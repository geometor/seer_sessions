            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, based on the format shown in the examples. However, the execution environment passed a NumPy array instead, causing the `input_str.strip().split()` operation to fail with an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function signature to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly.\n2.  Remove the string parsing logic (`parse_input`) and string formatting logic (`format_output`) from within the `transform` function, as these will likely be handled by the calling environment.\n3.  Assume the core transformation logic (finding '2', iterating and shifting elements based on adjacent zeros) is potentially correct but needs verification once the input type issue is resolved. The logic appears sound based on manual walkthroughs of the examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n*   **Input Type Mismatch:** 100% (7 out of 7) training examples failed due to the function expecting a string input but receiving a NumPy array.\n*   **Core Logic Validation:** 0% - The transformation logic itself was never reached due to the input parsing error. Therefore, its correctness could not be empirically validated against the examples.\n*   **Pivot Element '2':** Present exactly once in all 7 training inputs. Its position varies but remains fixed between input and output in all examples.\n*   **Shift Condition:** The pattern of non-zero elements shifting over exactly two zeros towards the pivot '2' is consistent across examples where movement occurs (train\\_2, train\\_3, train\\_4, train\\_5, train\\_7). Examples train\\_1 and train\\_6 show no movement, consistent with the rule (no eligible elements or blocking elements).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
