**1. General Assessment**

The provided execution results indicate that the Python code (`code_00.py`) used for testing failed to correctly transform inputs for examples 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, simply returning the original input as output. However, a manual trace of the transformation logic, as derived from the examples and described in the previous `dreamer` phase, suggests that this logic *should* produce the correct outputs for all examples.

The core logic involves finding the element '2' (pivot) and then iteratively processing elements on either side:
*   **Left side (indices < pivot_index):** Check elements from right-to-left (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i+1` and `i+2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i+2` (shift right by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the left side.
*   **Right side (indices > pivot_index):** Check elements from left-to-right (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i-1` and `i-2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i-2` (shift left by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the right side.

This iterative process, particularly the order of checking (right-to-left on the left side, left-to-right on the right side) and repeating passes until stability, correctly handles single element shifts (Ex 2, 4, 7), block shifts (Ex 3, 5), and cases where no shifts are possible because elements are adjacent to the pivot or don't have two consecutive zeros next to them (Ex 1, 6, test_1).

**Strategy:**
The failure likely lies in the implementation tested (`code_00.py`), not the derived logic. Potential issues in that code could include incorrect loop bounds, faulty condition checks, improper handling of array copies (if applicable), or logic errors in the `while` loop termination. The natural language program will be based on the validated logic derived from manual tracing and analysis, assuming the reported code execution was flawed.

**3. YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift non-zero numbers towards a fixed pivot '2' by jumping over adjacent pairs of zeros."
elements:
  - type: "sequence"
    description: "A list of integers."
    properties:
      length: 12 (based on examples)
      values: Non-negative integers, including 0.
  - type: "pivot"
    description: "The integer '2' which acts as a fixed reference point."
    properties:
      value: 2
      occurrence: Exactly once per sequence (based on examples).
      position: Static; its index does not change during transformation.
  - type: "movable_element"
    description: "Any non-zero integer other than the pivot '2'."
    properties:
      value: > 0 and != 2
      behavior: Can potentially change position relative to the pivot.
  - type: "gap"
    description: "The integer '0', representing empty space."
    properties:
      value: 0
      role: Enables movement; a pair of consecutive zeros allows a movable element to jump over them.

actions:
  - name: "find_pivot"
    description: "Locate the index of the pivot element '2'."
  - name: "process_left_side"
    description: "Iteratively shift movable elements to the left of the pivot."
    details:
      - direction: "Rightward shift (towards pivot)"
      - condition: "Element at index `i` is movable AND elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both 0."
      - iteration_order: "Process indices from `pivot_index - 3` down to `0` in each pass."
      - repetition: "Repeat passes until no elements are shifted in a full pass."
      - effect: "Swap element at `i` with element at `i+2`."
  - name: "process_right_side"
    description: "Iteratively shift movable elements to the right of the pivot."
    details:
      - direction: "Leftward shift (towards pivot)"
      - condition: "Element at index `i` is movable AND elements at `i-1` and `i-2` are both 0."
      - iteration_order: "Process indices from `pivot_index + 3` up to `n-1` in each pass."
      - repetition: "Repeat passes until no elements are shifted in a full pass."
      - effect: "Swap element at `i` with element at `i-2`."

constraints:
  - "The pivot '2' never moves."
  - "Movable elements only shift if exactly two consecutive zeros exist between their current position and potential destination closer to the pivot."
  - "Elements adjacent (or separated by one zero) to the pivot do not satisfy the shift condition."
  - "The relative order of adjacent movable elements is preserved during block shifts."

**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Pivot:** Find the index (`idx2`) of the number `2` in the input sequence. Assume `2` exists exactly once.
2.  **Initialize:** Create a mutable copy of the input sequence for modification. Let `n` be the length of the sequence.
3.  **Process Left Side (Elements before Pivot):**
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as shifts are made in a pass.
    *   Inside the loop, set a flag `swapped_left = false`.
    *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 - 3` down to `0`.
    *   For each `i`, check if the element `sequence[i]` is non-zero AND `sequence[i+1]` is 0 AND `sequence[i+2]` is 0.
    *   If the condition is true, swap `sequence[i]` and `sequence[i+2]`, and set `swapped_left = true`.
    *   After iterating through all relevant `i`, if `swapped_left` is still `false`, break the loop (the left side is stable).
4.  **Process Right Side (Elements after Pivot):**
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as shifts are made in a pass.
    *   Inside the loop, set a flag `swapped_right = false`.
    *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 + 3` up to `n - 1`.
    *   For each `i`, check if the element `sequence[i]` is non-zero AND `sequence[i-1]` is 0 AND `sequence[i-2]` is 0.
    *   If the condition is true, swap `sequence[i]` and `sequence[i-2]`, and set `swapped_right = true`.
    *   After iterating through all relevant `i`, if `swapped_right` is still `false`, break the loop (the right side is stable).
5.  **Finalize:** The modified sequence is the result.
