task_description: "Shift non-zero numbers towards a fixed pivot '2' by jumping over adjacent pairs of zeros."
elements:
  - type: "sequence"
    description: "A list of integers."
    properties:
      length: 12 (based on examples)
      values: Non-negative integers, including 0.
  - type: "pivot"
    description: "The integer '2' which acts as a fixed reference point."
    properties:
      value: 2
      occurrence: Exactly once per sequence (based on examples).
      position: Static; its index does not change during transformation.
  - type: "movable_element"
    description: "Any non-zero integer other than the pivot '2'."
    properties:
      value: > 0 and != 2
      behavior: Can potentially change position relative to the pivot.
  - type: "gap"
    description: "The integer '0', representing empty space."
    properties:
      value: 0
      role: Enables movement; a pair of consecutive zeros allows a movable element to jump over them.

actions:
  - name: "find_pivot"
    description: "Locate the index of the pivot element '2'."
  - name: "process_left_side"
    description: "Iteratively shift movable elements to the left of the pivot."
    details:
      - direction: "Rightward shift (towards pivot)"
      - condition: "Element at index `i` is movable AND elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both 0."
      - iteration_order: "Process indices from `pivot_index - 3` down to `0` in each pass."
      - repetition: "Repeat passes until no elements are shifted in a full pass."
      - effect: "Swap element at `i` with element at `i+2`."
  - name: "process_right_side"
    description: "Iteratively shift movable elements to the right of the pivot."
    details:
      - direction: "Leftward shift (towards pivot)"
      - condition: "Element at index `i` is movable AND elements at `i-1` and `i-2` are both 0."
      - iteration_order: "Process indices from `pivot_index + 3` up to `n-1` in each pass."
      - repetition: "Repeat passes until no elements are shifted in a full pass."
      - effect: "Swap element at `i` with element at `i-2`."

constraints:
  - "The pivot '2' never moves."
  - "Movable elements only shift if exactly two consecutive zeros exist between their current position and potential destination closer to the pivot."
  - "Elements adjacent (or separated by one zero) to the pivot do not satisfy the shift condition."
  - "The relative order of adjacent movable elements is preserved during block shifts."
