            "text": "**1. General Assessment**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate that the Python code (`code_00.py`) used for testing failed to correctly transform inputs for examples 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, simply returning the original input as output. However, a manual trace of the transformation logic, as derived from the examples and described in the previous `dreamer` phase, suggests that this logic *should* produce the correct outputs for all examples.\n\nThe core logic involves finding the element '2' (pivot) and then iteratively processing elements on either side:\n*   **Left side (indices < pivot_index):** Check elements from right-to-left (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i+1` and `i+2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i+2` (shift right by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the left side.\n*   **Right side (indices > pivot_index):** Check elements from left-to-right (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i-1` and `i-2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i-2` (shift left by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the right side.\n\nThis iterative process, particularly the order of checking (right-to-left on the left side, left-to-right on the right side) and repeating passes until stability, correctly handles single element shifts (Ex 2, 4, 7), block shifts (Ex 3, 5), and cases where no shifts are possible because elements are adjacent to the pivot or don't have two consecutive zeros next to them (Ex 1, 6, test_1).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe failure likely lies in the implementation tested (`code_00.py`), not the derived logic. Potential issues in that code could include incorrect loop bounds, faulty condition checks, improper handling of array copies (if applicable), or logic errors in the `while` loop termination. The natural language program will be based on the validated logic derived from manual tracing and analysis, assuming the reported code execution was flawed.\n\n**2. Metrics**\n"
