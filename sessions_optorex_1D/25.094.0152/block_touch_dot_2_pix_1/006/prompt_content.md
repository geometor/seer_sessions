"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers (represented as a NumPy array) based on specific movement rules relative to the number '2'.

The transformation identifies the position of the number '2', which acts as a fixed pivot.
Non-zero numbers located to the left of '2' are potentially shifted rightwards by two positions
if the two positions immediately to their right (towards '2') are both zeros. This shifting
process is repeated iteratively for the entire left side (from right-to-left within each pass)
until no more such shifts are possible in a full pass.
Similarly, non-zero numbers located to the right of '2' are potentially shifted leftwards by
two positions if the two positions immediately to their left (towards '2') are both zeros.
This shifting process is repeated iteratively for the entire right side (from left-to-right
within each pass) until no more such shifts are possible in a full pass.
Numbers immediately adjacent to '2' (at index idx2-1 or idx2+1) or separated by one zero
do not meet the shift conditions (i.e., the rule requires checking i+1, i+2 or i-1, i-2).
The pivot '2' itself never moves.
