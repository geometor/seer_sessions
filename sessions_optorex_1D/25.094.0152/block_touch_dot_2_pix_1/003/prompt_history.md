Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**1. Perception of Task Elements**

*   The input and output are sequences of integers, always 12 elements long in the examples.
*   The sequences contain single-digit non-negative integers, with '0' being common.
*   The number '2' appears exactly once in every input sequence and seems to play a pivotal role. Its position remains unchanged in the output.
*   Other non-zero numbers sometimes change position relative to the '2'.
*   Numbers *before* the '2' tend to shift *rightwards* towards the '2'.
*   Numbers *after* the '2' tend to shift *leftwards* towards the '2'.
*   The shift seems to happen only when there are exactly two consecutive '0's between the number and the position it moves to. The number effectively "jumps" over these two zeros.
*   Numbers adjacent to '2' (either immediately before or after) do not move.
*   If multiple numbers are eligible to move (e.g., a block like '4 4 4 4'), they maintain their relative order after the shift.
*   The processing order matters: processing elements *before* the '2' from right-to-left and elements *after* the '2' from left-to-right ensures correct placement when blocks of numbers are shifted.

**2. Facts (YAML)**

## General Assessment

The primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, based on the format shown in the examples. However, the execution environment passed a NumPy array instead, causing the `input_str.strip().split()` operation to fail with an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.

The strategy to resolve this is:

1.  Modify the `transform` function signature to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly.
2.  Remove the string parsing logic (`parse_input`) and string formatting logic (`format_output`) from within the `transform` function, as these will likely be handled by the calling environment.
3.  Assume the core transformation logic (finding '2', iterating and shifting elements based on adjacent zeros) is potentially correct but needs verification once the input type issue is resolved. The logic appears sound based on manual walkthroughs of the examples.

## Metrics

*   **Input Type Mismatch:** 100% (7 out of 7) training examples failed due to the function expecting a string input but receiving a NumPy array.
*   **Core Logic Validation:** 0% - The transformation logic itself was never reached due to the input parsing error. Therefore, its correctness could not be empirically validated against the examples.
*   **Pivot Element '2':** Present exactly once in all 7 training inputs. Its position varies but remains fixed between input and output in all examples.
*   **Shift Condition:** The pattern of non-zero elements shifting over exactly two zeros towards the pivot '2' is consistent across examples where movement occurs (train\_2, train\_3, train\_4, train\_5, train\_7). Examples train\_1 and train\_6 show no movement, consistent with the rule (no eligible elements or blocking elements).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
InputType: List[int] or numpy.ndarray # Changed from string
OutputType: List[int] or numpy.ndarray # Changed from string
SequenceLength: 12 (observed in all examples)
PivotElement:
  Value: 2
  Occurrence: Exactly once per sequence
  Behavior: Position remains fixed during transformation.
ElementBehavior:
  - ElementType: Non-zero integer
    Location: Left of Pivot (index < index_of_2)
    Action: Conditional Shift Right
    Condition: If element is at index `i`, and elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both 0, and `i+2 < index_of_2`.
    ShiftAmount: 2 positions right (move from `i` to `i+2`)
    Iteration: Apply iteratively, processing from right-to-left (closer to pivot first in each pass) until no more shifts occur on the left side.
  - ElementType: Non-zero integer
    Location: Right of Pivot (index > index_of_2)
    Action: Conditional Shift Left
    Condition: If element is at index `i`, and elements at `i-1` and `i-2` are both 0, and `i-2 > index_of_2`.
    ShiftAmount: 2 positions left (move from `i` to `i-2`)
    Iteration: Apply iteratively, processing from left-to-right (closer to pivot first in each pass) until no more shifts occur on the right side.
  - ElementType: Zero (0)
    Behavior: Act as space fillers enabling shifts; are replaced by shifted non-zero elements.
  - ElementType: Pivot (2)
    Behavior: Remains stationary, defines the split point for left/right processing.
Constraints:
  - Elements immediately adjacent to the pivot (at index `index_of_2 - 1` or `index_of_2 + 1`) do not shift via this rule.
  - Blocks of adjacent non-zero numbers maintain their relative order when shifted.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept an input sequence (list or array) of integers.
2.  Identify the index of the unique element '2' (the pivot).
3.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to store the result.
4.  **Process Left Side (Indices less than the pivot's index):**
    *   Repeatedly scan the sequence from right-to-left, starting from the index `pivot_index - 3` down to `0`.
    *   In each scan, if a non-zero element is found at index `i` such that the elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both `0`, swap the element at `i` with the `0` at `i+2` (effectively shifting the non-zero element two positions to the right). Record that a swap occurred during this scan.
    *   Continue scanning and swapping within the current pass.
    *   If a full scan completes without any swaps, stop processing the left side. Otherwise, repeat the scan.
5.  **Process Right Side (Indices greater than the pivot's index):**
    *   Repeatedly scan the sequence from left-to-right, starting from the index `pivot_index + 3` up to the end of the sequence.
    *   In each scan, if a non-zero element is found at index `i` such that the elements at `i-1` and `i-2` are both `0`, swap the element at `i` with the `0` at `i-2` (effectively shifting the non-zero element two positions to the left). Record that a swap occurred during this scan.
    *   Continue scanning and swapping within the current pass.
    *   If a full scan completes without any swaps, stop processing the right side. Otherwise, repeat the scan.
6.  Return the modified sequence.
