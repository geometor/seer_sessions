Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**1. Perception of Task Elements**

*   The input and output are sequences of integers, always 12 elements long in the examples.
*   The sequences contain single-digit non-negative integers, with '0' being common.
*   The number '2' appears exactly once in every input sequence and seems to play a pivotal role. Its position remains unchanged in the output.
*   Other non-zero numbers sometimes change position relative to the '2'.
*   Numbers *before* the '2' tend to shift *rightwards* towards the '2'.
*   Numbers *after* the '2' tend to shift *leftwards* towards the '2'.
*   The shift seems to happen only when there are exactly two consecutive '0's between the number and the position it moves to. The number effectively "jumps" over these two zeros.
*   Numbers adjacent to '2' (either immediately before or after) do not move.
*   If multiple numbers are eligible to move (e.g., a block like '4 4 4 4'), they maintain their relative order after the shift.
*   The processing order matters: processing elements *before* the '2' from right-to-left and elements *after* the '2' from left-to-right ensures correct placement when blocks of numbers are shifted.

**2. Facts (YAML)**

**1. General Assessment**

The provided execution results indicate that the Python code (`code_00.py`) used for testing failed to correctly transform inputs for examples 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, simply returning the original input as output. However, a manual trace of the transformation logic, as derived from the examples and described in the previous `dreamer` phase, suggests that this logic *should* produce the correct outputs for all examples.

The core logic involves finding the element '2' (pivot) and then iteratively processing elements on either side:
*   **Left side (indices < pivot_index):** Check elements from right-to-left (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i+1` and `i+2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i+2` (shift right by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the left side.
*   **Right side (indices > pivot_index):** Check elements from left-to-right (i.e., starting closer to the pivot). If a non-zero element at index `i` has zeros at `i-1` and `i-2`, swap the element at `i` with the zero at `i-2` (shift left by 2). Repeat passes until no more shifts occur on the right side.

This iterative process, particularly the order of checking (right-to-left on the left side, left-to-right on the right side) and repeating passes until stability, correctly handles single element shifts (Ex 2, 4, 7), block shifts (Ex 3, 5), and cases where no shifts are possible because elements are adjacent to the pivot or don't have two consecutive zeros next to them (Ex 1, 6, test_1).

**Strategy:**
The failure likely lies in the implementation tested (`code_00.py`), not the derived logic. Potential issues in that code could include incorrect loop bounds, faulty condition checks, improper handling of array copies (if applicable), or logic errors in the `while` loop termination. The natural language program will be based on the validated logic derived from manual tracing and analysis, assuming the reported code execution was flawed.

**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Pivot:** Find the index (`idx2`) of the number `2` in the input sequence. Assume `2` exists exactly once.
2.  **Initialize:** Create a mutable copy of the input sequence for modification. Let `n` be the length of the sequence.
3.  **Process Left Side (Elements before Pivot):**
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as shifts are made in a pass.
    *   Inside the loop, set a flag `swapped_left = false`.
    *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 - 3` down to `0`.
    *   For each `i`, check if the element `sequence[i]` is non-zero AND `sequence[i+1]` is 0 AND `sequence[i+2]` is 0.
    *   If the condition is true, swap `sequence[i]` and `sequence[i+2]`, and set `swapped_left = true`.
    *   After iterating through all relevant `i`, if `swapped_left` is still `false`, break the loop (the left side is stable).
4.  **Process Right Side (Elements after Pivot):**
    *   Start a loop that continues as long as shifts are made in a pass.
    *   Inside the loop, set a flag `swapped_right = false`.
    *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 + 3` up to `n - 1`.
    *   For each `i`, check if the element `sequence[i]` is non-zero AND `sequence[i-1]` is 0 AND `sequence[i-2]` is 0.
    *   If the condition is true, swap `sequence[i]` and `sequence[i-2]`, and set `swapped_right = true`.
    *   After iterating through all relevant `i`, if `swapped_right` is still `false`, break the loop (the right side is stable).
5.  **Finalize:** The modified sequence is the result.
