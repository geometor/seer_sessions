"""
Transformation Rule:
Identifies contiguous blocks of one or more zeros within an input sequence of integers, where each block is immediately preceded by a non-zero digit (Left neighbor, L) and immediately followed by a non-zero digit (Right neighbor, R). 
Based on the comparison of L and R, these identified 'mobile' zero blocks are relocated:
- If L < R, the zeros from the block are moved to the end of the sequence.
- If L > R, the zeros from the block are moved to the beginning of the sequence.
Zeros that are not part of such a L-0...0-R pattern (e.g., at the ends, adjacent to only one non-zero digit, or only next to other zeros) remain in place relative to the other non-moving elements.
The final sequence is constructed by concatenating the zeros designated for the beginning, the remaining non-zero digits and static zeros in their original relative order, and finally the zeros designated for the end.
