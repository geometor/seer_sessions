"""
Transformation Rule:
Identifies blocks of one or more zeros that are directly situated between two non-zero digits (Left and Right neighbors) within the input sequence of integers. 
Based on the comparison of the Left and Right non-zero neighbors, these identified zeros are relocated.
If the Left neighbor is less than the Right neighbor, the block of zeros is moved to the end of the sequence.
If the Left neighbor is greater than the Right neighbor, the block of zeros is moved to the beginning of the sequence.
All other digits (non-zeros and zeros not meeting the relocation criteria) maintain their relative order in the sequence after the mobile zeros are extracted.
The final sequence is constructed by prepending the 'start' zeros, followed by the remaining sequence elements, and finally appending the 'end' zeros.
