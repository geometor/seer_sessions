Non-zero digits seem to maintain their relative order but might shift position due to the movement of zeros.\n3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The transformation appears to be triggered when one or more '0's are located *between* two non-zero digits.\n4.  **Transformation Action:** The '0's identified in the trigger condition are removed from their original position.\n5.  **Destination Logic:** The destination of the removed '0's depends on the values of the non-zero digits that surrounded them.\n    *   If the left non-zero neighbor is *less than* the right non-zero neighbor, the '0'(s) move to the *end* of the sequence.\n    *   If the left non-zero neighbor is *greater than* the right non-zero neighbor, the '0'(s) move to the *beginning* of the sequence.\n6.  **Inaction Cases:** If '0's are not strictly between two non-zero digits (e.g., at the ends, adjacent to another '0', or adjacent to only one non-zero digit), they remain in place relative to the non-zero elements.\n7.  **Multiple Occurrences:** The process seems applicable to all instances where the trigger condition (non-zero / zero(s) / non-zero) is met within the sequence. Zeros identified for moving to the start are prepended, and those for moving to the end are appended.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Advance the iteration index `i` past the identified block of zeros to avoid reprocessing.\n6.  Create a new list `result_core` containing only the elements from the original list whose indices are *not* in `indices_to_remove`.\n7.  Construct the final list by concatenating `zeros_to_prepend`, `result_core`, and `zeros_to_append`.\n8.  Convert the final list back into a space-separated string."
