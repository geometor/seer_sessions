Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces.
2.  **Key Element:** The digit '0' plays a crucial role in the transformation. Non-zero digits seem to maintain their relative order but might shift position due to the movement of zeros.
3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The transformation appears to be triggered when one or more '0's are located *between* two non-zero digits.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The '0's identified in the trigger condition are removed from their original position.
5.  **Destination Logic:** The destination of the removed '0's depends on the values of the non-zero digits that surrounded them.
    *   If the left non-zero neighbor is *less than* the right non-zero neighbor, the '0'(s) move to the *end* of the sequence.
    *   If the left non-zero neighbor is *greater than* the right non-zero neighbor, the '0'(s) move to the *beginning* of the sequence.
6.  **Inaction Cases:** If '0's are not strictly between two non-zero digits (e.g., at the ends, adjacent to another '0', or adjacent to only one non-zero digit), they remain in place relative to the non-zero elements.
7.  **Multiple Occurrences:** The process seems applicable to all instances where the trigger condition (non-zero / zero(s) / non-zero) is met within the sequence. Zeros identified for moving to the start are prepended, and those for moving to the end are appended.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated single digits
    role: input & output
objects:
  - name: digit_sequence

  - name: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: potentially mobile element
  - name: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: triggers movement, anchors relative position
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: digits in the sequence
  - type: comparison
    between: adjacent non-zero digits surrounding zero(s) (less than / greater than)
actions:
  - name: identify_mobile_zeros
    criteria: zero(s) located immediately between two non_zero_digits (L, R)
  - name: remove_zeros
    target: mobile_zeros identified

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Initialize two empty lists: `zeros_to_prepend` and `zeros_to_append`.
3.  Initialize an empty list `indices_to_remove`.
4.  Iterate through the list from the second element (index 1) to the second-to-last element (index length - 2).
5.  If the current element at index `i` is 0 and the elements at `i-1` (Left) and `i+1` (Right) are both non-zero:
    a.  Identify the contiguous block of zeros starting at index `i`. Let this block be `current_zeros`.
    b.  Add the indices of `current_zeros` to `indices_to_remove`.
    c.  Compare the Left and Right non-zero neighbors.
    d.  If Left < Right, add `current_zeros` to the `zeros_to_append` list.
    e.  If Left > Right, add `current_zeros` to the `zeros_to_prepend` list.
    f.  Advance the iteration index `i` past the identified block of zeros to avoid reprocessing.
6.  Create a new list `result_core` containing only the elements from the original list whose indices are *not* in `indices_to_remove`.
7.  Construct the final list by concatenating `zeros_to_prepend`, `result_core`, and `zeros_to_append`.
8.  Convert the final list back into a space-separated string.
