            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate a consistent failure across all examples. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly points to an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method, which is valid for strings but not for NumPy arrays. However, the testing environment supplied the input as a NumPy array.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying zeros between non-zeros and relocating them based on neighbor comparison) was therefore never actually executed or tested. The immediate failure occurred during the input parsing stage.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is easily convertible from a NumPy array) as input, removing the string parsing step (`parse_input`).\n2.  Ensure the function returns the result in the expected format, likely also a NumPy array or list of integers, removing the string formatting step (`format_output`).\n3.  Re-evaluate the core transformation logic based on the examples, assuming the input is correctly handled as a sequence of integers. The existing logic appears potentially correct based on manual walkthroughs but needs confirmation through execution.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nSince the code failed at the input stage, performance metrics for the transformation logic itself cannot be gathered. The crucial metric is the input type:\n\n*   **Expected Input Type (Code):** `str`\n*   **Actual Input Type (Test Env):** `numpy.ndarray`\n*   **Result:** `TypeError` on `input_str.split()` call in all cases.\n\nLet's re-analyze the examples assuming the input is a list/array of integers:\n\n*   **train_1:** `[2, 0, 4, ...]` -> `0` at index 1 is between `2` (L) and `4` (R). `L < R`, move `0` to end. -> `[2, 4, ..., 0]`. Correct.\n*   **train_2:** `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> No zeros between two non-zeros. -> No change. Correct.\n*   **train_3:** `[0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]` -> No zeros between two non-zeros. -> No change. Correct.\n*   **train_4:** `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> `0` at index 7 is between `7` (L) and `2` (R). `L > R`, move `0` to start. -> `[0, 7, 7, ..., 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.\n*   **train_5:** `[0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> No zeros strictly *between* two non-zeros. -> No change. Correct.\n*   **train_6:** `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> No zeros between two non-zeros. -> No change. Correct.\n*   **train_7:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` -> `0, 0` at indices 5, 6 are between `2` (L) and `3` (R). `L < R`, move `0, 0` to end. -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, ..., 3, 0, 0]`. Correct.\n\nThe core logic described previously seems consistent with all training examples when the input type issue is disregarded.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
