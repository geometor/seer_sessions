"""
Transformation Rule:
Identify blocks of one or more zeros that are directly situated between two non-zero digits (Left and Right neighbors). 
Based on the comparison of the Left and Right non-zero neighbors, relocate these identified zeros.
If the Left neighbor is less than the Right neighbor, move the block of zeros to the end of the sequence.
If the Left neighbor is greater than the Right neighbor, move the block of zeros to the beginning of the sequence.
All other digits (non-zeros and zeros not meeting the criteria) maintain their relative order in the sequence after the mobile zeros are extracted.
The final sequence is constructed by prepending the 'start' zeros, followed by the remaining sequence elements, and finally appending the 'end' zeros.
