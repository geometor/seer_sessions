## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero, non-'2' digits adjacent to a fixed '2'. However, the generated code failed on examples where a shift was actually required. The successful cases (train_1, train_6) were those where the block was *already* adjacent to the '2' in the input, meaning no shift was needed.

The failure analysis revealed a logical flaw in the implementation: the code incorrectly returned the input grid if a block was found but was *not* already adjacent to the '2'. The check for adjacency was misplaced, effectively preventing the shifting logic from executing when it was needed most.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Logic:** Modify the control flow in the transformation function. After finding the separator and the number block, explicitly check if the block is already adjacent to the separator. If it is, return the input unchanged. If it is *not* adjacent, proceed with the shifting logic (calculating target indices and constructing the output grid) as previously defined.
2.  **Verify Implementation:** Ensure the helper functions `find_separator_index` and `find_number_block` correctly identify the elements even in the edge cases (like the block being at the start/end of the sequence).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected logic, emphasizing the conditional nature of the shift (i.e., shift *unless* already adjacent).

## Metrics Gathering

We will use code execution to analyze each example, focusing on the separator index, block properties (digits, start, end), and whether a shift is required based on initial adjacency.

**Metrics Summary:**

The analysis confirms the previous assessment:
*   Examples 0 (train_1) and 5 (train_6) have blocks that are `Initially Adjacent` to the separator '2'. Consequently, `Shift Required` is False, and the `Output Matches Input` is True.
*   All other examples (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) have blocks that are *not* initially adjacent. `Shift Required` is True, and the `Output Matches Input` is False, correctly indicating that a transformation must occur.
*   The calculated `Target Start (Out)` and `Target End (Out)` match the positions observed in the expected output arrays for the cases requiring a shift.

This data strongly supports the refined logic: perform the shift if, *and only if*, the block is not already adjacent to the separator.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the index of the digit '2' (the separator). If '2' is not found, the output is identical to the input; stop.
3.  Scan the sequence to find the start and end indices of the single contiguous block of digits that are neither '0' nor '2'. Record the digits within this block.
4.  If no such block exists, the output is identical to the input; stop.
5.  Determine if the identified block is *already adjacent* to the separator (i.e., its end index is `separator_index - 1` or its start index is `separator_index + 1`).
6.  If the block *is* already adjacent, the output is identical to the input; stop.
7.  If the block exists but is *not* adjacent:
    a. Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with '0'.
    b. Place the digit '2' into the output sequence at its original index (found in step 2).
    c. Determine if the block was found to the left or right of the separator's index in the *input*.
    d. If the block was to the left of the separator:
        i.  Calculate the target end index for the block as `separator_index - 1`.
        ii. Calculate the target start index as `target_end_index - length_of_block + 1`.
    e. If the block was to the right of the separator:
        i.  Calculate the target start index for the block as `separator_index + 1`.
        ii. Calculate the target end index as `target_start_index + length_of_block - 1`.
    f. Copy the recorded block digits into the *output* sequence from the calculated target start index to the calculated target end index.
    g. Return the constructed output sequence.
