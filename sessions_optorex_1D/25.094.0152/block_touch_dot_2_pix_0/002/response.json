            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue is an input type mismatch. The initial analysis and the generated code assumed the input/output would be space-separated strings, leading to the use of `.split()`. However, the execution environment provided NumPy arrays directly to the `transform` function, causing the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples.\n\nThe core logic identified \u2013 finding a '2', locating a contiguous block of other non-zero digits, and shifting that block adjacent to the '2' \u2013 appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided in the initial examples. The strategy is to adapt the implementation to directly handle numerical array inputs (presumably NumPy arrays, based on the error message) instead of strings.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe code failed during input processing, so no output was generated for comparison. The key metric is the input data type.\n"
