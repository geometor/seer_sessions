task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits (excluding 2) within a 1D numerical array to be adjacent to the fixed digit 2."
elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: "A 1D NumPy array of single-digit integers."
    properties:
      - length: Integer, the number of elements in the array.
      - dtype: Integer (e.g., np.int64).
  - object: Separator
    description: "The digit 2 which serves as a fixed anchor point."
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - index: Integer, the position of 2 in the array (remains constant). Found using np.where(array == 2).
  - object: NumberBlock
    description: "A contiguous sub-sequence (slice) of the array containing digits that are not 0 and not 2."
    properties:
      - digits: 1D NumPy array or list of non-zero, non-2 integers.
      - start_index: Integer, the starting position in the input array.
      - end_index: Integer, the ending position in the input array.
      - length: Integer, the number of digits in the block.
      - relative_position: String, either 'left_of_separator' or 'right_of_separator'.
  - object: Zero
    description: "The digit 0 representing empty space."
    properties:
      - value: 0
actions:
  - action: FindSeparator
    description: "Locate the index of the digit 2 in the input array."
    inputs: [InputArray]
    outputs: [separator_index (or indication if not found)]
  - action: FindNumberBlock
    description: "Identify the contiguous block of non-zero, non-2 digits, its start/end indices, the digits themselves, and its position relative to the separator."
    inputs: [InputArray, separator_index]
    outputs: [NumberBlock (or null if none exists)]
  - action: ShiftBlock
    description: "Calculate the target start and end indices for the NumberBlock in the output array, placing it adjacent to the Separator."
    inputs: [NumberBlock, separator_index, array_length]
    outputs: [target_start_index, target_end_index]
  - action: ConstructOutput
    description: "Create the output array by placing the Separator at its original index, the NumberBlock slice at its target indices, and filling remaining positions with 0."
    inputs: [array_length, separator_index, Separator.value, target_start_index, target_end_index, NumberBlock.digits]
    outputs: [OutputArray]
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: "The NumberBlock in the output array is positioned immediately next to the Separator."
    condition_left: "If NumberBlock was left_of_separator, its end_index in output is separator_index - 1."
    condition_right: "If NumberBlock was right_of_separator, its start_index in output is separator_index + 1."
  - type: Preservation
    description: "The Separator (2) maintains its original index. The relative order of digits within the NumberBlock is preserved."
  - type: Replacement
    description: "Positions not occupied by the Separator or the shifted NumberBlock in the output array are filled with Zero (0). The output array has the same length and dtype as the input."
