task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits (excluding '2') adjacent to the fixed digit '2'."
elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: "A 1D list of single-digit integers."
    properties:
      - length: Integer, the number of digits in the sequence.
      - digits: List of integers [0-9].
  - object: Separator
    description: "The digit '2' which serves as a fixed anchor point."
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - index: Integer, the position of '2' in the sequence (remains constant).
  - object: NumberBlock
    description: "A contiguous sub-sequence of digits that are not '0' and not '2'."
    properties:
      - digits: List of non-zero, non-2 integers.
      - start_index: Integer, the starting position in the input sequence.
      - end_index: Integer, the ending position in the input sequence.
      - length: Integer, the number of digits in the block.
      - relative_position: String, either 'left_of_separator' or 'right_of_separator'.
  - object: Zero
    description: "The digit '0' representing empty space."
    properties:
      - value: 0
actions:
  - action: FindSeparator
    description: "Locate the index of the digit '2' in the input sequence."
    inputs: [InputSequence]
    outputs: [separator_index]
  - action: FindNumberBlock
    description: "Identify the contiguous block of non-zero, non-2 digits, its start/end indices, and its position relative to the separator."
    inputs: [InputSequence, separator_index]
    outputs: [NumberBlock (or null if none exists)]
  - action: ShiftBlock
    description: "Calculate the target start and end indices for the NumberBlock in the output sequence, placing it adjacent to the Separator."
    inputs: [NumberBlock, separator_index, sequence_length]
    outputs: [target_start_index, target_end_index]
  - action: ConstructOutput
    description: "Create the output sequence by placing the Separator at its original index, the NumberBlock at its target indices, and filling remaining positions with '0'."
    inputs: [sequence_length, separator_index, Separator.value, target_start_index, target_end_index, NumberBlock.digits]
    outputs: [OutputSequence]
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: "The NumberBlock in the output sequence is positioned immediately next to the Separator."
    condition_left: "If NumberBlock was left_of_separator, its end_index in output is separator_index - 1."
    condition_right: "If NumberBlock was right_of_separator, its start_index in output is separator_index + 1."
  - type: Preservation
    description: "The Separator ('2') maintains its original index. The relative order of digits within the NumberBlock is preserved."
  - type: Replacement
    description: "Positions not occupied by the Separator or the shifted NumberBlock in the output sequence are filled with Zero ('0')."
