            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings. They can be interpreted as 1D arrays or lists.\n2.  **Key Digits:**\n    *   `0`: Appears to represent empty space or background.\n    *   `2`: Acts as a fixed point or separator. Its position does not change from input to output.\n    *   Other non-zero digits (`3`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9` in the examples): Form contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action is the shifting of the contiguous block of non-zero digits (excluding '2') towards the '2'.\n4.  **Direction of Shift:**\n    *   If the block is initially to the left of '2', it shifts rightward until its rightmost digit is immediately adjacent to the left of '2'.\n    *   If the block is initially to the right of '2', it shifts leftward until its leftmost digit is immediately adjacent to the right of '2'.\n5.  **Integrity:** The digits within the non-zero block maintain their relative order during the shift. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n6.  **Filling:** The positions previously occupied by the shifted block become '0'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
