```python
"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on specific movement rules.

The rules involve shifting elements '1' or contiguous blocks of '6' based on adjacent '0's.
The rules are checked and applied in a specific priority order:
1. Rule 6 (Left): A block of '6's moves 2 positions left if preceded by '0, 0'.
2. Rule 6 (Right): A block of '6's moves 2 positions right if followed by '0, 0'.
3. Rule 1 (Right): An element '1' moves 1 position right if followed by a '0'.

Only the first applicable rule found is executed for a given input grid.
If no rules apply, the grid remains unchanged.
