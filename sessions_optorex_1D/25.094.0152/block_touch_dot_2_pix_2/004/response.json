            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed on all examples due to a consistent error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error arises from attempting to use a multi-element NumPy array slice directly as a boolean condition in an `if` statement (specifically when checking for two adjacent zeros using slicing like `output_grid[start - 2 : start] == 0`). NumPy requires explicit reduction of the boolean array resulting from the comparison (e.g., checking if *all* elements meet the condition using `.all()`).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is straightforward: modify the conditional checks involving array slices to use `np.all()` to ensure the condition evaluates to a single boolean value (True only if *all* elements in the slice are 0). The underlying logic (identifying blocks, checking neighbors, applying prioritized move rules) appears correct based on the initial analysis and the successful prediction of outputs in the examples when the rules are manually applied.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the prompt history (though only training examples were listed in the initial prompt).\n*   **Error Type:** NumPy boolean ambiguity error (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`).\n*   **Cause:** Incorrect syntax for evaluating boolean conditions on NumPy array slices within `if` statements. The conditions `output_grid[start - 2 : start] == 0` and `output_grid[end + 1 : end + 3] == 0` produce boolean arrays, which cannot be implicitly evaluated as a single boolean.\n*   **Affected Rules:** The error specifically affects the implementation of Rule 6 (Left) and Rule 6 (Right), which check for two adjacent zeros. Rule 1 (Right) checks only a single adjacent element and thus did not trigger this specific error, although execution stopped before it could be tested in relevant cases due to the prior error.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
