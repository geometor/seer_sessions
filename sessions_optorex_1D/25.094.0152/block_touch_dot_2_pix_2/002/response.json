            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed because it assumed the input was a Python list, while the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" confirms this mismatch, occurring when boolean operations on arrays were used in contexts expecting single booleans. The core logic identified (movement of `1`s and `6`s based on adjacent `0`s) appears correct based on the examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted for NumPy arrays.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Type:** Use code execution to verify that inputs are NumPy arrays. (Done via `tool_code` in thought process).\n2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function and any helper functions (like `find_blocks`) to work correctly with NumPy arrays.\n    *   Use NumPy indexing and slicing.\n    *   Use `np.where` to locate elements or start/end of potential blocks.\n    *   Use `np.all()` when checking conditions involving multiple elements (e.g., `[0, 0]`).\n    *   Perform array modifications (swaps/shifts) using NumPy operations on a copy of the input array.\n3.  **Refine Logic:** Ensure the block identification and movement logic handles edge cases and NumPy array characteristics correctly. The priority of rules (6-left, 6-right, 1-right) seems consistent with the examples and should be maintained.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirmed the following:\n*   Inputs are `<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`.\n*   Rule 1 (Right): `input_1[4] == 1` and `input_1[5] == 0`. Condition met.\n*   Rule 6 (Right): `input_6[1] == 6` and `input_6[2:4] == [0, 0]`. Condition met using `np.all(input_6[2:4] == 0)`.\n*   Rule 6 (Left): `input_7[7:11]` are `6`s. The block starts at index 7. `input_7[5:7] == [0, 0]`. Condition met using `np.all(input_7[5:7] == 0)`.\n*   Examples 2, 3, 4, 5: No conditions for movement are met (checked mentally, consistent with outputs equalling inputs). For instance, in Example 2 `[8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`, there are no `1`s or `6`s to move. In Example 3 `[0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]`, no `1`s or `6`s.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
