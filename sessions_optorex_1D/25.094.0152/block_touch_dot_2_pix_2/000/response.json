            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task operates on sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers. The core operation involves conditional movement of specific numbers (`1` and `6`) or contiguous blocks of these numbers within the sequence. The movement is determined by the presence and number of adjacent zero (`0`) elements. Other non-zero numbers (`2`, `3`, `8`, `9` in the examples) appear to remain stationary or act as boundaries. The movement essentially swaps the position of the moving number/block with adjacent zeros.\n\n*   **Objects:** Sequences of 12 integers, individual integers (especially `0`, `1`, `6`), contiguous blocks of identical non-zero integers.\n*   **Properties:** Integer value, position (index) within the sequence, sequence length (fixed at 12), adjacency to other numbers (particularly `0`).\n*   **Actions:** Identifying specific numbers (`1`, `6`), identifying blocks of identical numbers, checking adjacent positions for zeros, moving numbers/blocks, swapping positions.\n*   **Relationships:** A number `1` moves right if followed by a `0`. A number `6` (or block of `6`s) moves left if preceded by two `0`s, or moves right if followed by two `0`s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify potential movements based on the following rules, checking boundary conditions (staying within indices 0-11):\n    a.  **Rule for 1:** If an element with value `1` at index `i` is immediately followed by a `0` at index `i+1`, mark a potential move: swap the elements at `i` and `i+1`.\n    b.  **Rule for 6 (Left):** Identify maximal contiguous blocks of `6`s. For a block starting at index `i`, if it is immediately preceded by two `0`s (at indices `i-2` and `i-1`), mark a potential move: shift the entire block 2 positions to the left, moving the two preceding `0`s to the original right end of the block's location.\n    c.  **Rule for 6 (Right):** Identify maximal contiguous blocks of `6`s. For a block ending at index `j`, if it is immediately followed by two `0`s (at indices `j+1` and `j+2`), mark a potential move: shift the entire block 2 positions to the right, moving the two following `0`s to the original left end of the block's location.\n3.  Execute the single applicable move identified in step 2 on the output sequence. Based on the provided examples, only one such move occurs per task instance. If multiple moves were identified (which doesn't happen in the examples), a priority rule would be needed, but we assume only one applies.\n4.  If no potential moves were identified in step 2, the output sequence remains identical to the input.\n5.  Return the final output sequence."
