Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.\n2.  Check for movement rules in a specific order (6-left, 6-right, 1-right).\n3.  Rule 6 (Left): Identify contiguous blocks of `6`s. If a block starting at index `s` is preceded by two `0`s (at `s-2`, `s-1`), shift the block 2 positions left by swapping elements. Execute this move and stop.\n4.  Rule 6 (Right): Identify contiguous blocks of `6`s. If a block ending at index `e` is followed by two `0`s (at `e+1`, `e+2`), shift the block 2 positions right by swapping elements. Execute this move and stop.\n5.  Rule 1 (Right): If an element `1` at index `i` is followed by a `0` at `i+1`, swap these two elements. Execute this move and stop.\n6.  If none of the rules apply, return the unchanged sequence.\nOnly the first applicable rule found (in the order 6-left, 6-right, 1-right) is executed.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\n\ndef find_blocks(grid, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all maximal contiguous blocks of a given value in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input list of integers.\n        value: The integer value to find blocks of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple is (start_index, end_index)\n        of a block.
