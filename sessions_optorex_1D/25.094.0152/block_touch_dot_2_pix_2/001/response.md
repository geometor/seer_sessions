```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on specific movement rules for '1' and '6'.

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Check for movement rules in a specific order (6-left, 6-right, 1-right).
3.  Rule 6 (Left): Identify contiguous blocks of `6`s. If a block starting at index `s` is preceded by two `0`s (at `s-2`, `s-1`), shift the block 2 positions left by swapping elements. Execute this move and stop.
4.  Rule 6 (Right): Identify contiguous blocks of `6`s. If a block ending at index `e` is followed by two `0`s (at `e+1`, `e+2`), shift the block 2 positions right by swapping elements. Execute this move and stop.
5.  Rule 1 (Right): If an element `1` at index `i` is followed by a `0` at `i+1`, swap these two elements. Execute this move and stop.
6.  If none of the rules apply, return the unchanged sequence.
Only the first applicable rule found (in the order 6-left, 6-right, 1-right) is executed.
