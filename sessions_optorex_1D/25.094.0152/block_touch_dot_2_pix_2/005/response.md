```python
"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on specific, prioritized movement rules.
The rules involve shifting elements '1' or contiguous blocks of '6' based on adjacent '0's.
Priority Order:
1. Rule 6 (Left): A block of '6's moves 2 positions left if preceded by '0, 0'.
2. Rule 6 (Right): A block of '6's moves 2 positions right if followed by '0, 0'.
3. Rule 1 (Right): An element '1' moves 1 position right if followed by a '0'.
Only the first applicable rule found is executed. If no rules apply, the grid remains unchanged.
