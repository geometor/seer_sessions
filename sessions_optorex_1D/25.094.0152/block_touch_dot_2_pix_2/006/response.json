            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed execution on all examples due to a technical error: using a NumPy boolean array directly in an `if` condition, which requires `np.all()` or `np.any()` for proper evaluation. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms this.\n\nThe underlying logic for the transformation rules (movement of '1' and '6' based on adjacent '0's) appears generally correct based on re-examining the input/output pairs:\n*   A '1' moves one step right into an adjacent '0'. (Example 1)\n*   A block of '6's moves two steps left if preceded by '0, 0'. (Example 7)\n*   A block of '6's moves two steps right if followed by '0, 0'. (Example 6)\n*   If none of these conditions are met, or if '1's or '6's are absent, the sequence remains unchanged. (Examples 2, 3, 4, 5)\n*   Example 4 is crucial: `[..., 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` remains unchanged. This implies Rule 1 ('1' moves right) might only apply to the *first* instance of a `1` followed by a `0` encountered during a scan, or that blocks of `1`s behave differently. Given Example 1, where a single `1` does move, the simplest consistent interpretation is that we scan for the first applicable rule (prioritizing '6' moves, then '1' moves) and execute only that one move. In Example 4, no `1` is *immediately* followed by a `0`, so the rule doesn't trigger.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Correct the NumPy boolean condition checks in the code by wrapping them with `np.all()`.\n2.  Maintain the prioritized rule application order: 6-Left, 6-Right, 1-Right.\n3.  Ensure Rule 1 only applies to the first instance of `1` followed by `0` found during the scan.\n4.  Re-validate the corrected code against all examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the previous code failed execution, traditional pass/fail metrics aren't applicable. The analysis focuses on rule consistency:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `[0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0]`. Consistent with Rule 1-Right (first `1` at index 4 followed by `0` at index 5).\n*   **Example 2:** `[8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` -> `[8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Consistent (No 1 or 6).\n*   **Example 3:** `[0,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]` -> `[0,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]`. Consistent (No 1 or 6).\n*   **Example 4:** `[0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]` -> `[0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]`. Consistent (No `1` immediately followed by `0`).\n*   **Example 5:** `[0,0,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0]` -> `[0,0,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0]`. Consistent (No 1 or 6).\n*   **Example 6:** `[0,6,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,6,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Consistent with Rule 6-Right (6 at index 1 followed by `0, 0` at indices 2, 3).\n*   **Example 7:** `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0]` -> `[2,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0]`. Consistent with Rule 6-Left (block 6 starts at index 7, preceded by `0, 0` at indices 5, 6).\n\nThe rules derived initially seem consistent with all examples, provided the priority and \"first-match\" logic are applied correctly, and the implementation error is fixed.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
