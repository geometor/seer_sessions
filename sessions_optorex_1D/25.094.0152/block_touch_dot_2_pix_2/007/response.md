```python
"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on specific, prioritized movement rules.
The rules involve shifting elements '1' or contiguous blocks of '6' based on adjacent '0's.
Priority Order:
1. Rule 6 (Left): The first identified block of '6's (scanning left-to-right) moves 2 positions left if immediately preceded by '0, 0'.
2. Rule 6 (Right): If rule 6-Left did not apply, the first identified block of '6's (scanning left-to-right) moves 2 positions right if immediately followed by '0, 0'.
3. Rule 1 (Right): If neither rule 6 applied, the first identified element '1' (scanning left-to-right) moves 1 position right if immediately followed by a '0'.
Only the highest priority rule that matches is executed. If no rules match, the sequence is unchanged.
