Rule 6 (Left): A block of '6's moves 2 positions left if preceded by '0, 0'.\n2. Rule 6 (Right): A block of '6's moves 2 positions right if followed by '0, 0'.\n3. Rule 1 (Right): An element '1' moves 1 position right if followed by a '0'.\n\nOnly the first applicable rule found is executed for a given input grid.\nIf no rules apply, the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_blocks_np(grid, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all maximal contiguous blocks of a given value in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input 1D numpy array.\n        value: The integer value to find blocks of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple is (start_index, end_index)\n        of a block.
