Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence (0-9).
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - FirstNonZero: The first NonZeroElement encountered when scanning from the start of the sequence.
  - LastNonZero: The last NonZeroElement encountered (equivalent to the first non-zero element found when scanning from the end).
  - IntermediateZero: A ZeroElement located at an index strictly greater than the index of the FirstNonZero element and strictly less than the index of the LastNonZero element.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: 12 (constant).
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index of the FirstNonZero element. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - LastNonZeroIndex: The index of the LastNonZero element. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - IntermediateZeroIndices: A list of indices where IntermediateZeros are located, ordered by their appearance in the sequence.
  - IntermediateZeroCount: The total count of IntermediateZero elements (length of IntermediateZeroIndices list).

Relationships:
  - IntermediateZeros exist only if FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex are defined and LastNonZeroIndex > FirstNonZeroIndex + 1.

Actions:
  - IdentifyNonZeroIndices: Find FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - IdentifyIntermediateZeros: Find all ZeroElements between FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex and record their indices.
  - CountIntermediateZeros: Calculate IntermediateZeroCount.
  - RemoveElementAtIndex: Create a new sequence excluding the element at a specified index.
  - RemoveFirstTwoIntermediateZeros: Create a new sequence excluding the elements at the first two indices listed in IntermediateZeroIndices.
  - PadStart: Prepend one or two ZeroElements to the beginning of a sequence.
  - PadEnd: Append one or two ZeroElements to the end of a sequence.
