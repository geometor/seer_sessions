Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence (0-9).
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - IntermediateZero: A ZeroElement located strictly between the first and last NonZeroElement indices in the sequence.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: 12 (constant).
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index of the first NonZeroElement in the input sequence. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - LastNonZeroIndex: The index of the last NonZeroElement in the input sequence. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - IntermediateZeroIndices: A list containing the indices of all IntermediateZero elements, in the order they appear in the sequence.
  - IntermediateZeroCount: The total count of IntermediateZero elements (length of IntermediateZeroIndices list).

Relationships:
  - IntermediateZeros exist only if there are at least two NonZeroElements and the distance between their indices is greater than 1.
  - IntermediateZeros are found at indices `k` where `FirstNonZeroIndex < k < LastNonZeroIndex` and the element at `k` is 0.

Actions:
  - IdentifyIndices: Find FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - IdentifyIntermediateZeros: Find the indices of all zeros between FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex. Store these indices in IntermediateZeroIndices.
  - CountIntermediateZeros: Calculate IntermediateZeroCount based on the length of IntermediateZeroIndices.
  - RemoveElementAtIndex: Create a new sequence excluding the element at a specific index.
  - RemoveFirstTwoIntermediateZeros: Create a new sequence excluding the elements at the indices specified by the first two values in IntermediateZeroIndices.
  - PrependElement: Add an element (specifically 0) to the beginning of a sequence.
  - AppendElement: Add an element (specifically 0) to the end of a sequence.
  - PadSequenceStart: Add two ZeroElements to the beginning of the sequence.
  - PadSequenceEnd: Add two ZeroElements to the end of the sequence.
