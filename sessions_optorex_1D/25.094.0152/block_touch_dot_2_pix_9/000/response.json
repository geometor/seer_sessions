Specifically, zeros located *between* the first and last non-zero numbers in the sequence play a crucial role. Non-zero numbers seem to maintain their relative order.\n3.  **Core Operation:** The primary action involves modifying the number and position of these \"intermediate\" zeros.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** There appear to be two main scenarios based on the *count* of these intermediate zeros.\n    *   If there's exactly one intermediate zero, it's moved either to the beginning or the end of the sequence.\n    *   If there are two or more intermediate zeros, exactly two of them are removed, and two zeros are added back (padded) either at the beginning or the end.\n5.  **Padding Location:** The location for adding padding zeros (in the second case) or moving the single zero (in the first case) seems dependent on the position of the *first* non-zero number in the original input sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
