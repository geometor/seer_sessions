Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence (0-9).
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - IntermediateZero: A ZeroElement located strictly between the first and last NonZeroElement in the sequence.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: 12 (constant).
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index of the first NonZeroElement in the input sequence. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - LastNonZeroIndex: The index of the last NonZeroElement in the input sequence. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - IntermediateZeroCount: The total count of IntermediateZero elements.

Relationships:
  - IntermediateZeros exist only if there are at least two NonZeroElements.
  - IntermediateZeros are found at indices `k` where `FirstNonZeroIndex < k < LastNonZeroIndex` and the element at `k` is 0.

Actions:
  - IdentifyIndices: Find FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - IdentifyIntermediateZeros: Find all zeros between these indices.
  - CountIntermediateZeros: Calculate IntermediateZeroCount.
  - RemoveElement: Delete an element at a specific index.
  - RemoveTwoIntermediateZeros: Filter out the first two IntermediateZero elements found between FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - InsertElement: Add an element (specifically 0) at a target position (start or end).
  - PadSequence: Add two ZeroElements to either the start or the end of the sequence.
