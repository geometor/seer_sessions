Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence (0-9).
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - FirstNonZero: The NonZeroElement with the lowest index in the sequence.
  - LastNonZero: The NonZeroElement with the highest index in the sequence.
  - IntermediateZero: A ZeroElement located at an index strictly between the index of the FirstNonZero and the index of the LastNonZero element.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: 12 (constant).
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index of the FirstNonZero element. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - LastNonZeroIndex: The index of the LastNonZero element. Null if no NonZeroElements exist.
  - IntermediateZeroIndices: A list containing the indices of all IntermediateZero elements, in ascending order.
  - IntermediateZeroCount: The total count of IntermediateZero elements (length of IntermediateZeroIndices).

Relationships:
  - IntermediateZeros exist only if FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex are defined and FirstNonZeroIndex < LastNonZeroIndex - 1.
  - The transformation depends on IntermediateZeroCount.
  - The location of added zeros (padding) depends on the FirstNonZeroIndex.

Actions:
  - IdentifyFirstLastNonZero: Find FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - IdentifyIntermediateZeros: Find all IntermediateZeroIndices between FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - CountIntermediateZeros: Calculate IntermediateZeroCount.
  - RemoveElementAtIndex: Delete an element from the sequence at a specific index.
  - RemoveFirstTwoIntermediateZeros: Remove elements from the sequence located at the first two indices listed in IntermediateZeroIndices.
  - PadStart: Insert one or two ZeroElements at the beginning of the sequence.
  - PadEnd: Append one or two ZeroElements to the end of the sequence.
  - ReconstructSequence: Create a new sequence by conditionally removing IntermediateZeros and adding padding zeros.
