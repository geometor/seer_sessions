            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified from the execution results is a type mismatch error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, but the code attempted to use the `.index()` method, which is specific to Python lists. The accompanying warning `Warning: Input sequence length is 1, expected 12.` is likely a downstream effect, possibly due to how the testing framework handled the initial error or iterated over the input array element by element after the failure.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly convert the input NumPy array into a Python list at the beginning. This allows the rest of the logic, which relies on list methods and iteration, to function correctly.\n2.  **Code Robustness:** Ensure helper functions (`find_pivot`, `find_data_block`) also operate correctly on the converted list.\n3.  **Logic Validation:** Since the core logic wasn't reached due to the type error, the existing natural language program and YAML facts describing the transformation rule (pivot, block, gap, shift) remain the current best hypothesis and don't need fundamental changes yet. The focus is on fixing the input handling to allow testing of this logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The testing environment passes NumPy arrays to the `transform` function.\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` due to using a list-specific method (`.index()`) on a NumPy array.\n*   **Length Warning:** A secondary warning indicated the function perceived input length as 1, which contradicts the task description (length 12). This is likely an artifact of the error handling or iteration within the test harness after the initial `AttributeError`.\n*   **Core Logic Status:** The intended transformation logic (finding pivot, block, calculating shift based on gap) has not been successfully tested yet due to the input type error preventing execution.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Create an `output_list` of 12 zeros.\n4.  Find the index (`pivot_index`) of the integer `2` within the `input_list`. If `2` is not found, return the `input_list` as is (error condition).\n5.  Place the integer `2` at the `pivot_index` in the `output_list`.\n6.  Scan the `input_list` to locate the first contiguous block of non-zero integers, excluding the element at `pivot_index`. Record its starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), and the sequence of values (`block_values`).\n7.  If no such data block is found, return the `output_list` (containing only the `2` and zeros).\n8.  Determine the relative position of the block to the `pivot_index`:\n    *   If `block_end < pivot_index`, the block is \"Left\". Calculate `gap = pivot_index - block_end - 1`.\n    *   If `block_start > pivot_index`, the block is \"Right\". Calculate `gap = block_start - pivot_index - 1`.\n    *   Otherwise (adjacent or overlapping), the `gap = 0`. Ensure gap is non-negative.\n9.

Iterate through the `block_values`. For each value, determine its target index in the `output_list` (starting from `new_block_start` and incrementing). If the target index is valid (within bounds 0-11) and is *not* equal to `pivot_index`, place the value at that target index in the `output_list`.\n12. Return the completed `output_list`."
