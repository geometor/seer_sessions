Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: Input/Output Data
      Structure: List or Array of Integers
      Properties:
        - Length: 12 (fixed)
  - Pivot:
      Type: Special Element
      Value: 2
      Properties:
        - Count: Exactly 1 per Sequence
        - Position: Fixed (index remains constant between input and output)
  - DataBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence
      Structure: Contiguous sequence of non-zero integers within the Sequence
      Exclusion: Does not include the Pivot value (2)
      Properties:
        - Existence: Zero or one per Sequence
        - Position: Relative to Pivot (Left, Right, Adjacent)
        - Indices: Start Index, End Index
        - Values: List of integers in the block
        - Length: Variable
  - Filler:
      Type: Background Element
      Value: 0
      Properties:
        - Role: Occupies positions not taken by Pivot or DataBlock

Relationships:
  - RelativePosition: Between DataBlock and Pivot (Left, Right, Adjacent)
      Definition: Determined by comparing DataBlock indices to Pivot index.
  - Gap:
      Type: Spatial Separation Metric
      Definition: Number of Fillers (zeros) strictly located between the DataBlock and the Pivot.
      Properties:
        - Value: Integer >= 0
        - Calculation: Depends on RelativePosition and indices.
          - Left: `Pivot_Index - Block_End_Index - 1`
          - Right: `Block_Start_Index - Pivot_Index - 1`
          - Adjacent: `0`

Actions:
  - InitializeOutput: Create a new sequence of length 12, filled with Filler (0).
  - LocatePivot: Find the index of the Pivot (value 2) in the input Sequence.
  - PlacePivot: Copy the Pivot value (2) to its original index in the output Sequence.
  - IdentifyDataBlock: Scan the input Sequence to find the first contiguous DataBlock (non-zero, non-Pivot values). Record its start index, end index, and values.
  - CheckBlockExistence: If no DataBlock is found, finalize the output (it only contains the Pivot and Fillers).
  - CalculateGap: Determine the Gap between the identified DataBlock and the Pivot based on their indices and relative position.
  - DetermineShiftAmount: Calculate the number of positions to shift the DataBlock based on the Gap:
      - If Gap = 0, Shift Amount = 0
      - If Gap = 1, Shift Amount = 1
      - If Gap > 1, Shift Amount = 2
  - CalculateNewBlockPosition: Determine the new start index for the DataBlock by adding (if Left) or subtracting (if Right) the ShiftAmount from the original start index.
  - PlaceDataBlock: Copy the DataBlock values into the output Sequence, starting at the calculated new start index, ensuring not to overwrite the Pivot's position.
  - FinalizeOutput: Return the constructed output Sequence.
