Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Properties:
        - Type: List of Integers
        - Length: 12
  - Pivot:
      Properties:
        - Value: 2
        - Count: 1
        - Position: Fixed (remains same in output as input)
  - DataBlock:
      Properties:
        - Type: Contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero integers (excluding Pivot)
        - Existence: Typically one per sequence (can be absent or adjacent to Pivot)
        - Position: Relative to Pivot (Left, Right, Adjacent)
        - Length: Variable
  - Filler:
      Properties:
        - Value: 0
        - Role: Background, occupies space not used by Pivot or DataBlock

Relationships:
  - RelativePosition: Between DataBlock and Pivot (Left, Right, Adjacent)
  - Gap:
      Properties:
        - Type: Number of Fillers (zeros) strictly between DataBlock and Pivot
        - Value: Integer >= 0

Actions:
  - LocatePivot: Find the index of the Pivot (value 2).
  - IdentifyDataBlock: Find the start index, end index, and values of the contiguous non-zero sequence (excluding Pivot).
  - CalculateGap: Determine the number of zeros between the DataBlock and the Pivot based on their indices.
  - DetermineShift:
      Based on Gap:
        - If Gap = 0, Shift Amount = 0
        - If Gap = 1, Shift Amount = 1
        - If Gap > 1, Shift Amount = 2
      Based on RelativePosition:
        - If DataBlock is Left of Pivot, Shift Direction = Right
        - If DataBlock is Right of Pivot, Shift Direction = Left
        - If DataBlock is Adjacent or Absent, Shift Direction = None
  - ApplyShift: Calculate the new start and end indices for the DataBlock.
  - ConstructOutput: Create a new sequence of length 12, place the Pivot at its original index, place the shifted DataBlock at its new indices, and fill remaining positions with Filler (0).
