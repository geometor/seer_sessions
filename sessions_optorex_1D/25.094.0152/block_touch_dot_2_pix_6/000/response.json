            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.\n2.  **Key Element '2':** The number `2` appears exactly once in every input and output sequence. Its position remains unchanged during the transformation. It acts as a fixed pivot point.\n3.  **Data Block:** Apart from the `2` and `0`s, there is typically a contiguous block of other non-zero integers (e.g., `3 3`, `5 5 5`, `7`, `1 1 1 1 1`, `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`). Let's call this the \"data block\". In some cases (`train_4`, `train_6`), the `2` is immediately adjacent to this block.\n4.  **Zeros:** Zeros act as background or padding elements.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the \"data block\" relative to the fixed position of the `2`. Zeros fill the space created or displaced by the shift.\n6.  **Shift Logic:**\n    *   If the data block is to the left of the `2`, it shifts rightwards towards the `2`.\n    *   If the data block is to the right of the `2`, it shifts leftwards towards the `2`.\n    *   If the data block is already adjacent to the `2` (or if there's no data block other than `2`), no shift occurs.\n7.  **Shift Amount:** The amount of the shift depends on the gap (number of zeros) between the data block and the `2`.\n    *   If the gap is 0 (adjacent), the shift is 0.\n    *   If the gap is 1, the shift is 1 position (towards the `2`).\n    *   If the gap is greater than 1, the shift is 2 positions (towards the `2`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of non-zero integers, excluding the `2`. Record its starting index (`block_start`), ending index (`block_end`), and the sequence of values (`block_values`). If no such block exists, proceed to step 8.\n4.

Calculate the `gap` (number of zeros strictly between the block and the `2`):\n    *   If \"Left\", `gap = pivot_index - block_end - 1`.\n    *   If \"Right\", `gap = block_start - pivot_index - 1`.\n    *   If \"Adjacent\", `gap = 0`.\n6.

Calculate the new indices for the block (`new_block_start`, `new_block_end`):\n    *   If \"Left\", `new_block_start = block_start + shift_amount`, `new_block_end = block_end + shift_amount`.\n    *   If \"Right\", `new_block_start = block_start - shift_amount`, `new_block_end = block_end - shift_amount`.\n    *   If \"Adjacent\", `new_block_start = block_start`, `new_block_end = block_end`.\n8.  Create the output sequence, initially filled with 12 zeros.\n9.  Place the integer `2` at the `pivot_index` in the output sequence.\n10. If a data block was found in step 3, place the `block_values` into the output sequence starting at `new_block_start` and ending at `new_block_end`.\n11. Return the completed output sequence."
