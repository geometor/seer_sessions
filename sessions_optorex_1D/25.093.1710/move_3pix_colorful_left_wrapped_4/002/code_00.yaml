objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    description: A sequence of integers provided as input.
    properties:
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - element_type: integer
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    description: The sequence of integers generated as output.
    properties:
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - element_type: integer
  - name: head_segment
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    description: The first 3 elements of the input sequence.
    properties:
      - length: 3
  - name: tail_segment
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    description: The elements of the input sequence starting from the 4th element.
    properties:
      - length: 9 (derived from input length 12 and head length 3)
actions:
  - name: slice
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: [head_segment, tail_segment]
    description: Divides the input sequence into two parts; the first 3 elements (head) and the remaining elements (tail).
  - name: concatenate
    actor: system
    input: [tail_segment, head_segment]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the tail_segment and the head_segment, in that order, to form the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is formed by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end, maintaining the relative order within both the moved segment and the remaining segment. This is equivalent to a left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions.
