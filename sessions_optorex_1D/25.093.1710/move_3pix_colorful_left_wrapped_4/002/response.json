            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string (`str`). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array object instead. The core transformation logic (identifying the first 3 elements and moving them to the end) appears consistent with the examples, but the input handling and type assumptions were incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the understanding of the input and output types. The `transform` function should expect a sequence-like object (list or NumPy array) containing the numbers directly, rather than a string requiring parsing. Similarly, the output should likely be of the same sequence type. The functions `parse_input` and `format_output` are unnecessary and incorrect in this context.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples and the error:\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error).\n*   **Input Element Type:** Integers (observed from examples).\n*   **Input Sequence Length:** 12 (consistent across all `train_` examples).\n*   **Number of Elements Moved:** 3 (consistent across all `train_` examples).\n*   **Transformation:** Rotational shift (left rotation by 3 positions).\n*   **Error:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in all examples due to incorrect input type handling (`.split()` called on an array).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
