Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves processing a sequence of integers. The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. The output is also a single string containing space-separated integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a fixed number of elements from the beginning of the input sequence are moved to the end to form the output sequence, while maintaining the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Separate the input sequence into two parts:
    a.  The first part consists of the initial 3 integers.
    b.  The second part consists of all the remaining integers (from the 4th integer to the end).
3.  Construct the output sequence by appending the first part (the initial 3 integers) to the end of the second part (the remaining integers).
4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string (`str`). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array object instead. The core transformation logic (identifying the first 3 elements and moving them to the end) appears consistent with the examples, but the input handling and type assumptions were incorrect.

The strategy is to revise the understanding of the input and output types. The `transform` function should expect a sequence-like object (list or NumPy array) containing the numbers directly, rather than a string requiring parsing. Similarly, the output should likely be of the same sequence type. The functions `parse_input` and `format_output` are unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

**Metrics:**

Based on the provided examples and the error:

*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error).
*   **Input Element Type:** Integers (observed from examples).
*   **Input Sequence Length:** 12 (consistent across all `train_` examples).
*   **Number of Elements Moved:** 3 (consistent across all `train_` examples).
*   **Transformation:** Rotational shift (left rotation by 3 positions).
*   **Error:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in all examples due to incorrect input type handling (`.split()` called on an array).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (expected to be a list or NumPy array of integers).
2.  Identify the first 3 elements of the input sequence (the head segment).
3.  Identify the remaining elements of the input sequence, starting from the 4th element (the tail segment).
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the tail segment followed by the head segment.
5.  Return the constructed sequence.
