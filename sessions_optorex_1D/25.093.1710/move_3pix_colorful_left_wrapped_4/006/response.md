**General Assessment:**

The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected string format. The initial assumption based on the string representation in the problem description was incorrect regarding the function's input type in the execution environment.

The core logic identified previously – moving the first 3 elements of the sequence to the end – appears consistent across all examples when viewing the data as sequences of numbers. The failure is purely due to the mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type (NumPy array).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list, which the environment likely converts to a NumPy array) directly.
2.  Remove the string parsing (`split`) and string formatting (`join`) steps.
3.  Implement the sequence manipulation (slicing and concatenation) using NumPy array operations or standard list operations.

    type: numpy.ndarray (or list) of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input to the transform function.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray (or list) of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers generated as output by the transform function.
  - name: head_segment
    type: numpy.ndarray (or list) of integers
    description: The first 3 elements of the input sequence.
  - name: tail_segment

    description: The elements of the input sequence starting from the 4th element until the end.
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: data_type
    value: sequence of integers (handled as numpy.ndarray in execution)
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value: 12 (based on all examples)

    property: data_type
    value: sequence of integers (handled as numpy.ndarray in execution)
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length

actions:
  - name: slice
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: [head_segment, tail_segment]
    description: Divides the input sequence into two parts; the first 3 elements (head) and the rest (tail).
  - name: concatenate
    actor: system
    input: [tail_segment, head_segment]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the tail_segment and the head_segment, in that order, using sequence concatenation.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is formed by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end, preserving relative order within both segments. This is equivalent to a left circular shift (rotation) by 3 positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (expected as a NumPy array or list of integers).
2.  Define the number of elements to move, `n = 3`.
3.  Check if the length of the input sequence is greater than `n`. (Based on examples, this is always true, as length is 12).
4.  Split the input sequence into two segments:
    a.  `head_segment`: The first `n` elements of the input sequence.
    b.  `tail_segment`: The elements from index `n` to the end of the input sequence.
5.  Construct the `output_sequence` by concatenating the `tail_segment` followed by the `head_segment`.
6.  Return the `output_sequence`.
