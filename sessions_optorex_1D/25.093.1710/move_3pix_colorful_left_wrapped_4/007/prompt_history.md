Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves processing a sequence of integers. The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. The output is also a single string containing space-separated integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a fixed number of elements from the beginning of the input sequence are moved to the end to form the output sequence, while maintaining the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Separate the input sequence into two parts:
    a.  The first part consists of the initial 3 integers.
    b.  The second part consists of all the remaining integers (from the 4th integer to the end).
3.  Construct the output sequence by appending the first part (the initial 3 integers) to the end of the second part (the remaining integers).
4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.

**General Assessment:**

The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected string format. The initial assumption based on the string representation in the problem description was incorrect regarding the function's input type in the execution environment.

The core logic identified previously – moving the first 3 elements of the sequence to the end – appears consistent across all examples when viewing the data as sequences of numbers. The failure is purely due to the mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type (NumPy array).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list, which the environment likely converts to a NumPy array) directly.
2.  Remove the string parsing (`split`) and string formatting (`join`) steps.
3.  Implement the sequence manipulation (slicing and concatenation) using NumPy array operations or standard list operations.

2.  Define the number of elements to move, `n = 3`.
3.  Check if the length of the input sequence is greater than `n`. (Based on examples, this is always true, as length is 12).
4.  Split the input sequence into two segments:
    a.  `head_segment`: The first `n` elements of the input sequence.
    b.  `tail_segment`: The elements from index `n` to the end of the input sequence.
5.  Construct the `output_sequence` by concatenating the `tail_segment` followed by the `head_segment`.
6.  Return the `output_sequence`.
