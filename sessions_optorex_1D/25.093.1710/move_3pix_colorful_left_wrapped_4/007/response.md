```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence (expected as a NumPy array or list of integers) by moving the first 3 elements to the end of the sequence, while preserving the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements. This is equivalent to a left circular shift (rotation) by 3 positions.
