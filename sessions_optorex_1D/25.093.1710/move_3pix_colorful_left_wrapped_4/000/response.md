Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves processing a sequence of integers. The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. The output is also a single string containing space-separated integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a fixed number of elements from the beginning of the input sequence are moved to the end to form the output sequence, while maintaining the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers generated as output.
  - name: head_segment
    type: list of integers
    description: The first 3 elements of the input sequence.
  - name: tail_segment
    type: list of integers
    description: The elements of the input sequence starting from the 4th element until the end.
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: order
    value: preserved within segments
  - object: output_sequence
    property: order
    value: concatenation of tail_segment followed by head_segment
  - object: head_segment
    property: length
    value: 3
actions:
  - name: split
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: [head_segment, tail_segment]
    description: Divides the input sequence into two parts; the first 3 elements and the rest.
  - name: concatenate
    actor: system
    input: [tail_segment, head_segment]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the tail_segment and the head_segment in that specific order.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is formed by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Separate the input sequence into two parts:
    a.  The first part consists of the initial 3 integers.
    b.  The second part consists of all the remaining integers (from the 4th integer to the end).
3.  Construct the output sequence by appending the first part (the initial 3 integers) to the end of the second part (the remaining integers).
4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.
