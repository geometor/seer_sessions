objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers generated as output.
  - name: head_segment
    type: list of integers
    description: The first 3 elements of the input sequence.
  - name: tail_segment
    type: list of integers
    description: The elements of the input sequence starting from the 4th element until the end.
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: order
    value: preserved within segments
  - object: output_sequence
    property: order
    value: concatenation of tail_segment followed by head_segment
  - object: head_segment
    property: length
    value: 3
actions:
  - name: split
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: [head_segment, tail_segment]
    description: Divides the input sequence into two parts; the first 3 elements and the rest.
  - name: concatenate
    actor: system
    input: [tail_segment, head_segment]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the tail_segment and the head_segment in that specific order.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is formed by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end.
