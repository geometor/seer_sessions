The input is a single string containing space-separated integers. The output is also a single string containing space-separated integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a fixed number of elements from the beginning of the input sequence are moved to the end to form the output sequence, while maintaining the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
