objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of strings (representing integers)
    description: A sequence of space-separated numbers provided as input. All examples have a length of 12.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of strings (representing integers)
    description: The sequence of space-separated numbers generated as output. All examples have a length of 12.
  - name: head_segment
    type: list of strings
    description: The first 3 elements of the input_sequence.
  - name: tail_segment
    type: list of strings
    description: The elements of the input_sequence starting from the 4th element until the end (elements 3 through 11, using 0-based indexing).
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: element_type
    value: string representation of integers
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value: 12 (consistent across all examples)
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    value: 12 (consistent across all examples)
  - object: head_segment
    property: length
    value: 3
  - object: tail_segment
    property: length
    value: 9
  - object: head_segment
    property: relative_order
    value: preserved in the output (appears at the end)
  - object: tail_segment
    property: relative_order
    value: preserved in the output (appears at the beginning)
actions:
  - name: split
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      split_index: 3
    output: [head_segment, tail_segment]
    description: Divides the input sequence into two parts; the first 3 elements (head) and the remaining 9 elements (tail).
  - name: concatenate
    actor: system
    input: [tail_segment, head_segment]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the tail_segment and the head_segment, in that order, to form the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is formed by taking the elements from index 3 to the end of the input sequence, followed by the elements from index 0 to 2 of the input sequence. This is equivalent to a left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions.
