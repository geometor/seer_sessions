*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 integers.
    *   The integers themselves seem to range from 0 to 9.
    *   The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences, the same set of numbers is present in both, just in a different order.
    *   Specifically, the first three elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the output sequence.
    *   The remaining nine elements (from the 4th element to the 12th element) of the input sequence form the beginning of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order. This constitutes a left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: integers
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: integers
      - name: first_part
        type: sub-sequence
        source: input_sequence
        description: The first 3 elements of the input sequence.
      - name: second_part
        type: sub-sequence
        source: input_sequence
        description: The elements from index 3 to the end (last 9 elements) of the input sequence.
    actions:
      - name: split
        input: input_sequence
        outputs: [first_part, second_part]
        description: Divide the input sequence into two parts based on index.
      - name: concatenate
        inputs: [second_part, first_part]
        output: output_sequence
        description: Join the second part and the first part together in that order.
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        input: input_sequence
        output: output_sequence
        rule: The output sequence is formed by concatenating the second_part followed by the first_part of the input sequence.
      - type: positional
        description: Elements maintain their relative order within the first_part and second_part during the transformation.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the first 3 elements of the sequence.
    3.  Identify the remaining 9 elements of the sequence (from the 4th element to the 12th).
    4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the 9 elements identified in step 3 at the beginning.
    5.  Append the 3 elements identified in step 2 to the end of the sequence constructed in step 4.
