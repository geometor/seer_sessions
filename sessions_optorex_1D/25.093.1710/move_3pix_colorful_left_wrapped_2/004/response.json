            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided information indicates that the initial hypothesis about the transformation (a left rotation by 3 positions on a 1D sequence) is conceptually correct based on the string representations of the examples. However, the execution errors (`Input array must have shape (12,)`) reveal a mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function (a 1D NumPy array of shape `(12,)`) and the actual format passed by the testing environment (likely a 2D NumPy array, probably shape `(1, 12)`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the actual shape of the input `numpy.ndarray` passed to the function. Based on the error and common practices in similar frameworks, it's highly probable the shape is `(1, 12)`.\n2.  Adjust the implementation within the `transform` function to handle this `(1, 12)` shape. The core logic (split at index 3, concatenate parts 2 and 1) remains the same but needs to be applied to the *single row* of the 2D array.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) to accurately reflect the input object's properties (shape) and the operations performed on it.\n\n## Metrics and Assumptions Verification\n\nAssumption: The testing framework converts the input string (e.g., `\"2 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\"`) into a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, 12)` before passing it to the `transform` function.\n\nVerification: Let's check the shape of a sample input if interpreted this way.\n"
