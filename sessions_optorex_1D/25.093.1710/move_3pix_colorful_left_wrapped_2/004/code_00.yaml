      - description: The single row extracted from the input_grid.
  - name: first_part
    type: numpy.ndarray
    source: input_row
    properties:
        - length: 3
    description: The first 3 elements of the input_row.

actions:
  - name: extract_row
    input: input_grid
    output: input_row
    description: Get the first (and only) row from the input_grid.
  - name: split_row
    input: input_row
    outputs: [first_part, second_part]
    description: Divide the input_row into two parts - the first 3 elements and the remaining 9 elements.
  - name: concatenate_parts
    inputs: [second_part, first_part]
    output: output_row
    description: Join the second_part and the first_part together in that order to form the transformed row.
  - name: reshape_to_grid
    input: output_row
    output: output_grid
    description: Reshape the 1D transformed row back into a 2D grid of shape (1, 12).
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: The output grid is formed by performing a left rotation by 3 positions on the single row of the input grid.
  - type: positional
    description: Elements maintain their relative order within the first_part and second_part during the transformation.
