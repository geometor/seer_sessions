            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided execution results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided by the testing environment (a NumPy array). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently appears because the code attempts to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array object.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (left cyclic shift by 3) appears consistent with the input/output pairs visually. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Correct the Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array as input.\n2.  **Adapt the Transformation Logic:** Implement the left cyclic shift using NumPy array operations (slicing and concatenation).\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the input type handled by the function (NumPy array) and the array-based operations performed.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nBased on the error messages and the initial examples:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The `transform` function receives a NumPy array.\n*   **Output Type:** The function should likely return a NumPy array, as the testing framework handles the final formatting for comparison.\n*   **Array Elements:** The elements within the array appear to represent the single digits from the input strings. Their exact dtype (e.g., `int`, `str`) within the array isn't specified by the error, but NumPy operations can handle either appropriately for rotation. Let's assume they are treated as elements to be rearranged, regardless of specific type for the rotation itself.\n*   **Array Length:** All training examples show input/output arrays of length 12.\n*   **Transformation:** A left cyclic shift of 3 positions remains the most plausible transformation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
