Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, separated by spaces. They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.
*   **Length:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples.
*   **Content:** The digits present in the output are the same as the digits in the input, suggesting no digits are added or removed, only rearranged.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output sequences, it appears that the output is a cyclic shift (rotation) of the input sequence. Let's test this:
    *   `train_1`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0]` -> `[0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_2`: `[2, 1, 0, 7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3]` -> `[7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_3`: `[2, 3, 7, 8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9]` -> `[8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 3, 7]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_4`: `[7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7, 7, 2, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   The pattern consistently holds: the output is the input sequence rotated left by 3 positions.

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Take the first 3 elements from the beginning of the sequence.
3.  Take the subsequence starting from the 4th element up to the end of the sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided execution results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided by the testing environment (a NumPy array). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently appears because the code attempts to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array object.

The core transformation logic identified previously (left cyclic shift by 3) appears consistent with the input/output pairs visually. The strategy is to:

1.  **Correct the Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array as input.
2.  **Adapt the Transformation Logic:** Implement the left cyclic shift using NumPy array operations (slicing and concatenation).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the input type handled by the function (NumPy array) and the array-based operations performed.

## Metrics and Observations

Based on the error messages and the initial examples:

*   **Input Type:** The `transform` function receives a NumPy array.
*   **Output Type:** The function should likely return a NumPy array, as the testing framework handles the final formatting for comparison.
*   **Array Elements:** The elements within the array appear to represent the single digits from the input strings. Their exact dtype (e.g., `int`, `str`) within the array isn't specified by the error, but NumPy operations can handle either appropriately for rotation. Let's assume they are treated as elements to be rearranged, regardless of specific type for the rotation itself.
*   **Array Length:** All training examples show input/output arrays of length 12.
*   **Transformation:** A left cyclic shift of 3 positions remains the most plausible transformation.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Array Rotation
Input:
  Type: NumPy array
  Properties:
    - Represents an ordered sequence of elements (originally digits).
    - Length observed in examples: 12
Output:
  Type: NumPy array
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input array.
    - Contains the same elements as the input array, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Shift (Rotation)
  Parameters:
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Relationship: The output array is generated by moving the first 3 elements of the input array to the end, preserving the relative order of all elements.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input data as a NumPy array.
2.  Define the number of positions to shift left as 3.
3.  Calculate the effective shift amount by taking the shift amount modulo the length of the input array (this ensures correct behavior for any array length, though all examples have length 12).
4.  Slice the input array to get the elements from the effective shift index to the end.
5.  Slice the input array to get the elements from the beginning up to the effective shift index.
6.  Concatenate the slice from step 4 followed by the slice from step 5 to create the output array.
7.  Return the resulting rotated NumPy array.
