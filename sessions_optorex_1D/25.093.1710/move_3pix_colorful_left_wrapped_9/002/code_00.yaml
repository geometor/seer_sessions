Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray (or list-like structure) of integers
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence of single digits (0-9 represented as integers)
    - Fixed length (observed length is 12 in all examples, but the rule should generalize)
Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray (or list-like structure) of integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same elements as input, but rearranged
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Rotation (Left Shift)
  Parameters:
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Relationship: Output sequence is derived by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end, preserving the relative order of all elements.
  Implementation_Note: Use array/list slicing and concatenation.
