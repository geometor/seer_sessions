They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.\n*   **Length:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples.\n*   **Content:** The digits present in the output are the same as the digits in the input, suggesting no digits are added or removed, only rearranged.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output sequences, it appears that the output is a cyclic shift (rotation) of the input sequence. Let's test this:\n    *   `train_1`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0]` -> `[0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Left shift by 3)\n    *   `train_2`: `[2, 1, 0, 7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3]` -> `[7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (Left shift by 3)\n    *   `train_3`: `[2, 3, 7, 8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9]` -> `[8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 3, 7]` (Left shift by 3)\n    *   `train_4`: `[7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7, 7, 2, 0]` (Left shift by 3)\n    *   The pattern consistently holds: the output is the input sequence rotated left by 3 positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
