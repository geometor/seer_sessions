Task: Sequence Left Rotation by 3
Input:
  Type: Sequence (List or Array) of integers
  Properties:
    - Ordered
    - Fixed length (observed length is 12 in all examples)
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: Sequence (List or Array) of integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same elements as input, but rearranged
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Rotation (Left Shift)
  Parameters:
    - Direction: Left
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Description: The output sequence is generated by moving the first 3 elements of the input sequence to the end, maintaining the relative order of the moved elements and the relative order of the remaining elements.
  Relationship: `output[i] = input[(i + 3) % length]` where `length` is the sequence length (12).
