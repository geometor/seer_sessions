Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, separated by spaces. They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.
*   **Length:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples.
*   **Content:** The digits present in the output are the same as the digits in the input, suggesting no digits are added or removed, only rearranged.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output sequences, it appears that the output is a cyclic shift (rotation) of the input sequence. Let's test this:
    *   `train_1`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0]` -> `[0, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_2`: `[2, 1, 0, 7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3]` -> `[7, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_3`: `[2, 3, 7, 8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9]` -> `[8, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 3, 7]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   `train_4`: `[7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6, 7, 7, 2, 0]` (Left shift by 3)
    *   The pattern consistently holds: the output is the input sequence rotated left by 3 positions.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence
    - Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same elements as input
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Rotation (Left Shift)
  Parameters:
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Relationship: Output list is derived by moving the first 3 elements of the input list to the end, maintaining the order of the moved elements and the order of the remaining elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Take the first 3 elements from the beginning of the sequence.
3.  Take the subsequence starting from the 4th element up to the end of the sequence.
4.  Create the output sequence by appending the first 3 elements (obtained in step 2) to the end of the subsequence (obtained in step 3).
5.  Return the resulting sequence.
