Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers. The integers appear to be single digits (0-9).
2.  **Conservation of Elements:** The multiset of numbers present in the input seems identical to the multiset of numbers in the output. For instance, in `train_4`, the input `[8,6,5,9,9,4,0,0,0,0,0,4]` contains one 8, one 6, one 5, two 9s, two 4s, and five 0s. The output `[9,9,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,6,5]` contains the exact same counts of each number. This suggests the transformation is a rearrangement or permutation of the input sequence.
3.  **Positional Shift:** Observing the movement of non-zero elements strongly suggests a consistent shift.
    *   In `train_1`, the '1' moves from index 3 to index 0 (a shift of -3).
    *   In `train_3`, '2' moves from index 8 to 5 (-3 shift), and '6' moves from index 9 to 6 (-3 shift).
    *   In `train_6`, '9' moves from index 5 to 2 (-3 shift), '1' from 6 to 3 (-3 shift), and '3' from 7 to 4 (-3 shift).
    *   Looking at shifts that cross the boundary (like in `train_2` where '1' goes from index 0 to 9, and '7' goes from 11 to 8), they fit a pattern of cyclic shifting. A shift from index 0 to 9 in a list of 12 is equivalent to a -3 shift (0 - 3 = -3; -3 mod 12 = 9). A shift from index 11 to 8 is also a -3 shift (11 - 3 = 8).
4.  **Consistent Transformation:** Every example consistently shows that each element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i - 3) mod 12` in the output. This is equivalent to a cyclic rotation of the entire sequence to the left by 3 positions.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
data_type: list_of_integers
sequence_length: 12
element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
transformation:
  type: cyclic_rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 3
  properties:
    - preserves_elements: true
    - preserves_length: true
    - operates_on_indices_modulo_length: true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a cyclic rotation (left shift) on the sequence by 3 positions.
3.  The element originally at index `i` will move to index `(i - 3) mod 12`.
4.  The resulting sequence is the output.
