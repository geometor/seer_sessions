Input:
  type: string
  format: space-separated integers
  content: sequence of numbers
  properties:
    length: 12 elements
Output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated integers
  content: sequence of numbers
  properties:
    length: 12 elements
Transformation:
  description: Rearranges the sequence by moving the initial segment to the end.
  steps:
    - action: parse_string
      input: input_string
      delimiter: " "
      output: list_of_integers
      constraints:
        input_length: 12
    - action: split_list
      input: list_of_integers
      parameters:
        split_index: 3 # Split after the 3rd element (index 3)
      results:
        - segment_1: elements from index 0 up to (but not including) 3
        - segment_2: elements from index 3 to the end
    - action: concatenate_lists
      inputs:
        - segment_2
        - segment_1
      output: reordered_list_of_integers
    - action: format_list
      input: reordered_list_of_integers
      delimiter: " "
      output: output_string
Relationship:
  - The output string contains the same integers as the input string.
  - The transformation is equivalent to a cyclic shift applied to two segments of the sequence.
  - Segment 1 (input[0:3]) is moved after Segment 2 (input[3:12]).
