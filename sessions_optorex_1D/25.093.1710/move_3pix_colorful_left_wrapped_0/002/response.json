            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a specific rearrangement pattern. The input is always a sequence of 12 integers represented as a space-separated string. The output is also a sequence of 12 integers as a space-separated string. The transformation involves moving the first 3 integers of the input sequence to the end of the sequence, while the remaining 9 integers shift to the beginning, maintaining their relative internal order.\n\nThe previous code implementation correctly captured this logic. The reported errors (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) likely stem from an inconsistency between the function's expected input type (string) and the type of data it received during testing (possibly a NumPy array). Assuming the task requires processing a string input as shown in the examples, the core transformation logic identified remains valid. The strategy is to refine the description of this string-based transformation.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Format:** Space-separated string of integers.\n*   **Output Format:** Space-separated string of integers.\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 integers across all examples.\n*   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 integers across all examples.\n*   **Transformation Type:** Sequence rearrangement (cyclic shift of segments).\n*   **Split Point:** The sequence is conceptually split after the 3rd element.\n*   **Segment 1:** First 3 elements of the input.\n*   **Segment 2:** Elements from the 4th to the 12th position of the input.\n*   **Reordering Rule:** Output = Segment 2 + Segment 1.\n*   **Element Integrity:** All input integers are present in the output; no values are changed or added/removed.\n*   **Order Preservation:** The relative order of elements within Segment 1 and within Segment 2 is preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
