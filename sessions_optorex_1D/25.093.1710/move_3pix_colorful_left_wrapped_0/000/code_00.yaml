Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: flat list
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: flat list
Transformation:
  action: split
  input: input sequence
  parameters:
    split_point: after the 3rd element
  results:
    - part1: first 3 elements
    - part2: remaining 9 elements (elements 4 through 12)
  action: concatenate
  inputs:
    - part2
    - part1
  output: output sequence
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a reordering of the input sequence.
  - The first 3 elements of the input are moved to the end of the sequence.
  - The elements from the 4th position to the end of the input are moved to the beginning of the sequence.
  - The relative order within the moved segments is preserved.
  - This operation is equivalent to taking a slice of the first 3 elements and a slice of the remaining elements, then concatenating the second slice followed by the first slice.
