Input:
  type: sequence # Likely received as numpy.ndarray or list by the function
  element_type: integer # Or string representation of integer
  length: 12
  structure: linear sequence
Output:
  type: string
  content: space-separated integers
  length: variable (string length), represents 12 integers
Transformation:
  action: receive_sequence
  description: Accepts an input sequence (e.g., list, numpy array) of 12 elements.
  action: split_sequence
  parameters:
    split_point: after the 3rd element (index 2)
  results:
    - segment1: elements at indices 0, 1, 2
    - segment2: elements at indices 3 through 11
  action: concatenate_segments
  inputs:
    - segment2
    - segment1
  output_sequence: reordered sequence
  action: format_output
  input: output_sequence
  output: space-separated string representation of the output_sequence
Relationship:
  - The output is generated by performing a cyclic shift (rotation) on the input sequence.
  - Specifically, the first 3 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end.
  - The last 9 elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning.
  - The relative order of elements within the first 3 and within the last 9 is preserved.
