Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences of 12 integers, separated by spaces.
*   The integers themselves range from 0 to 9.
*   The core operation seems to involve rearranging the order of the numbers within the sequence.
*   Comparing inputs and outputs, the set of numbers remains the same, only their positions change.
*   In every example, the first three numbers of the input sequence appear at the end of the output sequence, maintaining their original relative order.
*   The remaining nine numbers (from the 4th to the 12th position) in the input sequence appear at the beginning of the output sequence, also maintaining their original relative order.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: flat list
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: flat list
Transformation:
  action: split
  input: input sequence
  parameters:
    split_point: after the 3rd element
  results:
    - part1: first 3 elements
    - part2: remaining 9 elements (elements 4 through 12)
  action: concatenate
  inputs:
    - part2
    - part1
  output: output sequence
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a reordering of the input sequence.
  - The first 3 elements of the input are moved to the end of the sequence.
  - The elements from the 4th position to the end of the input are moved to the beginning of the sequence.
  - The relative order within the moved segments is preserved.
  - This operation is equivalent to taking a slice of the first 3 elements and a slice of the remaining elements, then concatenating the second slice followed by the first slice.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first segment consisting of the first 3 integers.
3.  Identify the second segment consisting of the integers from the 4th position to the 12th position.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the second segment first, followed by the first segment.
5.  Format the resulting sequence as space-separated integers.
```python
import math
import numpy as np
import re

1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2. Split the list into two parts: the first 3 elements (segment 1) and the elements from index 3 to the end (segment 2).
3. Concatenate segment 2 followed by segment 1.
4. Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string.
