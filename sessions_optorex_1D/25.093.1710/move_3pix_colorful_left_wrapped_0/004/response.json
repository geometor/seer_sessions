            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided information includes 7 training examples, each consisting of an input string and an output string of 12 space-separated integers. A previous attempt to generate a Python `transform` function resulted in errors across all examples. The error message, `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input instead of the expected string.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input to the `transform` function might be a NumPy array (or potentially a list) rather than a raw string, due to the execution environment.\n2.  Modify the data handling within the `transform` function to work directly with sequence-like objects (lists or NumPy arrays) instead of relying on string splitting.\n3.  Verify that the core transformation logic (moving the first 3 elements to the end) remains consistent across all examples.\n4.  Update the YAML documentation and the natural language program to reflect the potentially different input type and the confirmed transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Inferred from the error message to be `numpy.ndarray` when passed to the `transform` function in the execution environment. Initially represented as space-separated strings.\n*   **Output Type:** Space-separated strings.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in both input and output across all examples.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** The rule of moving the first 3 elements to the end while preserving the relative order of both segments (first 3 and last 9) holds true for all 7 training examples.\n\nExample 1: `[2 8 6]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 5 5 4 4]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 5 5 4 4 2 8 6]`\nExample 2: `[2 1 0]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 1 0]`\nExample 3: `[2 3 9]` moved after `[8 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[8 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 9]`\nExample 4: `[2 9 7]` moved after `[4 1 7 1 0 5 8 7 6]` -> `[4 1 7 1 0 5 8 7 6 2 9 7]`\nExample 5: `[3 9 2]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 8 5 5]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 8 5 5 3 9 2]`\nExample 6: `[4 5 7]` moved after `[0 0 5 7 6 1 4 2 1]` -> `[0 0 5 7 6 1 4 2 1 4 5 7]`\nExample 7: `[1 2 9]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 1 2 9]`\n\nThe pattern is robust across the provided examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
