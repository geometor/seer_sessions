**Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided information includes 7 training examples, each consisting of an input string and an output string of 12 space-separated integers. A previous attempt to generate a Python `transform` function resulted in errors across all examples. The error message, `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input instead of the expected string.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input to the `transform` function might be a NumPy array (or potentially a list) rather than a raw string, due to the execution environment.
2.  Modify the data handling within the `transform` function to work directly with sequence-like objects (lists or NumPy arrays) instead of relying on string splitting.
3.  Verify that the core transformation logic (moving the first 3 elements to the end) remains consistent across all examples.
4.  Update the YAML documentation and the natural language program to reflect the potentially different input type and the confirmed transformation rule.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** Inferred from the error message to be `numpy.ndarray` when passed to the `transform` function in the execution environment. Initially represented as space-separated strings.
*   **Output Type:** Space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in both input and output across all examples.
*   **Transformation Consistency:** The rule of moving the first 3 elements to the end while preserving the relative order of both segments (first 3 and last 9) holds true for all 7 training examples.

Example 1: `[2 8 6]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 5 5 4 4]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 5 5 4 4 2 8 6]`
Example 2: `[2 1 0]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 1 0]`
Example 3: `[2 3 9]` moved after `[8 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[8 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 9]`
Example 4: `[2 9 7]` moved after `[4 1 7 1 0 5 8 7 6]` -> `[4 1 7 1 0 5 8 7 6 2 9 7]`
Example 5: `[3 9 2]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 8 5 5]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 8 5 5 3 9 2]`
Example 6: `[4 5 7]` moved after `[0 0 5 7 6 1 4 2 1]` -> `[0 0 5 7 6 1 4 2 1 4 5 7]`
Example 7: `[1 2 9]` moved after `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 1 2 9]`

The pattern is robust across the provided examples.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence # Likely received as numpy.ndarray or list by the function
  element_type: integer # Or string representation of integer
  length: 12
  structure: linear sequence
Output:
  type: string
  content: space-separated integers
  length: variable (string length), represents 12 integers
Transformation:
  action: receive_sequence
  description: Accepts an input sequence (e.g., list, numpy array) of 12 elements.
  action: split_sequence
  parameters:
    split_point: after the 3rd element (index 2)
  results:
    - segment1: elements at indices 0, 1, 2
    - segment2: elements at indices 3 through 11
  action: concatenate_segments
  inputs:
    - segment2
    - segment1
  output_sequence: reordered sequence
  action: format_output
  input: output_sequence
  output: space-separated string representation of the output_sequence
Relationship:
  - The output is generated by performing a cyclic shift (rotation) on the input sequence.
  - Specifically, the first 3 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end.
  - The last 9 elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning.
  - The relative order of elements within the first 3 and within the last 9 is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence of 12 elements (likely a list or NumPy array containing numbers or string representations of numbers).
2.  Isolate the first segment consisting of the first 3 elements (elements at indices 0, 1, 2).
3.  Isolate the second segment consisting of the remaining 9 elements (elements at indices 3 through 11).
4.  Create a new sequence by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment.
5.  Convert each element in the new sequence to a string.
6.  Join the string elements with single spaces in between to form the final output string.
