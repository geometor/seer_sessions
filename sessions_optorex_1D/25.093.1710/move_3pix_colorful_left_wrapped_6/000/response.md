*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers.
    *   The length of the input sequence is consistently 12 across all examples.
    *   The length of the output sequence is also consistently 12 across all examples.
    *   The integers present in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, implying a rearrangement or reordering operation.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the first three elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence to form the output sequence. This corresponds to a left circular shift or rotation by 3 positions.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: input_sequence
        description: A list of 12 integers.
        properties:
          - type: list
          - element_type: integer
          - length: 12
      - object: output_sequence
        description: A list of 12 integers derived from the input sequence.
        properties:
          - type: list
          - element_type: integer
          - length: 12
    transformation:
      - action: rotate_left
        parameters:
          - object: input_sequence
          - shift_amount: 3
        description: The elements of the input sequence are shifted 3 positions to the left in a circular manner.
    relationship:
      - type: rearrangement
        description: The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence but in a different order.
      - rule: The output sequence is generated by taking the first 3 elements of the input sequence and appending them to the end of the remaining elements (from index 3 onwards).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the first 3 elements of the sequence.
    3.  Identify the remaining elements of the sequence (from the 4th element to the end).
    4.  Create the output sequence by concatenating the remaining elements (step 3) followed by the first 3 elements (step 2).
