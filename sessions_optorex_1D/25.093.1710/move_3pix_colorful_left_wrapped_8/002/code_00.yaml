  action: split_and_concatenate
  description: Splits the input sequence into two parts and concatenates them in reverse order.
  split_point:
    type: index
    value: 3 # Split occurs after the element at index 2
  segments:
    - segment_1:
        source: input
        indices: 0 to 2 (inclusive)
        length: 3
    - segment_2:
        source: input
        indices: 3 to 11 (inclusive)
        length: 9
  concatenation_order: [segment_2, segment_1]
