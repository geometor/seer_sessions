Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences of 12 integers.
*   The numbers within the sequence appear to be rearranged from input to output.
*   The set of numbers present in the input is identical to the set of numbers in the output, just in a different order.
*   Comparing corresponding elements reveals a consistent positional shift across all examples. Specifically, the element at index 3 in the input becomes the element at index 0 in the output, the element at index 4 in the input becomes the element at index 1 in the output, and so on. The elements originally at indices 0, 1, and 2 in the input appear at the end of the output sequence (indices 9, 10, 11). This pattern indicates a circular left shift.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
actions:
  - name: rotate_left
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 3
    produces: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is derived by performing a circular left rotation of the input_sequence by exactly 3 positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Take the first 3 integers from the beginning of the input sequence.
3.  Take the remaining 9 integers (from index 3 to index 11) from the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the 9 integers (from step 3) and then appending the 3 integers (from step 2) to the end.
