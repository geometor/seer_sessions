Specifically, the element at index 3 in the input becomes the element at index 0 in the output, the element at index 4 in the input becomes the element at index 1 in the output, and so on. The elements originally at indices 0, 1, and 2 in the input appear at the end of the output sequence (indices 9, 10, 11). This pattern indicates a circular left shift.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
