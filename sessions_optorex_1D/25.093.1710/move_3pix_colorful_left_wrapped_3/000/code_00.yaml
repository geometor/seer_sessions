  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
actions:
  - name: rotate_left
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 3
    produces: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is derived by performing a circular left rotation of the input_sequence by exactly 3 positions.
