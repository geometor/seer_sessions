            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Assessment:** The provided execution results indicate a failure in the previous step's code execution or implementation. The `Transformed Output` consistently mirrors the `Input`, while the `Expected Output` differs significantly. Critically, comparing the `Input` and `Expected Output` across all provided training and testing examples *re-confirms* the initial hypothesis: the transformation is a circular left shift of the 12-element sequence by 3 positions. The failure reported was in the execution/testing phase, not in the pattern recognition itself. The \"Pixels Off\" metric reported in the results seems inconsistent with a simple count of differing elements between Input and Expected Output, but the underlying pattern remains clear.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** The strategy is to reaffirm the identified transformation rule (circular left shift by 3) based on the consistent pattern observed between the `Input` and `Expected Output` pairs. The execution failure will be noted, but the core understanding of the task's logic remains unchanged. The YAML facts and natural language program will reflect this confirmed rule. We will use code execution to verify the shift logic on the examples and calculate the number of differing elements between input and expected output.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the circular left shift by 3 positions and calculate the number of elements that differ between the input and the *expected* output for each example.\n\n"
