objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
      - description: The initial sequence of numbers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
      - description: The sequence after transformation.
actions:
  - name: circular_left_shift
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 3
    produces: output_sequence
    description: Moves the first 3 elements to the end of the sequence, shifting the remaining elements to the beginning.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by applying a circular left shift of 3 positions to the input_sequence.
