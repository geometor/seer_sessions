**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected a `List[int]` as input, but it received a single string containing space-separated numbers. This resulted in a `ValueError` because the length check `len(input_sequence)` was performed on the string itself (length 1), not on the list of numbers it represented.

The core transformation logic identified previously (a circular left shift by 3 positions) appears consistent with all provided input/output examples. The strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the input handling within the `transform` function to parse the input string into a list of integers first, perform the rotation on the list, and then format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

*   **Input Format:** All inputs are single strings containing 12 space-separated integers.
*   **Output Format:** All outputs are single strings containing 12 space-separated integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output sequences consistently contain 12 integers.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** In every example, the elements starting from the 4th position (index 3) in the input appear at the beginning of the output, followed by the first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2) of the input. This confirms a circular left shift by 3 positions.

Let's verify the shift for a few examples:

*   **train_1:** `input = [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0]`. Shift left by 3: `[4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`. Matches output.
*   **train_4:** `input = [5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 9, 7, 2, 1]`. Shift left by 3: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 5, 9, 0]`. Matches output.
*   **train_7:** `input = [6, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Shift left by 3: `[9, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]`. Matches output.

The pattern holds true for all provided examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers.
3.  Identify the first 3 integers in the list (at indices 0, 1, 2).
4.  Identify the remaining 9 integers in the list (from index 3 to 11).
5.  Construct a new list by placing the 9 integers (from step 4) first, followed by the 3 integers (from step 3).
6.  Format the new list back into a single string with integers separated by spaces.
7.  Return the formatted string as the output.
