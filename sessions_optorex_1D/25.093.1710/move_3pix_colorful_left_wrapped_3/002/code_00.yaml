objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers # Corrected from string assumption
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers
actions:
  - name: rotate_left_circular
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 3 # Fixed shift amount
    produces: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is derived by performing a circular left rotation of the input_sequence by exactly 3 positions. The elements initially at indices 0, 1, 2 are moved to indices 9, 10, 11 respectively, and all other elements shift 3 positions to the left.
