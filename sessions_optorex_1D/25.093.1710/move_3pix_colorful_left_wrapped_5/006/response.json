The core transformation logic\u2014moving the first three elements of the sequence to the end\u2014appears consistent across all provided training examples based on visual inspection. The strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the function signature and internal handling to accept NumPy arrays directly or convert the input NumPy array to a list before applying the existing slicing and concatenation logic. The underlying transformation rule itself seems correct and does not need fundamental changes.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nTo confirm the input type and structure, let's examine the first training example.\n\n"
