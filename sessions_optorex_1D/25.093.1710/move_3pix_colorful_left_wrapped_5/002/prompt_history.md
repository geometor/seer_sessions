**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of 12 numerical digits, separated by spaces. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the first three elements of the input sequence are relocated to the end of the sequence in the output, while the remaining elements are shifted forward to occupy the initial positions, maintaining their original relative order.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the first three digits of the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining nine digits of the sequence (from the 4th to the 12th digit).
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the remaining nine digits (identified in step 3) in their original relative order.
5.  Append the first three digits (identified in step 2) to the end of the sequence formed in step 4, maintaining their original relative order.
```python
import re

def transform(input_str: str) -> str:
    """
    Moves the first three elements of a space-separated sequence of 12 digits to the end of the sequence, preserving the relative order of both the moved elements and the remaining elements.

    Args:
        input_str: A string containing 12 space-separated digits.

    Returns:
        A string containing the transformed sequence of 12 space-separated digits.
    """

    # Parse the input string into a list of digits (as strings)
    # Using regex to handle potential multiple spaces
    digits = re.findall(r'\d', input_str)

    # Ensure the input has exactly 12 digits
    if len(digits) != 12:
        raise ValueError("Input string must contain exactly 12 digits.")

    # Extract the first three elements
    first_three = digits[:3]

    # Extract the remaining elements (from index 3 to the end)
    remaining = digits[3:]

    # Concatenate the remaining elements followed by the first three
    output_digits = remaining + first_three

    # Format the output list back into a space-separated string
    output_str = " ".join(output_digits)
