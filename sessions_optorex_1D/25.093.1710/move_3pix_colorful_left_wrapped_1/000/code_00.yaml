Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains the same digits as the input, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Left Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The sequence of 12 integers is rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.
    The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the
    output sequence. The elements from index 3 to 11 of the input sequence become
    the elements from index 0 to 8 of the output sequence.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of the first 3 elements is preserved at the end of the output.
  - The relative order of the remaining 9 elements is preserved at the beginning of the output.
