**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results indicate that the submitted code (`code_00.py`) failed to correctly transform the input sequences. In every example, the "Transformed Output" is identical to the "Input", suggesting that the intended transformation (left rotation by 3 positions) was not applied during the test execution.

However, upon re-examination of the input/output pairs for all training and test examples, the originally identified pattern – a cyclic left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions – holds true for *all* cases.

Therefore, the strategy is:
1.  **Confirm Pattern:** The core transformation logic identified previously (left rotation by 3) appears correct based on the problem specification (input/output pairs).
2.  **Acknowledge Execution Failure:** Note that the provided code execution results show a failure, likely due to an implementation error within the `transform` function's integration or execution, rather than a misunderstanding of the required transformation rule.
3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The YAML facts and natural language program should describe the correct left rotation transformation, as this accurately reflects the relationship between the example inputs and outputs. The error lies in the prior code's execution, not the rule itself.
4.  **Metrics:** Report metrics comparing the *expected* output to the *actual (failed)* output from the execution trace to quantify the reported discrepancies.

**Metrics**
The following metrics quantify the difference between the *expected* output and the *actual* output reported in the failed execution trace (where the actual output was erroneously identical to the input). The `diff_count` represents the number of positions where the expected digit differs from the actual reported digit.


``` python
import sys
import io

# Capture stdout
old_stdout = sys.stdout
sys.stdout = captured_stdout = io.StringIO()

def parse_line(line):
    # Handles potential extra whitespace
    return [int(x) for x in line.split()]

def compare_outputs(expected_str, actual_str):
    expected_list = parse_line(expected_str)
    actual_list = parse_line(actual_str)
    diff_count = 0
    # Use max length in case lists have different lengths, though unlikely here
    list_len = max(len(expected_list), len(actual_list))
    for i in range(list_len):
        # Check index bounds and value equality
        if i >= len(expected_list) or i >= len(actual_list) or expected_list[i] != actual_list[i]:
            diff_count += 1
    return diff_count

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Elements: Same digits as the input, rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift_Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The sequence of 12 integers is rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.
    The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the
    output sequence, maintaining their relative order. The elements originally at
    indices 3 through 11 of the input sequence become the elements at indices 0
    through 8 of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
Execution_Issue_Note: >
  The provided execution trace showed the transformation function returning the
  input unchanged. However, analysis of all input/output examples confirms the
  intended transformation is a left rotation by 3 positions. The discrepancy lies
  in the execution/implementation tested, not the underlying task rule.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - `output[i] = input[(i + 3) % 12]` for `i` in `0..11`.
  - The first 3 elements of the input (`input[0:3]`) are moved to the end of the output (`output[9:12]`).
  - The remaining 9 elements of the input (`input[3:12]`) are moved to the beginning of the output (`output[0:9]`).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence, which consists of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the segment containing the first 3 integers (at indices 0, 1, 2).
3.  Identify the segment containing the remaining 9 integers (at indices 3 through 11).
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the second segment (the 9 integers from index 3 onwards) followed by the first segment (the first 3 integers).
5.  Return the newly constructed 12-integer sequence.
