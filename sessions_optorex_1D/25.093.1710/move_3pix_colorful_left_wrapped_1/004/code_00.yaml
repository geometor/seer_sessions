Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Elements: Same digits as the input, rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Left Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift_Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The sequence of 12 integers is rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.
    The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the
    output sequence, maintaining their relative order. The elements originally at
    indices 3 through 11 of the input sequence become the elements at indices 0
    through 8 of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
Execution_Issue_Note: >
  The provided execution trace showed the transformation function returning the
  input unchanged. However, analysis of all input/output examples confirms the
  intended transformation is a left rotation by 3 positions. The discrepancy lies
  in the execution/implementation tested, not the underlying task rule.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - `output[i] = input[(i + 3) % 12]` for `i` in `0..11`.
  - The first 3 elements of the input (`input[0:3]`) are moved to the end of the output (`output[9:12]`).
  - The remaining 9 elements of the input (`input[3:12]`) are moved to the beginning of the output (`output[0:9]`).
