            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate that the submitted code (`code_00.py`) failed to correctly transform the input sequences. In every example, the \"Transformed Output\" is identical to the \"Input\", suggesting that the intended transformation (left rotation by 3 positions) was not applied during the test execution.\n\nHowever, upon re-examination of the input/output pairs for all training and test examples, the originally identified pattern \u2013 a cyclic left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions \u2013 holds true for *all* cases.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is:\n1.  **Confirm Pattern:** The core transformation logic identified previously (left rotation by 3) appears correct based on the problem specification (input/output pairs).\n2.  **Acknowledge Execution Failure:** Note that the provided code execution results show a failure, likely due to an implementation error within the `transform` function's integration or execution, rather than a misunderstanding of the required transformation rule.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The YAML facts and natural language program should describe the correct left rotation transformation, as this accurately reflects the relationship between the example inputs and outputs. The error lies in the prior code's execution, not the rule itself.\n4.  **Metrics:** Report metrics comparing the *expected* output to the *actual (failed)* output from the execution trace to quantify the reported discrepancies.\n\n**Metrics**\nThe following metrics quantify the difference between the *expected* output and the *actual* output reported in the failed execution trace (where the actual output was erroneously identical to the input). The `diff_count` represents the number of positions where the expected digit differs from the actual reported digit.\n\n"
