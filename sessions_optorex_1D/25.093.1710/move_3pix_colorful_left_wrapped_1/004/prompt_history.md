Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 integers, separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain single digits (0-9).
3.  **Transformation:** The output sequence appears to be a rearranged version of the input sequence. Specifically, it looks like a cyclic shift or rotation.
4.  **Consistency:** Comparing all examples, the transformation seems consistent. Let's focus on the first few elements and the last few elements.
    *   `train_1`: `0 0 0` -> `0 0 0` (at the end); `9 7 5` -> `9 7 5` (shifted left)
    *   `train_2`: `1 3 8` -> `1 3 8` (at the end)
    *   `train_3`: `0 0 0` -> `0 0 0` (at the end)
    *   `train_4`: `5 3 5` -> `5 3 5` (at the end)
    *   `train_5`: `0 0 0` -> `0 0 0` (at the end)
    *   `train_6`: `0 7 2` -> `0 7 2` (at the end, but the last two are `7 2`)
    *   `train_7`: `8 6 7` -> `8 6 7` (at the end)
5.  **Pattern Identification:** In every example, the first 3 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order. The remaining 9 elements from the input (elements 4 through 12, or indices 3 through 11) are shifted to the beginning of the output sequence, also maintaining their relative order. This corresponds to a left rotation of the sequence by 3 positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains the same digits as the input, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Left Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The sequence of 12 integers is rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.
    The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the
    output sequence. The elements from index 3 to 11 of the input sequence become
    the elements from index 0 to 8 of the output sequence.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of the first 3 elements is preserved at the end of the output.
  - The relative order of the remaining 9 elements is preserved at the beginning of the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first 3 elements of the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining 9 elements of the sequence (from the 4th element to the 12th).
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the 9 elements identified in step 3, followed by the 3 elements identified in step 2.
