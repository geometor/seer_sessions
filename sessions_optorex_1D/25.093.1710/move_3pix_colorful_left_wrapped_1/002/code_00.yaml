Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List or NumPy Array of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List or NumPy Array of Integers (same as input type)
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains the same digits as the input, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Left Cyclic Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The input sequence (list or array) of 12 integers is rotated cyclically
    to the left by 3 positions.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the output sequence, maintaining relative order.
  - The elements from index 3 to 11 of the input sequence become the elements from index 0 to 8 of the output sequence, maintaining relative order.
