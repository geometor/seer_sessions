**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt failed because it assumed the input would be a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array instead.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) as input directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`parse_input`).
2.  Implement the core rotation logic, which was correctly identified as a left rotation by 3 positions. This can be done using slicing and concatenation on the input array/list.
3.  Ensure the function returns the transformed data in the expected format (likely a NumPy array or list), removing the string formatting step (`format_output`).

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** The execution environment provides the input as a NumPy array.
*   **Output Type:** The expected output is likely also a NumPy array or a list of integers, mirroring the input structure.
*   **Input Length:** All input arrays have a length of 12.
*   **Output Length:** All output arrays have a length of 12.
*   **Transformation:** In all examples, the output array is consistently the input array rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.
    *   `train_1`: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 7 5]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 9 7 5 0 0 0]`
    *   `train_2`: `[1 3 8 0 0 8 9 9 7 7 9 4]` -> `[0 0 8 9 9 7 7 9 4 1 3 8]`
    *   `train_3`: `[0 0 0 0 6 6 3 5 9 9 8 0]` -> `[0 6 6 3 5 9 9 8 0 0 0 0]`
    *   `train_4`: `[5 3 5 1 0 8 9 5 5 7 1 8]` -> `[1 0 8 9 5 5 7 1 8 5 3 5]`
    *   `train_5`: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   `train_6`: `[0 7 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2]`
    *   `train_7`: `[8 6 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 7 3 9]` -> `[5 0 0 0 0 5 7 3 9 8 6 7]`
*   **Element Preservation:** The output contains the same elements as the input, just in a different order. No elements are added, removed, or changed.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Input:
  Type: List or NumPy Array of Integers
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains single digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: List or NumPy Array of Integers (same as input type)
  Length: 12
  Properties: Contains the same digits as the input, but rearranged.
Transformation:
  Action: Left Cyclic Rotation
  Parameters:
    Shift Amount: 3 positions
  Description: >
    The input sequence (list or array) of 12 integers is rotated cyclically
    to the left by 3 positions.
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the output sequence, maintaining relative order.
  - The elements from index 3 to 11 of the input sequence become the elements from index 0 to 8 of the output sequence, maintaining relative order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (which is a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Define the rotation amount as 3.
3.  Extract the sub-sequence starting from index 3 up to the end of the input sequence.
4.  Extract the sub-sequence starting from index 0 up to (but not including) index 3 of the input sequence.
5.  Concatenate the sub-sequence from step 3 followed by the sub-sequence from step 4 to form the output sequence.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.
