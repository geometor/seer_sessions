            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because it assumed the input would be a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array instead.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) as input directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`parse_input`).\n2.  Implement the core rotation logic, which was correctly identified as a left rotation by 3 positions. This can be done using slicing and concatenation on the input array/list.\n3.  Ensure the function returns the transformed data in the expected format (likely a NumPy array or list), removing the string formatting step (`format_output`).\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The execution environment provides the input as a NumPy array.\n*   **Output Type:** The expected output is likely also a NumPy array or a list of integers, mirroring the input structure.\n*   **Input Length:** All input arrays have a length of 12.\n*   **Output Length:** All output arrays have a length of 12.\n*   **Transformation:** In all examples, the output array is consistently the input array rotated cyclically to the left by 3 positions.\n    *   `train_1`: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 7 5]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 9 7 5 0 0 0]`\n    *   `train_2`: `[1 3 8 0 0 8 9 9 7 7 9 4]` -> `[0 0 8 9 9 7 7 9 4 1 3 8]`\n    *   `train_3`: `[0 0 0 0 6 6 3 5 9 9 8 0]` -> `[0 6 6 3 5 9 9 8 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   `train_4`: `[5 3 5 1 0 8 9 5 5 7 1 8]` -> `[1 0 8 9 5 5 7 1 8 5 3 5]`\n    *   `train_5`: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   `train_6`: `[0 7 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2]`\n    *   `train_7`: `[8 6 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 7 3 9]` -> `[5 0 0 0 0 5 7 3 9 8 6 7]`\n*   **Element Preservation:** The output contains the same elements as the input, just in a different order. No elements are added, removed, or changed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
