Input:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  contains:
    - zeros: representing empty space
    - object:
        type: contiguous block
        properties:
          value: non-zero integer (consistent within the block)
          length: variable (number of elements in the block)
          start_index: position of the first element of the block
          end_index: position of the last element of the block
Output:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: derived from input by applying a transformation
Transformation:
  action: shift_right
  target: object (the contiguous block of non-zero integers)
  parameter: shift_distance
  relationship: shift_distance equals the length of the object
  effect:
    - The object moves to a new position.
    - The new start_index = old start_index + shift_distance.
    - The original positions occupied by the object become zeros.
Constraints:
  - The sequence length remains 12.
  - There is only one contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input.
  - The shift operation occurs within the bounds of the sequence (no wrap-around or truncation observed in examples).
