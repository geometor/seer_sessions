Input:
  type: list or 1D NumPy array
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  contains:
    - zeros: representing empty space or background.
    - object:
        type: contiguous block
        properties:
          value: non-zero integer (consistent within the block)
          length: variable (number of elements in the block)
          start_index: position (0-based index) of the first element of the block
          end_index: position (0-based index) of the last element of the block
Output:
  type: 1D NumPy array (as produced by the refined code)
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: derived from input by applying a transformation to the object.
Transformation:
  action: shift_right
  target: object (the contiguous block of non-zero integers)
  parameter: shift_distance
  rule: shift_distance is equal to the length of the object (block).
  effect:
    - The object (block) is moved to a new position in the sequence.
    - The new start_index = old start_index + block_length.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the original block location become zeros.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the new block location take the block's value.
    - All other positions remain zero.
    - Elements shifted beyond the sequence boundary (index >= 12) are discarded.
Constraints:
  - The sequence length remains 12.
  - There is exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in the input.
  - The block is surrounded by zeros (except potentially at the sequence edges).
