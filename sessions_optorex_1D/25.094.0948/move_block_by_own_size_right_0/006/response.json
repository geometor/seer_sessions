            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code, designed to identify a contiguous block of non-zero identical integers and shift it right by its length, failed across all training examples, producing only sequences of zeros. A logical trace of the code against the examples suggests it *should* produce the correct outputs. The `find_block_properties` function appears robust for the given inputs, and the shifting logic correctly calculates the `new_start_index` and places the block.\n\nThe discrepancy between the code's apparent logic and the execution results (all zeros) is puzzling. Potential reasons for this failure *external* to the code's logic might include:\n1.  An error in the execution environment or testing harness that prevented the code from running as intended or incorrectly reported the results.\n2.  A subtle data type mismatch or issue with how the `input_grid` was passed to the `transform` function during testing.\n3.  An unexpected behavior of a NumPy function in the specific testing environment (less likely).\n\nHowever, following the instruction to learn from the *results*, the consistent failure implies that the condition `start_index == -1` was always met within the `transform` function during the test execution. This would happen if `find_block_properties` consistently returned `(-1, 0, 0)`. Despite the trace suggesting otherwise, we will re-verify the core transformation rule based *only* on the input/output pairs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Programmatically re-analyze each input/output pair to confirm the block properties (start index, length, value) and the shift distance.\n2.  Verify if the shift distance consistently equals the block length across all examples.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this verified understanding. The core logic likely remains the same, but we need absolute certainty from the data.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze each example to extract block properties and shift distance.\n\n"
