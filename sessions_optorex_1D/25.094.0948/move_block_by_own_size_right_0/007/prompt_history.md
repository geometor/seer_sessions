## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output are both sequences (or lists) of 12 integers.
Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The zeros act as padding or empty space.
The transformation involves moving this block of non-zero integers within the sequence.
The direction of movement is always to the right.
The distance the block moves appears to be directly related to the number of elements in the block (its length).

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  contains:
    - zeros: representing empty space
    - object:
        type: contiguous block
        properties:
          value: non-zero integer (consistent within the block)
          length: variable (number of elements in the block)
          start_index: position of the first element of the block
          end_index: position of the last element of the block
Output:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: derived from input by applying a transformation
Transformation:
  action: shift_right
  target: object (the contiguous block of non-zero integers)
  parameter: shift_distance
  relationship: shift_distance equals the length of the object
  effect:
    - The object moves to a new position.
    - The new start_index = old start_index + shift_distance.
    - The original positions occupied by the object become zeros.
Constraints:
  - The sequence length remains 12.
  - There is only one contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input.
  - The shift operation occurs within the bounds of the sequence (no wrap-around or truncation observed in examples).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Object:** Scan the input sequence to find the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. Note its value, its starting index, and its length (number of elements).
2.  **Calculate Shift Distance:** Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
3.  **Create Output Sequence:** Initialize a new sequence of 12 zeros.
4.  **Place Shifted Object:** Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding the shift distance to the original starting index. Copy the identified block of non-zero integers into the new sequence starting at this new calculated index.
5.  **Return Output:** The resulting sequence is the output.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code, designed to identify a contiguous block of non-zero identical integers and shift it right by its length, failed across all training examples, producing only sequences of zeros. A logical trace of the code against the examples suggests it *should* produce the correct outputs. The `find_block_properties` function appears robust for the given inputs, and the shifting logic correctly calculates the `new_start_index` and places the block.

The discrepancy between the code's apparent logic and the execution results (all zeros) is puzzling. Potential reasons for this failure *external* to the code's logic might include:
1.  An error in the execution environment or testing harness that prevented the code from running as intended or incorrectly reported the results.
2.  A subtle data type mismatch or issue with how the `input_grid` was passed to the `transform` function during testing.
3.  An unexpected behavior of a NumPy function in the specific testing environment (less likely).

However, following the instruction to learn from the *results*, the consistent failure implies that the condition `start_index == -1` was always met within the `transform` function during the test execution. This would happen if `find_block_properties` consistently returned `(-1, 0, 0)`. Despite the trace suggesting otherwise, we will re-verify the core transformation rule based *only* on the input/output pairs.

**Strategy:**
1.  Programmatically re-analyze each input/output pair to confirm the block properties (start index, length, value) and the shift distance.
2.  Verify if the shift distance consistently equals the block length across all examples.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this verified understanding. The core logic likely remains the same, but we need absolute certainty from the data.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze each example to extract block properties and shift distance.

```
The analysis confirms that for every example, the transformation involves:
1.  Identifying a single, contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
2.  Shifting this block to the right.
3.  The distance of the shift is exactly equal to the length (number of elements) of the block.

This confirms the initial understanding and the logic implemented in the provided Python code was correct. The failure reported during execution remains unexplained by the code's logic itself.

## Updated YAML Facts


```yaml
Input:
  type: list or 1D NumPy array
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  contains:
    - zeros: representing empty space or background.
    - object:
        type: contiguous block
        properties:
          value: non-zero integer (consistent within the block)
          length: variable (number of elements in the block)
          start_index: position (0-based index) of the first element of the block
          end_index: position (0-based index) of the last element of the block
Output:
  type: 1D NumPy array (as produced by the refined code)
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  structure: derived from input by applying a transformation to the object.
Transformation:
  action: shift_right
  target: object (the contiguous block of non-zero integers)
  parameter: shift_distance
  rule: shift_distance is equal to the length of the object (block).
  effect:
    - The object (block) is moved to a new position in the sequence.
    - The new start_index = old start_index + block_length.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the original block location become zeros.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the new block location take the block's value.
    - All other positions remain zero.
    - Elements shifted beyond the sequence boundary (index >= 12) are discarded.
Constraints:
  - The sequence length remains 12.
  - There is exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in the input.
  - The block is surrounded by zeros (except potentially at the sequence edges).
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Block:** Scan the input sequence (list or array of 12 integers) to locate the single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. Record its starting index, its length (number of elements), and the integer value of its elements. If no such block exists, return a sequence of 12 zeros.
2.  **Calculate Shift Distance:** The distance to shift the block is equal to its length.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the new starting index for the block by adding the shift distance (block length) to the original starting index.
5.  **Place Shifted Block:** Copy the block's elements (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure that elements are only placed within the bounds of the 12-element sequence (indices 0 through 11); any part of the block that would be shifted beyond index 11 is discarded.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the newly created sequence containing the shifted block and zeros elsewhere.
