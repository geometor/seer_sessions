*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**
    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.
    *   The execution error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array).
    *   The strategy is to adapt the `transform` function to directly accept and process a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) and return a NumPy array (or list) of the same type, eliminating the string parsing and formatting steps. The internal logic for finding and shifting the block will be retained but applied directly to the array/list data structure.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    The primary metric to confirm is the input data type. The error message confirms it's `numpy.ndarray`. Let's re-evaluate the core logic parameters for each training example assuming array input.

    *   **Train 1:** Input `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[1]` at index 2. Length=1. New start index = 2 + 1 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 2:** Input `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[7, 7, 7, 7]` at index 1. Length=4. New start index = 1 + 4 = 5. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 3:** Input `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4, 4]` at index 1. Length=3. New start index = 1 + 3 = 4. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 4:** Input `[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6]` at index 0. Length=3. New start index = 0 + 3 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 5:** Input `[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[2]` at index 1. Length=1. New start index = 1 + 1 = 2. Output `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 6:** Input `[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4, 4, 4]` at index 0. Length=4. New start index = 0 + 4 = 4. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 7:** Input `[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4]` at index 1. Length=2. New start index = 1 + 2 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

    The logic consistently holds for all examples. No code execution is needed to verify these simple index/length calculations. The issue lies solely in the function's input/output signature.

          Calculate the new start index for the block by adding the block's length

          into the new array at this calculated new start index. Ensure placement
          does not exceed array bounds.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a 1D NumPy array of integers (`input_array`).
    2.  Initialize an `output_array` of the same length as `input_array`, filled with zeros.
    3.  Scan `input_array` to find the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`).
    4.  If no non-zero element is found (`start_index` remains unset or is -1), return the initialized `output_array`.
    5.  If a non-zero element is found, continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero elements. Determine the `block_length` and extract the `block_elements`.
    6.  Calculate the target starting position for the block in the `output_array`: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
    7.  Check if `new_start_index` is within the bounds of the `output_array`.
    8.  If it is within bounds, copy the `block_elements` into the `output_array` starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that the copy operation does not write past the end of the `output_array` (handle potential edge cases where the shifted block might partially or fully fall off the end, although examples suggest this won't happen with valid inputs according to the rule).
    9.  Return the `output_array`.
