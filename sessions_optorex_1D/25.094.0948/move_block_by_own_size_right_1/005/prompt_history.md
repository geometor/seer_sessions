*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero digits. The remaining elements are zeros.
    *   The non-zero digits within the block are always the same value in the examples, but the core logic seems to depend on them being non-zero, not necessarily identical.
    *   The core transformation involves shifting the non-zero block to the right.
    *   The amount of the shift appears directly related to the number of elements in the non-zero block.
    *   Zeros act as placeholders or empty space around the non-zero block.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output sequence as a sequence of zeros with the same length as the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its index as `start_index`.
    3.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. Record the index of the last non-zero digit in the block as `end_index`.
    4.  If no non-zero digits are found, the output sequence remains all zeros.
    5.  If a non-zero block is found:
        a.  Extract the sub-sequence (the block) from the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` inclusive.
        b.  Calculate the length of the block: `block_length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
        c.  Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
        d.  Place the extracted block into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The provided code failed because it assumed the input was a 1D NumPy array (`[0, 0, 1, ...]`), while the execution environment likely supplied a 2D NumPy array representing a grid, even if it only contained a single row (`[[0, 0, 1, ...]]`).
    *   Attempting to perform boolean comparisons (like `element != 0`) on an entire row array instead of individual elements caused the "ambiguous truth value" error.
    *   The core transformation logic (find non-zero block, shift right by block length) appears correct based on the examples.
    *   The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle a 2D grid input, focusing operations on the first (and likely only) row.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    *   **Assumption:** The input is consistently a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N), where N is the number of elements shown in the string representation.
    *   **Verification:** Simulating this structure resolves the ambiguity error. The logic operates as follows:
        *   Extract the first row from the input grid.
        *   Apply the `find_non_zero_block` logic to this 1D row.
        *   Create an output grid of the same shape, initialized to zeros.
        *   Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block within the row (`original_start_index + block_length`).
        *   Place the `block_elements` into the first row of the output grid at the `new_start_index`.
    *   This process correctly reproduces the output for all training examples when applied to the assumed 2D grid input structure. For instance:
        *   `train_1`: Input `[[0, 0, 1, ...]]`, block `[1]` at index 2, length 1. New start index 2+1=3. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 1, ...]]`.
        *   `train_2`: Input `[[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0 ...]]`, block `[7, 7, 7, 7]` at index 1, length 4. New start index 1+4=5. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0 ...]]`.
        *   `train_4`: Input `[[6, 6, 6, 0 ...]]`, block `[6, 6, 6]` at index 0, length 3. New start index 0+3=3. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0 ...]]`.

        variable: shift_amount (columns)
        determined_by: length of non_zero_block
        description: The number of columns the block is shifted to the right is equal to the length (number of columns) of the block itself.
      - type: positional
        element: non_zero_block in output_grid's first row
        position: starts at column (original_start_column_index + block_length)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid, which will have exactly one row.
    2.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros.
    3.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
    4.  Scan this input row to find the first non-zero digit. Record its column index as `start_column_index`.
    5.  Continue scanning the row from `start_column_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. Record the column index of the last non-zero digit in the block as `end_column_index`.
    6.  If no non-zero digits are found in the row, the output grid remains all zeros. Return the output grid.
    7.  If a non-zero block is found:
        a.  Extract the sub-sequence of elements (the block) from the input row, from `start_column_index` to `end_column_index` inclusive.
        b.  Calculate the length of the block: `block_length = end_column_index - start_column_index + 1`.
        c.  Calculate the new starting column position for the block in the output grid's first row: `new_start_column_index = start_column_index + block_length`.
        d.  Place the extracted block elements into the first row of the output grid, starting at `new_start_column_index`. Ensure that the placement does not exceed the grid's column boundaries (truncate the block if necessary, although examples suggest this won't happen).
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
