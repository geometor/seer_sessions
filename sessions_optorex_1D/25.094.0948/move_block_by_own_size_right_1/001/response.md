"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits by identifying the single contiguous block 
of non-zero digits and shifting it to the right. The amount of the shift is 
equal to the length of the non-zero block itself. Zeros act as placeholders.

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Find the start index and length of the contiguous non-zero block.
3.  Extract the elements of the block.
4.  If a block is found:
    a. Calculate the new starting position for the block by adding its original 
       start index and its length.
    b. Create an output list initialized with zeros, having the same length as the input.
    c. Place the extracted block into the output list at the calculated new start position.
5.  If no non-zero block is found, the output list remains all zeros.
6.  Format the output list back into a space-separated string.
