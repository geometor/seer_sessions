*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero digits. The remaining elements are zeros.
    *   The non-zero digits within the block are always the same value in the examples, but the core logic seems to depend on them being non-zero, not necessarily identical.
    *   The core transformation involves shifting the non-zero block to the right.
    *   The amount of the shift appears directly related to the number of elements in the non-zero block.
    *   Zeros act as placeholders or empty space around the non-zero block.

        description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the input_sequence containing only non-zero digits.
        properties:
          - start_index: The index of the first digit in the block within the input_sequence.
          - length: The number of digits in the block.
          - elements: The sequence of non-zero digits forming the block.
    
    actions:
      - name: identify_block
        inputs: input_sequence
        outputs: non_zero_block (including start_index, length, elements)
        description: Find the start index and end index of the contiguous sequence of non-zero digits. Extract the block and determine its length.
      - name: shift_block
        inputs: 
          - non_zero_block (start_index, length, elements)
          - original_sequence_length
        outputs: output_sequence
        description: >
          Create a new sequence of the original length, filled with zeros.
          Calculate the new start index for the block by adding the block's length
          to its original start index. Place the elements of the non_zero_block 
          into the new sequence at this calculated new start index.
    
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        input: input_sequence
        output: output_sequence
        rule: The non_zero_block identified in the input_sequence is shifted rightwards.
      - type: dependency
        variable: shift_amount
        determined_by: length of non_zero_block
        description: The number of positions the block is shifted to the right is equal to the length of the block itself.
      - type: positional
        element: non_zero_block in output_sequence
        position: starts at (original_start_index + block_length)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output sequence as a sequence of zeros with the same length as the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its index as `start_index`.
    3.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. Record the index of the last non-zero digit in the block as `end_index`.
    4.  If no non-zero digits are found, the output sequence remains all zeros.
    5.  If a non-zero block is found:
        a.  Extract the sub-sequence (the block) from the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` inclusive.
        b.  Calculate the length of the block: `block_length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
        c.  Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
        d.  Place the extracted block into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
