The logic operates as follows:\n        *   Extract the first row from the input grid.\n        *   Apply the `find_non_zero_block` logic to this 1D row.\n        *   Create an output grid of the same shape, initialized to zeros.\n        *   Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block within the row (`original_start_index + block_length`).\n        *   Place the `block_elements` into the first row of the output grid at the `new_start_index`.\n    *   This process correctly reproduces the output for all training examples when applied to the assumed 2D grid input structure. For instance:\n        *   `train_1`: Input `[[0, 0, 1, ...]]`, block `[1]` at index 2, length 1. New start index 2+1=3. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 1, ...]]`.\n        *   `train_2`: Input `[[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0 ...]]`, block `[7, 7, 7, 7]` at index 1, length 4. New start index 1+4=5. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0 ...]]`.\n        *   `train_4`: Input `[[6, 6, 6, 0 ...]]`, block `[6, 6, 6]` at index 0, length 3. New start index 0+3=3. Output `[[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0 ...]]`.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
