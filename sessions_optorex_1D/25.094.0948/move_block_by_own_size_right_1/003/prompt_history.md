*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero digits. The remaining elements are zeros.
    *   The non-zero digits within the block are always the same value in the examples, but the core logic seems to depend on them being non-zero, not necessarily identical.
    *   The core transformation involves shifting the non-zero block to the right.
    *   The amount of the shift appears directly related to the number of elements in the non-zero block.
    *   Zeros act as placeholders or empty space around the non-zero block.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**
    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.
    *   The execution error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array).
    *   The strategy is to adapt the `transform` function to directly accept and process a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) and return a NumPy array (or list) of the same type, eliminating the string parsing and formatting steps. The internal logic for finding and shifting the block will be retained but applied directly to the array/list data structure.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    The primary metric to confirm is the input data type. The error message confirms it's `numpy.ndarray`. Let's re-evaluate the core logic parameters for each training example assuming array input.

    *   **Train 1:** Input `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[1]` at index 2. Length=1. New start index = 2 + 1 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 2:** Input `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[7, 7, 7, 7]` at index 1. Length=4. New start index = 1 + 4 = 5. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 3:** Input `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4, 4]` at index 1. Length=3. New start index = 1 + 3 = 4. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 4:** Input `[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6]` at index 0. Length=3. New start index = 0 + 3 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 5:** Input `[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[2]` at index 1. Length=1. New start index = 1 + 1 = 2. Output `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 6:** Input `[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4, 4, 4]` at index 0. Length=4. New start index = 0 + 4 = 4. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   **Train 7:** Input `[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[4, 4]` at index 1. Length=2. New start index = 1 + 2 = 3. Output `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

    The logic consistently holds for all examples. No code execution is needed to verify these simple index/length calculations. The issue lies solely in the function's input/output signature.
