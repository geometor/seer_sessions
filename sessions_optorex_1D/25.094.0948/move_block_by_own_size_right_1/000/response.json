The remaining elements are zeros.\n    *   The non-zero digits within the block are always the same value in the examples, but the core logic seems to depend on them being non-zero, not necessarily identical.\n    *   The core transformation involves shifting the non-zero block to the right.\n    *   The amount of the shift appears directly related to the number of elements in the non-zero block.\n    *   Zeros act as placeholders or empty space around the non-zero block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
