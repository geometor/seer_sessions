*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 1-dimensional sequences (or lists) of integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output.
    *   The non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.

*   **YAML Documentation of Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, length, and starting index.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    4.  Copy the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new index.
    5.  Return the modified output sequence.

*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed because it was based on an incorrect assumption derived from only the first example. The initial hypothesis was that the non-zero block always shifts 3 positions to the right. However, analysis of subsequent examples reveals that the shift amount is not fixed.
    *   The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that a NumPy array was used in a boolean context where a single True/False value was expected. This usually happens in `if` conditions or logical operations. While the underlying cause of this specific runtime error needs fixing in the *coder* phase (likely ensuring comparisons happen element-wise, even if the input is already an array), the *dreamer* phase must first correct the fundamental logic of the transformation rule.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Re-analyze all training examples to find the correct pattern for the shift amount.
        2.  Use code execution to verify the pattern by extracting metrics (block start, length, value, and shift amount) for each example.
        3.  Update the YAML documentation and the natural language program to reflect the revised understanding of the transformation rule.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Executing code to analyze each example's input and output to determine block properties and the actual shift applied.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    2.  Determine the properties of this block: its digit value, its length, and its starting index.
    3.  Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the determined length of the block.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding the shift amount (the block's length) to its original starting index.
    5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    6.  Check if the calculated new starting index and the block's length allow the block to fit entirely within the bounds of the output sequence.
    7.  If the block fits, copy the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new index.
    8.  If the block does not fit (i.e., would extend beyond the sequence length), leave the output sequence as zeros in that region.
    9.  Return the resulting output sequence.
