```python
"""
Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 1D sequence 
to the right by an amount equal to the block's length. The input might be 
a list or a NumPy array, and the output should match the input type and size, 
with the original block positions replaced by zeros. If the shift causes the 
block to extend beyond the sequence boundaries, it is omitted from the output.
