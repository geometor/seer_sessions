*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 1-dimensional sequences (or lists) of integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output.
    *   The non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, length, and starting index.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    4.  Copy the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new index.
    5.  Return the modified output sequence.
