*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 1-dimensional sequences (or lists) of integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output.
    *   The non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous code failed execution on all examples, reporting a NumPy error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error often arises when an `if` statement or boolean context receives a boolean array instead of a single `True`/`False`. While testing the block finding logic independently did not reproduce this error, it suggests a potential issue in how NumPy arrays were handled within the original `transform` function, possibly during comparison or assignment operations.
    *   Crucially, a detailed review of all input/output pairs revealed that the initial hypothesis of a *fixed* shift (by 3 positions) was incorrect. The actual transformation rule involves a *variable* shift.
    *   The analysis shows a consistent pattern: the contiguous block of non-zero identical digits is shifted to the right by an amount equal to the length of the block itself.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   The primary goal is to correct the understanding of the transformation rule.
    *   The Natural Language Program and supporting YAML documentation must be updated to reflect that the shift amount is determined by the length of the identified non-zero block.
    *   While the exact cause of the NumPy error in the previous code execution is unclear without the specific execution context, the corrected logic (using block length for shift) should be the basis for the next coding attempt. The coder should be mindful of potential NumPy pitfalls during implementation.

*   **Metrics:**
    The following table summarizes the properties of the non-zero block and the observed shift for each training example:

    7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
