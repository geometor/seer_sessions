*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 1-dimensional sequences (or lists) of integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output.
    *   The non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial analysis incorrectly identified the shift amount as a fixed value of 3. Re-evaluation of the examples reveals the shift amount is variable.
    *   The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the input data is being handled as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists, within the testing environment or the provided code stub. The comparison logic or conditional checks in the previous code attempt likely caused this when applied directly to a multi-element array.
    *   The core task remains identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it right within a sequence of zeros. The key is to correctly determine the *magnitude* of the shift.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the input and output positions of the non-zero block in *all* examples to find the correct rule for the shift amount.
    2.  Use `tool_code` to calculate the block properties (start index, length, value) and the actual shift amount for each training example to confirm the revised rule.
    3.  Update the YAML documentation and Natural Language Program to reflect the correct shift rule.
    4.  Ensure the Natural Language Program implicitly handles potential NumPy array inputs or is clear that it assumes list inputs, leaving NumPy handling to the coder phase.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's analyze each training example to find the block properties and the shift amount.
