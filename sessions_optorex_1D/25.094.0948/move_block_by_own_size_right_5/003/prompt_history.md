*   **Perception:** The input and output are sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings. Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence also contains the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right, and surrounded by zeros. The amount of the rightward shift appears to be equal to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the sequence remains constant.

*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it rightward by a distance equal to its length. However, it fundamentally misinterpreted the input data type. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` reveals that the input is provided as a NumPy array, not a space-separated string. The strategy is to adapt the process to work directly with NumPy arrays, removing the incorrect string parsing and formatting steps. The core logic of identifying the block, calculating the new position, and constructing the output array remains valid.

*   **Metrics:**
