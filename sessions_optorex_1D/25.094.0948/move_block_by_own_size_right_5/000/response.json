Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence also contains the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right, and surrounded by zeros. The amount of the rightward shift appears to be equal to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the sequence remains constant.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
