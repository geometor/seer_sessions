*   **Perception:** The input and output are sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings. Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence also contains the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right, and surrounded by zeros. The amount of the rightward shift appears to be equal to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the sequence remains constant.

*   **Facts:**

        properties:
          - length: Integer (e.g., 12)
          - elements: Digits (0-9)

            constraints: Exactly one such block exists in the input.
            attributes:
              - value: The non-zero digit (e.g., 9, 7, 8, 1, 4, 2)
              - length: The number of digits in the block (Integer > 0)
              - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - type: zero_block
            description: Consists of the digit 0. Fills the space around the non_zero_block.
      - object: input_sequence
        description: The initial sequence containing one non_zero_block.
      - object: output_sequence
        description: The resulting sequence after transformation.
        properties:
          - same length as input_sequence
          - contains the identical non_zero_block from the input, but shifted.
          - filled with zeros elsewhere.

        description: Determine the number of positions to shift the block.
        inputs: block_length
        outputs: shift_amount (equal to block_length)
      - action: calculate_new_position
        description: Determine the new starting index for the block in the output sequence.
        inputs:
          - block_start_index

        outputs: new_start_index (block_start_index + shift_amount)
      - action: construct_output
        description: Create the output_sequence.
        steps:
          - Initialize a sequence of the same length as the input with all zeros.
          - Place the identified non_zero_block (using block_value and block_length) starting at the calculated new_start_index.
    relationships:
      - relationship: shift_equals_length
        description: The amount the non_zero_block is shifted to the right is equal to its own length.
      - relationship: block_preservation
        description: The value and length of the non_zero_block remain unchanged from input to output.
      - relationship: length_preservation
        description: The total length of the sequence remains unchanged.
