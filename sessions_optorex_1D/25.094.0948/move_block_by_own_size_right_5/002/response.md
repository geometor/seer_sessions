*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: locating a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it rightward by a distance equal to its length. However, it fundamentally misinterpreted the input data type. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` reveals that the input is provided as a NumPy array, not a space-separated string. The strategy is to adapt the process to work directly with NumPy arrays, removing the incorrect string parsing and formatting steps. The core logic of identifying the block, calculating the new position, and constructing the output array remains valid.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a NumPy array of integers.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input array. Determine its value, its length, and its starting index.
    3.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output array by adding the block's length to its original starting index.
    4.  Create a new NumPy array of the same length as the input array, initially filled entirely with zeros.
    5.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers (value and length) into the new array, starting at the calculated target starting index.
    6.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
