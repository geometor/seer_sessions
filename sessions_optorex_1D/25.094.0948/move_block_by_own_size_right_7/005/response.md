"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by finding the single contiguous block of 
identical non-zero digits and shifting it to the right. The distance of the shift 
is equal to the length of the non-zero block itself. The rest of the sequence 
is filled with zeros. Assumes the input represents a 1D sequence, potentially nested 
within a single-row 2D structure.
