Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** All example sequences (input and output) have a length of 12 elements.
3.  **Elements:** The sequences contain the digit 0 and other non-zero digits (3, 4, 7, 8).
4.  **Structure:** In each input and output sequence, there is exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The rest of the elements are zeros.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a change in the position of the non-zero block. The block itself (the digits and their order/count) remains unchanged. The surrounding zeros effectively "fill in" the space.
6.  **Movement Pattern:** The non-zero block always shifts to the right.
7.  **Shift Distance:** Comparing the starting index of the block in the input and output reveals a pattern:
    *   train_1: `3 3` (length 2) starts at index 7, moves to index 9 (shift = 2).
    *   train_2: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) starts at index 3, moves to index 7 (shift = 4).
    *   train_3: `4 4` (length 2) starts at index 2, moves to index 4 (shift = 2).
    *   train_4: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) starts at index 0, moves to index 4 (shift = 4).
    *   train_5: `8 8 8` (length 3) starts at index 5, moves to index 8 (shift = 3).
    *   train_6: `4` (length 1) starts at index 9, moves to index 10 (shift = 1).
    *   train_7: `8 8 8 8` (length 4) starts at index 2, moves to index 6 (shift = 4).
    The distance the block shifts to the right is equal to the length of the block itself.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of digits within a sequence.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples).
  Content: Primarily zeros (background) with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the object).

Output:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Length: Same as input.
  Content: Same elements as input (same non-zero block, same number of zeros), but rearranged.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - elements: list of integers
      - length: integer (e.g., 12)
  - Name: BackgroundElement
    Properties:
      - value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - value: integer (non-zero digit)
      - length: integer (number of times the digit repeats contiguously)
      - start_index_input: integer (position where the block begins in the input)
      - start_index_output: integer (position where the block begins in the output)

Relationships:
  - The Sequence contains one NonZeroBlock and multiple BackgroundElements.
  - The NonZeroBlock in the output is identical in value and length to the NonZeroBlock in the input.
  - The number of BackgroundElements is conserved between input and output.

Actions:
  - Identify the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence (value, length, start_index_input).
  - Calculate the start_index_output by adding the length of the NonZeroBlock to its start_index_input.
  - Construct the output Sequence:
    - Initialize with BackgroundElements (zeros).
    - Place the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output.

Constraint: Assumes exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits exists in the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Find the first non-zero number in the sequence. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block. Record its starting index and its value.
3.  Determine the length of this contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the block's length to its starting index found in step 2.
5.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
6.  Copy the identified non-zero block (using its value and length) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index.
7.  Output the new sequence.
