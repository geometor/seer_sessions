The rest of the elements are zeros.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a change in the position of the non-zero block. The block itself (the digits and their order/count) remains unchanged. The surrounding zeros effectively \"fill in\" the space.\n6.  **Movement Pattern:** The non-zero block always shifts to the right.\n7.  **Shift Distance:** Comparing the starting index of the block in the input and output reveals a pattern:\n    *   train_1: `3 3` (length 2) starts at index 7, moves to index 9 (shift = 2).\n    *   train_2: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) starts at index 3, moves to index 7 (shift = 4).\n    *   train_3: `4 4` (length 2) starts at index 2, moves to index 4 (shift = 2).\n    *   train_4: `7 7 7 7` (length 4) starts at index 0, moves to index 4 (shift = 4).\n    *   train_5: `8 8 8` (length 3) starts at index 5, moves to index 8 (shift = 3).\n    *   train_6: `4` (length 1) starts at index 9, moves to index 10 (shift = 1).\n    *   train_7: `8 8 8 8` (length 4) starts at index 2, moves to index 6 (shift = 4).\n    The distance the block shifts to the right is equal to the length of the block itself.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
