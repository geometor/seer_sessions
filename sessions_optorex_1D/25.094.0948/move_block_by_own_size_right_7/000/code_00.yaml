Task: Shift a block of digits within a sequence.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples).
  Content: Primarily zeros (background) with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the object).

Output:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Length: Same as input.
  Content: Same elements as input (same non-zero block, same number of zeros), but rearranged.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - elements: list of integers
      - length: integer (e.g., 12)
  - Name: BackgroundElement
    Properties:
      - value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - value: integer (non-zero digit)
      - length: integer (number of times the digit repeats contiguously)
      - start_index_input: integer (position where the block begins in the input)
      - start_index_output: integer (position where the block begins in the output)

Relationships:
  - The Sequence contains one NonZeroBlock and multiple BackgroundElements.
  - The NonZeroBlock in the output is identical in value and length to the NonZeroBlock in the input.
  - The number of BackgroundElements is conserved between input and output.

Actions:
  - Identify the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence (value, length, start_index_input).
  - Calculate the start_index_output by adding the length of the NonZeroBlock to its start_index_input.
  - Construct the output Sequence:
    - Initialize with BackgroundElements (zeros).
    - Place the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output.

Constraint: Assumes exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits exists in the input.
