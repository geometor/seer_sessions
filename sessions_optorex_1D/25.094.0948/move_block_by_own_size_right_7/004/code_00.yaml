Task: Shift a block of digits within a 1D sequence.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers (assumed 1-dimensional).
  Represented As: Might be passed as a list, 1D NumPy array, or potentially a 2D array with one row in the execution environment.
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples).
  Content: Primarily zeros (background) with exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the object).

Output:
  Type: Sequence of integers (1-dimensional).
  Length: Same as input.
  Content: Same elements as input (same non-zero block, same number of zeros), but rearranged.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - elements: list or array of integers
      - length: integer (e.g., 12)
  - Name: BackgroundElement
    Properties:
      - value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - value: integer (the non-zero digit)
      - length: integer (number of times the digit repeats contiguously)
      - start_index_input: integer (index where the block begins in the input sequence)
      - start_index_output: integer (index where the block begins in the output sequence)

Relationships:
  - The Sequence contains one NonZeroBlock and multiple BackgroundElements.
  - The NonZeroBlock in the output has the same value and length as in the input.
  - The number of BackgroundElements is conserved.
  - start_index_output = start_index_input + length (of NonZeroBlock).

Actions:
  - Parse the input, ensuring it's treated as a 1D sequence of integers (handle potential 2D single-row input if necessary).
  - Identify the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence (find its value, length, and start_index_input).
  - Calculate the start_index_output using the formula: start_index_input + length.
  - Construct the output Sequence:
    - Initialize a 1D sequence of the same length with BackgroundElements (zeros).
    - Place the identified NonZeroBlock (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated start_index_output. Handle potential boundary conditions (e.g., ensure writing doesn't exceed sequence length).

Constraint: Assumes exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits exists in the input. Assumes input represents a 1D sequence.
