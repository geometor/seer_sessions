            "text": "**Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified from the execution results is an input type mismatch. The previous `transform` function expected a space-separated string as input based on the visual representation in the prompt. However, the execution environment passed a `numpy.ndarray` object, causing the `.split()` method call to fail.\n\nThe underlying transformation logic (identifying the non-zero block and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the examples. The strategy for resolution is to modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step. The core logic for finding and shifting the block can remain largely the same, operating on list/array indices and elements.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe key metrics derived from the examples remain consistent, even when treating the input/output as sequences of integers rather than strings:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                                | Output Sequence                               | Block Value | Block Length | Block Start (Input) | Block Start (Output) | Shift Distance |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0]`                   | 3           | 2            | 7                   | 9                    | 2              |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0]`                   | 7           | 4            | 3                   | 7                    | 4              |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | 4           | 2            | 2                   | 4                    | 2              |\n| train_4 | `[7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`                   | 7           | 4            | 0                   | 4                    | 4              |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]`                   | 8           | 3            | 5                   | 8                    | 3              |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]`                   | 4           | 1            | 9                   | 10                   | 1              |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0]`                   | 8           | 4            | 2                   | 6                    | 4              |\n\nThe relationship `Block Start (Output) = Block Start (Input) + Block Length` holds true for all examples.
