*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both linear sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), acting as a background or empty space.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits. In some cases, the block might consist of only one digit.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same non-zero block as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift (movement) of this non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The amount and direction of the shift appear consistent across examples. Specifically, the block moves to the right.
    *   The shift distance seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself, namely its length.

    Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
    Objects:

        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - length: 12

      - name: NonZeroBlock
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - elements: Identical non-zero integers
          - length: Variable (number of elements in the block)
          - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
    Relationships:
      - The Output Sequence is derived from the Input Sequence.
      - The NonZeroBlock exists within both the Input and Output Sequences.
    Action:
      - name: Shift Block
        input: Input Sequence
        output: Output Sequence
        steps:
          - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the Input Sequence (find its elements, start_index_input, and length).
          - Calculate the start_index_output based on the start_index_input and the length of the NonZeroBlock.
          - Construct the Output Sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output, filling the rest with zeros.
    Rule:
      - The start_index_output is calculated as: start_index_input + length of NonZeroBlock.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block (`start_index_input`).
    4.  If no non-zero integer is found, the input consists only of zeros; return the initialized output sequence (which is also all zeros).
    5.  Determine the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers starting from `start_index_input`. Record the value of the digit and the length of this block (`block_length`).
    6.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output sequence (`start_index_output`) by adding the `start_index_input` and the `block_length`.
    7.  Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated `start_index_output`.
    8.  Return the resulting output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (finding a non-zero block and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on visually inspecting the input/output pairs. The failures reported (`TypeError: Input must be a list of integers.`) strongly suggest an issue with how the `transform` function handles the input data structure. The examples were presented as strings of space-separated integers, but the execution environment likely passes the input as a structured object, probably a list of lists (representing a grid, even if it's just 1xN). The previous code assumed a flat list (`List[int]`) rather than a grid (`List[List[int]]`).

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to expect a grid (list of lists) as input, extract the relevant row (likely the first and only row), apply the existing block-finding and shifting logic to that row, and then return the result in the same grid format (a list containing the modified row).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the structure and key properties of each training example to confirm the pattern. We will treat the input/output strings as representing single rows in a grid.

The metrics confirm that for all training examples:
*   The input and output sequences have a length of 12.
*   The input contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
*   The output contains the same block (identical value and length).
*   The rule `output_block_start = input_block_start + input_block_length` holds true for all examples.

This reinforces the initial logic but highlights the need to adapt the code to handle the grid input format.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a single-row grid.
Input_Format: List[List[int]] (Grid, typically 1xN)
Output_Format: List[List[int]] (Grid, same dimensions as input)
Objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: Typically 1
      - columns: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: Integers
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: Same as InputGrid
      - columns: Same as InputGrid
      - elements: Integers (derived from InputGrid)
  - name: GridRow
    type: List[int]
    description: A single row extracted from the grid, containing the data to be transformed.
  - name: NonZeroBlock
    type: Concept
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero integers within a GridRow.
    properties:
      - value: The integer value of the elements in the block.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - start_index_input: The starting index of the block within the input GridRow.
      - start_index_output: The calculated starting index of the block within the output GridRow.
Relationships:
  - The OutputGrid is derived from the InputGrid.
  - The transformation primarily operates on the first (and likely only) row of the InputGrid.
  - The NonZeroBlock exists in the input GridRow and is placed into the output GridRow.
Action:
  - name: Shift Block in Row
    input: InputGrid
    output: OutputGrid
    steps:
      - Extract the first row from the InputGrid (assume it's the target row).
      - Identify the NonZeroBlock within this row (find its value, start_index_input, and length).
      - If no NonZeroBlock exists, create an OutputGrid of the same dimensions filled with zeros.
      - Calculate the target start_index_output for the block in the output row using the rule: start_index_output = start_index_input + length.
      - Create an output row (List[int]) of the same length as the input row, initialized with zeros.
      - Place the NonZeroBlock (using its value and length) into the output row starting at the calculated start_index_output. Handle boundary conditions (if the block placement extends beyond the row length, truncate it).
      - Construct the OutputGrid by placing the modified row within a list.
Rule:
  - The starting index of the NonZeroBlock in the output row is calculated as: `start_index_output = start_index_input + length_of_NonZeroBlock`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid (assumed to be a list containing a single list of 12 integers).
2.  Extract the first row from the input grid. Let this be the `input_sequence`.
3.  Determine the length of the `input_sequence` (e.g., 12).
4.  Initialize an `output_sequence` as a list of zeros with the same length.
5.  Scan the `input_sequence` to find the first non-zero integer. Record its index as `start_index_input` and its value as `block_value`.
6.  If no non-zero integer is found, the `input_sequence` consists only of zeros. Proceed to step 10.
7.  Starting from `start_index_input`, count the number of consecutive elements in `input_sequence` that are equal to `block_value`. Record this count as `block_length`.
8.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` (`start_index_output`) by adding `start_index_input` and `block_length`.
9.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
    *   Calculate the target index in the output: `current_output_index = start_index_output + i`.
    *   If `current_output_index` is within the valid bounds (0 to length-1) of the `output_sequence`, set the element at `output_sequence[current_output_index]` to `block_value`.
10. Create the output grid by wrapping the `output_sequence` in a list.
11. Return the resulting output grid.
