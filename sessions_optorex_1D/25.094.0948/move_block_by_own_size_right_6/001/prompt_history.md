*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both linear sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), acting as a background or empty space.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits. In some cases, the block might consist of only one digit.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same non-zero block as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift (movement) of this non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The amount and direction of the shift appear consistent across examples. Specifically, the block moves to the right.
    *   The shift distance seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself, namely its length.

*   **YAML Documentation:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
    Objects:
      - name: Sequence
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: Integers (mostly 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits)
      - name: NonZeroBlock
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - elements: Identical non-zero integers
          - length: Variable (number of elements in the block)
          - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
    Relationships:
      - The Output Sequence is derived from the Input Sequence.
      - The NonZeroBlock exists within both the Input and Output Sequences.
    Action:
      - name: Shift Block
        input: Input Sequence
        output: Output Sequence
        steps:
          - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the Input Sequence (find its elements, start_index_input, and length).
          - Calculate the start_index_output based on the start_index_input and the length of the NonZeroBlock.
          - Construct the Output Sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output, filling the rest with zeros.
    Rule:
      - The start_index_output is calculated as: start_index_input + length of NonZeroBlock.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block (`start_index_input`).
    4.  If no non-zero integer is found, the input consists only of zeros; return the initialized output sequence (which is also all zeros).
    5.  Determine the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers starting from `start_index_input`. Record the value of the digit and the length of this block (`block_length`).
    6.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output sequence (`start_index_output`) by adding the `start_index_input` and the `block_length`.
    7.  Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated `start_index_output`.
    8.  Return the resulting output sequence.
