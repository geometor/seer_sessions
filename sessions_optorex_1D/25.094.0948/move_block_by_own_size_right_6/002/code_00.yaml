Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a single-row grid.
Input_Format: List[List[int]] (Grid, typically 1xN)
Output_Format: List[List[int]] (Grid, same dimensions as input)
Objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: Typically 1
      - columns: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: Integers
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: Same as InputGrid
      - columns: Same as InputGrid
      - elements: Integers (derived from InputGrid)
  - name: GridRow
    type: List[int]
    description: A single row extracted from the grid, containing the data to be transformed.
  - name: NonZeroBlock
    type: Concept
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero integers within a GridRow.
    properties:
      - value: The integer value of the elements in the block.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - start_index_input: The starting index of the block within the input GridRow.
      - start_index_output: The calculated starting index of the block within the output GridRow.
Relationships:
  - The OutputGrid is derived from the InputGrid.
  - The transformation primarily operates on the first (and likely only) row of the InputGrid.
  - The NonZeroBlock exists in the input GridRow and is placed into the output GridRow.
Action:
  - name: Shift Block in Row
    input: InputGrid
    output: OutputGrid
    steps:
      - Extract the first row from the InputGrid (assume it's the target row).
      - Identify the NonZeroBlock within this row (find its value, start_index_input, and length).
      - If no NonZeroBlock exists, create an OutputGrid of the same dimensions filled with zeros.
      - Calculate the target start_index_output for the block in the output row using the rule: start_index_output = start_index_input + length.
      - Create an output row (List[int]) of the same length as the input row, initialized with zeros.
      - Place the NonZeroBlock (using its value and length) into the output row starting at the calculated start_index_output. Handle boundary conditions (if the block placement extends beyond the row length, truncate it).
      - Construct the OutputGrid by placing the modified row within a list.
Rule:
  - The starting index of the NonZeroBlock in the output row is calculated as: `start_index_output = start_index_input + length_of_NonZeroBlock`.
