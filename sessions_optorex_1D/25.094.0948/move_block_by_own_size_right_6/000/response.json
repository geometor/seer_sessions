In some cases, the block might consist of only one digit.\n    *   The output sequence contains the exact same non-zero block as the input.\n    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift (movement) of this non-zero block within the sequence.\n    *   The amount and direction of the shift appear consistent across examples. Specifically, the block moves to the right.\n    *   The shift distance seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself, namely its length.\n\n*   **YAML Documentation:**\n    "
