Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a single-row grid to the right.
Input/Output Format: Assumed to be a grid (list of lists), even if only one row.
Objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: Integers
      - contains: Single RowSequence
  - name: RowSequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Mostly 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (NonZeroBlock)
  - name: NonZeroBlock
    type: Subsequence (conceptual)
    properties:
      - elements: Identical non-zero integers (value)
      - length: Number of elements in the block (block_length)
      - start_index_input: The column index where the block begins in the InputGrid's RowSequence.
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: 12
      - elements: Mostly 0, containing the shifted NonZeroBlock.
      - contains: Single TransformedRowSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is derived from InputGrid by transforming its RowSequence.
Action:
  - name: Shift Block in Row
    input: InputGrid
    output: OutputGrid
    steps:
      - Extract the RowSequence from the InputGrid (assume it's the first row).
      - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the RowSequence (find its value, start_index_input, and block_length).
      - If no NonZeroBlock exists, create an OutputGrid of the same dimensions filled with zeros.
      - If a NonZeroBlock exists:
          - Calculate the target start column index for the block in the output (`start_index_output`) using the rule: `start_index_output = start_index_input + block_length`.
          - Create a new TransformedRowSequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
          - Place the NonZeroBlock (using its value and block_length) into the TransformedRowSequence starting at `start_index_output`. Ensure placement respects sequence boundaries (elements shifted beyond the end are dropped).
          - Construct the OutputGrid containing the TransformedRowSequence.
Rule:
  - The starting column index of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputGrid's row is calculated as: `start_index_input + block_length`.
Constraint:
  - The transformation operates only within the single row.
  - Block elements shifted beyond the right boundary of the row are discarded.
