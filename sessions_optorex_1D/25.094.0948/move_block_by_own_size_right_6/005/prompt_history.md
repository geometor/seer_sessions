*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both linear sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), acting as a background or empty space.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits. In some cases, the block might consist of only one digit.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same non-zero block as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift (movement) of this non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The amount and direction of the shift appear consistent across examples. Specifically, the block moves to the right.
    *   The shift distance seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself, namely its length.

*   **YAML Documentation:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
    Objects:
      - name: Sequence
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: Integers (mostly 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits)
      - name: NonZeroBlock
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - elements: Identical non-zero integers
          - length: Variable (number of elements in the block)
          - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
    Relationships:
      - The Output Sequence is derived from the Input Sequence.
      - The NonZeroBlock exists within both the Input and Output Sequences.
    Action:
      - name: Shift Block
        input: Input Sequence
        output: Output Sequence
        steps:
          - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the Input Sequence (find its elements, start_index_input, and length).
          - Calculate the start_index_output based on the start_index_input and the length of the NonZeroBlock.
          - Construct the Output Sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output, filling the rest with zeros.
    Rule:
      - The start_index_output is calculated as: start_index_input + length of NonZeroBlock.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block (`start_index_input`).
    4.  If no non-zero integer is found, the input consists only of zeros; return the initialized output sequence (which is also all zeros).
    5.  Determine the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers starting from `start_index_input`. Record the value of the digit and the length of this block (`block_length`).
    6.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output sequence (`start_index_output`) by adding the `start_index_input` and the `block_length`.
    7.  Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated `start_index_output`.
    8.  Return the resulting output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code implements the core logic identified in the initial analysis: find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it right by its length. However, the test results show that the `Transformed Output` is consistently empty, and crucially, the `Size Correct` flag is `False`. This strongly suggests an issue not with the *transformation logic itself*, but with how the function receives input or returns output in the context of the testing environment.

Possible reasons for the failure:

1.  **Input Format Mismatch:** The code expects `input_grid` to be a list of lists (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]`), even for a single row. If the testing environment provides the input as a flat list (e.g., `[0, 0, ...]`), the code might fail or behave unexpectedly, potentially at the `input_sequence = input_grid[0]` line or the validation check.
2.  **Output Format Mismatch:** The code returns the result wrapped in a list (`[output_sequence]`). The testing environment might expect a flat list, or perhaps a specific object type (like a NumPy array if that's the underlying framework). The empty output suggests the framework isn't receiving or interpreting the return value correctly.
3.  **Execution Error:** An unforeseen error within the `transform` or `find_nonzero_block` functions could be causing them to terminate prematurely without returning a value, leading to the empty output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use `tool_code` to run the core transformation logic on the example inputs to confirm it produces the correct *sequences* independent of the wrapper function/format.
2.  **Hypothesize Input/Output:** Assume the testing environment uses a specific format (e.g., list of lists for input, list of lists for output).
3.  **Refine Code (Mentally/Conceptually):** Adjust the understanding of the function signature and return value based on the hypothesis.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect the most likely input/output structure (assuming list of lists, as handled by the current code, seems a reasonable starting point given grid-based task contexts). The failure is likely subtle, perhaps related to how the test harness calls the function or interprets its return.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the core logic using the provided Python functions (slightly adapted for standalone execution).

**Metrics Analysis:**

The `tool_code` execution confirms that the core logic (`find_nonzero_block` and `apply_logic`) correctly identifies the non-zero blocks and calculates the expected output *sequences* for all training examples when operating on flat lists.

This reinforces the conclusion that the failure reported by the testing framework is due to an incompatibility between the `transform` function's signature/input handling/output formatting and the environment's expectations, rather than a flaw in the transformation rule itself. The `transform` function in the provided code expects a list of lists (grid) and returns a list of lists. The empty output in the test results likely means this grid format handling is incorrect for the specific test harness.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a single-row grid to the right.
Input/Output Format: Assumed to be a grid (list of lists), even if only one row.
Objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: Integers
      - contains: Single RowSequence
  - name: RowSequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Mostly 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (NonZeroBlock)
  - name: NonZeroBlock
    type: Subsequence (conceptual)
    properties:
      - elements: Identical non-zero integers (value)
      - length: Number of elements in the block (block_length)
      - start_index_input: The column index where the block begins in the InputGrid's RowSequence.
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: List[List[int]]
    properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: 12
      - elements: Mostly 0, containing the shifted NonZeroBlock.
      - contains: Single TransformedRowSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is derived from InputGrid by transforming its RowSequence.
Action:
  - name: Shift Block in Row
    input: InputGrid
    output: OutputGrid
    steps:
      - Extract the RowSequence from the InputGrid (assume it's the first row).
      - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the RowSequence (find its value, start_index_input, and block_length).
      - If no NonZeroBlock exists, create an OutputGrid of the same dimensions filled with zeros.
      - If a NonZeroBlock exists:
          - Calculate the target start column index for the block in the output (`start_index_output`) using the rule: `start_index_output = start_index_input + block_length`.
          - Create a new TransformedRowSequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
          - Place the NonZeroBlock (using its value and block_length) into the TransformedRowSequence starting at `start_index_output`. Ensure placement respects sequence boundaries (elements shifted beyond the end are dropped).
          - Construct the OutputGrid containing the TransformedRowSequence.
Rule:
  - The starting column index of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputGrid's row is calculated as: `start_index_input + block_length`.
Constraint:
  - The transformation operates only within the single row.
  - Block elements shifted beyond the right boundary of the row are discarded.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid, which consists of a single row of 12 integers.
2.  Extract the sequence of integers from the input grid's row.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
4.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first non-zero integer. Record its column index (`start_index_input`) and its value (`block_value`).
5.  If no non-zero integer is found, the input row consists only of zeros. Proceed to step 9 with the initialized zero sequence.
6.  Continue scanning from `start_index_input` to determine the length of the contiguous block of integers identical to `block_value`. Record this length (`block_length`).
7.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the output sequence (`start_index_output`) by adding `start_index_input` and `block_length`.
8.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
    *   Calculate the current target index in the output sequence: `current_output_index = start_index_output + i`.
    *   If `current_output_index` is within the valid range of indices (0 to 11), place the `block_value` at `output_sequence[current_output_index]`.
9.  Construct the output grid containing the (potentially modified) output sequence as its single row.
10. Return the resulting output grid.
