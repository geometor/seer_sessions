*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both linear sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), acting as a background or empty space.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits. In some cases, the block might consist of only one digit.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same non-zero block as the input.
    *   The primary transformation is the positional shift (movement) of this non-zero block within the sequence.
    *   The amount and direction of the shift appear consistent across examples. Specifically, the block moves to the right.
    *   The shift distance seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself, namely its length.

*   **YAML Documentation:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
    Objects:
      - name: Sequence
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: Integers (mostly 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits)
      - name: NonZeroBlock
        type: List[int]
        properties:
          - elements: Identical non-zero integers
          - length: Variable (number of elements in the block)
          - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
    Relationships:
      - The Output Sequence is derived from the Input Sequence.
      - The NonZeroBlock exists within both the Input and Output Sequences.
    Action:
      - name: Shift Block
        input: Input Sequence
        output: Output Sequence
        steps:
          - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the Input Sequence (find its elements, start_index_input, and length).
          - Calculate the start_index_output based on the start_index_input and the length of the NonZeroBlock.
          - Construct the Output Sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock at the calculated start_index_output, filling the rest with zeros.
    Rule:
      - The start_index_output is calculated as: start_index_input + length of NonZeroBlock.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block (`start_index_input`).
    4.  If no non-zero integer is found, the input consists only of zeros; return the initialized output sequence (which is also all zeros).
    5.  Determine the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers starting from `start_index_input`. Record the value of the digit and the length of this block (`block_length`).
    6.  Calculate the starting index for the block in the output sequence (`start_index_output`) by adding the `start_index_input` and the `block_length`.
    7.  Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence, starting at the calculated `start_index_output`.
    8.  Return the resulting output sequence.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero digits to the right by a distance equal to its length. However, the implementation failed because it assumed the input was a grid (list of lists) rather than a flat sequence (list). The execution results show empty transformed outputs, likely due to this input format mismatch causing the validation check `if not isinstance(input_grid, list) or not input_grid or not isinstance(input_grid[0], list):` to return `[[]]`. The strategy is to correct the input handling to treat the data as a single list and re-verify the transformation logic against all examples.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    We will analyze each training example to confirm the properties of the non-zero block and the shift rule.

    **Analysis Summary:** The metrics confirm that across all examples:
    *   Input and output sequences are consistently length 12.
    *   Each input contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    *   The non-zero block's value and length are preserved in the output.
    *   The rule `output_start_index = input_start_index + block_length` holds true for all examples.
    *   The data represents a 1D sequence.

*   **YAML Documentation:**

    
```yaml
    Task: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 1D sequence to the right by a distance equal to the block's length.
    Objects:
      - name: Sequence
        type: List[int]
        description: A 1-dimensional list of integers.
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - elements: Primarily zeros (0), with exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
      - name: NonZeroBlock
        type: Subsequence
        description: The contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the sequence.
        properties:
          - value: The non-zero integer comprising the block.
          - length: The number of elements in the block.
          - start_index_input: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
          - start_index_output: The 0-based index where the block begins in the output sequence.
    Relationships:
      - The Output Sequence is derived from the Input Sequence by repositioning the NonZeroBlock.
      - The NonZeroBlock's value and length remain unchanged between the input and output sequences.
    Action:
      - name: Shift Block Right
        input: Input Sequence
        output: Output Sequence
        steps:
          - Identify the NonZeroBlock within the Input Sequence (find its value, start_index_input, and length).
          - If no NonZeroBlock exists, return a sequence of zeros of the same length.
          - Calculate the target start_index_output using the rule: start_index_output = start_index_input + length.
          - Construct the Output Sequence: Initialize a sequence of zeros with the same length as the input. Place the NonZeroBlock (using its value and length) into the Output Sequence starting at the calculated start_index_output. Ensure placement respects sequence boundaries (elements shifted beyond the end are dropped).
    Rule:
      - The starting index of the NonZeroBlock in the Output Sequence is calculated as: `start_index_output = start_index_input + length_of_block`.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence (a list of 12 integers).
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence to find the starting index (`start_index_input`), value (`block_value`), and length (`block_length`) of the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    4.  If no non-zero block is found (i.e., the input is all zeros), return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
    5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: `start_index_output = start_index_input + block_length`.
    6.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
        a.  Calculate the current index in the output sequence: `current_output_index = start_index_output + i`.
        b.  If `current_output_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), set the element at `output_sequence[current_output_index]` to `block_value`.
    7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
