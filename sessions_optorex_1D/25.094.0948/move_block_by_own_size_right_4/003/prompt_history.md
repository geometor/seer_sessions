*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating sequences of integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this block of non-zero integers to the right. The magnitude of the shift appears to be directly related to the number of elements in the non-zero block.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue causing the errors is an incorrect assumption about the input format within the `transform` function. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the function received a NumPy array (or potentially a list) as input, not a string as expected by the line `input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]`. The core logic of identifying the block and calculating the shift based on its length appears sound based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to remove the string parsing step and assume the input is already in a list-like format (list or NumPy array).

*   **Metrics:**
    The `find_block` logic correctly identifies the block and its properties in each training example. The calculated shift (equal to the block length) and the resulting new start index align with the transformation observed in the input/output pairs.

    Let's re-verify with `tool_code` using the `find_block` logic (adjusted to work directly with lists):

    -   **train_2:** Block `[5, 5]` (len 2) at index 4 shifts by 2 to index 6.
    -   **train_3:** Block `[8]` (len 1) at index 0 shifts by 1 to index 1.
    -   **train_4:** Block `[3, 3, 3]` (len 3) at index 5 shifts by 3 to index 8.
    -   **train_5:** Block `[2]` (len 1) at index 3 shifts by 1 to index 4.
    -   **train_6:** Block `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` (len 5) at index 0 shifts by 5 to index 5.
    -   **train_7:** Block `[6, 6, 6]` (len 3) at index 2 shifts by 3 to index 5.
