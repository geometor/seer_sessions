**General Assessment**

The provided code consistently fails across all training and test examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This strongly indicates an issue with how the input data is being handled, specifically when boolean checks are performed. The error arises when attempting to evaluate the truthiness of a NumPy array containing multiple elements, which is ambiguous (e.g., `if np.array([True, False]):`).

The most probable cause is that the `input_grid` variable, assumed by the latest code revision to be a 1D list or adaptable to a 1D NumPy array, is actually being passed as a 2D NumPy array (likely with shape (1, N), representing a single row within a grid structure) by the testing environment. When the `_find_block` function iterates over this 2D array, it yields entire rows (which are 1D arrays) instead of individual scalar digits. Comparisons like `digit != 0` or `digit == value` then operate on these arrays, leading to the ambiguity error in conditional statements (`if`, `elif`).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input.
2.  Extract the first row of the input array to obtain the 1D sequence of digits.
3.  Apply the existing `_find_block` logic to this extracted 1D sequence.
4.  Ensure the output is formatted correctly, likely as a 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the input (1, N).

**Metrics and Observations**

*   **Input Format:** Based on the consistent error, the input format is inferred to be a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`) rather than a 1D list or array.
*   **Error Source:** The error occurs within the `_find_block` function during iteration. The loop variable (`digit` in the code) incorrectly holds a 1D array (a row) instead of a scalar integer when the input is 2D. Conditional checks (`is_non_zero`, `digit == value`, etc.) applied to this array trigger the ValueError.
*   **Core Logic Validity:** The underlying logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it right by its length appears sound based on the initial visual inspection of the examples. The failure is purely an implementation detail related to data type/shape handling.
*   **Example Analysis (Simulated based on logic):**
    *   `train_1`: Input `[[0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`. Block: value=6, start=3, length=1. Shift=1. New start=4. Output `[[0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`.
    *   `train_2`: Input `[[0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]]`. Block: value=5, start=2, length=5. Shift=5. New start=7. Output `[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5]]`.
    *   `train_3`: Input `[[9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`. Block: value=9, start=0, length=5. Shift=5. New start=5. Output `[[0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0]]`.
    *   The logic holds consistently for all examples provided the input is treated as the first row of a 2D array.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Shift the block of non-zero digits found in the input grid's single row to the right by a distance equal to its own length.
  steps:
    - Assume the input is a 2D grid with one row. Extract this row as a 1D sequence.
    - Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this sequence. Record its value, length, and starting column index.
    - Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block's length.
    - Calculate the new starting column index by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
    - Create an output grid of the same shape as the input grid (1 row, same number of columns), initially filled with zeros.
    - Place the original block (same value, same length) into the row of the output grid, starting at the new calculated column index. Handle boundary conditions (i.e., if the shifted block would extend beyond the grid width, only place the part that fits).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid, expected to have exactly one row.
2.  Extract the sequence of numbers from this single row.
3.  Scan the sequence to find the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Store the digit's value, the length (number of repetitions) of the block, and the starting column index of this block.
4.  Create a new 2D grid with the same dimensions (1 row, same number of columns as input) and fill it entirely with zeros.
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for the block in the new grid's row by adding the block's length to its original starting column index.
6.  Copy the block of non-zero digits (using the stored value and length) into the new grid's row, beginning at the calculated target starting column index. Ensure you do not write past the end of the row; if the shifted block is too long to fit entirely, only place the digits that fall within the grid's boundaries.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
