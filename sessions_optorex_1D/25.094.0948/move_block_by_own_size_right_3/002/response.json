The universal error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" strongly suggests that the testing environment provides the input data as NumPy arrays (or a similar structure) rather than standard Python lists. The error occurs when a comparison like `if element != 0:` is performed on an array element without explicitly handling the array context (e.g., using `.any()` or `.all()`, although in this case, direct element comparison should work if properly indexed).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the block finding and shifting logic using `tool_code` simulation that mimics array behavior.\n2.  Refine the YAML and Natural Language Program to be precise about the steps, assuming array-like input structures.\n3.  The subsequent Coder phase must ensure the implementation correctly handles comparisons and assignments with array elements.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nUsing code execution to verify the block details and calculated shift for each training example.\n\n"
