Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of an identical non-zero digit. The rest of the sequence elements are zeros.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating this block of non-zero digits within the sequence.
4.  **Block Integrity:** The non-zero digit itself and the number of times it repeats (the length of the block) remain unchanged between input and output.
5.  **Movement:** The block consistently shifts to the right.
6.  **Shift Distance:** By comparing the starting position of the block in the input and output across examples, it appears the distance the block shifts is equal to the length of the block itself. For example:
    *   `train_1`: Block `6` (length 1) at index 3 moves to index 4 (shift of 1).
    *   `train_2`: Block `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 5).
    *   `train_4`: Block `8 8 8` (length 3) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 5 (shift of 3).
    *   `train_6`: Block `1 1` (length 2) starting at index 5 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 2).
7.  **Output Structure:** The output sequence retains the same overall length as the input. The positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Shift the block of non-zero digits to the right by a distance equal to its own length.
  steps:
    - Find the block of non-zero digits in the input sequence.
    - Record its value, length, and starting index.
    - Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block's length.
    - Calculate the new starting index by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
    - Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    - Place the original block (same value, same length) into the output sequence at the new starting index.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note the digit's value, the length of the block (how many times the digit repeats), and the starting index of the block.
2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, and initialize all its elements to zero.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new sequence by adding the block's length to its original starting index found in step 1.
4.  Copy the block of non-zero digits (using the value and length from step 1) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
