data_elements:
  - type: Sequence
    properties:
      - name: structure
        value: 1D Array/List
        description: Represents the input and output data structures. Likely NumPy arrays in the execution environment.
      - name: elements
        description: Contains single-digit integers (0-9).
      - name: length
        description: The total number of elements in the sequence. Same for input and output.
      - role: input
      - role: output
  - type: Block
    properties:
      - name: value
        description: The non-zero integer digit composing the block (1-9).
      - name: length
        description: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously.
      - name: start_index
        description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the sequence.
      - name: end_index
        description: The 0-based index of the position immediately after the last element of the block (start_index + length).
    relationships:
      - description: The input Sequence contains exactly one Block of identical, non-zero digits.
      - description: The output Sequence contains the same Block (identical value and length) as the input.
  - type: Zero
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
    relationships:
      - description: Zeros occupy all positions in the Sequence outside the identified Block.

actions:
  - name: Identify Block
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Block (value, length, start_index)
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to find the first contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits. Record the digit's value, the count of its repetition (length), and its starting index.
  - name: Calculate Shift Distance
    inputs:
      - Block length
    outputs:
      - Shift amount
    description: The distance to shift the block is equal to the Block length.
  - name: Calculate New Position
    inputs:
      - Block start_index
      - Shift amount
    outputs:
      - New start_index
    description: Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the Shift amount (Block length) to the original Block start_index.
  - name: Construct Output Sequence
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence length
      - Block (value, length)
      - New start_index
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros. Place the identified Block (using its value and length) into this new sequence, starting at the calculated New start_index. Ensure the block placement does not exceed the sequence boundaries.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Relocate the single contiguous block of non-zero digits within the sequence.
  logic: The block is shifted to the right by a number of positions equal to its own length.
