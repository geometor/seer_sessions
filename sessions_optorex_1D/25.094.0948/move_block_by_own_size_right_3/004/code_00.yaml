task_elements:
  - type: Sequence
    properties:
      - name: elements
        description: A 1D list or array of single-digit integers.
      - name: length
        description: The total number of elements in the sequence. Remains constant between input and output.
      - role: input
      - role: output
  - type: Block
    properties:
      - name: value
        description: The non-zero integer digit composing the block.
      - name: length
        description: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously.
      - name: start_index
        description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the input sequence.
    relationships:
      - description: The input Sequence contains exactly one Block. All other elements are zero.
      - description: The Block is composed of identical non-zero digits.
      - description: The output Sequence contains the same Block (identical value and length) but at a potentially different position.
  - type: Zero
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
    relationships:
      - description: Zeros occupy all positions in the input and output Sequences outside the Block.

actions:
  - name: Identify Block
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Block (value, length, start_index)
    description: Find the contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, length, and starting index. Assumes only one such block exists.
  - name: Calculate Shift Distance
    inputs:
      - Block length
    outputs:
      - Shift amount
    description: The shift amount is numerically equal to the Block length.
  - name: Calculate New Block Position
    inputs:
      - Block start_index (from input)
      - Shift amount
    outputs:
      - New start_index (for output)
    description: Add the Shift amount to the original start_index to find the block's starting position in the output sequence.
  - name: Construct Output Sequence
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence length
      - Block (value, length)
      - New start_index
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros. Place the identified Block (using its value and length) into this new sequence starting at the calculated New start_index. Ensure the block placement respects the sequence boundaries.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Relocate the single contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
  logic: The block is shifted horizontally to the right by a distance exactly equal to the number of elements in the block (its length). The output sequence maintains the same length as the input, with the shifted block placed in its new position and all other elements set to zero.
