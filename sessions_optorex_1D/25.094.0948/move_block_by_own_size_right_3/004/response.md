**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code execution failed across all examples with a NumPy error related to boolean ambiguity ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..."). This suggested a potential mismatch between the code's assumptions about the input data (expecting 1D scalar sequences) and the format possibly provided by the test environment (potentially multi-dimensional arrays or arrays requiring explicit boolean handling with `.any()` or `.all()`).

A controlled test using `tool_code` was performed, explicitly feeding the example inputs as Python lists to the transformation logic. This test successfully replicated the expected output for all training examples. This confirms that the derived transformation logic (find the non-zero block, shift it right by its length) is correct based on the provided input-output pairs.

The strategy is therefore to maintain this core logic. The errors previously encountered are likely due to specifics of the execution environment interacting with NumPy, rather than a flaw in the fundamental understanding of the transformation rule. The focus for the `coder` phase will be on ensuring the Python implementation is robust to the exact data type and structure passed by the test harness, potentially incorporating more defensive checks or NumPy-specific handling if necessary, while adhering to the confirmed transformation rule.

**Metrics**

The `tool_code` execution provided metrics confirming the transformation logic:

| Example | Input                                     | Block Value | Block Start Index | Block Length | Shift Amount | New Start Index | Expected Output                           | Actual Output (from tool_code)            | Match |

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence, which is a one-dimensional list of integers containing exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, with all other elements being zero.
2.  Identify this non-zero block: determine its digit value, its length (the number of times the digit appears contiguously), and the index at which it starts.
3.  Calculate the shift distance, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Compute the starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filling it entirely with zeros initially.
6.  Copy the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, beginning at the computed new starting index. Ensure that the placement does not exceed the bounds of the output sequence.
7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
