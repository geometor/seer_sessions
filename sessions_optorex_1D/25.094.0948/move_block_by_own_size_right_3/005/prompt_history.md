Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of an identical non-zero digit. The rest of the sequence elements are zeros.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating this block of non-zero digits within the sequence.
4.  **Block Integrity:** The non-zero digit itself and the number of times it repeats (the length of the block) remain unchanged between input and output.
5.  **Movement:** The block consistently shifts to the right.
6.  **Shift Distance:** By comparing the starting position of the block in the input and output across examples, it appears the distance the block shifts is equal to the length of the block itself. For example:
    *   `train_1`: Block `6` (length 1) at index 3 moves to index 4 (shift of 1).
    *   `train_2`: Block `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 5).
    *   `train_4`: Block `8 8 8` (length 3) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 5 (shift of 3).
    *   `train_6`: Block `1 1` (length 2) starting at index 5 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 2).
7.  **Output Structure:** The output sequence retains the same overall length as the input. The positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Shift the block of non-zero digits to the right by a distance equal to its own length.
  steps:
    - Find the block of non-zero digits in the input sequence.
    - Record its value, length, and starting index.
    - Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block's length.
    - Calculate the new starting index by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
    - Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    - Place the original block (same value, same length) into the output sequence at the new starting index.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note the digit's value, the length of the block (how many times the digit repeats), and the starting index of the block.
2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, and initialize all its elements to zero.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new sequence by adding the block's length to its original starting index found in step 1.
4.  Copy the block of non-zero digits (using the value and length from step 1) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code execution failed across all examples with a NumPy error related to boolean ambiguity ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..."). This suggested a potential mismatch between the code's assumptions about the input data (expecting 1D scalar sequences) and the format possibly provided by the test environment (potentially multi-dimensional arrays or arrays requiring explicit boolean handling with `.any()` or `.all()`).

A controlled test using `tool_code` was performed, explicitly feeding the example inputs as Python lists to the transformation logic. This test successfully replicated the expected output for all training examples. This confirms that the derived transformation logic (find the non-zero block, shift it right by its length) is correct based on the provided input-output pairs.

The strategy is therefore to maintain this core logic. The errors previously encountered are likely due to specifics of the execution environment interacting with NumPy, rather than a flaw in the fundamental understanding of the transformation rule. The focus for the `coder` phase will be on ensuring the Python implementation is robust to the exact data type and structure passed by the test harness, potentially incorporating more defensive checks or NumPy-specific handling if necessary, while adhering to the confirmed transformation rule.

**Metrics**

The `tool_code` execution provided metrics confirming the transformation logic:

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: Sequence
    properties:
      - name: elements
        description: A 1D list or array of single-digit integers.
      - name: length
        description: The total number of elements in the sequence. Remains constant between input and output.
      - role: input
      - role: output
  - type: Block
    properties:
      - name: value
        description: The non-zero integer digit composing the block.
      - name: length
        description: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously.
      - name: start_index
        description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the input sequence.
    relationships:
      - description: The input Sequence contains exactly one Block. All other elements are zero.
      - description: The Block is composed of identical non-zero digits.
      - description: The output Sequence contains the same Block (identical value and length) but at a potentially different position.
  - type: Zero
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
    relationships:
      - description: Zeros occupy all positions in the input and output Sequences outside the Block.

actions:
  - name: Identify Block
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Block (value, length, start_index)
    description: Find the contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, length, and starting index. Assumes only one such block exists.
  - name: Calculate Shift Distance
    inputs:
      - Block length
    outputs:
      - Shift amount
    description: The shift amount is numerically equal to the Block length.
  - name: Calculate New Block Position
    inputs:
      - Block start_index (from input)
      - Shift amount
    outputs:
      - New start_index (for output)
    description: Add the Shift amount to the original start_index to find the block's starting position in the output sequence.
  - name: Construct Output Sequence
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence length
      - Block (value, length)
      - New start_index
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros. Place the identified Block (using its value and length) into this new sequence starting at the calculated New start_index. Ensure the block placement respects the sequence boundaries.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Relocate the single contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence.
  logic: The block is shifted horizontally to the right by a distance exactly equal to the number of elements in the block (its length). The output sequence maintains the same length as the input, with the shifted block placed in its new position and all other elements set to zero.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence, which is a one-dimensional list of integers containing exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, with all other elements being zero.
2.  Identify this non-zero block: determine its digit value, its length (the number of times the digit appears contiguously), and the index at which it starts.
3.  Calculate the shift distance, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Compute the starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filling it entirely with zeros initially.
6.  Copy the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, beginning at the computed new starting index. Ensure that the placement does not exceed the bounds of the output sequence.
7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
