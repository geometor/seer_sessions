            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of an identical non-zero digit. The rest of the sequence elements are zeros.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating this block of non-zero digits within the sequence.\n4.  **Block Integrity:** The non-zero digit itself and the number of times it repeats (the length of the block) remain unchanged between input and output.\n5.  **Movement:** The block consistently shifts to the right.\n6.  **Shift Distance:** By comparing the starting position of the block in the input and output across examples, it appears the distance the block shifts is equal to the length of the block itself. For example:\n    *   `train_1`: Block `6` (length 1) at index 3 moves to index 4 (shift of 1).\n    *   `train_2`: Block `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 5).\n    *   `train_4`: Block `8 8 8` (length 3) starting at index 2 moves to start at index 5 (shift of 3).\n    *   `train_6`: Block `1 1` (length 2) starting at index 5 moves to start at index 7 (shift of 2).\n7.  **Output Structure:** The output sequence retains the same overall length as the input. The positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
