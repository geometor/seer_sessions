  - type: Sequence
    properties:
      - name: elements
        description: A list of single-digit integers.
      - name: length
        description: The total number of elements in the sequence.
      - role: input
      - role: output
  - type: Block
    properties:
      - name: value
        description: The non-zero digit composing the block.
      - name: length
        description: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously.
      - name: start_index
        description: The index of the first element of the block in the sequence.
      - name: end_index
        description: The index of the last element of the block in the sequence.
    relationships:
      - description: The input Sequence contains exactly one Block.
      - description: The Block is composed of identical non-zero digits.
      - description: The output Sequence contains the same Block (identical value and length).
  - type: Zero
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
    relationships:
      - description: Zeros occupy all positions in the Sequence outside the Block.

actions:
  - name: Identify Block
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Block (value, length, start_index)
    description: Find the contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence.
  - name: Calculate Shift
    inputs:
      - Block length
    outputs:
      - Shift amount
    description: The shift amount is equal to the Block length.
  - name: Calculate New Position
    inputs:
      - Block start_index
      - Shift amount
    outputs:
      - New start_index
    description: Add the Shift amount to the original start_index to find the block's starting position in the output.
  - name: Construct Output
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence length
      - Block (value, length)
      - New start_index
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled with zeros, and place the Block at the calculated New start_index.

transformation_rule:
  goal: Shift the block of non-zero digits to the right by a distance equal to its own length.
  steps:
    - Find the block of non-zero digits in the input sequence.
    - Record its value, length, and starting index.
    - Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block's length.
    - Calculate the new starting index by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
    - Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    - Place the original block (same value, same length) into the output sequence at the new starting index.
