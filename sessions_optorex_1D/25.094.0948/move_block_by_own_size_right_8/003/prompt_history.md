## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence consists of the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The amount of the rightward shift is equal to the length of the non-zero block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of `digit_value`. Calculate the length of this block (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
6.  Place the block of `digit_value` with length `block_length` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment

The execution results indicate a consistent `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10` across all training examples. This error typically occurs when attempting to convert a non-numeric string to an integer. Looking at the provided Python code (`code_00.py`), neither the `transform` nor the `find_block` function explicitly attempts to convert the entire input string (`input_grid`) into an integer. However, the peculiar error message `... '00[[00000000000000000000000'` suggests that the input received by the `transform` function in the testing environment might not be the clean, space-separated string presented in the examples (e.g., `"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0"`). It's possible the input is multi-line, contains unexpected characters (like the `[[`), or is an object whose string representation (`str(input_grid)`) results in this malformed string.

The core transformation logic (finding a block of non-zero digits and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the error is to modify the `transform` function to robustly handle the input it receives:
1.  Ensure the input is treated as a string.
2.  Clean the input string by removing any characters that are not digits (especially spaces, brackets, or newlines suspected from the error message).
3.  Proceed with the existing logic on the cleaned sequence of 12 digits.
4.  Format the final output sequence back into a space-separated string to match the expected output format.

## Metrics and Validation

The `tool_code` execution confirms that the core algorithm produces the correct output for all training examples when the input is preprocessed to remove spaces and the output is formatted with spaces.


```python
# Results Summary from tool_code execution:
# Example 1: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1")
# Example 2: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0")
# Example 3: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0")
# Example 4: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4")
# Example 5: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0")
# Example 6: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3")
# Example 7: Correct (Input: "0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0")
```


This successful validation supports the hypothesis that the original error was due to input formatting/handling issues rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input, which represents a sequence of 12 digits, possibly formatted with spaces or other characters.
2.  Convert the input to a string format.
3.  Preprocess the string: remove all space characters to obtain a clean sequence of 12 digits.
4.  Initialize a list representing the output sequence with 12 zeros.
5.  Iterate through the cleaned input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`). If no non-zero digit is found, skip to step 8.
6.  Starting from `start_index`, determine the length (`block_length`) of the contiguous block of `digit_value`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
8.  If a block was found, place the block (repeating `digit_value` for `block_length` times) into the output list, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure the block placement does not exceed the bounds of the 12-element list.
9.  Convert the elements of the output list back to strings.
10. Join the elements of the output list with single spaces in between to create the final output string.
11. Return the final space-separated output string.
