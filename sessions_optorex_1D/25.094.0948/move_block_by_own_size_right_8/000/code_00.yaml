task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit repeated in the block (e.g., 1, 9, 4, 7, 3).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The position (0-based index) where the block begins in the input sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    action:
      - identify: Locate the non-zero block in the input sequence.
      - measure: Determine the length of the identified block.
      - shift: Move the block to the right within the sequence.
      - fill: Place zeros in all positions not occupied by the shifted block.
    relationship:
      - The shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block from the input, shifted rightward.
      - shifted_start_index: The new starting position of the block (original start_index + block length).
