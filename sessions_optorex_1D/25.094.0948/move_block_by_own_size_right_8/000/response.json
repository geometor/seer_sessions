Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence consists of the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The amount of the rightward shift is equal to the length of the non-zero block.\n\n## Task Facts\n\n"
