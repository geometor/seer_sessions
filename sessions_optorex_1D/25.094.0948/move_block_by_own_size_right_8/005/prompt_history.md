## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence consists of the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The amount of the rightward shift is equal to the length of the non-zero block.

## Task Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit repeated in the block (e.g., 1, 9, 4, 7, 3).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The position (0-based index) where the block begins in the input sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    action:
      - identify: Locate the non-zero block in the input sequence.
      - measure: Determine the length of the identified block.
      - shift: Move the block to the right within the sequence.
      - fill: Place zeros in all positions not occupied by the shifted block.
    relationship:
      - The shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block from the input, shifted rightward.
      - shifted_start_index: The new starting position of the block (original start_index + block length).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of `digit_value`. Calculate the length of this block (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
6.  Place the block of `digit_value` with length `block_length` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment

The core logic identified previously—finding a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it right by its length—appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The errors encountered (`invalid literal for int() with base 10`) confirm that the issue lies in the initial processing of the input string. The input format includes spaces between digits, which the previous code didn't handle correctly, attempting to convert the space-separated string directly instead of parsing it into a sequence of digits.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input processing step to correctly handle the space-separated string format, extracting the sequence of digits.
2.  Apply the identified block-finding and shifting logic to this processed digit sequence.
3.  Ensure the output is formatted correctly as a space-separated string of digits.

```
The analysis confirms the hypothesis: In each case, the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits is identified, and its length perfectly predicts the rightward shift required to match the output sequence. The `shift_matches` column is consistently `True`.

    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit ('1'-'9') repeated in the block.
      - length: The number of times the digit_value is repeated contiguously.
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the digit_sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input_sequence to produce the output_sequence.
    action:
      - parse: Convert the input_sequence string into a digit_sequence by removing spaces.
      - identify: Locate the non_zero_block (digit_value, start_index, length) within the digit_sequence.
      - initialize: Create an output list of 12 '0's.
      - calculate_shift: Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block length.
      - calculate_new_position: Compute the new starting index for the block in the output: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
      - place_block: Copy the non_zero_block into the output list starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure placement does not exceed the sequence bounds (length 12).
      - format_output: Convert the output list back into a space-separated string.
  - type: output_sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 digits represented as a space-separated string, resulting from the transformation.
    properties:
      format: String with digits separated by single spaces.
      length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      composition: Contains '0' digits and the original non_zero_block shifted right by its length compared to its position in the input's digit_sequence.
      shifted_start_index: The starting index of the block in the output's digit sequence (`start_index + block_length`).
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input string, which consists of 12 digits separated by spaces.
2.  Preprocess the input string: Remove all spaces to obtain a pure 12-digit sequence (`digit_sequence`).
3.  Initialize an output list containing 12 '0' characters.
4.  Iterate through the `digit_sequence` to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`). If no non-zero digit is found, proceed to step 8.
5.  Determine the length (`block_length`) of the contiguous block of `digit_value` starting at `start_index`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
    *   Calculate the target index in the output list: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    *   If `target_index` is less than 12 (the length of the output list), set the character at `output_list[target_index]` to `digit_value`.
8.  Join the characters in the output list using a single space as a separator to create the final output string.
9.  Return the formatted output string.
