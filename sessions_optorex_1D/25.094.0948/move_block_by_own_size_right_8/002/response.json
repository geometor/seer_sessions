            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe execution results indicate a consistent `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10` across all training examples. This error typically occurs when attempting to convert a non-numeric string to an integer. Looking at the provided Python code (`code_00.py`), neither the `transform` nor the `find_block` function explicitly attempts to convert the entire input string (`input_grid`) into an integer. However, the peculiar error message `... '00[[00000000000000000000000'` suggests that the input received by the `transform` function in the testing environment might not be the clean, space-separated string presented in the examples (e.g., `\"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"`). It's possible the input is multi-line, contains unexpected characters (like the `[[`), or is an object whose string representation (`str(input_grid)`) results in this malformed string.\n\nThe core transformation logic (finding a block of non-zero digits and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the error is to modify the `transform` function to robustly handle the input it receives:\n1.  Ensure the input is treated as a string.\n2.  Clean the input string by removing any characters that are not digits (especially spaces, brackets, or newlines suspected from the error message).\n3.  Proceed with the existing logic on the cleaned sequence of 12 digits.\n4.  Format the final output sequence back into a space-separated string to match the expected output format.\n\n## Metrics and Validation\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirms that the core algorithm produces the correct output for all training examples when the input is preprocessed to remove spaces and the output is formatted with spaces.\n\n"
