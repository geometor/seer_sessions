## General Assessment

The execution results indicate a consistent `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10` across all training examples. This error typically occurs when attempting to convert a non-numeric string to an integer. Looking at the provided Python code (`code_00.py`), neither the `transform` nor the `find_block` function explicitly attempts to convert the entire input string (`input_grid`) into an integer. However, the peculiar error message `... '00[[00000000000000000000000'` suggests that the input received by the `transform` function in the testing environment might not be the clean, space-separated string presented in the examples (e.g., `"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0"`). It's possible the input is multi-line, contains unexpected characters (like the `[[`), or is an object whose string representation (`str(input_grid)`) results in this malformed string.

The core transformation logic (finding a block of non-zero digits and shifting it right by its length) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the error is to modify the `transform` function to robustly handle the input it receives:
1.  Ensure the input is treated as a string.
2.  Clean the input string by removing any characters that are not digits (especially spaces, brackets, or newlines suspected from the error message).
3.  Proceed with the existing logic on the cleaned sequence of 12 digits.
4.  Format the final output sequence back into a space-separated string to match the expected output format.

## Metrics and Validation

The `tool_code` execution confirms that the core algorithm produces the correct output for all training examples when the input is preprocessed to remove spaces and the output is formatted with spaces.


```python
# Results Summary from tool_code execution:
# Example 1: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1")
# Example 2: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0")
# Example 3: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0")
# Example 4: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4")
# Example 5: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0")
# Example 6: Correct (Input: "0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3")
# Example 7: Correct (Input: "0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0", Output: "0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0")
```


This successful validation supports the hypothesis that the original error was due to input formatting/handling issues rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself.

## Task Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a string representing a sequence of 12 digits, potentially separated by spaces or containing other non-digit characters.
    properties:
      apparent_length: 12 digits.
      composition: Primarily contains zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '1', '9', '4', '7', '3').
      formatting: May include spaces or other characters requiring preprocessing.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the cleaned input sequence.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit repeated in the block.
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the cleaned input sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    preprocessing:
      - action: Convert input to string.
      - action: Remove non-digit characters (like spaces) to get a clean 12-digit sequence.
    core_logic:
      - action: Identify the non-zero block (digit_value, start_index, length) in the cleaned sequence.
      - action: Calculate the new start index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
      - action: Construct the output sequence by placing the block at `new_start_index`.
      - action: Fill all other positions in the output sequence with zeros.
    postprocessing:
      - action: Format the resulting 12-digit sequence as a string with digits separated by single spaces.
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a string representing a sequence of 12 digits separated by spaces.
    properties:
      length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      composition: Contains zeros ('0') and the same non-zero block from the input, shifted rightward by its own length.
      - shifted_start_index: The conceptual starting position (0-based index in the digit sequence) of the block in the output (original start_index + block length).
      formatting: Digits are separated by single spaces.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input, which represents a sequence of 12 digits, possibly formatted with spaces or other characters.
2.  Convert the input to a string format.
3.  Preprocess the string: remove all space characters to obtain a clean sequence of 12 digits.
4.  Initialize a list representing the output sequence with 12 zeros.
5.  Iterate through the cleaned input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`). If no non-zero digit is found, skip to step 8.
6.  Starting from `start_index`, determine the length (`block_length`) of the contiguous block of `digit_value`.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
8.  If a block was found, place the block (repeating `digit_value` for `block_length` times) into the output list, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure the block placement does not exceed the bounds of the 12-element list.
9.  Convert the elements of the output list back to strings.
10. Join the elements of the output list with single spaces in between to create the final output string.
11. Return the final space-separated output string.
