task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a string representing a sequence of 12 digits, potentially separated by spaces or containing other non-digit characters.
    properties:
      apparent_length: 12 digits.
      composition: Primarily contains zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '1', '9', '4', '7', '3').
      formatting: May include spaces or other characters requiring preprocessing.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the cleaned input sequence.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit repeated in the block.
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the cleaned input sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    preprocessing:
      - action: Convert input to string.
      - action: Remove non-digit characters (like spaces) to get a clean 12-digit sequence.
    core_logic:
      - action: Identify the non-zero block (digit_value, start_index, length) in the cleaned sequence.
      - action: Calculate the new start index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
      - action: Construct the output sequence by placing the block at `new_start_index`.
      - action: Fill all other positions in the output sequence with zeros.
    postprocessing:
      - action: Format the resulting 12-digit sequence as a string with digits separated by single spaces.
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a string representing a sequence of 12 digits separated by spaces.
    properties:
      length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      composition: Contains zeros ('0') and the same non-zero block from the input, shifted rightward by its own length.
      - shifted_start_index: The conceptual starting position (0-based index in the digit sequence) of the block in the output (original start_index + block length).
      formatting: Digits are separated by single spaces.
