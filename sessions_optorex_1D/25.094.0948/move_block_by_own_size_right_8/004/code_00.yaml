task_elements:
  - type: input_sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 digits represented as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      format: String with digits separated by single spaces.
      length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      composition: Contains '0' digits and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits ('1'-'9').
  - type: digit_sequence
    description: The numeric sequence derived from the input by removing spaces.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Purely digits '0'-'9'.
  - type: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the digit_sequence consisting of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit ('1'-'9') repeated in the block.
      - length: The number of times the digit_value is repeated contiguously.
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the digit_sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input_sequence to produce the output_sequence.
    action:
      - parse: Convert the input_sequence string into a digit_sequence by removing spaces.
      - identify: Locate the non_zero_block (digit_value, start_index, length) within the digit_sequence.
      - initialize: Create an output list of 12 '0's.
      - calculate_shift: Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the block length.
      - calculate_new_position: Compute the new starting index for the block in the output: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
      - place_block: Copy the non_zero_block into the output list starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure placement does not exceed the sequence bounds (length 12).
      - format_output: Convert the output list back into a space-separated string.
  - type: output_sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 digits represented as a space-separated string, resulting from the transformation.
    properties:
      format: String with digits separated by single spaces.
      length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      composition: Contains '0' digits and the original non_zero_block shifted right by its length compared to its position in the input's digit_sequence.
      shifted_start_index: The starting index of the block in the output's digit sequence (`start_index + block_length`).
