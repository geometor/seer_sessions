task_elements:
  - type: input_sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 digits provided as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - format: String, digits '0'-'9' separated by single spaces.
      - length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits ('1'-'9').
  - type: non_zero_block
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit ('1'-'9') making up the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index of the first digit of the block in the sequence (after removing spaces).
      - length: The number of times the digit_value is repeated contiguously.
  - type: transformation_rule
    description: The rule defining how the input sequence is converted to the output sequence.
    action:
      - parse_input: Convert the space-separated input string into a list or sequence of 12 digit characters.
      - locate_block: Find the `start_index`, `digit_value`, and `length` of the `non_zero_block`.
      - calculate_shift: Determine the `new_start_index` for the block using the formula: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
      - construct_output: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
      - place_block: Copy the `non_zero_block` (sequence of `digit_value` with `length`) into the new sequence, starting at the `new_start_index`. Handle cases where the shifted block might extend beyond the sequence length (only place the part that fits).
      - format_output: Convert the resulting sequence of 12 digits back into a space-separated string.
  - type: output_sequence
    description: The transformed sequence of 12 digits, formatted as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - format: String, digits '0'-'9' separated by single spaces.
      - length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros, with the `non_zero_block` from the input shifted to its new position. The original position of the block is filled with zeros.
