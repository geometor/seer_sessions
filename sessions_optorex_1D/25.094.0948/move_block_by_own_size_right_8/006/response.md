## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code failed because it attempted to interpret the space-separated input string (e.g., "0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0") as a single integer, leading to a `ValueError`. The error messages clearly indicate this parsing issue (`invalid literal for int()`).

The core logic hypothesized in the previous stage – identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it rightward by a distance equal to its length – appears consistent with all training examples when manually analyzed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Parsing:** Modify the input handling to split the space-separated string into a list or sequence of individual digit characters.
2.  **Implement Core Logic:** Apply the previously defined logic (find block start, value, length; calculate new start; construct output) to this parsed sequence.
3.  **Format Output:** Ensure the final output is formatted as a space-separated string, matching the expected output format.
4.  **Validate:** Re-verify the logic against all examples using the corrected parsing.

## Metrics Gathering

The following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs, assuming the input string is first processed by removing spaces.

             if not (actual_new_start + block_length <= len(out_seq) and out_seq[actual_new_start : actual_new_start + block_length] == digit_value * block_length):
                 # Need a more robust find if the block itself contains zeros or is cut off.
                 # However, for this problem, the block is contiguous non-zero digits.

                 actual_new_start = first_output_non_zero # Assume block starts at first non-zero

         except ValueError:

```
The analysis confirms that for all training examples, the non-zero block is shifted right by a distance exactly equal to its length. The `Matches Expected?` column is `True` for all cases.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 digits separated by spaces.
2.  Parse the input string: Split the string by spaces to create a list of 12 individual digit characters.
3.  Initialize an output list of 12 characters, filling it with '0'.
4.  Identify the non-zero block:
    a. Iterate through the parsed input list to find the index (`start_index`) and value (`digit_value`) of the first non-zero digit.
    b. If no non-zero digit is found, proceed directly to step 7 (output remains all zeros).
    c. Starting from `start_index`, count the number of consecutive occurrences of `digit_value` to determine the block's `length`.
5.  Calculate the new position: Determine the starting index for the block in the output list: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
6.  Place the block in the output:
    a. Iterate `length` times (from `i = 0` to `length - 1`).
    b. For each iteration `i`, calculate the target index in the output list: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    c. Check if `target_index` is within the bounds of the output list (i.e., less than 12).
    d. If it is within bounds, set the character at `output_list[target_index]` to `digit_value`.
7.  Format the output: Join the characters in the output list using a single space as a separator to create the final output string.
8.  Return the formatted output string.
