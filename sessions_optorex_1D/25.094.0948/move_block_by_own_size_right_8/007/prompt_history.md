## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence consists of the same block of non-zero digits, shifted to the right within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The amount of the rightward shift is equal to the length of the non-zero block.

## Task Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit repeated in the block (e.g., 1, 9, 4, 7, 3).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The position (0-based index) where the block begins in the input sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The process applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    action:
      - identify: Locate the non-zero block in the input sequence.
      - measure: Determine the length of the identified block.
      - shift: Move the block to the right within the sequence.
      - fill: Place zeros in all positions not occupied by the shifted block.
    relationship:
      - The shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of 12 digits.
    properties:
      length: 12
      composition: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block from the input, shifted rightward.
      - shifted_start_index: The new starting position of the block (original start_index + block length).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`digit_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of `digit_value`. Calculate the length of this block (`block_length`).
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + block_length`.
6.  Place the block of `digit_value` with length `block_length` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code failed because it attempted to interpret the space-separated input string (e.g., "0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0") as a single integer, leading to a `ValueError`. The error messages clearly indicate this parsing issue (`invalid literal for int()`).

The core logic hypothesized in the previous stage – identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it rightward by a distance equal to its length – appears consistent with all training examples when manually analyzed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Parsing:** Modify the input handling to split the space-separated string into a list or sequence of individual digit characters.
2.  **Implement Core Logic:** Apply the previously defined logic (find block start, value, length; calculate new start; construct output) to this parsed sequence.
3.  **Format Output:** Ensure the final output is formatted as a space-separated string, matching the expected output format.
4.  **Validate:** Re-verify the logic against all examples using the corrected parsing.

The analysis confirms that for all training examples, the non-zero block is shifted right by a distance exactly equal to its length. The `Matches Expected?` column is `True` for all cases.

## Task Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: input_sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 digits provided as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - format: String, digits '0'-'9' separated by single spaces.
      - length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits ('1'-'9').
  - type: non_zero_block
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit ('1'-'9') making up the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index of the first digit of the block in the sequence (after removing spaces).
      - length: The number of times the digit_value is repeated contiguously.
  - type: transformation_rule
    description: The rule defining how the input sequence is converted to the output sequence.
    action:
      - parse_input: Convert the space-separated input string into a list or sequence of 12 digit characters.
      - locate_block: Find the `start_index`, `digit_value`, and `length` of the `non_zero_block`.
      - calculate_shift: Determine the `new_start_index` for the block using the formula: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
      - construct_output: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
      - place_block: Copy the `non_zero_block` (sequence of `digit_value` with `length`) into the new sequence, starting at the `new_start_index`. Handle cases where the shifted block might extend beyond the sequence length (only place the part that fits).
      - format_output: Convert the resulting sequence of 12 digits back into a space-separated string.
  - type: output_sequence
    description: The transformed sequence of 12 digits, formatted as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - format: String, digits '0'-'9' separated by single spaces.
      - length: 12 digits (23 characters including spaces).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros, with the `non_zero_block` from the input shifted to its new position. The original position of the block is filled with zeros.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 digits separated by spaces.
2.  Parse the input string: Split the string by spaces to create a list of 12 individual digit characters.
3.  Initialize an output list of 12 characters, filling it with '0'.
4.  Identify the non-zero block:
    a. Iterate through the parsed input list to find the index (`start_index`) and value (`digit_value`) of the first non-zero digit.
    b. If no non-zero digit is found, proceed directly to step 7 (output remains all zeros).
    c. Starting from `start_index`, count the number of consecutive occurrences of `digit_value` to determine the block's `length`.
5.  Calculate the new position: Determine the starting index for the block in the output list: `new_start_index = start_index + length`.
6.  Place the block in the output:
    a. Iterate `length` times (from `i = 0` to `length - 1`).
    b. For each iteration `i`, calculate the target index in the output list: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    c. Check if `target_index` is within the bounds of the output list (i.e., less than 12).
    d. If it is within bounds, set the character at `output_list[target_index]` to `digit_value`.
7.  Format the output: Join the characters in the output list using a single space as a separator to create the final output string.
8.  Return the formatted output string.
