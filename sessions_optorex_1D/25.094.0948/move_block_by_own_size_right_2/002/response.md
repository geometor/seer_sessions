**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code accurately captured the core transformation logic observed in the initial examples: identify a contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shift it to the right by a distance equal to its length. The errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") encountered during testing strongly indicate that the testing environment provides the input data as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists. The `find_block` function's comparison logic (e.g., `num == value`) behaves differently for arrays, leading to the error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the transformation logic against all provided examples using code execution to extract key metrics.
2.  Confirm that the rule "shift right by block length" holds consistently.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML) and the natural language program based on these verified metrics, maintaining the core logic.
4.  Pass this refined understanding to the coder phase, highlighting the need to handle NumPy array inputs correctly in the implementation, particularly during comparisons.

The metrics confirm that for every training example, the single contiguous block of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right by a distance exactly equal to the length of that block. The core logic is sound.

**YAML Documentation of Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A fixed-size (length 12) 1D grid represented as a list or array of integers.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list or numpy array of integers
      - structure: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - object: block
    description: The single contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence consisting of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value (e.g., 6, 4, 2, 8, 3). Is consistent across all examples.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (variable, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4).
      - start_index_input: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the input sequence.
      - end_index_input: The 0-based index of the last element of the block in the input sequence (start_index_input + length - 1).
      - start_index_output: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the output sequence.
  - object: zero
    description: The integer 0, representing the background or empty space in the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block is embedded within the sequence, surrounded by zeros.
  - type: transformation
    description: The block's position shifts from the input sequence to the output sequence. The block itself (value and length) remains unchanged.
  - type: dependency
    description: The amount of the block's rightward shift is determined by its length.
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Locate the unique contiguous block of identical non-zero integers in the input sequence. Determine its value, starting index, and length.
  - action: calculate_shift_distance
    description: Determine the distance the block needs to move to the right. This distance is strictly equal to the length of the block identified in the previous step.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Calculate the starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance (block length) to the block's starting index in the input sequence. (new_start = input_start + block_length)
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new sequence of the same fixed size (12) initialized with zeros. Place the identified block (using its original value and length) into this new sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers amidst zeros.
2.  Identify this non-zero block: determine its numerical value, its length (number of elements), and its starting index within the input sequence.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: add the block's length to its starting index from the input sequence.
4.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
5.  Populate the output sequence by placing the identified block (using its original value and length) starting at the calculated target starting index. The elements outside the block remain zero.
6.  Return the generated output sequence.
