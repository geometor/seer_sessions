Ensure it is treated as a flat, one-dimensional sequence (flatten if necessary).\n2. Scan the sequence to locate the single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.\n3. Identify the properties of this block: its non-zero integer value, its length (number of elements), and its starting index (0-based) in the input sequence.\n4. Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: add the block's length to its starting index from the input sequence.\n5. Create a new output sequence consisting of 12 zeros.\n6. Place the identified block (using its original value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure the block placement respects the sequence boundaries.\n7.
