**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a one-dimensional sequence of 12 integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence retains this block but shifts its position to the right. The amount of the shift appears to be determined by the length of the non-zero block itself.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A list of 12 integers representing the input and output grids.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list of integers
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence consisting of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value (e.g., 6, 4, 2, 8, 3).
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - start_index_input: The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence.
      - end_index_input: The ending position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the output sequence.
  - object: zero
    description: The integer 0, representing the background or empty space in the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block is located within the sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The block's position changes from the input sequence to the output sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Find the start index, end index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input sequence.
  - action: calculate_shift
    description: Determine the distance the block needs to move to the right. This distance is equal to the length of the block.
  - action: apply_shift
    description: Calculate the new starting position of the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros and place the identified block at its new calculated position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
2.  Determine the value, length (number of elements), and starting index of this block.
3.  Calculate the shift distance required: the shift distance is equal to the length of the block.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance to the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Generate the output sequence: Create a sequence of 12 zeros. Then, place the original block (using its identified value and length) into this new sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
