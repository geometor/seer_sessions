task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A sequence of 12 integers, potentially represented as a list or numpy array. May require flattening to ensure 1D processing.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list or numpy array of integers
  - object: block
    description: A single contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence consisting of identical non-zero integers. Assumed to be unique per input sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value of the elements in the block.
      - length: The number of elements (integers) in the block.
      - start_index_input: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the (flattened) input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the output sequence.
  - object: zero
    description: The integer 0, representing the background or empty space in the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block is located within the sequence, surrounded by zeros.
  - type: transformation
    description: The block's position changes from the input sequence to the output sequence by shifting right.
  - type: dependency
    description: The distance the block shifts to the right is determined by, and is equal to, the length of the block itself.
actions:
  - action: flatten_input
    description: Ensure the input sequence is treated as a one-dimensional array or list.
  - action: identify_block
    description: Find the start index, value, and length of the unique contiguous non-zero block in the flattened input sequence.
  - action: calculate_shift_and_new_position
    description: Determine the shift distance (which equals the block length) and calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence (input_start_index + block_length).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros. Place the identified block (using its original value and length) into this new sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
