            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement the observed transformation rule: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero numbers rightwards by a distance equal to the block's length. However, it failed execution on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` This strongly indicates that the code was attempting to use a multi-element NumPy array in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement condition).\n\nThe most likely cause is that the input data, while conceptually a 1D sequence, was processed by `numpy.array()` in a way that resulted in a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)` instead of `(12,)`). This would cause comparisons involving array elements (like `grid_arr[current_index] == value`) to return boolean arrays when `value` itself becomes an array due to indexing a 2D array with a single index.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Logic:** Verify the core logic (shift right by block length) against all examples.\n2.  **Identify Error Source:** Pinpoint the exact line causing the boolean ambiguity error, likely related to array comparisons after incorrect dimension handling.\n3.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the code to ensure the input is treated as a 1D NumPy array, regardless of whether it's initially passed as a flat list or a list containing a single list. Using `.flatten()` on the input array is a robust approach.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the confirmed logic and potentially mention the input flattening step for robustness.\n\n**Metrics Analysis (via `tool_code`)**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution analyzed each training example based on the core logic (shift right by block length):\n\n"
