Transformation Rule:
1. Receive the input, which is a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers amidst zeros.
2. Identify this non-zero block: determine its numerical value, its length (number of elements), and its starting index within the input sequence.
3. Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: add the block's length to its starting index from the input sequence.
4. Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
5. Populate the output sequence by placing the identified block (using its original value and length) starting at the calculated target starting index. The elements outside the block remain zero.
6. Return the generated output sequence.
