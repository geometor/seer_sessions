task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A list of 12 integers representing the input and output grids.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list of integers
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence consisting of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value (e.g., 6, 4, 2, 8, 3).
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - start_index_input: The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence.
      - end_index_input: The ending position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the output sequence.
  - object: zero
    description: The integer 0, representing the background or empty space in the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The block is located within the sequence.
  - type: transformation
    description: The block's position changes from the input sequence to the output sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Find the start index, end index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input sequence.
  - action: calculate_shift
    description: Determine the distance the block needs to move to the right. This distance is equal to the length of the block.
  - action: apply_shift
    description: Calculate the new starting position of the block in the output sequence by adding the shift distance to the original starting index.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros and place the identified block at its new calculated position.
