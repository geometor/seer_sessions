*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The transformation involves reversing a specific portion of the input sequence.
    *   Leading and trailing zeros in the input sequence appear to remain in their original positions in the output.
    *   The core operation targets the sub-sequence of digits located between the first non-zero digit and the last non-zero digit (inclusive). If the sequence contains no non-zero digits, or only one, it remains unchanged (although this case isn't explicitly shown, it's a logical consequence). If the sequence contains no zeros at the start or end, the entire sequence is reversed.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided results indicate a complete failure of the previous code implementation. In every example (training and test), the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, meaning the `transform` function did not modify the input array as intended. However, manually applying the hypothesized rule (reverse the sub-sequence between the first and last non-zero elements) to each example pair shows that this rule *does* correctly produce the `Expected Output` in all cases.

**Conclusion:** The natural language program and the core logic derived previously are correct. The failure lies solely in the Python implementation which did not execute the intended reversal and reconstruction.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-affirm the core transformation logic based on manual verification against all provided examples.
2.  Use code execution to calculate metrics quantifying the difference between the flawed `Transformed Output` (which equals the `Input`) and the `Expected Output`. This highlights the extent of the implementation error.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to ensure clarity and accuracy, reflecting the validated logic. The core logic remains unchanged, but the description can be refined.
4.  The next step (coder phase) must focus on correctly implementing this validated logic in Python, likely using array slicing and concatenation.

## Metrics Analysis

We will calculate the number of elements that differ between the (incorrectly) `Transformed Output` (which is the same as the `Input`) and the `Expected Output` for each example.

**Metrics Summary:**

*   All input and output sequences have the same length (12 in these examples).
*   The number of differing elements between the input (which was incorrectly returned as the output by the previous code) and the expected output varies, confirming that a transformation *should* have occurred. The differences align with the expected reversal operation:
    *   train\_1: 8 differences
    *   train\_2: 6 differences
    *   train\_3: 6 differences
    *   train\_4: 12 differences (entire sequence reversed)
    *   train\_5: 6 differences
    *   train\_6: 2 differences
    *   train\_7: 10 differences
    *   test\_1: 2 differences

      - definition: Sequence of zero elements preceding the first non-zero element.
      - existence: May be empty if the sequence starts with a non-zero element or if the sequence contains only zeros.
  - object: trailing_zeros
    properties:
      - definition: Sequence of zero elements following the last non-zero element.
      - existence: May be empty if the sequence ends with a non-zero element or if the sequence contains only zeros.

transformation_rule:
  - action: identify_non_zero_indices
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: list_of_indices_of_non_zero_elements
    description: Find the indices of all elements that are not equal to zero.
  - action: determine_subsequence_boundaries
    inputs: list_of_indices_of_non_zero_elements
    outputs: start_index, end_index
    description: >
      If the list of indices is empty or contains only one index, the sequence remains unchanged.
      Otherwise, the start_index is the minimum index in the list, and the end_index is the maximum index.
  - action: segment_sequence
    inputs: input_sequence, start_index, end_index
    outputs: leading_part, middle_part, trailing_part
    description: >
      Split the input sequence into three parts based on the identified boundaries:
      1. leading_part: Elements from the beginning up to (but not including) start_index.
      2. middle_part: Elements from start_index up to and including end_index.
      3. trailing_part: Elements from end_index + 1 to the end of the sequence.
      Note: If the sequence remains unchanged (step 2), this segmentation is effectively skipped, or the middle_part encompasses the whole sequence relative to itself.
  - action: reverse_middle_part
    inputs: middle_part
    outputs: reversed_middle_part
    description: Reverse the order of elements within the middle_part segment.
  - action: reconstruct_sequence
    inputs: leading_part, reversed_middle_part, trailing_part
    outputs: output_sequence
    description: Concatenate the leading_part, the reversed_middle_part, and the trailing_part in that order to form the final output sequence. If the sequence was determined to remain unchanged in the boundary step, this reconstruction simply yields the original sequence.

edge_cases:
  - condition: Sequence contains no non-zero elements.
    result: Output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
  - condition: Sequence contains exactly one non-zero element.
    result: Output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the indices of all non-zero digits in the sequence.
3.  Check the count of non-zero digits found:
    *   If there are zero or one non-zero digits, the transformation is complete; return the original input sequence.
    *   If there are two or more non-zero digits, proceed to the next step.
4.  Identify the `start_index` as the index of the first non-zero digit (the minimum of the found indices).
5.  Identify the `end_index` as the index of the last non-zero digit (the maximum of the found indices).
6.  Extract the sub-sequence (`middle_part`) from the `start_index` to the `end_index` (inclusive).
7.  Reverse the order of the elements within this `middle_part`.
8.  Extract the elements before the `start_index` (the `leading_part`). If `start_index` is 0, this part is empty.
9.  Extract the elements after the `end_index` (the `trailing_part`). If `end_index` is the last index of the sequence, this part is empty.
10. Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `leading_part`, the reversed `middle_part`, and the `trailing_part`.
11. Return the constructed output sequence.
