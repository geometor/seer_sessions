            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided results indicate a complete failure of the previous code implementation. In every example (training and test), the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, meaning the `transform` function did not modify the input array as intended. However, manually applying the hypothesized rule (reverse the sub-sequence between the first and last non-zero elements) to each example pair shows that this rule *does* correctly produce the `Expected Output` in all cases.\n\n**Conclusion:** The natural language program and the core logic derived previously are correct. The failure lies solely in the Python implementation which did not execute the intended reversal and reconstruction.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-affirm the core transformation logic based on manual verification against all provided examples.\n2.  Use code execution to calculate metrics quantifying the difference between the flawed `Transformed Output` (which equals the `Input`) and the `Expected Output`. This highlights the extent of the implementation error.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to ensure clarity and accuracy, reflecting the validated logic. The core logic remains unchanged, but the description can be refined.\n4.  The next step (coder phase) must focus on correctly implementing this validated logic in Python, likely using array slicing and concatenation.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nWe will calculate the number of elements that differ between the (incorrectly) `Transformed Output` (which is the same as the `Input`) and the `Expected Output` for each example.\n\n"
