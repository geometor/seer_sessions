"""
Reverses the contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits within a sequence of digits, leaving any leading or trailing zeros in their original positions.

1.  Identify the index of the first non-zero digit.
2.  Identify the index of the last non-zero digit.
3.  If no non-zero digits exist, return the original sequence.
4.  Extract the sub-sequence from the first non-zero index to the last non-zero index (inclusive).
5.  Extract any leading zeros (before the first non-zero index).
6.  Extract any trailing zeros (after the last non-zero index).
7.  Reverse the extracted non-zero sub-sequence.
8.  Concatenate the leading zeros, the reversed non-zero sub-sequence, and the trailing zeros to form the output sequence.
