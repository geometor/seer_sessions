*   **Perception**: The input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces. The transformation appears to involve reversing a portion of the sequence. Specifically, the contiguous subsequence containing all the non-zero digits is identified and reversed in place. The surrounding zero digits, both leading and trailing, remain in their original positions.

*   **Facts**:

      - leading_zeros: the sequence of zeros before the first non-zero digit
      - trailing_zeros: the sequence of zeros after the last non-zero digit
    properties:
      - digits: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
    actions:
      - identify: find the start and end indices of the non-zero subsequence
      - extract: isolate the leading zeros, the non-zero subsequence, and the trailing zeros
      - reverse: reverse the order of the elements within the non-zero subsequence
      - concatenate: combine the leading zeros, the reversed subsequence, and the trailing zeros to form the output sequence
    relationships:
      - The output sequence maintains the same leading and trailing zeros as the input sequence.
      - The core part of the output sequence is the reverse of the core non-zero part of the input sequence.
      - If the input contains no non-zero digits, the output is identical to the input (inferred, not explicitly shown in examples).
      - If the input contains only non-zero digits, the entire output sequence is the reverse of the input sequence.

*   **General Assessment:** The provided examples consistently demonstrate a pattern where a contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits within a larger sequence is reversed, while any leading or trailing zeros remain in their original positions. The initial natural language program accurately captured this observed transformation. The execution results, however, show that the provided code (`code_00.py`) failed to implement this transformation, consistently returning the input sequence unchanged. This indicates an implementation error in the code that was tested, rather than a misunderstanding of the task requirements based on the examples. The strategy is to proceed with the original understanding of the transformation logic, as it perfectly aligns with all input/output pairs, and ensure the coder phase correctly implements this logic.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   The execution results show that for every training and test example, the `transform` function returned the original input sequence.
    *   `Match: False` for all examples except potentially cases where the input requires no change (e.g., all zeros, or a single non-zero digit), although no such specific cases were highlighted as matching.
    *   `Pixels Off` (interpreted here as differing elements) varies depending on the length and content of the non-zero subsequence that *should* have been reversed. For instance, `train_1` has 4 non-zero elements (`4 7 9 1` -> `1 9 7 4`), resulting in 4 differing elements. `train_2` has 12 non-zero elements, all needing reversal, resulting in 12 differing elements. `train_6` has 2 non-zero elements (`8 3` -> `3 8`), resulting in 2 differing elements. The reported "Pixels Off" values align with the number of elements within the non-zero subsequence that would change position upon reversal.
    *   `Size Correct: True` for all examples, as the length of the sequence is preserved.
    *   `Color Palette Correct: True` and `Color Count Correct: True`, as the digits themselves are preserved, only their order within the subsequence changes.

*   **Facts**:
