*   **Perception**: The input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces. The transformation appears to involve reversing a portion of the sequence. Specifically, the contiguous subsequence containing all the non-zero digits is identified and reversed in place. The surrounding zero digits, both leading and trailing, remain in their original positions.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input_elements: sequence of single digits (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
    output_elements: sequence of single digits (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
    objects:
      - sequence: the input list of digits
      - subsequence: the contiguous part of the sequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending at the last non-zero digit
      - leading_zeros: the sequence of zeros before the first non-zero digit
      - trailing_zeros: the sequence of zeros after the last non-zero digit
    properties:
      - digits: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
    actions:
      - identify: find the start and end indices of the non-zero subsequence
      - extract: isolate the leading zeros, the non-zero subsequence, and the trailing zeros
      - reverse: reverse the order of the elements within the non-zero subsequence
      - concatenate: combine the leading zeros, the reversed subsequence, and the trailing zeros to form the output sequence
    relationships:
      - The output sequence maintains the same leading and trailing zeros as the input sequence.
      - The core part of the output sequence is the reverse of the core non-zero part of the input sequence.
      - If the input contains no non-zero digits, the output is identical to the input (inferred, not explicitly shown in examples).
      - If the input contains only non-zero digits, the entire output sequence is the reverse of the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the sequence. If no non-zero digit exists, return the original sequence.
    3.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the sequence.
    4.  Extract the subsequence starting from the first non-zero digit's index up to and including the last non-zero digit's index.
    5.  Reverse the order of the digits within this extracted subsequence.
    6.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating:
        a.  The digits from the start of the original sequence up to (but not including) the first non-zero digit's index (the leading zeros).
        b.  The reversed subsequence.
        c.  The digits from the position immediately after the last non-zero digit's index to the end of the original sequence (the trailing zeros).
    7.  Return the constructed output sequence.

## General Assessment

The provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where a specific subsequence within a list of digits is reversed. The results indicate that the previous code implementation failed entirely, returning the input unchanged for all test cases. This suggests either a fundamental flaw in the code's logic execution (perhaps an early exit or incorrect condition check) or an issue with how the test harness invoked the function or processed its input/output.

However, the underlying pattern observed across all examples remains consistent:
1.  Identify the contiguous block of digits starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit.
2.  Reverse only this identified block.
3.  Keep any leading and trailing zero digits in their original positions.

The strategy is to refine the description of this process, ensuring clarity and accuracy based on the complete set of examples, assuming the core logic identified is correct and the previous execution failure was an implementation bug.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_format: string containing space-separated single digits (0-9)
output_format: string containing space-separated single digits (0-9)
input_data_structure: 1D sequence (list or array) of integers
output_data_structure: 1D sequence (list or array) of integers of the same length as the input

objects:
  - name: sequence
    description: The full input list of digits.
    properties:
      - length: integer, number of digits in the sequence.
      - elements: integer digits (0-9).
  - name: leading_zeros
    description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros at the beginning of the input sequence. May be empty.
    properties:
      - elements: only the digit 0.
      - location: starts at index 0.
  - name: trailing_zeros
    description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros at the end of the input sequence. May be empty.
    properties:
      - elements: only the digit 0.
      - location: ends at the last index of the sequence.
  - name: core_subsequence
    description: The contiguous subsequence starting at the first non-zero digit and ending at the last non-zero digit in the input sequence. If the input contains no non-zero digits, this subsequence is considered empty.
    properties:
      - elements: digits (0-9), guaranteed to contain at least one non-zero digit unless the entire input sequence is zeros.
      - location: bounded by the first and last non-zero elements.

actions:
  - name: find_indices
    description: Locate the index of the first non-zero element and the index of the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
    inputs: sequence
    outputs: start_index, end_index (or indicators like None/ -1 if no non-zeros exist)
  - name: extract_parts
    description: Split the input sequence into three parts based on the found indices - leading_zeros, core_subsequence, and trailing_zeros.
    inputs: sequence, start_index, end_index
    outputs: leading_zeros_part, core_subsequence_part, trailing_zeros_part
  - name: reverse_subsequence
    description: Reverse the order of elements within the extracted core_subsequence.
    inputs: core_subsequence_part
    outputs: reversed_core_subsequence
  - name: concatenate_parts
    description: Combine the leading_zeros, reversed_core_subsequence, and trailing_zeros back into a single sequence.
    inputs: leading_zeros_part, reversed_core_subsequence, trailing_zeros_part
    outputs: final_output_sequence

relationships:
  - The length of the output sequence is always equal to the length of the input sequence.
  - The elements in the leading_zeros part of the input appear unchanged at the beginning of the output.
  - The elements in the trailing_zeros part of the input appear unchanged at the end of the output.
  - The elements in the core_subsequence part of the input appear in reverse order in the corresponding segment of the output.
  - If the input sequence contains no non-zero digits, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (represented as a list or array).
2.  Identify the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`).
3.  Identify the index of the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
4.  **Handle Edge Case**: If no non-zero digits are found (`start_index` is invalid/None), return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  Extract the three segments of the sequence:
    a.  `leading_zeros`: The segment from the beginning of the sequence up to (but not including) `start_index`.
    b.  `core_subsequence`: The segment from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
    c.  `trailing_zeros`: The segment from the position immediately after `end_index` to the end of the sequence.
6.  Reverse the order of the elements within the `core_subsequence`.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `leading_zeros`, the reversed `core_subsequence`, and the `trailing_zeros` in that order.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
