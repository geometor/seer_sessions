*   **General Assessment:** The provided examples consistently demonstrate a pattern where a contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits within a larger sequence is reversed, while any leading or trailing zeros remain in their original positions. The initial natural language program accurately captured this observed transformation. The execution results, however, show that the provided code (`code_00.py`) failed to implement this transformation, consistently returning the input sequence unchanged. This indicates an implementation error in the code that was tested, rather than a misunderstanding of the task requirements based on the examples. The strategy is to proceed with the original understanding of the transformation logic, as it perfectly aligns with all input/output pairs, and ensure the coder phase correctly implements this logic.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   The execution results show that for every training and test example, the `transform` function returned the original input sequence.
    *   `Match: False` for all examples except potentially cases where the input requires no change (e.g., all zeros, or a single non-zero digit), although no such specific cases were highlighted as matching.
    *   `Pixels Off` (interpreted here as differing elements) varies depending on the length and content of the non-zero subsequence that *should* have been reversed. For instance, `train_1` has 4 non-zero elements (`4 7 9 1` -> `1 9 7 4`), resulting in 4 differing elements. `train_2` has 12 non-zero elements, all needing reversal, resulting in 12 differing elements. `train_6` has 2 non-zero elements (`8 3` -> `3 8`), resulting in 2 differing elements. The reported "Pixels Off" values align with the number of elements within the non-zero subsequence that would change position upon reversal.
    *   `Size Correct: True` for all examples, as the length of the sequence is preserved.
    *   `Color Palette Correct: True` and `Color Count Correct: True`, as the digits themselves are preserved, only their order within the subsequence changes.

```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input_datatype: sequence of integers (represented as space-separated strings)
    output_datatype: sequence of integers (represented as space-separated strings)
    input_structure: 1D list or array of integers.
    output_structure: 1D list or array of integers, same length as input.
    zero_handling: Zeros act as delimiters for the subsequence to be transformed.
    objects:
      - sequence: The input list/array of integers.
      - non_zero_subsequence: The contiguous part of the sequence starting from the first non-zero integer and ending at the last non-zero integer. Can be empty if the sequence contains only zeros.
      - leading_zeros: The contiguous sequence of zeros at the beginning of the input sequence, before the `non_zero_subsequence`. Can be empty.
      - trailing_zeros: The contiguous sequence of zeros at the end of the input sequence, after the `non_zero_subsequence`. Can be empty.
    properties:
      - integers: Can be zero or non-zero.
      - index: Position within the sequence.
      - start_index: Index of the first non-zero integer.
      - end_index: Index of the last non-zero integer.
    actions:
      - find_indices: Locate the start_index and end_index of the non_zero_subsequence.
      - extract: Separate the sequence into three parts: leading_zeros, non_zero_subsequence, and trailing_zeros based on start_index and end_index.
      - reverse: Reverse the order of elements within the extracted non_zero_subsequence.
      - concatenate: Combine the leading_zeros, the reversed non_zero_subsequence, and the trailing_zeros in that order.
    relationships:
      - The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
      - The elements in the leading_zeros part of the input sequence appear unchanged and in the same positions in the output sequence.
      - The elements in the trailing_zeros part of the input sequence appear unchanged and in the same positions in the output sequence.
      - The elements in the non_zero_subsequence part of the input sequence appear in reversed order in the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
      - If no non-zero elements exist, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
      - If all elements are non-zero, the entire output sequence is the reverse of the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Read the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Identify the index of the first non-zero integer (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero integer (`end_index`) in the sequence.
    3.  If no non-zero integers are found (e.g., the sequence is all zeros), return the original sequence unchanged.
    4.  Otherwise, define three segments of the sequence:
        a.  The `leading_zeros` segment: from the beginning of the sequence up to (but not including) `start_index`.
        b.  The `non_zero_subsequence` segment: from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
        c.  The `trailing_zeros` segment: from the position immediately after `end_index` to the end of the sequence.
    5.  Reverse the order of the integers within the `non_zero_subsequence` segment.
    6.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `leading_zeros` segment, the reversed `non_zero_subsequence` segment, and the `trailing_zeros` segment in that order.
    7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
