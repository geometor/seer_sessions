            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where a specific subsequence within a list of digits is reversed. The results indicate that the previous code implementation failed entirely, returning the input unchanged for all test cases. This suggests either a fundamental flaw in the code's logic execution (perhaps an early exit or incorrect condition check) or an issue with how the test harness invoked the function or processed its input/output.\n\nHowever, the underlying pattern observed across all examples remains consistent:\n1.  Identify the contiguous block of digits starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit.\n2.  Reverse only this identified block.\n3.  Keep any leading and trailing zero digits in their original positions.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the description of this process, ensuring clarity and accuracy based on the complete set of examples, assuming the core logic identified is correct and the previous execution failure was an implementation bug.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples:\n\n| Example   | Input Sequence             | Output Sequence            | First Non-Zero Index | Last Non-Zero Index | Subsequence          | Reversed Subsequence | Leading Zeros | Trailing Zeros | Notes                      |\n| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------ | :------------- | :------------------------- |\n| train\\_1  | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 7 9 1 0`  | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 9 7 4 0`  | 7                    | 10                  | `[4, 7, 9, 1]`       | `[1, 9, 7, 4]`       | 7             | 1              |                            |\n| train\\_2  | `4 7 9 2 4 6 2 3 4 3 1 5`  | `5 1 3 4 3 2 6 4 2 9 7 4`  | 0                    | 11                  | `[4, ..., 5]`        | `[5, ..., 4]`        | 0             | 0              | All non-zero, full reverse |\n| train\\_3  | `0 0 0 8 6 6 6 6 1 8 1 3`  | `0 0 0 3 1 8 1 6 6 6 6 8`  | 3                    | 11                  | `[8, ..., 3]`        | `[3, ..., 8]`        | 3             | 0              |                            |\n| train\\_4  | `3 7 4 7 7 1 3 6 8 6 4 9`  | `9 4 6 8 6 3 1 7 7 4 7 3`  | 0                    | 11                  | `[3, ..., 9]`        | `[9, ..., 3]`        | 0             | 0              | All non-zero, full reverse |\n| train\\_5  | `0 9 6 7 5 8 9 2 2 3 1 0`  | `0 1 3 2 2 9 8 5 7 6 9 0`  | 1                    | 10                  | `[9, ..., 1]`        | `[1, ..., 9]`        | 1             | 1              |                            |\n| train\\_6  | `8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | `3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | 0                    | 1                   | `[8, 3]`             | `[3, 8]`             | 0             | 10             |                            |\n| train\\_7  | `0 0 3 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | `0 0 8 6 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | 2                    | 4                   | `[3, 6, 8]`          | `[8, 6, 3]`          | 2             | 7              |                            |\n| test\\_1   | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 3`  | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 9 2`  | 9                    | 11                  | `[2, 9, 3]`          | `[3, 9, 2]`          | 9             | 0              |                            |\n| Edge Case | `0 0 0 0`                | `0 0 0 0`                | N/A                  | N/A                 | `[]`                 | `[]`                 | 4             | 0              | (Inferred) All zeros       |\n\n## Facts\n\n"
