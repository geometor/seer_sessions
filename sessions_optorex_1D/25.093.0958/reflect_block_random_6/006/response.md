## General Assessment

The provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where a specific subsequence within a list of digits is reversed. The results indicate that the previous code implementation failed entirely, returning the input unchanged for all test cases. This suggests either a fundamental flaw in the code's logic execution (perhaps an early exit or incorrect condition check) or an issue with how the test harness invoked the function or processed its input/output.

However, the underlying pattern observed across all examples remains consistent:
1.  Identify the contiguous block of digits starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit.
2.  Reverse only this identified block.
3.  Keep any leading and trailing zero digits in their original positions.

The strategy is to refine the description of this process, ensuring clarity and accuracy based on the complete set of examples, assuming the core logic identified is correct and the previous execution failure was an implementation bug.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (represented as a list or array).
2.  Identify the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`).
3.  Identify the index of the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
4.  **Handle Edge Case**: If no non-zero digits are found (`start_index` is invalid/None), return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  Extract the three segments of the sequence:
    a.  `leading_zeros`: The segment from the beginning of the sequence up to (but not including) `start_index`.
    b.  `core_subsequence`: The segment from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
    c.  `trailing_zeros`: The segment from the position immediately after `end_index` to the end of the sequence.
6.  Reverse the order of the elements within the `core_subsequence`.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `leading_zeros`, the reversed `core_subsequence`, and the `trailing_zeros` in that order.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
