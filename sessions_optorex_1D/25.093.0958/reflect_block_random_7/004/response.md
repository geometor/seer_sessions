**General Assessment and Strategy**

The execution results consistently show a `ValueError` during the input processing stage (`invalid literal for int()`). This indicates that the `transform` function, specifically the part responsible for converting the input into a list of integers, is failing. The error message suggests that the `int()` function is receiving a string that looks like the string representation of a list (e.g., `'[5, 9, 3, ...]'`) instead of a string representing a single digit (e.g., `'5'`).

This likely stems from how the input `input_data` is being passed to the function during testing versus how the function expects to receive it or how it handles different types. The original code attempts type checking (`isinstance`), but the error implies that either:
1.  The input data is consistently passed as a string, but it's formatted as `"[...]"`, causing `split()` to produce incorrect parts like `'[5,'`.
2.  The type checking logic isn't correctly routing the input, or there's a fallback path that incorrectly treats a non-string input as a string representation.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Robust Input Parsing:** Modify the input handling section of the `transform` function to reliably convert the input into a `list[int]`, regardless of whether it receives a space-separated string (e.g., `"5 9 3"`), a list of numbers (e.g., `[5, 9, 3]`), or a NumPy array. Ensure that string representations of lists (`"[5, 9, 3]"`) are handled gracefully or raise a more informative error if this format is considered invalid. Based on the error, the most critical fix is likely within the `isinstance(input_data, str)` block to handle only space-separated digit strings correctly.
2.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying logic of identifying leading/trailing zeros, extracting the core block, reversing it, and concatenating seems sound based on the initial analysis of the examples. The focus should be on fixing the input stage first.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the refined understanding of required input handling.

**Metrics Gathering**

The primary metric from the execution results is the error itself:
*   **Error Type:** `ValueError`
*   **Cause:** Attempting `int()` conversion on an invalid string literal (e.g., `'[5,'`, `'[0,'`).
*   **Frequency:** Occurred on 100% of the provided examples (7 train, 1 test shown).
*   **Location:** Input processing phase, before the core transformation logic is applied.

No `tool_code` is needed as the error message provides the necessary information for this stage.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    origin: input_data
    target: output_string
    rule: The output_string is formed by first robustly parsing input_data into input_list. Then, identify the leading_zeros, the core_block (between first and last non-zeros), and the trailing_zeros. The output_sequence is constructed by concatenating leading_zeros, the reversed core_block, and trailing_zeros. Finally, format output_sequence into output_string. If input_list contains only zeros, the output_string is identical to the formatted input_list.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Parsing:** Receive the input data. Determine its type (space-separated string, list, or NumPy array). Convert it into a standardized list of integers called `input_list`.
    *   If the input is a string, split it by spaces. Convert each resulting part into an integer. Handle potential errors if parts are not valid integers.
    *   If the input is a list or NumPy array, ensure all its elements are converted to integers.
2.  **Handle Empty/All-Zero Case:** If `input_list` is empty, return an empty string. If `input_list` contains only zeros, format it directly into the output string and return it.
3.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find the index of the first non-zero element (`first_nz`) and the index of the last non-zero element (`last_nz`) in `input_list`.
4.  **Extract Components:**
    *   Extract the `leading_zeros`: the sublist from the start of `input_list` up to index `first_nz`.
    *   Extract the `core_block`: the sublist from index `first_nz` up to and including index `last_nz`.
    *   Extract the `trailing_zeros`: the sublist from the index after `last_nz` to the end of `input_list`.
5.  **Reverse Core:** Create a `reversed_core_block` by reversing the order of elements in the `core_block`.
6.  **Concatenate:** Construct the final `output_sequence` list by concatenating `leading_zeros`, `reversed_core_block`, and `trailing_zeros` in that order.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert the `output_sequence` list into a space-separated string and return it.
