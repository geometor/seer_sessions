objects:
  - name: input_data
    type: string | list[int] | numpy.ndarray
    description: The input sequence, which can be provided as a space-separated string of digits, a list of integers, or a NumPy array of integers.
  - name: input_list
    type: list[int]
    description: The sequence of digits derived from input_data, represented uniformly as a list of integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The transformed sequence of digits as a list of integers before final formatting.
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: The final transformed sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
  - name: leading_zeros
    type: list[int]
    description: A sublist containing zeros from the beginning of input_list, up to the first non-zero digit. Can be empty.
  - name: trailing_zeros
    type: list[int]
    description: A sublist containing zeros from the end of input_list, starting after the last non-zero digit. Can be empty.
  - name: core_block
    type: list[int]
    description: The contiguous sublist of input_list between the leading and trailing zeros (inclusive of the first and last non-zero elements). If there are no non-zero elements, this block is conceptually empty or spans the whole list depending on implementation details, but the effect is the list remains unchanged.
properties:
  - object: input_list
    name: elements
    type: list of integers
  - object: input_list
    name: length
    type: integer
actions:
  - name: robust_parse_input
    input: input_data
    output: input_list
    description: Convert the input_data (string, list, or ndarray) into a standardized list of integers (input_list). Handle potential formatting issues gracefully. If input is a string, split by spaces and convert parts to int. If list/array, convert elements to int.
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    input: input_list
    output: integer (index) or None
    description: Find the index of the first element in the list that is not zero. Return None or -1 if all are zero.
  - name: find_last_non_zero_index
    input: input_list
    output: integer (index) or None
    description: Find the index of the last element in the list that is not zero. Return None or -1 if all are zero.
  - name: extract_sublist
    input: list, start_index, end_index
    output: list
    description: Get a portion of a list based on start and end indices.
  - name: reverse_list
    input: list
    output: list
    description: Reverse the order of elements in a given list.
  - name: concatenate_lists
    input: list_1, list_2, list_3
    output: list
    description: Combine multiple lists into a single list in the specified order (leading_zeros, reversed_core, trailing_zeros).
  - name: format_output
    input: output_sequence (list[int])
    output: output_string (string)
    description: Convert the final list of integers back into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    origin: input_data
    target: output_string
    rule: The output_string is formed by first robustly parsing input_data into input_list. Then, identify the leading_zeros, the core_block (between first and last non-zeros), and the trailing_zeros. The output_sequence is constructed by concatenating leading_zeros, the reversed core_block, and trailing_zeros. Finally, format output_sequence into output_string. If input_list contains only zeros, the output_string is identical to the formatted input_list.
