            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results consistently show a `ValueError` during the input processing stage (`invalid literal for int()`). This indicates that the `transform` function, specifically the part responsible for converting the input into a list of integers, is failing. The error message suggests that the `int()` function is receiving a string that looks like the string representation of a list (e.g., `'[5, 9, 3, ...]'`) instead of a string representing a single digit (e.g., `'5'`).\n\nThis likely stems from how the input `input_data` is being passed to the function during testing versus how the function expects to receive it or how it handles different types. The original code attempts type checking (`isinstance`), but the error implies that either:\n1.  The input data is consistently passed as a string, but it's formatted as `\"[...]\"`, causing `split()` to produce incorrect parts like `'[5,'`.\n2.  The type checking logic isn't correctly routing the input, or there's a fallback path that incorrectly treats a non-string input as a string representation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Robust Input Parsing:** Modify the input handling section of the `transform` function to reliably convert the input into a `list[int]`, regardless of whether it receives a space-separated string (e.g., `\"5 9 3\"`), a list of numbers (e.g., `[5, 9, 3]`), or a NumPy array. Ensure that string representations of lists (`\"[5, 9, 3]\"`) are handled gracefully or raise a more informative error if this format is considered invalid. Based on the error, the most critical fix is likely within the `isinstance(input_data, str)` block to handle only space-separated digit strings correctly.\n2.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying logic of identifying leading/trailing zeros, extracting the core block, reversing it, and concatenating seems sound based on the initial analysis of the examples. The focus should be on fixing the input stage first.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the refined understanding of required input handling.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe primary metric from the execution results is the error itself:\n*   **Error Type:** `ValueError`\n*   **Cause:** Attempting `int()` conversion on an invalid string literal (e.g., `'[5,'`, `'[0,'`).\n*   **Frequency:** Occurred on 100% of the provided examples (7 train, 1 test shown).\n*   **Location:** Input processing phase, before the core transformation logic is applied.\n\nNo `tool_code` is needed as the error message provides the necessary information for this stage.\n\n**Facts Documentation**\n\n"
