objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of digits provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of digits produced as output.
  - name: leading_zeros
    type: list of integers
    description: A sublist containing zeros from the beginning of the input sequence, up to the first non-zero digit. Can be empty.
  - name: trailing_zeros
    type: list of integers
    description: A sublist containing zeros from the end of the input sequence, starting after the last non-zero digit. Can be empty.
  - name: core_block
    type: list of integers
    description: The contiguous sublist of the input sequence between the leading and trailing zeros (inclusive of the first and last non-zero elements). If there are no zeros, this is the entire input sequence.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - name: identify_leading_zeros
    description: Find the sublist of zeros at the start of the sequence.
  - name: identify_trailing_zeros
    description: Find the sublist of zeros at the end of the sequence.
  - name: identify_core_block
    description: Extract the sublist located between the leading and trailing zeros.
  - name: reverse_list
    input: list
    output: list
    description: Reverse the order of elements in a given list.
  - name: concatenate_lists
    input: list_1, list_2, list_3
    output: list
    description: Combine multiple lists into a single list in the specified order.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the final list of integers back into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    origin: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is formed by concatenating the leading_zeros, the reversed core_block, and the trailing_zeros from the input_sequence.
