            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are strings representing sequences of single digits separated by spaces.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence (12 digits in all examples).\n3.  **Element Conservation:** The digits present in the output are the same digits present in the input, just potentially in a different order. This suggests a rearrangement or reversal operation.\n4.  **Role of Zeros:** Zeros at the beginning and end of the sequence appear to maintain their positions relative to the start and end. For instance, in `train_2`, `0 0` at the start and `0` at the end remain. In `train_6`, `0 0 0 0` at the start and `0 0` at the end remain.\n5.  **Core Transformation:** The digits *between* the leading and trailing zeros (the contiguous block of non-zero digits, or the block including non-zeros if there are no leading/trailing zeros) seem to be reversed.\n    *   `train_1`: `5 9 3 6 2 6 6 1 6 2 3 3` (no leading/trailing zeros) -> reversed `3 3 2 6 1 6 6 2 6 3 9 5`.\n    *   `train_2`: `0 0 [2 4 9 5 9 2 7 8 2] 0` -> `0 0 [2 8 7 2 9 5 9 4 2] 0` (block `2...2` is reversed).\n    *   `train_5`: `[4 8 6 4 7 4 4 8 1 5] 0 0` -> `[5 1 8 4 4 7 4 6 8 4] 0 0` (block `4...5` is reversed).\n    *   `train_6`: `0 0 0 0 [7 9 2 5 2 1] 0 0` -> `0 0 0 0 [1 2 5 2 9 7] 0 0` (block `7...1` is reversed).\n\n**Facts Documentation:**\n\n"
