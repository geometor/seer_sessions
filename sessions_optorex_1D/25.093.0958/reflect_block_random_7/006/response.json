            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed consistently across all training examples with a `TypeError` during input parsing. This indicates the core transformation logic (reversing the segment between non-zero elements) was never reached. The error message, \"only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\", strongly suggests that the input data, when passed as a NumPy array (common in the ARC environment), is not being correctly processed into a flat list of integers. The `_parse_input_to_list` function attempted to iterate through the NumPy array and convert items directly to `int`, but items in a multi-dimensional array can be arrays themselves, causing the failure.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the input parsing step (`_parse_input_to_list`) to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs by first flattening them into a 1D structure before attempting to convert elements to integers. The core logic of identifying leading/trailing zeros and reversing the central block appears sound based on the visual examples and should be preserved.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Total Examples:** 7\n*   **Successful Examples:** 0\n*   **Failed Examples:** 7 (100%)\n*   **Error Type:** `TypeError: Input list/array contains non-integer elements: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`\n*   **Cause:** The `_parse_input_to_list` function does not correctly handle the conversion of NumPy array inputs (potentially 2D, e.g., 1xN or Nx1) into a 1D list of scalar integers. It attempts to apply `int()` to array elements which might themselves be arrays.\n\n**Facts Documentation:**\n\n"

Handle empty input (return an empty string or list).\n2.  **Find Non-Zero Boundaries:**\n    *   Find the index of the first non-zero element in `input_sequence`. If no non-zero elements exist (the list is empty or contains only zeros), proceed to step 6 using the original `input_sequence`.\n    *   Find the index of the last non-zero element in `input_sequence`.\n3.  **Extract Components:**\n    *   Extract the sublist of leading zeros: elements from the start of `input_sequence` up to (but not including) the first non-zero element. Store this as `leading_zeros`.\n    *   Extract the sublist of trailing zeros: elements from the position after the last non-zero element to the end of `input_sequence`. Store this as `trailing_zeros`.\n    *   Extract the core sublist: elements from the first non-zero element up to and including the last non-zero element. Store this as `core_block`.\n4.  **Reverse Core:** Reverse the order of elements within the `core_block`.\n5.  **Construct Output List:** Create the final `output_sequence` by concatenating `leading_zeros`, the reversed `core_block`, and `trailing_zeros` in that order.\n6.  **Format Output:** Convert the `output_sequence` (or the original `input_sequence` if it contained only zeros) into a string of space-separated digits. Return this string."
