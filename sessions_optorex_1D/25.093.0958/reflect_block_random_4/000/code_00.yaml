objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single-digit integers (0-9).
    properties:
      - length: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - elements: The individual integers in the sequence.
      - contains_zeros: Boolean indicating if the sequence includes the digit 0.
      - contains_non_zeros: Boolean indicating if the sequence includes digits 1-9.
  - type: sub-sequence
    description: A contiguous portion of the main sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first element of the sub-sequence in the main sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last element of the sub-sequence in the main sequence.
      - elements: The integers within the sub-sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_segment
    description: Find the portion of the sequence from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element.
    inputs:
      - sequence: The input sequence.
    outputs:
      - start_index: Index of the first non-zero element (or None if all zeros).
      - end_index: Index of the last non-zero element (or None if all zeros).
  - name: extract_sub_sequence
    description: Get the elements within a specified range of indices.
    inputs:
      - sequence: The main sequence.
      - start_index: The starting index (inclusive).
      - end_index: The ending index (inclusive).
    outputs:
      - sub_sequence: The extracted sequence of elements.
  - name: reverse_sequence
    description: Reverse the order of elements in a sequence.
    inputs:
      - sequence: The sequence to be reversed.
    outputs:
      - reversed_sequence: The sequence with elements in reverse order.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Build the final output sequence by replacing the identified segment with its reversed version.
    inputs:
      - original_sequence: The input sequence.
      - start_index: The start index of the segment that was reversed.
      - end_index: The end index of the segment that was reversed.
      - reversed_sub_sequence: The reversed segment.
    outputs:
      - output_sequence: The final transformed sequence.

relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
  - Elements outside the segment defined by the first and last non-zero numbers remain in their original positions.
  - The segment from the first non-zero number to the last non-zero number in the input corresponds to the reversed version of that same segment in the output.
  - If the input sequence contains no non-zero numbers, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
