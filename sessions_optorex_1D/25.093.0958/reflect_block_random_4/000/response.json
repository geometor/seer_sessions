Each input sequence is transformed into an output sequence of the same length. The key observation is the role of the zero ('0') elements versus the non-zero elements. The zeros appear to act as padding or boundaries, while the core transformation happens on the contiguous block of non-zero numbers (and any zeros interspersed *within* that block). Specifically, the segment of the sequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit is reversed. The zeros outside this segment (leading and trailing zeros) remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
