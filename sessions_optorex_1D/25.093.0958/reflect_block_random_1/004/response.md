**General Assessment and Strategy**

The test results indicate that the previously generated code (`code_00.py`) failed to perform *any* transformation, simply returning the input sequence as the output in all cases. However, a manual re-analysis of the input/output examples strongly confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation involves reversing the sub-sequence located between the first and last non-zero elements, leaving leading and trailing zeros untouched.

This discrepancy suggests the failure lies not in the *understanding* of the transformation rule (the logic), but likely in the execution or integration of the code within the testing environment, or perhaps a subtle implementation detail that caused it to bypass the transformation logic entirely (though the provided code structure seems sound for the described logic).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic derived from the examples.
2.  Gather metrics based on the *expected* outputs compared to the inputs to solidify the understanding of the boundaries and the reversed segment.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise and unambiguous, guiding the coder phase effectively. Assume the core logic is correct and focus on clear specification.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze a few examples to confirm the pattern of segment reversal between the first and last non-zero elements.

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 6, 8, 6, 5, 8, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 8]`
    *   Output: `[0, 8, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 8, 5, 6, 8, 6]`
    *   First non-zero index: 1 (value 6)
    *   Last non-zero index: 11 (value 8)
    *   Prefix: `[0]`
    *   Suffix: `[]`
    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 8, 6, 5, 8, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 8]`
    *   Middle (Output): `[8, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 8, 5, 6, 8, 6]`
    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.
    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 0]`
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6, 0]`
    *   First non-zero index: 6 (value 6)
    *   Last non-zero index: 10 (value 4)
    *   Prefix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Suffix: `[0]`
    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 7, 8, 5, 4]`
    *   Middle (Output): `[4, 5, 8, 7, 6]`
    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.
    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.

*   **train_7:**
    *   Input: `[6, 8, 2, 1, 8, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Output: `[5, 5, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   First non-zero index: 0 (value 6)
    *   Last non-zero index: 6 (value 5)
    *   Prefix: `[]`
    *   Suffix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 8, 2, 1, 8, 5, 5]`
    *   Middle (Output): `[5, 5, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6]`
    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.
    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.

The pattern holds consistently across all examples. The transformation rule is robust.

      - reversed_core_segment
      - trailing_zeros_segment
    outputs: output_sequence
    description: Combine the segments in order (leading, reversed core, trailing) to form the final output sequence. If the input was all zeros, this effectively reconstructs the original sequence.

special_cases:
  - condition: input_sequence contains only zeros

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Determine the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`).
3.  Determine the index of the last non-zero element (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-zero element is found (i.e., the sequence consists entirely of zeros), return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  Otherwise (if at least one non-zero element exists):
    a.  Extract the `prefix` sub-sequence: elements from the start of the sequence up to (but not including) `start_index`.
    b.  Extract the `core` sub-sequence: elements from `start_index` up to and including `end_index`.
    c.  Extract the `suffix` sub-sequence: elements from the index immediately after `end_index` to the end of the sequence.
    d.  Reverse the order of the elements within the `core` sub-sequence.
    e.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `prefix`, the reversed `core` sub-sequence, and the `suffix`, in that order.
6.  Return the constructed or original output sequence.
