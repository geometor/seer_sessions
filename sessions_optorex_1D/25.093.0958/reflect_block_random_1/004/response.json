            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe test results indicate that the previously generated code (`code_00.py`) failed to perform *any* transformation, simply returning the input sequence as the output in all cases. However, a manual re-analysis of the input/output examples strongly confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation involves reversing the sub-sequence located between the first and last non-zero elements, leaving leading and trailing zeros untouched.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests the failure lies not in the *understanding* of the transformation rule (the logic), but likely in the execution or integration of the code within the testing environment, or perhaps a subtle implementation detail that caused it to bypass the transformation logic entirely (though the provided code structure seems sound for the described logic).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic derived from the examples.\n2.  Gather metrics based on the *expected* outputs compared to the inputs to solidify the understanding of the boundaries and the reversed segment.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise and unambiguous, guiding the coder phase effectively. Assume the core logic is correct and focus on clear specification.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze a few examples to confirm the pattern of segment reversal between the first and last non-zero elements.\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 6, 8, 6, 5, 8, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 8]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 8, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 8, 5, 6, 8, 6]`\n    *   First non-zero index: 1 (value 6)\n    *   Last non-zero index: 11 (value 8)\n    *   Prefix: `[0]`\n    *   Suffix: `[]`\n    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 8, 6, 5, 8, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 8]`\n    *   Middle (Output): `[8, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 8, 5, 6, 8, 6]`\n    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.\n    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.\n\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 0]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6, 0]`\n    *   First non-zero index: 6 (value 6)\n    *   Last non-zero index: 10 (value 4)\n    *   Prefix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Suffix: `[0]`\n    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 7, 8, 5, 4]`\n    *   Middle (Output): `[4, 5, 8, 7, 6]`\n    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.\n    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.\n\n*   **train_7:**\n    *   Input: `[6, 8, 2, 1, 8, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Output: `[5, 5, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   First non-zero index: 0 (value 6)\n    *   Last non-zero index: 6 (value 5)\n    *   Prefix: `[]`\n    *   Suffix: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Middle (Input): `[6, 8, 2, 1, 8, 5, 5]`\n    *   Middle (Output): `[5, 5, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6]`\n    *   Is Output Middle the reverse of Input Middle? Yes.\n    *   Prefix matches? Yes. Suffix matches? Yes.\n\nThe pattern holds consistently across all examples. The transformation rule is robust.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
