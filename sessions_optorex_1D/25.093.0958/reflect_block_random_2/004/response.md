**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying the contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits within an input sequence and reversing only that sub-sequence, leaving leading and trailing zeros untouched. The logic appears sound based on the string representation of the input/output examples.

However, the execution results show a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples. This strongly indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a `np.ndarray`, is receiving a 2D array (even possibly a 1xN or Nx1 array) instead of the implicitly assumed 1D array. The comparison `val != 0` within the helper functions (`_find_first_non_zero_index`, `_find_last_non_zero_index`) fails when `val` is an array resulting from iterating over a 2D NumPy array.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential 2D inputs. Check the dimensions of the `input_grid`.
2.  **Flattening:** If the input is 2D but effectively 1D (shape 1xN or Nx1), flatten it to a 1D array before applying the core logic. Store the original shape.
3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the existing logic (find first/last non-zero indices, extract parts, reverse middle part, concatenate) to the 1D array.
4.  **Reshaping:** Reshape the resulting 1D array back to the original shape of the input grid before returning it.
5.  **Ambiguity:** Acknowledge that if the input grid is truly 2D (MxN where M>1 and N>1), the current transformation rule is ambiguous based on the examples. The flattening approach is a reasonable assumption for effectively 1D grids represented in 2D.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Based on the initial string format and the transformation's nature (reversing a segment), the inputs behave like 1D sequences. The error confirms they are passed as NumPy arrays, likely 2D arrays with one dimension being size 1 (row or column vectors).

*   **Example 1:** Input `[2 6 2 3 6 7 4 4 8 1 1 3]`. Output `[3 1 1 8 4 4 7 6 3 2 6 2]`. All non-zero. Entire sequence reversed.
*   **Example 2:** Input `[2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 0, last non-zero index 1. Sub-sequence `[2 7]` reversed to `[7 2]`. Trailing zeros preserved.
*   **Example 3:** Input `[0 0 6 9 3 9 2 1 7 1 7 4]`. Output `[0 0 4 7 1 7 1 2 9 3 9 6]`. First non-zero index 2, last non-zero index 11. Sub-sequence `[6 9 3 9 2 1 7 1 7 4]` reversed to `[4 7 1 7 1 2 9 3 9 6]`. Leading zeros preserved.
*   **Example 4:** Input `[0 0 2 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[0 0 1 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 2, last non-zero index 5. Sub-sequence `[2 1 8 1]` reversed to `[1 8 1 2]`. Leading and trailing zeros preserved.
*   **Example 5:** Input `[2 1 5 3 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[8 3 3 5 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 0, last non-zero index 5. Sub-sequence `[2 1 5 3 3 8]` reversed to `[8 3 3 5 1 2]`. Trailing zeros preserved.
*   **Example 6:** Input `[8 8 6 7 5 9 9 7 2 2 6 1]`. Output `[1 6 2 2 7 9 9 5 7 6 8 8]`. All non-zero. Entire sequence reversed.
*   **Example 7:** Input `[0 0 0 6 2 1 4 1 6 8 2 1]`. Output `[0 0 0 1 2 8 6 1 4 1 2 6]`. First non-zero index 3, last non-zero index 11. Sub-sequence `[6 2 1 4 1 6 8 2 1]` reversed to `[1 2 8 6 1 4 1 2 6]`. Leading zeros preserved.

The pattern holds consistently: identify the segment between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive) and reverse only that segment. The NumPy error needs correction by handling the input array format properly.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid (NumPy array) and store its original shape.
2.  If the grid has more than one dimension, check if it's effectively 1D (i.e., shape 1xN or Nx1). If yes, flatten it into a 1D sequence. If it's truly 2D (MxN with M>1, N>1), the behavior is undefined by examples; assume flattening for now or handle as an error. If the grid is already 1D, use it directly as the sequence.
3.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the 1D sequence.
4.  If no non-zero digit exists (all zeros), construct the output grid by creating a copy of the original input grid (maintaining its shape) and stop.
5.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the 1D sequence.
6.  Extract three parts from the 1D sequence:
    a.  The `leading_part`: elements from the start up to (but not including) the first non-zero digit.
    b.  The `middle_part`: elements from the first non-zero digit up to and including the last non-zero digit.
    c.  The `trailing_part`: elements from after the last non-zero digit to the end of the sequence.
7.  Reverse the order of the elements within the `middle_part` to create the `reversed_middle_part`.
8.  Construct the transformed 1D sequence by concatenating the `leading_part`, the `reversed_middle_part`, and the `trailing_part` in that order.
9.  Reshape the transformed 1D sequence back into the original shape stored in step 1.
10. Output the reshaped grid.
