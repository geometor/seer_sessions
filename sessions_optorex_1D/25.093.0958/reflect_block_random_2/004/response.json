            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying the contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits within an input sequence and reversing only that sub-sequence, leaving leading and trailing zeros untouched. The logic appears sound based on the string representation of the input/output examples.\n\nHowever, the execution results show a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples. This strongly indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a `np.ndarray`, is receiving a 2D array (even possibly a 1xN or Nx1 array) instead of the implicitly assumed 1D array. The comparison `val != 0` within the helper functions (`_find_first_non_zero_index`, `_find_last_non_zero_index`) fails when `val` is an array resulting from iterating over a 2D NumPy array.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential 2D inputs. Check the dimensions of the `input_grid`.\n2.  **Flattening:** If the input is 2D but effectively 1D (shape 1xN or Nx1), flatten it to a 1D array before applying the core logic. Store the original shape.\n3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the existing logic (find first/last non-zero indices, extract parts, reverse middle part, concatenate) to the 1D array.\n4.  **Reshaping:** Reshape the resulting 1D array back to the original shape of the input grid before returning it.\n5.  **Ambiguity:** Acknowledge that if the input grid is truly 2D (MxN where M>1 and N>1), the current transformation rule is ambiguous based on the examples. The flattening approach is a reasonable assumption for effectively 1D grids represented in 2D.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nBased on the initial string format and the transformation's nature (reversing a segment), the inputs behave like 1D sequences. The error confirms they are passed as NumPy arrays, likely 2D arrays with one dimension being size 1 (row or column vectors).\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[2 6 2 3 6 7 4 4 8 1 1 3]`. Output `[3 1 1 8 4 4 7 6 3 2 6 2]`. All non-zero. Entire sequence reversed.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 0, last non-zero index 1. Sub-sequence `[2 7]` reversed to `[7 2]`. Trailing zeros preserved.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0 0 6 9 3 9 2 1 7 1 7 4]`. Output `[0 0 4 7 1 7 1 2 9 3 9 6]`. First non-zero index 2, last non-zero index 11. Sub-sequence `[6 9 3 9 2 1 7 1 7 4]` reversed to `[4 7 1 7 1 2 9 3 9 6]`. Leading zeros preserved.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[0 0 2 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[0 0 1 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 2, last non-zero index 5. Sub-sequence `[2 1 8 1]` reversed to `[1 8 1 2]`. Leading and trailing zeros preserved.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[2 1 5 3 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[8 3 3 5 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. First non-zero index 0, last non-zero index 5. Sub-sequence `[2 1 5 3 3 8]` reversed to `[8 3 3 5 1 2]`. Trailing zeros preserved.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[8 8 6 7 5 9 9 7 2 2 6 1]`. Output `[1 6 2 2 7 9 9 5 7 6 8 8]`. All non-zero. Entire sequence reversed.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[0 0 0 6 2 1 4 1 6 8 2 1]`. Output `[0 0 0 1 2 8 6 1 4 1 2 6]`. First non-zero index 3, last non-zero index 11. Sub-sequence `[6 2 1 4 1 6 8 2 1]` reversed to `[1 2 8 6 1 4 1 2 6]`. Leading zeros preserved.\n\nThe pattern holds consistently: identify the segment between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive) and reverse only that segment. The NumPy error needs correction by handling the input array format properly.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If the grid has more than one dimension, check if it's effectively 1D (i.e., shape 1xN or Nx1). If yes, flatten it into a 1D sequence. If it's truly 2D (MxN with M>1, N>1), the behavior is undefined by examples; assume flattening for now or handle as an error. If the grid is already 1D, use it directly as the sequence.\n3.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the 1D sequence.\n4.  If no non-zero digit exists (all zeros), construct the output grid by creating a copy of the original input grid (maintaining its shape) and stop.\n5.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the 1D sequence.\n6.  Extract three parts from the 1D sequence:\n    a.  The `leading_part`: elements from the start up to (but not including) the first non-zero digit.\n    b.  The `middle_part`: elements from the first non-zero digit up to and including the last non-zero digit.\n    c.  The `trailing_part`: elements from after the last non-zero digit to the end of the sequence.\n7.  Reverse the order of the elements within the `middle_part` to create the `reversed_middle_part`.\n8.  Construct the transformed 1D sequence by concatenating the `leading_part`, the `reversed_middle_part`, and the `trailing_part` in that order.\n9.  Reshape the transformed 1D sequence back into the original shape stored in step 1.\n10. Output the reshaped grid."
