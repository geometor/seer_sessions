task_elements:
  - item: sequences
    properties:
      - type: list of single-digit integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - role: input and output
objects:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - contains digits (0-9)
      - may contain leading zeros
      - may contain trailing zeros
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - contains the same digits as input
      - same length as input
  - object: non_zero_subsequence
    derivation: The contiguous block of digits in the input sequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending at the last non-zero digit.
    properties:
      - may be the entire sequence if no leading/trailing zeros exist
      - may be empty if the input sequence contains only zeros
relationships:
  - relationship: position_preservation
    between: leading zeros in input_sequence
    and: leading zeros in output_sequence
    description: Leading zeros in the input maintain their positions at the start of the output.
  - relationship: position_preservation
    between: trailing zeros in input_sequence
    and: trailing zeros in output_sequence
    description: Trailing zeros in the input maintain their positions at the end of the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    on: input_sequence
    produces: start_index (index of first non-zero), end_index (index of last non-zero)
  - action: extract_subsequence
    on: input_sequence
    using: start_index, end_index
    produces: non_zero_subsequence
  - action: reverse_sequence
    on: non_zero_subsequence
    produces: reversed_non_zero_subsequence
  - action: construct_output
    using:
      - leading zeros (input[0:start_index])
      - reversed_non_zero_subsequence
      - trailing zeros (input[end_index+1:])
    produces: output_sequence
