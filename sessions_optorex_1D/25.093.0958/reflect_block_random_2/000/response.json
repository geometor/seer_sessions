These leading and trailing zeros seem to maintain their positions relative to the start and end of the sequence.\n5.  **Core Transformation:** The non-zero portion of the sequence appears to be reversed. In examples without leading or trailing zeros (train\\_1, train\\_6), the entire sequence is reversed. In examples with leading/trailing zeros, only the block of digits between the first non-zero digit and the last non-zero digit is reversed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
