            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input instead of the expected space-separated string. The testing environment likely loads the data directly into a numerical array format.\n\nThe core transformation logic, which involves identifying the first and last non-zero elements and reversing the segment between them (inclusive), appears consistent across all provided training examples based on manual verification (see thought process).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input type discrepancy. The function should expect a list or array of integers.\n2.  Verify the core transformation logic (reversing the non-zero segment) against all examples.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the correct input type and confirm the transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nSince the previous code failed during input processing, no execution metrics related to the transformation logic could be gathered. However, manual analysis confirms the pattern:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 6, 3, 1, 1, 9, 1, 6, 1, 2, 9, 4]`, Output `[0, 4, 9, 2, 1, 6, 1, 9, 1, 1, 3, 6]`. First non-zero index: 1, Last non-zero index: 11. Segment `[6..4]` reversed is `[4..6]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[9, 9, 4, 8, 6, 7, 5, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[2, 9, 5, 7, 6, 8, 4, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]`. First non-zero index: 0, Last non-zero index: 8. Segment `[9..2]` reversed is `[2..9]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 6, 4, 1]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 2, 8]`. First non-zero index: 7, Last non-zero index: 11. Segment `[8..1]` reversed is `[1..8]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[0, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 7, 7, 6, 2, 9]`, Output `[0, 0, 9, 2, 6, 7, 7, 5, 6, 1, 1, 9]`. First non-zero index: 2, Last non-zero index: 11. Segment `[9..9]` reversed is `[9..9]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[1, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 0]`, Output `[3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0]`. First non-zero index: 0, Last non-zero index: 10. Segment `[1..3]` reversed is `[3..1]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 6, 2, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, 0]`. First non-zero index: 4, Last non-zero index: 10. Segment `[4..2]` reversed is `[2..4]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[1, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[8, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. First non-zero index: 0, Last non-zero index: 2. Segment `[1, 9, 8]` reversed is `[8, 9, 1]`. Matches.\n\nThe transformation rule holds true for all examples. The only necessary correction is handling the input data type.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
