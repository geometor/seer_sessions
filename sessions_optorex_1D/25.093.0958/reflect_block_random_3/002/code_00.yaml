Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array)
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-9
Objects:
  - InputSequence: The list/array of 12 input digits.
  - NonZeroSegment: The contiguous sub-sequence within InputSequence, starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit.
  - LeadingZeros: The sub-sequence of zeros in InputSequence preceding the NonZeroSegment. Can be empty.
  - TrailingZeros: The sub-sequence of zeros in InputSequence following the NonZeroSegment. Can be empty.
  - OutputSequence: The resulting sequence after transformation.
Properties:
  - Sequence Length: Fixed at 12 for both input and output.
  - Digit Value: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index of the first occurrence of a non-zero digit in InputSequence. (-1 if all zeros).
  - LastNonZeroIndex: The index of the last occurrence of a non-zero digit in InputSequence. (-1 if all zeros).
Actions:
  - IdentifyBoundaries: Find the FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex in the InputSequence.
  - ExtractSegments: Isolate LeadingZeros, NonZeroSegment, and TrailingZeros based on the identified boundaries.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of digits within the NonZeroSegment.
  - Reconstruct: Concatenate LeadingZeros, the reversed NonZeroSegment, and TrailingZeros to form the OutputSequence.
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence.
  - NonZeroSegment is defined by FirstNonZeroIndex and LastNonZeroIndex.
  - LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros maintain their original positions relative to the overall sequence structure but flank the *reversed* NonZeroSegment in the output.
SpecialConditions:
  - If InputSequence contains only zeros (FirstNonZeroIndex is -1), OutputSequence is identical to InputSequence.
