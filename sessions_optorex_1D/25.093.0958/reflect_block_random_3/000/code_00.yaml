Data:
  Type: Sequence of digits
  Length: 12
  Delimiter: Space
Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of 12 input digits.
  - NonZeroSegment: The contiguous sub-sequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit.
  - LeadingZeros: The sequence of zeros preceding the NonZeroSegment.
  - TrailingZeros: The sequence of zeros following the NonZeroSegment.
Properties:
  - Sequence Length: Fixed at 12.
  - Digit Value: Integers from 0 to 9.
Actions:
  - Identify: Find the start and end indices of the NonZeroSegment.
  - Extract: Isolate the LeadingZeros, NonZeroSegment, and TrailingZeros.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of digits within the NonZeroSegment.
  - Reconstruct: Combine the LeadingZeros, the reversed NonZeroSegment, and the TrailingZeros to form the output sequence.
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroSegment is defined by the positions of the first and last non-zero digits in the input sequence.
  - LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros maintain their original positions relative to the overall sequence structure.
SpecialConditions:
  - If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
