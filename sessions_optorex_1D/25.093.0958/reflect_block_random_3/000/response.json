Leading and trailing zeros seem to act as boundaries, remaining fixed in their positions.\n4.  **Target Segment:** The segment of the sequence that undergoes reversal is the portion lying between the first non-zero digit and the last non-zero digit (inclusive).\n5.  **Edge Cases:**\n    *   If the sequence consists entirely of zeros, the output is identical to the input.\n    *   If there are no leading or trailing zeros, the entire sequence is reversed.\n    *   If there are only leading zeros or only trailing zeros, the reversal applies to the segment starting/ending with the first/last non-zero digit.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
