            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (reversing the sub-sequence between the first and last non-zero elements) appears correct based on the example pairs. The errors reported (`Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate a discrepancy between the function signature assumed in the previous `dreamer` phase (expecting a string input) and the actual data type passed during testing (a NumPy array).\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the understanding of the task to accept and return sequences of integers (specifically, accommodating NumPy arrays as suggested by the error) rather than space-separated strings. The fundamental algorithm of identifying the non-zero segment, reversing it, and reconstructing the sequence remains the same, but the implementation details regarding data handling (parsing/joining strings vs. manipulating sequences) need revision.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the error messages and simulation:\n\n1.  **Input Data Type:** `numpy.ndarray` containing integers.\n2.  **Output Data Type:** Expected to be `numpy.ndarray` containing integers (matching the input type).\n3.  **Error Cause:** Type mismatch. The function `transform(input_str: str)` attempted to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array object.\n4.  **Algorithm Validity:** The core algorithm (find first/last non-zero, slice, reverse, concatenate) is consistent with the input/output examples when applied to integer sequences. All training examples follow this pattern.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
