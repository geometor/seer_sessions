Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers (List or NumPy array)
  Length: 12
Objects:
  - InputSequence: The list or NumPy array of 12 input integers.
  - NonZeroSegment: The contiguous sub-sequence (list or array slice) starting from the first non-zero integer and ending with the last non-zero integer.
  - LeadingZeros: The sequence of zeros (list or array slice) preceding the NonZeroSegment.
  - TrailingZeros: The sequence of zeros (list or array slice) following the NonZeroSegment.
Properties:
  - Sequence Length: Fixed at 12.
  - Integer Value: Integers from 0 to 9.
Actions:
  - IdentifyIndices: Find the index of the first non-zero integer (`first_nz_idx`) and the index of the last non-zero integer (`last_nz_idx`) in the InputSequence.
  - Slice: Extract the LeadingZeros, NonZeroSegment, and TrailingZeros from the InputSequence based on the identified indices.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of integers within the NonZeroSegment.
  - Reconstruct: Combine the LeadingZeros, the reversed NonZeroSegment, and the TrailingZeros to form the output sequence, preserving the original data type (List or NumPy array).
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroSegment is defined by the positions of the first and last non-zero integers.
  - LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros maintain their original positions relative to the sequence structure.
SpecialConditions:
  - If the InputSequence contains only zeros, the output sequence is identical to the InputSequence.
