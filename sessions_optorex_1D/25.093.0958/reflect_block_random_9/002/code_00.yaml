Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, ReversedNonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
  - LeadingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integers (1-9)
      property: contiguous
      location: between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in InputSequence
  - TrailingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
  - ReversedNonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integers (1-9)
      location: between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in OutputSequence
      relation: Reverse order of NonZeroBlock from InputSequence

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock within the input list/array.
  - Extract: Isolate the LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, and TrailingZeros sub-sequences/sub-arrays.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of elements within the extracted NonZeroBlock.
  - Reconstruct: Assemble the OutputSequence by concatenating LeadingZeros, ReversedNonZeroBlock, and TrailingZeros.

Relationships:
  - The core transformation is the reversal of the contiguous sub-sequence/sub-array containing only non-zero digits.
  - The elements outside this non-zero sub-sequence/sub-array (leading and trailing zeros) maintain their original positions and values.
