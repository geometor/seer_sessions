**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed during execution because it expected a string input (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the function was actually receiving a NumPy array (or a similar list-like object) directly, not a string representation.

The core hypothesis about the transformation—reversing the contiguous block of non-zero digits while preserving leading and trailing zeros—appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided visually. The error is purely an implementation detail related to input handling.

The strategy is to modify the implementation to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`) and adjusting subsequent operations to work with this data structure. The underlying logic of identifying the non-zero block, reversing it, and reconstructing the sequence remains the same.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The error occurred uniformly across all examples at the input parsing stage. This confirms the input type is not a string as initially assumed. No further computational metrics are needed at this stage, as the conceptual logic derived from visual inspection hasn't been invalidated yet; only the input format assumption was wrong.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, ReversedNonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
  - LeadingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integers (1-9)
      property: contiguous
      location: between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in InputSequence
  - TrailingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
  - ReversedNonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      elements: integers (1-9)
      location: between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in OutputSequence
      relation: Reverse order of NonZeroBlock from InputSequence

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock within the input list/array.
  - Extract: Isolate the LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, and TrailingZeros sub-sequences/sub-arrays.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of elements within the extracted NonZeroBlock.
  - Reconstruct: Assemble the OutputSequence by concatenating LeadingZeros, ReversedNonZeroBlock, and TrailingZeros.

Relationships:
  - The core transformation is the reversal of the contiguous sub-sequence/sub-array containing only non-zero digits.
  - The elements outside this non-zero sub-sequence/sub-array (leading and trailing zeros) maintain their original positions and values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (as a list or array).
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`). If no non-zero digits exist, return the original input sequence.
3.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
4.  Extract the sub-sequence/sub-array of digits from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). This is the `NonZeroBlock`.
5.  Reverse the order of the digits within the extracted `NonZeroBlock`.
6.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the elements before `start_index`, the reversed `NonZeroBlock`, and the elements after `end_index`.
7.  Return the resulting sequence.
