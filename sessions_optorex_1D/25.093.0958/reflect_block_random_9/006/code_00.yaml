Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
      properties:
        - fixed_length (based on examples, but might not be general)
        - dtype: int
  - OutputSequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray
      elements: integers (0-9)
      structure: [LeadingZeros, ReversedNonZeroBlock, TrailingZeros]
      properties:
        - same length as InputSequence
        - dtype: int
  - LeadingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence (slice of numpy.ndarray)
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
      location: Start of the sequence, up to the first non-zero element. Can be empty.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence (slice of numpy.ndarray)
      elements: integers (1-9)
      property: contiguous
      location: Between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in InputSequence. Cannot contain zeros.
  - TrailingZeros:
      type: sub-sequence (slice of numpy.ndarray)
      elements: integer (0)
      relation: Identical in InputSequence and OutputSequence
      location: End of the sequence, after the last non-zero element. Can be empty.
  - ReversedNonZeroBlock:
      type: sub-sequence (slice of numpy.ndarray)
      elements: integers (1-9)
      location: Between LeadingZeros and TrailingZeros in OutputSequence
      relation: Reverse order of NonZeroBlock from InputSequence.

Actions:
  - IdentifyIndices: Locate the start index of the first non-zero element and the end index of the last non-zero element in the InputSequence. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist.
  - Slice: Extract the LeadingZeros, NonZeroBlock, and TrailingZeros sub-sequences using array slicing based on the identified indices.
  - Reverse: Reverse the order of elements within the extracted NonZeroBlock sub-sequence.
  - Reconstruct: Assemble the OutputSequence by concatenating the LeadingZeros, the ReversedNonZeroBlock, and the TrailingZeros, preserving the numpy.ndarray type.

Relationships:
  - The transformation solely affects the contiguous block of non-zero digits by reversing its order.
  - Zeros outside this central block act as fixed boundaries and remain unchanged in position and value.
  - The output sequence maintains the same length and element data type as the input sequence.
