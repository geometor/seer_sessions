They can be interpreted as lists of integers.\n2.  **Key Structure:** The sequences appear to have three distinct parts:\n    *   An optional sequence of leading zeros (`0`).\n    *   A central contiguous block of non-zero digits (1-9).\n    *   An optional sequence of trailing zeros (`0`).\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the leading and trailing zeros remain unchanged in their positions. The central block of non-zero digits appears to be reversed in the output compared to the input. This pattern holds consistently across all provided examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
