objects:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - element_type: integer (single digit, 0-9)
      - length: 12
  - type: block
    properties:
      - contiguity: true # elements are adjacent
      - element_value: non-zero (constant within the block)
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - exists_within: sequence

relationships:
  - block_is_part_of: sequence
  - input_sequence -> output_sequence: transformation applied

actions:
  - identify: locate the non-zero block within the input sequence (find start index, end index, and value)
  - shift: move the identified block to a new location in the output sequence
    properties:
      - direction: left (towards index 0)
      - magnitude: 3 positions
  - preserve: maintain the value and length of the non-zero block
  - fill: ensure positions outside the shifted block in the output sequence are zero

constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: 3
  - shift_direction: left
