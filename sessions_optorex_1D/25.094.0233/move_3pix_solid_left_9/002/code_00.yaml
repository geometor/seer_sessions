objects:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - element_type: integer (single digit, 0-9)
      - length: 12
      - format: list or array of integers # Adjusted based on error analysis
  - type: block
    properties:
      - contiguity: true # elements are adjacent
      - element_value: non-zero (constant within the block)
      - location: defined by start index within the sequence
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - exists_within: sequence

relationships:
  - block_is_part_of: sequence
  - input_sequence -> output_sequence: transformation applied

actions:
  - identify_block: locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its starting index, length, and the value of its digits.
  - calculate_new_position: determine the starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the original starting index.
  - construct_output: create a new sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
  - place_block: copy the identified block into the output sequence at the calculated new starting position. Ensure indices stay within bounds [0, 11].

constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: 3
  - shift_direction: left (negative index change)
  - background_value: 0 # Value used for positions outside the block
