objects:
  - type: grid # Changed from sequence to grid based on error
    properties:
      - element_type: integer (single digit, 0-9)
      - dimensions: 1 row, 12 columns # Explicitly defining dimensions
      - source: input
  - type: sequence # Derived 1D sequence from the grid row
    properties:
      - element_type: integer (single digit, 0-9)
      - length: 12
      - source: extracted from input grid row
  - type: block
    properties:
      - contiguity: true # elements are adjacent within the sequence
      - element_value: non-zero (constant within the block)
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - exists_within: sequence
  - type: output_sequence # The final transformed sequence
    properties:
      - element_type: integer (single digit, 0-9)
      - length: 12
      - background_value: 0

relationships:
  - sequence_is_derived_from: grid (specifically, the first row)
  - block_is_part_of: sequence
  - input_grid -> output_sequence: transformation applied

actions:
  - extract: obtain the 1D sequence from the single row of the input grid.
  - identify: locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the extracted sequence. Determine its start index, length, and value.
  - initialize: create a new output sequence of length 12, filled with zeros.
  - calculate_shift: determine the new start index for the block by subtracting the shift amount (3) from the original start index.
  - place_block: copy the identified block into the initialized output sequence at the calculated new start index, respecting sequence boundaries.

constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - grid_rows: 1
  - grid_cols: 12
  - shift_amount: 3
  - shift_direction: left (towards index 0)
  - background_value: 0
