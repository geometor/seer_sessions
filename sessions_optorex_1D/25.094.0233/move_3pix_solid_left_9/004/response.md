## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided examples and error messages strongly suggest that the core transformation logic (identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left) is correct. The failure across all examples with the error "Input sequence must be 1-dimensional" points directly to an incompatibility between the input format expected by the test environment (likely a 2D NumPy array, e.g., shape `(1, 12)`) and the input format assumed by the previous code (a 1D list or array, e.g., shape `(12,)`).

**Strategy:**
1.  **Confirm Input Format:** Assume the input `input_grid` is passed as a 2D NumPy array with one row (shape `(1, 12)`).
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the single row from the 2D input array before passing it to the `find_block_properties` function or processing it directly. The `find_block_properties` function itself seems robust for 1D sequences once it receives the correct input type.
3.  **Validate Logic:** Re-verify the constant left shift of 3 positions using metrics gathered from the examples.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to explicitly mention the input format handling (extracting the 1D sequence from the 2D input grid).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the block properties and shift for each example to confirm consistency.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_sequence(input_str, output_str):
    """Analyzes input and output sequences to find block properties and shift."""
    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]

    # Find input block
    start_in, end_in, val_in = -1, -1, 0
    for i, v in enumerate(input_list):
        if v != 0:
            if start_in == -1:
                start_in = i
                val_in = v
            elif v != val_in: # Should not happen based on problem description
                end_in = i
                break
        elif start_in != -1:
            end_in = i
            break
    if start_in != -1 and end_in == -1: # Block goes to the end
        end_in = len(input_list)

    length_in = end_in - start_in if start_in != -1 else 0

    # Find output block
    start_out = -1
    for i, v in enumerate(output_list):
         if v != 0:
             start_out = i
             break # Only need the start

    shift = start_in - start_out if start_in != -1 and start_out != -1 else None

    return {
        "input_start": start_in,
        "input_end": end_in,
        "input_length": length_in,
        "block_value": val_in,
        "output_start": start_out,
        "shift_amount": shift
    }

metrics = []
for i, (inp, outp) in enumerate(examples):
    metrics.append(analyze_sequence(inp, outp))

# Print summary
print("Example Metrics:")
for i, m in enumerate(metrics):
    print(f"  Example {i+1}: {m}")

# Verify consistent shift
shifts = [m['shift_amount'] for m in metrics if m['shift_amount'] is not None]
consistent_shift = all(s == 3 for s in shifts) and len(shifts) > 0
print(f"\nShift amount is consistently 3: {consistent_shift}")
```
```
Example Metrics:
  Example 1: {'input_start': 10, 'input_end': 12, 'input_length': 2, 'block_value': 1, 'output_start': 7, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 2: {'input_start': 4, 'input_end': 8, 'input_length': 4, 'block_value': 9, 'output_start': 1, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 3: {'input_start': 7, 'input_end': 9, 'input_length': 2, 'block_value': 3, 'output_start': 4, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 4: {'input_start': 3, 'input_end': 5, 'input_length': 2, 'block_value': 9, 'output_start': 0, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 5: {'input_start': 4, 'input_end': 8, 'input_length': 4, 'block_value': 3, 'output_start': 1, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 6: {'input_start': 8, 'input_end': 9, 'input_length': 1, 'block_value': 9, 'output_start': 5, 'shift_amount': 3}
  Example 7: {'input_start': 4, 'input_end': 10, 'input_length': 6, 'block_value': 6, 'output_start': 1, 'shift_amount': 3}

Shift amount is consistently 3: True

```
The metrics confirm that the transformation involves finding a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it exactly 3 positions to the left. The block's value and length are preserved. The background remains zero.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a 1x12 grid (or 2D array) of single-digit integers.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid to get a 1D sequence of 12 digits.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this 1D sequence. Determine its starting index, its length, and the value of the digits in the block. If no non-zero block exists, proceed to step 7 with an empty block.
4.  Create a new output sequence of 12 digits, initially filled entirely with the background value (0).
5.  If a non-zero block was identified in step 3:
    a.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting the constant shift amount (3) from its original starting index in the 1D sequence.
    b.  Iterate from 0 up to the block's length (exclusive). For each iteration `i`:
        i.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `new_start_index + i`.
        ii. If the target index is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), place the block's value at that target index in the output sequence.
6.  (Implicitly handled by initialization and step 5) Ensure all positions in the output sequence *not* filled by the shifted block retain the background value (0).
7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
