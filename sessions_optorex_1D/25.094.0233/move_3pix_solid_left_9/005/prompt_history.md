## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (length 12) of single digits.
*   **Structure:** The sequences consist primarily of zeros (0) and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1`, `9 9 9 9`, `3 3`).
*   **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. The block moves towards the beginning of the sequence (left shift).
*   **Consistency:** The non-zero digit value and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged between input and output. The shift amount seems constant across all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its starting index, its ending index, and the value of the digits in the block.
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 digits, initially filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 3 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, placing it starting at the newly calculated index.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided examples and error messages strongly suggest that the core transformation logic (identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left) is correct. The failure across all examples with the error "Input sequence must be 1-dimensional" points directly to an incompatibility between the input format expected by the test environment (likely a 2D NumPy array, e.g., shape `(1, 12)`) and the input format assumed by the previous code (a 1D list or array, e.g., shape `(12,)`).

**Strategy:**
1.  **Confirm Input Format:** Assume the input `input_grid` is passed as a 2D NumPy array with one row (shape `(1, 12)`).
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to extract the single row from the 2D input array before passing it to the `find_block_properties` function or processing it directly. The `find_block_properties` function itself seems robust for 1D sequences once it receives the correct input type.
3.  **Validate Logic:** Re-verify the constant left shift of 3 positions using metrics gathered from the examples.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to explicitly mention the input format handling (extracting the 1D sequence from the 2D input grid).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the block properties and shift for each example to confirm consistency.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid, which is expected to be a 1x12 grid (or 2D array) of single-digit integers.
2.  Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid to get a 1D sequence of 12 digits.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this 1D sequence. Determine its starting index, its length, and the value of the digits in the block. If no non-zero block exists, proceed to step 7 with an empty block.
4.  Create a new output sequence of 12 digits, initially filled entirely with the background value (0).
5.  If a non-zero block was identified in step 3:
    a.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting the constant shift amount (3) from its original starting index in the 1D sequence.
    b.  Iterate from 0 up to the block's length (exclusive). For each iteration `i`:
        i.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `new_start_index + i`.
        ii. If the target index is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), place the block's value at that target index in the output sequence.
6.  (Implicitly handled by initialization and step 5) Ensure all positions in the output sequence *not* filled by the shifted block retain the background value (0).
7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
