## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (length 12) of single digits.
*   **Structure:** The sequences consist primarily of zeros (0) and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1`, `9 9 9 9`, `3 3`).
*   **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. The block moves towards the beginning of the sequence (left shift).
*   **Consistency:** The non-zero digit value and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged between input and output. The shift amount seems constant across all examples.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string of digits, but the testing environment appears to be passing the input as a NumPy array (or a similar list-like structure), causing the `.split()` method call to fail.

The core logic of the transformation (identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left) appears consistent across all provided training examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Logic:** Use code execution to verify the block identification and shift consistency across all examples.
2.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the Natural Language Program and subsequent code generation to assume the input is already in a list-like format (e.g., list of integers), removing the string parsing step.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the confirmed transformation rule and the expected input format.

## Metrics Gathering

**Metrics Summary:**

The analysis confirms the initial hypothesis across all training examples:
*   A single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits is present in each input.
*   The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.
*   The block is consistently shifted 3 positions to the left (towards index 0) in the output sequence.
*   Positions outside the shifted block in the output are filled with zeros.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Initialize a new output sequence of 12 integers, filled with zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. If no non-zero digit is found, return the initialized zero sequence.
4.  Once the first non-zero digit is found, record its value (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
5.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to determine the length (`block_length`) of the contiguous block of digits equal to `block_value`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index - 3`.
7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_index` is within the valid range (0 to 11 inclusive), place the `block_value` at `output_sequence[target_index]`.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
