task_elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D NumPy array representing a grid of single digits.
    properties:
      - shape: Dimensions of the grid (e.g., (1, 12) for all train examples).
      - dtype: Data type of the elements (integer).
      - elements: Consist of '0' and one type of non-zero digit forming a block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous rectangular subgrid of identical non-zero digits within the main grid.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The specific non-zero digit (e.g., 9, 4, 6).
      - location_input: Top-left corner (row, col) in the input grid.
      - size: Dimensions (height, width) of the block.
      - location_output: Top-left corner (row, col) in the output grid.
    relationships:
      - contained_within: grid
actions:
  - action: shift_block
    actor: non_zero_block
    details: The block's position is moved within the grid.
    parameters:
      - shift_vector: (delta_row, delta_col) = (0, -3)
    constraints:
      - Grid shape and dtype are preserved.
      - Block value and size (height, width) are preserved.
      - The target starting column is calculated as `input_col - 3`.
      - If the target starting column is negative, it is clamped to 0.
      - The target starting row remains the same (`input_row`).
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid (2D NumPy array)
    output: output_grid (2D NumPy array)
    rule: Identify the non_zero_block in the input_grid. Create a new grid of the same shape and dtype, filled with zeros. Place the identified block into the new grid, shifted by (0, -3) rows/columns relative to its input position, ensuring the starting column is not less than 0.
