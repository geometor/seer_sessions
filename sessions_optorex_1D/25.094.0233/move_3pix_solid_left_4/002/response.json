            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code failed across all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs when a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values (resulting from an element-wise comparison) is used in a context requiring a single boolean value, such as an `if` statement condition.\n\nThis suggests that the input data, described initially as sequences or lists, is being processed as NumPy arrays within the testing environment. The `find_non_zero_block` function iterates through the sequence and performs comparisons like `x != 0` and `x != value`. If `x` represents an element slice or if the input is unexpectedly multi-dimensional, these comparisons could yield boolean arrays, triggering the error in the `if` conditions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Input Data Structure:** Confirm the exact data type and dimensionality (shape) of the `input_sequence` being passed to the `transform` function in the testing environment.\n2.  **Adapt Code for NumPy:** Modify the `find_non_zero_block` function to explicitly handle NumPy arrays, ensuring comparisons within conditions evaluate to single booleans. If the input is indeed multi-dimensional (e.g., a 1xN array), access elements appropriately (e.g., `sequence[0, i]` instead of `sequence[i]`).\n3.  **Refine Block Identification Logic:** Ensure the logic correctly identifies the start and end of the contiguous block within the (potentially multi-dimensional) NumPy array structure.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's inspect the structure of the input data using the first training example.\n"

The error occurs if the input sequence is treated as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N) and iterated directly, as the loop variable `x` becomes the entire row (a 1D array). Comparisons like `x != 0` then fail.\n2.  If the input sequence is a 1D NumPy array (shape (N,)), the original `find_non_zero_block` logic iterates correctly over scalar elements, and the comparisons work as intended. The simulation correctly identified the block `(value=4, start=6, end=9)`.\n3.  Conclusion: The testing environment likely passes the input as a 2D NumPy array (shape (1, N)).
