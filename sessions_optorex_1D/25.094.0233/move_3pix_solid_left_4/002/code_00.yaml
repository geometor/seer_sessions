task_type: sequence_transformation
input_structure:
  type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error analysis
  shape: (1, N) # Inferred shape, N=12 in examples
  element_type: integer
  range: 0-9
  properties:
    - contains mostly zeros
    - contains one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the single row
output_structure:
  type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should match input type convention
  shape: (1, N) # Output shape matches input
  element_type: integer
  range: 0-9
  properties:
    - contains mostly zeros
    - contains the same contiguous block of non-zero digits as the input, shifted
objects:
  - id: zero_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/padding
  - id: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence (within the row of the input array)
    properties:
      - consists of identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous within the row
      - variable length
      - variable digit value (3, 4, 7, 8, 9 observed)
relationships:
  - input.shape == output.shape
  - input.non_zero_block (content) == output.non_zero_block (content)
actions:
  - id: access_row
    description: Select the first (and only) row from the 2D input array for processing.
  - id: find_block
    description: Locate the start and end column indices of the non_zero_block within the selected row.
  - id: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the target start column index for the non_zero_block in the output array's row.
    rule: target_start_index = input_start_index - 3
  - id: construct_output_array
    description: Create a new 2D NumPy array of the same shape as the input, initially filled with zeros.
  - id: place_block
    description: Copy the non_zero_block from the input row into the output array's row at the calculated new position. Handle boundary conditions (indices < 0 are ignored, placement stops at the row end).
transformation_rule:
  description: Given a 2D input NumPy array of shape (1, N), identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits in the first row. Shift this block 3 positions (columns) to the left within the row. Create a new 2D NumPy array of the same shape, filled with zeros initially. Place the identified block into the new array's row at the shifted position, truncating the block if the shift moves it past the beginning (column 0).
constants:
  - shift_amount: -3 (left shift by 3 columns)
