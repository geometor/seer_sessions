            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. All provided examples have a sequence length of 12.\n2.  **Content:** The sequences primarily contain zeros (0) and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `9 9 9 9 9 9 9`).\n3.  **Core Object:** The significant element within the input sequence appears to be the contiguous block of non-zero digits. The zeros act as background or padding.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves changing the position of this non-zero block within the sequence while maintaining the sequence length and the values within the block.\n5.  **Observed Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-zero digits is shifted to the left. The magnitude of the shift appears constant across all examples.\n    *   train_1: `4 4 4` shifts from index 6 to 3 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_2: `7 7 7 7` shifts from index 4 to 1 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_3: `9 ... 9` shifts from index 3 to 0 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_4: `3 ... 3` shifts from index 5 to 2 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_5: `3 3` shifts from index 9 to 6 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_6: `8 ... 8` shifts from index 3 to 0 (shift = -3)\n    *   train_7: `8 ... 8` shifts from index 7 to 4 (shift = -3)\n6.  **Boundary Handling:** When the shift moves the block towards or past the beginning of the sequence (index 0), the part of the block that would fall before index 0 is effectively truncated, and the block starts at index 0 (as seen in train_3 and train_6). The space where the block was originally located is filled with zeros.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
