Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. All provided examples have a sequence length of 12.
2.  **Content:** The sequences primarily contain zeros (0) and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `9 9 9 9 9 9 9`).
3.  **Core Object:** The significant element within the input sequence appears to be the contiguous block of non-zero digits. The zeros act as background or padding.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation consistently involves changing the position of this non-zero block within the sequence while maintaining the sequence length and the values within the block.
5.  **Observed Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-zero digits is shifted to the left. The magnitude of the shift appears constant across all examples.
    *   train_1: `4 4 4` shifts from index 6 to 3 (shift = -3)
    *   train_2: `7 7 7 7` shifts from index 4 to 1 (shift = -3)
    *   train_3: `9 ... 9` shifts from index 3 to 0 (shift = -3)
    *   train_4: `3 ... 3` shifts from index 5 to 2 (shift = -3)
    *   train_5: `3 3` shifts from index 9 to 6 (shift = -3)
    *   train_6: `8 ... 8` shifts from index 3 to 0 (shift = -3)
    *   train_7: `8 ... 8` shifts from index 7 to 4 (shift = -3)
6.  **Boundary Handling:** When the shift moves the block towards or past the beginning of the sequence (index 0), the part of the block that would fall before index 0 is effectively truncated, and the block starts at index 0 (as seen in train_3 and train_6). The space where the block was originally located is filled with zeros.

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_structure:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  range: 0-9
  length: 12 (observed constant)
  properties:
    - contains mostly zeros
    - contains one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
output_structure:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  range: 0-9
  length: 12 (same as input)
  properties:
    - contains mostly zeros
    - contains the same contiguous block of non-zero digits as the input
objects:
  - id: zero_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/padding
  - id: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - consists of identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous within the main sequence
      - variable length
      - variable digit value (3, 4, 7, 8, 9 observed)
relationships:
  - input.length == output.length
  - input.non_zero_block == output.non_zero_block (content and length preserved)
actions:
  - id: find_block
    description: Locate the start and end indices of the non_zero_block in the input sequence.
  - id: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the target start index for the non_zero_block in the output sequence.
    rule: target_start_index = input_start_index - 3
  - id: construct_output
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
  - id: place_block
    description: Copy the non_zero_block from the input into the output sequence at the calculated new position. Handle boundary conditions (indices < 0 are ignored, placement stops at sequence end).
transformation_rule:
  description: Shift the contiguous block of non-zero digits 3 positions to the left within the sequence, filling the original position with zeros and truncating the block if it shifts past the beginning of the sequence.
constants:
  - shift_amount: -3 (left shift by 3 positions)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits. Record its value, its starting index, and its ending index in the input sequence.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its starting index in the input sequence.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with zeros.
5.  Iterate through the identified non-zero block from the input, element by element. For each element at a relative position `i` (starting from 0) within the block:
    a. Calculate the corresponding index `j` in the output sequence: `j = target_starting_index + i`.
    b. If `j` is a valid index within the bounds of the output sequence (i.e., `j >= 0` and `j < length of sequence`), place the non-zero digit at index `j` in the output sequence.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
