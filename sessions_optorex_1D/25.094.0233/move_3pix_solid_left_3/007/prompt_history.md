*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are lists (or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the input and output lists is constant (12 in all examples).
    *   Each input list contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers, surrounded by zeros.
    *   Each output list also contains a single contiguous block of the same non-zero number as the input, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The length of the non-zero block is preserved from input to output.
    *   The value of the non-zero number is preserved from input to output.
    *   The position of the non-zero block changes between the input and output. Specifically, the block is shifted to the left.
    *   Observing the start index of the block in the input and output across examples reveals a consistent leftward shift of 3 positions.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    data_type: list_of_integers
    list_length: 12
    elements:
      - type: zero
        role: background/padding
      - type: non_zero_digit
        role: object/pattern
        properties:
          - contiguity: forms a single block in the input
          - value_preservation: value remains the same in the output
          - length_preservation: block length remains the same in the output
    transformation:
      action: shift_block
      details:
        - object: the contiguous block of non-zero numbers
        - direction: left
        - magnitude: 3 positions
        - behavior:
            - identify the start index of the non-zero block in the input.
            - calculate the target start index in the output by subtracting 3.
            - construct the output list with zeros.
            - place the non-zero block at the target start index in the output list.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output list of the same length as the input list, filled with zeros.
    2.  Scan the input list to find the first non-zero element. Record its index (let's call it `start_index`) and its value.
    3.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of this non-zero value starting at `start_index`.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list by subtracting 3 from `start_index`.
    5.  Copy the contiguous block of non-zero numbers from the input into the output list, starting at the calculated new index.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided Python code, designed to shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers left by 3 positions in a 12-element sequence, fails on all training and test examples with the identical error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.

This specific NumPy error occurs when a boolean array (an array of `True`/`False` values) is used in a context that requires a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement condition). Reviewing the provided code, there isn't an obvious line that would cause this error under normal circumstances with the expected 1D array input. The conditional checks (`if start_index is not None:`, `if 0 <= output_index < n:`, `if input_array[i] == block_value:`) all involve scalar comparisons. The complex validation `if` statement also compares scalar values derived from the array properties.

**Hypotheses & Strategy:**

1.  **Hidden Complexity/Edge Case:** There might be an edge case or data type interaction not apparent from the examples that causes one of the variables expected to be scalar (like `block_value` or `input_array[i]`) to become an array, or an operation intended to return a scalar boolean accidentally returns an array boolean.
2.  **Input Format:** The way the input data (`input_grid`) is passed to the function by the testing environment might differ from a simple 1D list/array, potentially causing `np.array(input_grid)` or subsequent operations to yield unexpected dimensions or types.
3.  **Implementation Detail:** The validation logic within `find_non_zero_block`, while appearing correct, is the most complex boolean check and might be the source of the interaction, perhaps due to how array indices or lengths are handled internally by NumPy in specific situations.

**Resolution Strategy:**

1.  **Simplify:** Remove the complex validation `if` statement within `find_non_zero_block`. The core logic relies on finding the *first* non-zero element and extending the block as long as the value matches. The examples strongly suggest only one such block exists, making the validation potentially unnecessary and a source of error.
2.  **Reaffirm Logic:** The fundamental logic (find start, value, length; calculate new start; copy block within bounds) seems correct based on the task description and examples. The natural language program and YAML facts should reflect this core logic clearly.
3.  **Focus on Core Transformation:** Ensure the YAML and Natural Language Program accurately describe the primary task: identify the single non-zero block and shift it left by 3 positions, handling boundary conditions (elements shifted off the left end are lost).

## Metrics Gathering

Since I cannot execute code, I will describe the analysis for each example based on the intended logic:

**Input Format:** 1D sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
**Output Format:** 1D sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
**Transformation:** Left shift of the non-zero block by 3 positions.

The consistent error across all examples confirms the issue is fundamental to the code's interaction with the data or environment, not specific to a particular input configuration. The core logic of calculating the shift appears sound based on manual verification against the examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data:
  type: sequence
  format: 1D list or array of integers
  length: 12
  elements:
    - type: zero
      role: background/padding
    - type: non_zero_digit
      role: object/pattern
      constraints:
        - forms a single contiguous block
        - all digits within the block are identical
output_data:
  type: sequence
  format: 1D list or array of integers
  length: 12
  elements:
    - type: zero
      role: background/padding
    - type: non_zero_digit
      role: object/pattern (derived from input)
transformation:
  action: shift_block_left
  parameters:
    shift_amount: 3
  object_selection:
    criteria: the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  process:
    - identify: locate the start index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input sequence.
    - calculate: determine the target start index in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the input start index.
    - construct: create an output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
    - place: copy the identified non-zero block (value and length) into the output sequence starting at the calculated target start index.
  boundary_handling:
    - elements shifted to an index less than 0 are discarded.
    - elements are placed only at valid indices (0 to length-1).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero element in the input sequence. If no non-zero element exists, return the sequence of zeros.
3.  Record the value of this first non-zero element and its index (start\_index).
4.  Determine the length of the contiguous block of this specific non-zero value starting from start\_index.
5.  Calculate the target start index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the input start\_index.
6.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_index` is within the valid range of indices for the output sequence (0 to 11, inclusive), place the recorded non-zero value at `output_sequence[target_index]`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.
