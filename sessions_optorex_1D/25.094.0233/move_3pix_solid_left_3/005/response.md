"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by finding a single contiguous block of 
identical non-zero digits and shifting this block 3 positions to the left. 
The value and length of the block are preserved. The remaining positions in the 
output sequence are filled with zeros. Elements shifted past the beginning of the 
sequence (index 0) are discarded.
