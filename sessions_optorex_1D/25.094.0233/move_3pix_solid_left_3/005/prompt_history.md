*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are lists (or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the input and output lists is constant (12 in all examples).
    *   Each input list contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers, surrounded by zeros.
    *   Each output list also contains a single contiguous block of the same non-zero number as the input, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The length of the non-zero block is preserved from input to output.
    *   The value of the non-zero number is preserved from input to output.
    *   The position of the non-zero block changes between the input and output. Specifically, the block is shifted to the left.
    *   Observing the start index of the block in the input and output across examples reveals a consistent leftward shift of 3 positions.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The provided Python code attempts to implement the previously described logic: identify a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits in a 1D NumPy array and shift it three positions to the left.
    *   The code consistently fails across all training and test examples with the error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.
    *   This specific error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values (resulting from a comparison like `array == value` or `array != 0`) is used in a context that expects a single boolean value (e.g., a standard `if` statement condition).
    *   Looking at the provided `find_non_zero_block` function, the comparison `input_array != 0` inside `np.where` is valid and returns indices. The comparisons `input_array[i] == block_value` compare a single element to a scalar, which is also valid. There are no obvious direct uses of a boolean array in an `if` condition within the provided `transform` or `find_non_zero_block` functions.
    *   This suggests the error might originate from how the `input_grid` argument is being passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment or framework. It's possible the `input_grid` received by the function is not a simple 1D NumPy array as expected, potentially being a list, a list of lists, or a multi-dimensional array, causing downstream NumPy operations or comparisons to behave unexpectedly.
    *   The strategy for resolution involves ensuring the input data format matches the function's expectation (a 1D NumPy array) or modifying the function to correctly handle the actual input format, likely by explicitly converting or accessing the data correctly before performing comparisons. The core logic (find block, calculate new index, write block) remains sound based on the examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   All 7 training examples failed execution.
    *   All 1 test example failed execution.
    *   The error type is consistent across all failures: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.
    *   The underlying transformation logic (left shift by 3) appears consistent with the input/output pairs, but the implementation failed before producing any output for comparison. No metrics regarding the correctness of the shift itself can be gathered yet.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    *(The core understanding of the task hasn't changed based on the error; the error is implementation/environment related. The YAML reflects the perceived task based on input/output examples)*.

    implementation_notes: # Added section for implementation context
      - Current code uses NumPy.
      - Execution failed due to ambiguity in boolean array evaluation, potentially indicating a mismatch between expected input type (1D NumPy array) and actual input type provided during testing.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    *(The natural language program describes the intended transformation based on the examples, which remains unchanged by the execution error.)*
    1.  Initialize an output sequence of length 12, filled entirely with zeros.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical, non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its starting index, its numerical value, and its length.
    3.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its starting index in the input sequence.
    4.  Place the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that writing the block respects the boundaries of the output sequence (indices 0 through 11). If the target starting index is negative, begin writing the block from index 0 of the output sequence, effectively truncating the portion of the block that would fall before the start.
