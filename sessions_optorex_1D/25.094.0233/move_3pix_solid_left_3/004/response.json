Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n    *   This specific error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values (resulting from a comparison like `array == value` or `array != 0`) is used in a context that expects a single boolean value (e.g., a standard `if` statement condition).\n    *   Looking at the provided `find_non_zero_block` function, the comparison `input_array != 0` inside `np.where` is valid and returns indices. The comparisons `input_array[i] == block_value` compare a single element to a scalar, which is also valid. There are no obvious direct uses of a boolean array in an `if` condition within the provided `transform` or `find_non_zero_block` functions.\n    *   This suggests the error might originate from how the `input_grid` argument is being passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment or framework. It's possible the `input_grid` received by the function is not a simple 1D NumPy array as expected, potentially being a list, a list of lists, or a multi-dimensional array, causing downstream NumPy operations or comparisons to behave unexpectedly.\n    *   The strategy for resolution involves ensuring the input data format matches the function's expectation (a 1D NumPy array) or modifying the function to correctly handle the actual input format, likely by explicitly converting or accessing the data correctly before performing comparisons. The core logic (find block, calculate new index, write block) remains sound based on the examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   All 7 training examples failed execution.\n    *   All 1 test example failed execution.\n    *   The error type is consistent across all failures: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n    *   The underlying transformation logic (left shift by 3) appears consistent with the input/output pairs, but the implementation failed before producing any output for comparison. No metrics regarding the correctness of the shift itself can be gathered yet.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    *(The core understanding of the task hasn't changed based on the error; the error is implementation/environment related. The YAML reflects the perceived task based on input/output examples)*.\n    "
