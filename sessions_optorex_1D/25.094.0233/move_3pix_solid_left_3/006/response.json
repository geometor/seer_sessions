            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided Python code, designed to shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers left by 3 positions in a 12-element sequence, fails on all training and test examples with the identical error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n\nThis specific NumPy error occurs when a boolean array (an array of `True`/`False` values) is used in a context that requires a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement condition). Reviewing the provided code, there isn't an obvious line that would cause this error under normal circumstances with the expected 1D array input. The conditional checks (`if start_index is not None:`, `if 0 <= output_index < n:`, `if input_array[i] == block_value:`) all involve scalar comparisons. The complex validation `if` statement also compares scalar values derived from the array properties.\n\n**Hypotheses & Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Hidden Complexity/Edge Case:** There might be an edge case or data type interaction not apparent from the examples that causes one of the variables expected to be scalar (like `block_value` or `input_array[i]`) to become an array, or an operation intended to return a scalar boolean accidentally returns an array boolean.\n2.  **Input Format:** The way the input data (`input_grid`) is passed to the function by the testing environment might differ from a simple 1D list/array, potentially causing `np.array(input_grid)` or subsequent operations to yield unexpected dimensions or types.\n3.  **Implementation Detail:** The validation logic within `find_non_zero_block`, while appearing correct, is the most complex boolean check and might be the source of the interaction, perhaps due to how array indices or lengths are handled internally by NumPy in specific situations.\n\n**Resolution Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Simplify:** Remove the complex validation `if` statement within `find_non_zero_block`. The core logic relies on finding the *first* non-zero element and extending the block as long as the value matches. The examples strongly suggest only one such block exists, making the validation potentially unnecessary and a source of error.\n2.  **Reaffirm Logic:** The fundamental logic (find start, value, length; calculate new start; copy block within bounds) seems correct based on the task description and examples. The natural language program and YAML facts should reflect this core logic clearly.\n3.  **Focus on Core Transformation:** Ensure the YAML and Natural Language Program accurately describe the primary task: identify the single non-zero block and shift it left by 3 positions, handling boundary conditions (elements shifted off the left end are lost).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nSince I cannot execute code, I will describe the analysis for each example based on the intended logic:\n\n**Input Format:** 1D sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.\n**Output Format:** 1D sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.\n**Transformation:** Left shift of the non-zero block by 3 positions.\n\n| Example | Input Sequence             | Non-Zero Block (Value, Start, Length) | New Start Index (Start - 3) | Expected Output Sequence     | Actual Output |\n| :------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------ |\n| train_1 | `[0..0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`       | (1, 8, 1)                             | 5                           | `[0..0, 1, 0..0]`          | Error         |\n| train_2 | `[0..0, 4, 4, 4, 0..0]`    | (4, 4, 3)                             | 1                           | `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0..0]`       | Error         |\n| train_3 | `[0..0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` | (2, 6, 6)                             | 3                           | `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` | Error |\n| train_4 | `[0..0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]` | (8, 6, 5)                             | 3                           | `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Error |\n| train_5 | `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, ... , 9, 0]` | (9, 3, 8)                          | 0                           | `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Error |\n| train_6 | `[0..0, 8, 8, 8]`          | (8, 9, 3)                             | 6                           | `[0..0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]` | Error         |\n| train_7 | `[0..0, 2, 2, 2, 0..0]`    | (2, 5, 3)                             | 2                           | `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0..0]`    | Error         |\n| test_1 (Hypothetical based on pattern) | `[7, 7, 0..0]` | (7, 0, 2) | -3 | `[0..0]` (Block shifted entirely off) | Error |\n\nThe consistent error across all examples confirms the issue is fundamental to the code's interaction with the data or environment, not specific to a particular input configuration. The core logic of calculating the shift appears sound based on manual verification against the examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
