task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data:
  type: sequence
  format: 1D list or array of integers
  length: 12
  elements:
    - type: zero
      role: background/padding
    - type: non_zero_digit
      role: object/pattern
      constraints:
        - forms a single contiguous block
        - all digits within the block are identical
output_data:
  type: sequence
  format: 1D list or array of integers
  length: 12
  elements:
    - type: zero
      role: background/padding
    - type: non_zero_digit
      role: object/pattern (derived from input)
transformation:
  action: shift_block_left
  parameters:
    shift_amount: 3
  object_selection:
    criteria: the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  process:
    - identify: locate the start index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input sequence.
    - calculate: determine the target start index in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the input start index.
    - construct: create an output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
    - place: copy the identified non-zero block (value and length) into the output sequence starting at the calculated target start index.
  boundary_handling:
    - elements shifted to an index less than 0 are discarded.
    - elements are placed only at valid indices (0 to length-1).
