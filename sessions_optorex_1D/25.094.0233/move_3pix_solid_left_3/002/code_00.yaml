task_type: sequence_transformation
data_structure: array # Assumed based on error message, likely NumPy array
data_type: integers
array_length: 12
elements:
  - type: zero
    role: background/padding
  - type: non_zero_digit
    role: object/pattern
    properties:
      - contiguity: forms a single block in the input
      - value_preservation: value remains the same in the output
      - length_preservation: block length remains the same in the output
      - uniqueness: only one such block per input array
transformation:
  action: shift_block
  details:
    - object: the contiguous block of non-zero numbers
    - direction: left
    - magnitude: 3 positions
    - boundary_handling: implied (elements shifted off the left boundary are discarded, new positions on the right are filled with zeros) # Although not explicitly shown by examples hitting the boundary hard. Example 5 shifts to index 0.
    - process:
        - identify the start index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input array.
        - calculate the target start index in the output array by subtracting 3 from the input start index.
        - construct the output array, initially filled with zeros.
        - place the identified non-zero block (preserving value and length) at the target start index in the output array.
