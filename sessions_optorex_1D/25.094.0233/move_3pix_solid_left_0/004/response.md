**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt generated code based on the hypothesis that the input is a 1D sequence (list) of integers and the transformation involves shifting a contiguous block of non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left. The code failed on all examples with a NumPy error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous."

This error strongly indicates that the `transform` function, within the testing environment, receives its input not as a standard Python list, but as a NumPy array, potentially a 2D array. When the code attempts a boolean check like `if val != 0:` and `val` is a NumPy array (e.g., a row from a 2D array), the error occurs because NumPy doesn't allow direct boolean evaluation of multi-element arrays.

The strategy to resolve this is:
1.  **Acknowledge Input Type:** Assume the `input_sequence` argument passed to `transform` can be a NumPy array (possibly 2D).
2.  **Flatten Input:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly flatten the input NumPy array into a 1D list at the beginning. This converts the input into the format the existing logic expects.
3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** Retain the core transformation logic identified previously: find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the flattened 1D sequence and shift it 3 positions to the left, filling the remaining space with zeros. The linear examples provided suggest this 1D interpretation holds true even if the underlying data structure passed is 2D.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to mention the input flattening step and clarify that the operation occurs on the 1D representation.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Based on the error message and the consistent success of the 1D "shift left by 3" rule when manually applied to the flattened examples:

*   **Input Data Type:** Highly likely `numpy.ndarray`. The error is characteristic of NumPy array handling.
*   **Input Dimensionality:** Uncertain (could be 1D or 2D), but the error occurs when iterating or comparing in a way that treats elements as arrays (suggesting 2D input where rows are iterated). Flattening handles both 1D and 2D array inputs.
*   **Transformation Rule:** The "find 1D non-zero block and shift left by 3" rule consistently maps inputs to outputs across all 7 training examples when applied to the flattened sequence.
*   **Error Cause:** The error stems from applying standard Python comparisons/boolean checks directly to multi-element NumPy arrays, which is disallowed. It's not an error in the *transformation logic* itself, but in *handling the input data type*.

actions:
  - name: flatten_input
    inputs: input_grid

    description: Finds the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the flattened 1D sequence. Returns None if no non-zero digits exist.
  - name: shift_block_left_1d
    inputs:
      - non_zero_block (from identify_block_1d)
      - shift_amount (constant value of 3)

    description: Calculates the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the original start index (clamped at 0).
  - name: construct_output_1d
    inputs:
      - sequence_1d_length
      - non_zero_block (digit_value, original_length)
      - new_start_index
    outputs: output_sequence_1d (list of integers)
    description: Creates a new 1D sequence (list) of the original flattened length, initialized with zeros, and places the non_zero_block (using its value and length) at the calculated new_start_index.

relationships:
  - The core transformation operates on a 1D representation of the input.
  - The output sequence has the same length as the flattened input sequence.
  - The output sequence contains the same non_zero_block (value and length) as the input sequence, but potentially at a different location.
  - The non_zero_block in the output sequence starts 3 positions earlier (leftward shift) than in the flattened input sequence, with the starting index capped at 0.
  - Elements in the output sequence that are not part of the shifted non_zero_block are zeros.
  - If no non-zero block is found, the output sequence is identical to the flattened input sequence (or potentially an all-zero sequence of the same length if the input was all zeros).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input, which might be a NumPy array (potentially 2D) or a list representation of digits.
2.  Convert the input into a single, flat (1D) list of integers (`sequence_1d`).
3.  Determine the length (`n`) of this 1D list.
4.  Search the `sequence_1d` to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record the non-zero digit's value (`block_value`), its starting index (`start_index`), and its length (`block_length`).
5.  If no non-zero block is found, create an output list consisting of `n` zeros (or simply return a copy of `sequence_1d` if handling all-zero inputs that way).
6.  If a non-zero block is found:
    a.  Calculate the target starting index (`new_start_index`) for the block in the output list by subtracting 3 from the original `start_index`. Ensure `new_start_index` is not less than 0 (i.e., `new_start_index = max(0, start_index - 3)`).
    b.  Create a new output list of length `n`, initialized entirely with zeros.
    c.  Place the non-zero block into the output list: iterate `block_length` times, starting from `new_start_index`, setting the element at each position `new_start_index + i` (where `i` goes from 0 to `block_length - 1`) to `block_value`. Ensure that these indices stay within the bounds (0 to `n-1`) of the output list.
7.  Return the final 1D output list. (The calling environment will handle formatting back to the required output string/grid format).
