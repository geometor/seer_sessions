objects:
  - name: input_grid # Renamed to reflect potential multi-dimensional nature
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray (potentially 2D) or list
      - representation: Initially provided as space-separated strings, likely parsed into an array/list by the environment.
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: sequence_1d # Derived object
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - source: Flattened representation of input_grid
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence within sequence_1d
      - elements: identical non-zero digits
      - location: defined by start and end index within sequence_1d
      - length: variable
      - digit_value: the non-zero digit comprising the block
  - name: zero_elements
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: elements outside the non_zero_block in sequence_1d

actions:
  - name: flatten_input
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: sequence_1d
    description: Converts the input grid (potentially multi-dimensional numpy array) into a flat 1D list of integers.
  - name: identify_block_1d
    inputs: sequence_1d
    outputs: non_zero_block (digit_value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the flattened 1D sequence. Returns None if no non-zero digits exist.
  - name: shift_block_left_1d
    inputs:
      - non_zero_block (from identify_block_1d)
      - shift_amount (constant value of 3)
    outputs: new_start_index
    description: Calculates the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the original start index (clamped at 0).
  - name: construct_output_1d
    inputs:
      - sequence_1d_length
      - non_zero_block (digit_value, original_length)
      - new_start_index
    outputs: output_sequence_1d (list of integers)
    description: Creates a new 1D sequence (list) of the original flattened length, initialized with zeros, and places the non_zero_block (using its value and length) at the calculated new_start_index.

relationships:
  - The core transformation operates on a 1D representation of the input.
  - The output sequence has the same length as the flattened input sequence.
  - The output sequence contains the same non_zero_block (value and length) as the input sequence, but potentially at a different location.
  - The non_zero_block in the output sequence starts 3 positions earlier (leftward shift) than in the flattened input sequence, with the starting index capped at 0.
  - Elements in the output sequence that are not part of the shifted non_zero_block are zeros.
  - If no non-zero block is found, the output sequence is identical to the flattened input sequence (or potentially an all-zero sequence of the same length if the input was all zeros).
