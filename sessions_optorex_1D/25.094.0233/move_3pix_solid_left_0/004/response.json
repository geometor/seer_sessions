            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt generated code based on the hypothesis that the input is a 1D sequence (list) of integers and the transformation involves shifting a contiguous block of non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left. The code failed on all examples with a NumPy error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\"\n\nThis error strongly indicates that the `transform` function, within the testing environment, receives its input not as a standard Python list, but as a NumPy array, potentially a 2D array. When the code attempts a boolean check like `if val != 0:` and `val` is a NumPy array (e.g., a row from a 2D array), the error occurs because NumPy doesn't allow direct boolean evaluation of multi-element arrays.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n1.  **Acknowledge Input Type:** Assume the `input_sequence` argument passed to `transform` can be a NumPy array (possibly 2D).\n2.  **Flatten Input:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly flatten the input NumPy array into a 1D list at the beginning. This converts the input into the format the existing logic expects.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** Retain the core transformation logic identified previously: find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the flattened 1D sequence and shift it 3 positions to the left, filling the remaining space with zeros. The linear examples provided suggest this 1D interpretation holds true even if the underlying data structure passed is 2D.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to mention the input flattening step and clarify that the operation occurs on the 1D representation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nBased on the error message and the consistent success of the 1D \"shift left by 3\" rule when manually applied to the flattened examples:\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** Highly likely `numpy.ndarray`. The error is characteristic of NumPy array handling.\n*   **Input Dimensionality:** Uncertain (could be 1D or 2D), but the error occurs when iterating or comparing in a way that treats elements as arrays (suggesting 2D input where rows are iterated). Flattening handles both 1D and 2D array inputs.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The \"find 1D non-zero block and shift left by 3\" rule consistently maps inputs to outputs across all 7 training examples when applied to the flattened sequence.\n*   **Error Cause:** The error stems from applying standard Python comparisons/boolean checks directly to multi-element NumPy arrays, which is disallowed. It's not an error in the *transformation logic* itself, but in *handling the input data type*.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
