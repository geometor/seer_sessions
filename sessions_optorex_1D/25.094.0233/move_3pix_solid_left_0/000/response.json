Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of a non-zero digit (e.g., '2', '3', '8', '6'). The length of the sequences in the examples is consistently 12. The transformation rule appears to involve relocating the non-zero block within the sequence while preserving its length and the non-zero digit itself. The surrounding zeros adjust to accommodate the moved block. Specifically, the non-zero block is shifted three positions to the left.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
