It then identifies the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this sequence. This block is shifted three positions to the left (its starting index is reduced by 3, clamped at 0). A new 1D sequence of the original flattened length is constructed, filled with zeros initially, and then the shifted block is placed into it.
