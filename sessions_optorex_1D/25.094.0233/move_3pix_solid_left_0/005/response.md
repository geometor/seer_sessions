"""
Transforms an input grid (potentially multi-dimensional, received as list or numpy array) by first flattening it into a 1D sequence. It then identifies the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this sequence. This block is shifted three positions to the left (its starting index is reduced by 3, clamped at 0). A new 1D sequence of the original flattened length is constructed, filled with zeros initially, and then the shifted block is placed into it. If no non-zero block is found, a sequence of zeros of the same length is returned.
