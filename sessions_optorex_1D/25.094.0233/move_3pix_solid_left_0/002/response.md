**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code failed universally across all training and test examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`), but the testing environment is passing the input data as a NumPy array instead.

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by 3 positions) appears consistent across all training examples based on visual inspection. The strategy for resolution involves:

1.  Modifying the `transform` function to accept the input data in its actual format (likely a list of integers or a NumPy array) rather than expecting a string.
2.  Verifying the core block-shifting logic against all examples to ensure its general applicability.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-analyze the examples assuming the input is a list of integers directly, confirming the block identification and shift logic.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers # Changed from space-separated string
      - length: constant (12 in examples, generally N)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - elements: identical non-zero digits
      - location: defined by start and end index (exclusive) within the sequence
      - length: variable
      - digit_value: the non-zero digit comprising the block
  - name: zero_elements
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - location: elements outside the non_zero_block

actions:
  - name: identify_block
    inputs: sequence (list of integers)
    outputs: non_zero_block (digit_value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the first non-zero element and determines the start and end indices (exclusive) of the contiguous block of that element. Returns None if no non-zero element exists.
  - name: shift_block_left
    inputs:
      - non_zero_block (start_index)
      - shift_amount (constant value of 3)
    outputs: new_start_index
    description: Calculates the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the original start index. Ensures the result is not less than 0.
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original_sequence_length
      - non_zero_block (digit_value, block_length) # Only need value and length now
      - new_start_index
    outputs: output_sequence (list of integers)
    description: Creates a new sequence of the original length, initialized with zeros. Places the non_zero_block (represented by its digit_value repeated block_length times) into the new sequence starting at the calculated new_start_index, respecting sequence boundaries.

relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
  - If a non_zero_block exists in the input, the output sequence contains the same block (same digit value, same length), shifted left.
  - The non_zero_block in the output sequence starts 3 positions earlier (leftward shift) than in the input sequence, capped at index 0.
  - Elements in the output sequence that are not part of the shifted non_zero_block are zeros.
  - If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output sequence is identical to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence as a list of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Find its digit value, its starting index, and its ending index (exclusive). If no non-zero digits are found, return a copy of the input sequence.
4.  Calculate the length of the non-zero block (end index - start index).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index. Ensure the target starting index is not less than 0 (use `max(0, original_start_index - 3)`).
6.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
7.  Iterate from 0 up to the length of the non-zero block. For each iteration `i`:
    a.  Calculate the index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= target_index < sequence_length`), set the element at `output_sequence[target_index]` to the identified non-zero digit value.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
