**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves processing sequences of single-digit numbers represented as space-separated strings. Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of a non-zero digit (e.g., '2', '3', '8', '6'). The length of the sequences in the examples is consistently 12. The transformation rule appears to involve relocating the non-zero block within the sequence while preserving its length and the non-zero digit itself. The surrounding zeros adjust to accommodate the moved block. Specifically, the non-zero block is shifted three positions to the left.

**Facts:**

    description: Creates a new sequence of the original length, initialized with zeros, and places the non_zero_block at the calculated new_start_index.

relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
  - The output sequence contains the same non_zero_block as the input sequence, but potentially at a different location.
  - The non_zero_block in the output sequence starts 3 positions earlier (leftward shift) than in the input sequence.
  - Elements in the output sequence that are not part of the shifted non_zero_block are zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its value, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified non-zero block from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that indices remain within the bounds of the sequence (indices less than 0 are effectively ignored as the corresponding block elements are not copied).
6.  Format the resulting output sequence back into a space-separated string.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code failed universally across all training and test examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`), but the testing environment is passing the input data as a NumPy array instead.

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by 3 positions) appears consistent across all training examples based on visual inspection. The strategy for resolution involves:

1.  Modifying the `transform` function to accept the input data in its actual format (likely a list of integers or a NumPy array) rather than expecting a string.
2.  Verifying the core block-shifting logic against all examples to ensure its general applicability.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-analyze the examples assuming the input is a list of integers directly, confirming the block identification and shift logic.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence as a list of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Find its digit value, its starting index, and its ending index (exclusive). If no non-zero digits are found, return a copy of the input sequence.
4.  Calculate the length of the non-zero block (end index - start index).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index. Ensure the target starting index is not less than 0 (use `max(0, original_start_index - 3)`).
6.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
7.  Iterate from 0 up to the length of the non-zero block. For each iteration `i`:
    a.  Calculate the index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= target_index < sequence_length`), set the element at `output_sequence[target_index]` to the identified non-zero digit value.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
