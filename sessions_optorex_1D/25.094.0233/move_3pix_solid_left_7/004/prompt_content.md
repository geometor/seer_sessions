"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or array) of integers by finding the first
contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting this block exactly
3 positions to the left to create the output sequence. The sequence length and
the block's value and length remain constant. Positions outside the shifted
block in the output are filled with zeros.
