task_description: Shift a block of identical non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left within a sequence of integers.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list/array of integers representing the input or output state.
    properties:
      - length: Fixed (12 in examples).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - type: block
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value (e.g., 3, 5, 8, 6, 1, 2). Remains constant during transformation.
      - length: The number of times the value repeats consecutively. Remains constant during transformation.
      - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    details: The 'block' identified in the input sequence is moved exactly 3 positions to the left to determine its position in the output sequence.
    constraints:
      - The sequence length remains constant.
      - The block's value and length remain constant.
      - The output sequence is initialized with zeros.
      - The block is placed at the new calculated start index (`start_index_input - 3`) in the output sequence. Elements outside the block remain zero.
input_type: List[int] or np.ndarray
output_type: List[int] or np.ndarray # Based on error, likely numpy array expected/used
