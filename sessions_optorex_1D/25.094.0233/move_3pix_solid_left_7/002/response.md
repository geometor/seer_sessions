**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the test harness or execution environment passed the input data to the `transform` function as a NumPy array, not as the space-separated string the function was designed to accept (`input_grid: str`). The function failed at the first line where it tried to call `.split()` on the input.

The core logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it appears conceptually correct based on the initial analysis and matches all provided examples *if* we assume the input is processed correctly (i.e., as a list or array).

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the input handling of the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_grid.split()`).
2.  Verify the core logic (find block, calculate new start index, create output) against all examples using the corrected input assumption.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the input type and the consistent transformation rule.

**Metrics and Verification**

Let's verify the block identification and shift logic for each example, assuming the input is a list of integers.

            break # End of the block found
    if start_index is not None:
        return start_index, value, length
    else:
        return None, None, None

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics confirm the initial hypothesis:
*   The input and output sequences always have the same length (12).
*   There is always a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in the input.
*   The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.
*   The starting index of the block in the output is consistently 3 less than its starting index in the input (`calculated_output_start` matches `output_block_start`).
*   The transformation rule holds true for all provided training examples.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a block of identical non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left within a sequence of integers.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list/array of integers representing the input or output state.
    properties:
      - length: Fixed (12 in examples).
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - type: block
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value (e.g., 3, 5, 8, 6, 1, 2). Remains constant during transformation.
      - length: The number of times the value repeats consecutively. Remains constant during transformation.
      - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    details: The 'block' identified in the input sequence is moved exactly 3 positions to the left to determine its position in the output sequence.
    constraints:
      - The sequence length remains constant.
      - The block's value and length remain constant.
      - The output sequence is initialized with zeros.
      - The block is placed at the new calculated start index (`start_index_input - 3`) in the output sequence. Elements outside the block remain zero.
input_type: List[int] or np.ndarray
output_type: List[int] or np.ndarray # Based on error, likely numpy array expected/used
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept an input sequence (list or array) of integers.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers. Identify its starting index, its value, and its length.
4.  If no such block is found (e.g., the input is all zeros), return the initialized zero-filled output sequence.
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the block's starting index found in the input sequence.
6.  Copy the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index. Ensure copying stays within the bounds of the output sequence length (indices 0 to length-1).
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
