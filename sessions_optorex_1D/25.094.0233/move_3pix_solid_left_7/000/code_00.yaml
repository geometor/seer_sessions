task_description: Shift a block of identical non-zero numbers within a sequence of zeros.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of integers.
    properties:
      - length: Fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - composition: Primarily zeros, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer (e.g., 3, 5, 8, 6, 1, 2).
      - length: The number of times the value repeats consecutively.
      - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    details: The 'block' identified in the input sequence is moved 3 positions to the left to determine its position in the output sequence.
    constraints:
      - The length of the sequence remains constant.
      - The value and length of the 'block' remain constant.
      - Positions outside the shifted block in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
