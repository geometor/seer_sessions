            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: locate a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence and shift this block exactly 3 positions to the left to produce the output sequence. The length of the sequence, the value of the non-zero integer in the block, and the length of the block remain unchanged. The implementation failed universally across all examples due to a `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`. This indicates an issue within the `find_block` function, likely related to how elements from the input sequence (potentially passed as a NumPy array) were being compared. The strategy is to correct the element comparison logic within `find_block` to handle individual integer values correctly, ensuring it robustly identifies the block's starting index, value, and length, regardless of whether the input is a list or a NumPy array. The overall transformation logic (shifting the identified block left by 3) remains sound.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe analysis of each example confirms the initial hypothesis:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                | Non-Zero Block | Input Start Index | Output Sequence               | Output Start Index | Shift Amount (Left) |\n| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |\n| train_1 | `0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0`     | `3 3 3`        | 5                 | `0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 2                  | 3                   |\n| train_2 | `0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0`     | `5 5 5 5`      | 4                 | `0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 1                  | 3                   |\n| train_3 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0`     | `8`            | 9                 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0`     | 6                  | 3                   |\n| train_4 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6`     | `6 6 6 6 6`    | 7                 | `0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0`     | 4                  | 3                   |\n| train_5 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1`     | `1 1 1 1 1`    | 7                 | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0`     | 4                  | 3                   |\n| train_6 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0`     | `2 2 2`        | 6                 | `0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 3                  | 3                   |\n| train_7 | `0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | `3 3 3`        | 3                 | `3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 0                  | 3                   |\n\nThe shift amount is consistently 3 positions to the left.
