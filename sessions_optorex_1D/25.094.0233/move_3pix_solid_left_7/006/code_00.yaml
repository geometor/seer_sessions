task_description: Shift the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left within a sequence, maintaining sequence length.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1D sequence (list or array) of integers.
    properties:
      - name: input_sequence
        description: The initial sequence provided.
      - name: output_sequence
        description: The target sequence after transformation.
        properties:
          - length: Must be identical to the length of the input_sequence.
          - content: Derived from input_sequence by shifting the non-zero block. Initially composed of zeros.
      - composition: Contains mostly zeros (0) and exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the input_sequence consisting of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer forming the block (e.g., 3, 5, 8). This value is preserved in the output.
      - length: The number of times the value repeats consecutively. This length is preserved in the output.
      - input_start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input_sequence.
      - output_start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the output_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: identification
    action: find_block
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [value, length, input_start_index]
    description: Scan the input_sequence to find the first element that is not zero. Record its value, its starting index, and count how many consecutive times it appears.
  - type: calculation
    action: calculate_output_start_index
    inputs: [input_start_index]
    outputs: [output_start_index]
    description: Subtract 3 from the input_start_index.
  - type: transformation
    action: place_block
    inputs: [output_sequence, value, length, output_start_index]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    description: Modify the initialized output_sequence (all zeros) by placing the identified 'block' (value repeated 'length' times) starting at the calculated 'output_start_index'. Elements of the block falling outside the sequence bounds (index < 0 or index >= sequence length) are discarded.
