"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by finding the first contiguous block
of identical non-zero numbers and shifting this block exactly 3 positions to
the left to create the output sequence. The sequence length and the block's
value and length remain constant. Positions outside the shifted block in the
output are filled with zeros.
