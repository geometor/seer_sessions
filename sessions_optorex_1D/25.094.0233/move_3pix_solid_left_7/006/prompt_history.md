Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Structure:** Each sequence primarily consists of zeros (`0`) and contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `3 3 3`, `5 5 5 5`, `8`).
*   **Length Consistency:** The length of the input sequence is always the same as the length of the output sequence (12 in the examples).
*   **Value Preservation:** The non-zero digit and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged between the input and the output.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the position of the non-zero block within the sequence. Specifically, the block appears to be shifted to the left.

**Fact Analysis (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a block of identical non-zero numbers within a sequence of zeros.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of integers.
    properties:
      - length: Fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - composition: Primarily zeros, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer (e.g., 3, 5, 8, 6, 1, 2).
      - length: The number of times the value repeats consecutively.
      - start_index_input: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - start_index_output: The index where the block begins in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    details: The 'block' identified in the input sequence is moved 3 positions to the left to determine its position in the output sequence.
    constraints:
      - The length of the sequence remains constant.
      - The value and length of the 'block' remain constant.
      - Positions outside the shifted block in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence.
2.  Determine the starting index of this block in the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the block's starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified block of non-zero numbers into the output sequence, beginning at the calculated target starting index.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.
