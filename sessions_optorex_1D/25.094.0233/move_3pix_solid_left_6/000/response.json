Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-zero digits consistently moves 3 positions to the left. The length of the sequence remains constant, and the positions previously occupied by the shifted block (at its original right end) and the positions at the very end of the sequence are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
