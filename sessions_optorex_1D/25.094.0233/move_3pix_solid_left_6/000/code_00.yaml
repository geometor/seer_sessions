task_description: "Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: "A sequence of single digits represented as a space-separated string."
    properties:
      - length: fixed for each input-output pair (appears to be 12 in all examples)
      - content: consists of '0's and a single type of non-zero digit per sequence
  - type: block
    description: "A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits."
    properties:
      - value: the non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 2, 5, 3, 7)
      - length: variable (can be 1 or more)
      - position: defined by the start and end index within the sequence
  - type: zero
    description: "The digit '0', acting as padding or background."
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: "Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence."
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
    outputs:
      - non_zero_block
      - start_index
      - end_index
  - name: shift_block_left
    description: "Move the identified non-zero block 3 positions to the left."
    inputs:
      - non_zero_block
      - start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3
    outputs:
      - new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    description: "Create the output sequence by placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions with zeros."
    inputs:
      - original_length
      - shifted_block
      - new_start_index
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
relationships:
  - "The non-zero block is embedded within a sequence of zeros."
  - "The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block."
  - "The shift amount (3 positions left) is constant across all examples."
