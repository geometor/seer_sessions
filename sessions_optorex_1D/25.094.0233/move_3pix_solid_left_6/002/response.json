            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The previous analysis and generated code assumed the input would be a space-separated string of digits. However, the execution environment provided the input as a `numpy.ndarray`. This caused the `split()` method, which is specific to strings, to fail.\n\nThe underlying logic identified in the initial \"dreamer\" phase (locating a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence padded with zeros) appears to be consistent with all provided examples when viewed conceptually. The strategy is to correct the description of the input format and ensure the natural language program reflects operations on a sequence of numbers (like a list or array) rather than a string.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution failed immediately due to the type error, so no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered from that run. The key metric learned from the failure is the input data type.\n\nRe-evaluating the examples manually, treating inputs/outputs as sequences of integers:\n\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error) or conceptually, a list/sequence of integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 in all training examples.\n*   **Block Identification & Shift:**\n    *   `train_1`: Block `[6]` at index 4 -> shifted to index 1. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_2`: Block `[2]*7` at index 3 -> shifted to index 0. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_3`: Block `[5]*2` at index 7 -> shifted to index 4. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_4`: Block `[5]*6` at index 5 -> shifted to index 2. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_5`: Block `[3]*7` at index 4 -> shifted to index 1. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_6`: Block `[7]*6` at index 6 -> shifted to index 3. (Shift = -3)\n    *   `train_7`: Block `[2]*8` at index 3 -> shifted to index 0. (Shift = -3)\n\nThe analysis confirms a consistent leftward shift of 3 positions for the non-zero block across all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
