Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain the digit `0` and one type of non-zero digit (e.g., `6`, `2`, `5`, `3`, `7`).
3.  **Structure:** In each input, there is a contiguous block (or a single instance) of a non-zero digit, surrounded by zeros.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-zero block. Comparing inputs and outputs, the block of non-zero digits consistently moves 3 positions to the left. The length of the sequence remains constant, and the positions previously occupied by the shifted block (at its original right end) and the positions at the very end of the sequence are filled with zeros.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a block of non-zero digits within a sequence."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: "A sequence of single digits represented as a space-separated string."
    properties:
      - length: fixed for each input-output pair (appears to be 12 in all examples)
      - content: consists of '0's and a single type of non-zero digit per sequence
  - type: block
    description: "A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits."
    properties:
      - value: the non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 2, 5, 3, 7)
      - length: variable (can be 1 or more)
      - position: defined by the start and end index within the sequence
  - type: zero
    description: "The digit '0', acting as padding or background."
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: "Locate the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence."
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
    outputs:
      - non_zero_block
      - start_index
      - end_index
  - name: shift_block_left
    description: "Move the identified non-zero block 3 positions to the left."
    inputs:
      - non_zero_block
      - start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3
    outputs:
      - new_start_index
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    description: "Create the output sequence by placing the shifted block at its new position and filling the remaining positions with zeros."
    inputs:
      - original_length
      - shifted_block
      - new_start_index
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
relationships:
  - "The non-zero block is embedded within a sequence of zeros."
  - "The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block."
  - "The shift amount (3 positions left) is constant across all examples."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits and record its starting index and the block itself.
3.  Determine the new starting index by subtracting 3 from the original starting index.
4.  Construct a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Place the identified non-zero block into the new sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence.
