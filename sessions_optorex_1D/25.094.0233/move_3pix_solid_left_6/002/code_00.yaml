task_description: "Shift a block of non-zero digits 3 positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: "A 1-dimensional sequence (like a list or numpy array) of integers."
    properties:
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - content: consists of 0s and a single type of non-zero digit per sequence
  - type: block
    description: "A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence."
    properties:
      - value: the non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 2, 5, 3, 7)
      - length: variable (>= 1)
      - position: defined by the start index within the sequence
  - type: zero
    description: "The integer 0, acting as padding or background."
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: "Locate the start index and extract the contiguous block of non-zero digits from the input sequence."
    inputs:
      - input_sequence (list or array of integers)
    outputs:
      - non_zero_block (list or array of integers)
      - start_index (integer)
  - name: calculate_new_position
    description: "Determine the target start index for the block in the output sequence."
    inputs:
      - original_start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: -3 (representing 3 positions left)
    outputs:
      - new_start_index (integer)
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    description: "Create the output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros, and place the shifted block at its new position."
    inputs:
      - original_length
      - non_zero_block
      - new_start_index
    outputs:
      - output_sequence (list or array of integers)
relationships:
  - "The non-zero block is embedded within a sequence of zeros."
  - "The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block."
  - "The shift amount (3 positions left) is constant across all examples."
  - "Elements of the block shifted to indices less than 0 are discarded."
  - "Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted block are filled with 0."
