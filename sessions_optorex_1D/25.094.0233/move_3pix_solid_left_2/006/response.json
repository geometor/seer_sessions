            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in NumPy when an entire array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement), instead of comparing individual elements.\n\nGiven that the error occurred within the `find_non_zero_block` function during element comparisons (`if current_val != 0:` or `if sequence[j] == digit:`), and these comparisons *should* work correctly for scalar elements extracted from a 1D array, the most likely cause is that the `input_sequence` passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment was not a 1D NumPy array (shape `(N,)`) or a simple list, but rather a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`). In this case, indexing like `sequence[i]` might still return a 1-element array instead of a scalar, or the initial comparison `if current_val != 0` might be applied to `sequence` itself if it was accidentally interpreted as a single element within a nested structure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input Validation/Normalization:** Modify the `transform` function to check if the input `input_sequence` is a NumPy array and if it has more than one dimension (specifically, if it looks like a `(1, N)` row vector).\n2.  **Extract 1D Sequence:** If the input is a 2D array like `[[...]]`, extract the first (and only) row to get the actual 1D sequence before passing it to `find_non_zero_block` or processing it further.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying logic of finding the non-zero block and shifting it left by 3 positions appears correct based on the examples and should be preserved.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nSince the code failed execution, runtime metrics are unavailable. The analysis focuses on the input-output relationship and the identified pattern.\n\n*   **Consistency:** All examples follow the same transformation rule.\n*   **Rule:** Identify the contiguous block of a single non-zero digit. Shift this block exactly 3 positions to the left. Fill the vacated positions and any positions outside the array bounds after shifting with zeros. The length and digit of the block remain unchanged.\n*   **Input Format Assumption:** The error suggests the data format provided to the function during testing differs slightly from a plain 1D list or array (likely nested or 2D).\n\nLet's analyze the block properties for each training example:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                     | Non-Zero Block | Digit | Input Start Index | Length | Output Start Index | Output Sequence                    |\n| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :---- | :---------------- | :----- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4]`        | `444444`       | 4     | 6                 | 6      | 3                  | `[0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_2 | `[0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0]`        | `5555555`      | 5     | 4                 | 7      | 1                  | `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_3 | `[0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0]`        | `88888`        | 8     | 4                 | 5      | 1                  | `[0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0]`        | `22`           | 2     | 7                 | 2      | 4                  | `[0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0]`        | `9`            | 9     | 7                 | 1      | 4                  | `[0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_6 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4]`        | `4`            | 4     | 11                | 1      | 8                  | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0]`        |\n| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0]`        | `77777`        | 7     | 6                 | 5      | 3                  | `[0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0]`        |\n\nThe relationship `Output Start Index = Input Start Index - 3` holds true for all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
