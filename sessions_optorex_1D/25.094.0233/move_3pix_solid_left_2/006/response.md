**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in NumPy when an entire array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement), instead of comparing individual elements.

Given that the error occurred within the `find_non_zero_block` function during element comparisons (`if current_val != 0:` or `if sequence[j] == digit:`), and these comparisons *should* work correctly for scalar elements extracted from a 1D array, the most likely cause is that the `input_sequence` passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment was not a 1D NumPy array (shape `(N,)`) or a simple list, but rather a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`). In this case, indexing like `sequence[i]` might still return a 1-element array instead of a scalar, or the initial comparison `if current_val != 0` might be applied to `sequence` itself if it was accidentally interpreted as a single element within a nested structure.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Validation/Normalization:** Modify the `transform` function to check if the input `input_sequence` is a NumPy array and if it has more than one dimension (specifically, if it looks like a `(1, N)` row vector).
2.  **Extract 1D Sequence:** If the input is a 2D array like `[[...]]`, extract the first (and only) row to get the actual 1D sequence before passing it to `find_non_zero_block` or processing it further.
3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The underlying logic of finding the non-zero block and shifting it left by 3 positions appears correct based on the examples and should be preserved.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Since the code failed execution, runtime metrics are unavailable. The analysis focuses on the input-output relationship and the identified pattern.

*   **Consistency:** All examples follow the same transformation rule.
*   **Rule:** Identify the contiguous block of a single non-zero digit. Shift this block exactly 3 positions to the left. Fill the vacated positions and any positions outside the array bounds after shifting with zeros. The length and digit of the block remain unchanged.
*   **Input Format Assumption:** The error suggests the data format provided to the function during testing differs slightly from a plain 1D list or array (likely nested or 2D).

Let's analyze the block properties for each training example:

| Example | Input Sequence                     | Non-Zero Block | Digit | Input Start Index | Length | Output Start Index | Output Sequence                    |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :---- | :---------------- | :----- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4]`        | `444444`       | 4     | 6                 | 6      | 3                  | `[0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0]`        |

| train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0]`        | `22`           | 2     | 7                 | 2      | 4                  | `[0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        |
| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0]`        | `9`            | 9     | 7                 | 1      | 4                  | `[0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        |
| train_6 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4]`        | `4`            | 4     | 11                | 1      | 8                  | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0]`        |
| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0]`        | `77777`        | 7     | 6                 | 5      | 3                  | `[0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0]`        |

The relationship `Output Start Index = Input Start Index - 3` holds true for all examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (expected length 12).
2.  Check if the input is structured as a sequence nested within another (e.g., a list containing one list, or a 2D NumPy array with one row). If so, extract the inner 1D sequence. Otherwise, use the input directly as the 1D sequence.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of length 12, filled with zeros.
4.  Scan the 1D input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. If found, record its value (`digit`), its starting index (`input_start_index`), and determine the length (`length`) of the contiguous block of this `digit`.
5.  If a non-zero block was found:
    a.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: `output_start_index = input_start_index - 3`.
    b.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`. For each `i`:
        i.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = output_start_index + i`.
        ii. If `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), place the `digit` at `output_sequence[target_index]`.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
