task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits three positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_or_numpy_array_of_integers
    description: "A fixed-length (12) sequence containing mostly zeros and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit."
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: zero_digit
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: "Acts as the background or padding element."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    description: "A block of identical non-zero digits within the sequence."
    properties:
      - digit_value: "The specific non-zero integer (e.g., 4, 5, 8)."
      - length: "The number of times the digit repeats in the block."
      - start_index_input: "The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence."
      - start_index_output: "The calculated starting position (0-based index) of the block in the output sequence."

    description: "Determine the target start index for the block in the output sequence."
    inputs: [start_index_input]
    outputs: [start_index_output]
    formula: "start_index_output = start_index_input - 3"

    description: "Create the output sequence by initializing it with zeros and placing the identified block at the calculated new start index."
    inputs: [sequence_length, digit_value, length, start_index_output]

    details: "Iterate from 0 to length-1. For each iteration 'i', if 0 <= start_index_output + i < sequence_length, set output_sequence[start_index_output + i] = digit_value."
