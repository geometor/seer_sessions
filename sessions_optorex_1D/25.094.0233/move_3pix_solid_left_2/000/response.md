Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Data Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** All sequences (input and output) consistently have a length of 12.
*   **Content:** Each sequence primarily contains the digit 0, acting as a background or padding element.
*   **Distinct Feature:** Within each input sequence, there is a contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., `444444`, `5555555`, `22`).
*   **Transformation:** The primary change between input and output is the *position* of this contiguous block of non-zero digits. The block itself (the digit used and the number of times it repeats) remains unchanged. The block appears to shift to the left.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence (12 elements), filling it entirely with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. Record this digit's value and its starting index.
3.  Continue scanning from the starting index to find the end of the contiguous block of this non-zero digit. Record the length of this block.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 3 from the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Copy the block of non-zero digits (using the recorded value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new index.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.
