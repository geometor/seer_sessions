task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: "A fixed-length (12) sequence containing mostly zeros and one contiguous block of a non-zero digit."
  - name: zero_digit
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: "Acts as the background or padding element."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    description: "A block of identical non-zero digits within the sequence."
    properties:
      - digit_value: "The specific non-zero integer (e.g., 4, 5, 8)."
      - length: "The number of times the digit repeats in the block."
      - start_index_input: "The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the input sequence."
      - start_index_output: "The starting position (0-based index) of the block in the output sequence."
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    description: "Locate the start index, end index, digit value, and length of the non_zero_block in the input sequence."
  - name: shift_block_left
    description: "Move the identified non_zero_block three positions to the left."
    details: "The new start index is the original start index minus 3."
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    description: "Create the output sequence by placing the shifted block into a sequence of zeros of the original length."
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift

    properties: ["digit_value", "length"]
    description: "The value of the non-zero digit and the length of the block remain unchanged from input to output."
