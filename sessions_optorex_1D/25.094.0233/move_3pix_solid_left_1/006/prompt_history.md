*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D sequences (or lists) of single digits.
    *   Each sequence contains a background of '0' digits.
    *   Within the '0' background, there is a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '9 9 9 9 9', '2 2 2 2 2 2', '4 4 4 4').
    *   The transformation involves changing the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note its starting position, length, and the digit value.
    2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-zero block by subtracting 3 from its original starting position in the input sequence.
    4.  Copy the identified non-zero block (with its original digit value and length) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
    5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
