*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D sequences (or lists) of single digits.
    *   Each sequence contains a background of '0' digits.
    *   Within the '0' background, there is a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '9 9 9 9 9', '2 2 2 2 2 2', '4 4 4 4').
    *   The transformation involves changing the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note its starting position, length, and the digit value.
    2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-zero block by subtracting 3 from its original starting position in the input sequence.
    4.  Copy the identified non-zero block (with its original digit value and length) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
    5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples.
    *   The errors reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate a mismatch between the expected input type (a string) in the `transform` function and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array).
    *   The strategy is to correct the input handling in the code to work directly with a sequence (list or array) of numbers, rather than requiring string parsing. The underlying logic of identifying and shifting the block remains valid.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Consistency:** All examples follow the same pattern.
    *   **Input/Output Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant in all examples (12 elements).
    *   **Non-Zero Block:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.
    *   **Shift Amount:** The starting position of the non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the left. Let's verify:
        *   Ex 1: Start 7 -> Start 4 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 2: Start 4 -> Start 1 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 3: Start 4 -> Start 1 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 4: Start 7 -> Start 4 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 5: Start 8 -> Start 5 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 6: Start 10 -> Start 7 (Shift = 3)
        *   Ex 7: Start 10 -> Start 7 (Shift = 3)
    *   **Padding:** The positions vacated by the shift (at the original end of the block) and any positions the block moves away from are filled with zeros.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of integers).
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its starting index, length, and the digit value.
    3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its starting index in the input sequence.
    5.  Copy the identified non-zero block (using its original digit value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index.
    6.  Return the modified output sequence.
