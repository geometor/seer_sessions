            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the left) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples.\n    *   The errors reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate a mismatch between the expected input type (a string) in the `transform` function and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array).\n    *   The strategy is to correct the input handling in the code to work directly with a sequence (list or array) of numbers, rather than requiring string parsing. The underlying logic of identifying and shifting the block remains valid.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Consistency:** All examples follow the same pattern.\n    *   **Input/Output Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant in all examples (12 elements).\n    *   **Non-Zero Block:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.\n    *   **Shift Amount:** The starting position of the non-zero block consistently shifts 3 positions to the left. Let's verify:\n        *   Ex 1: Start 7 -> Start 4 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 2: Start 4 -> Start 1 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 3: Start 4 -> Start 1 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 4: Start 7 -> Start 4 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 5: Start 8 -> Start 5 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 6: Start 10 -> Start 7 (Shift = 3)\n        *   Ex 7: Start 10 -> Start 7 (Shift = 3)\n    *   **Padding:** The positions vacated by the shift (at the original end of the block) and any positions the block moves away from are filled with zeros.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
