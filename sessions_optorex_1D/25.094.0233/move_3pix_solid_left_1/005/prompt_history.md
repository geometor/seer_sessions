*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 1D sequences (or lists) of single digits.
    *   Each sequence contains a background of '0' digits.
    *   Within the '0' background, there is a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '9 9 9 9 9', '2 2 2 2 2 2', '4 4 4 4').
    *   The transformation involves changing the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note its starting position, length, and the digit value.
    2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-zero block by subtracting 3 from its original starting position in the input sequence.
    4.  Copy the identified non-zero block (with its original digit value and length) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
    5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The provided training examples consistently demonstrate a transformation where a single, contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a sequence of zeros is shifted three positions to the left.
    *   The error message ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") encountered during testing likely originates from the testing framework itself, potentially due to type mismatches (e.g., comparing a list output to a numpy array expected output) or how data is passed to the function, rather than a fundamental flaw in the previously deduced transformation logic. The core logic involves standard list operations and integer comparisons, which are not inherently ambiguous.
    *   The strategy is to re-verify the "shift left by 3" rule across all examples by extracting metrics (start index, length, value, new start index) and confirm its consistency. Then, refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on this confirmed rule. The implementation detail causing the specific runtime error is outside the scope of defining the transformation rule itself but suggests the coder phase needs to be mindful of potential numpy interactions in the execution environment.

      description: The contiguous block of non-zero digits is moved 3 positions towards the beginning of the sequence. Positions outside the new block location are filled with zeros.
    constraints:
      - The input sequence always contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
      - The background consists of zeros.
      - The shift amount is fixed at 3 positions to the left.
      - Digits shifted past the beginning of the sequence (index < 0) are truncated/lost.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record its starting index (`start_index`), its length (`length`), and the digit value (`value`).
    3.  Calculate the target starting index (`new_start_index`) for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the `start_index` found in the input.
    4.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
        a.  Calculate the current position in the output sequence: `output_pos = new_start_index + i`.
        b.  If `output_pos` is a valid index within the bounds of the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= output_pos < sequence_length`), place the recorded digit `value` at `output_sequence[output_pos]`.
    5.  Return the modified output sequence.
