"""
Given an input grid (likely 1x12), extract the sequence. Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers. Create a new zero-filled sequence of the same length (12). Place the identified block into the new sequence, shifted 3 positions to the left compared to its original position. Handle boundary conditions by truncating any part of the block that shifts to an index less than 0.
