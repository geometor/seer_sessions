**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of integers represented as space-separated strings. All sequences have a fixed length of 12.
*   **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. The rest of the elements are zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a positional shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Details:** The non-zero block consistently moves 3 positions to the left.
*   **Boundary Behavior:** When the shift causes the block to cross the left boundary (index 0), the portion that would go to negative indices is truncated. The positions vacated by the block at its original location become zeros. The positions at the right end of the sequence, which are not filled by the shifted block, remain zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Locate the contiguous sub-sequence (block) consisting of identical non-zero integers. Determine its value, its starting index, and its length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. If the target starting index is less than 0, begin copying the block into the output sequence starting at index 0, effectively truncating the elements that would have fallen outside the left boundary. Ensure that copying stops at the end of the sequence (index 11).
6.  Return the generated output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" consistently appears across all examples when executing the NumPy version of the `transform` function. This strongly suggests that an operation within the function, likely inside the `find_non_zero_block` helper function, is attempting to evaluate a multi-element NumPy array as a single boolean value (e.g., in an `if` statement).

The most probable cause is that the input `input_grid`, expected to be a 1D array (a sequence), is actually being passed as a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)` instead of `(12,)`). When iterating over a 2D array with `enumerate`, each `val` becomes a row (a 1D array), and comparisons like `val != 0` result in a boolean array, triggering the error.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to check if the input `input_grid` is 2D with a single row. If so, extract the first row (`input_grid[0]`) to use as the 1D sequence for processing.
2.  Ensure the `find_non_zero_block` function operates correctly on this extracted 1D array.
3.  Ensure the output format is a 1D array as shown in the examples.
4.  Update the YAML description and Natural Language Program to reflect this potential input structure and the necessary handling.

**Metrics Gathering (Simulated Analysis):**

Assuming the hypothesis that inputs are passed as 2D arrays (shape (1, 12)) is correct:

*   **Input Dimension:** Likely 2D `(1, 12)`.
*   **Expected Processing Dimension:** 1D `(12,)`.
*   **`find_non_zero_block` Iteration:** When iterating `enumerate(input_grid)` on a `(1, 12)` array, `val` becomes a 1D array of shape `(12,)`.
*   **Error Point:** The comparison `val != 0` inside `find_non_zero_block` attempts to evaluate `array([...]) != 0`, which produces a boolean array `array([False, ..., True, ...])`. This boolean array cannot be implicitly converted to a single True/False value for the `if` statement, hence the error.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is expected to be a grid, likely with dimensions 1x12 (a single row containing the sequence).
2.  Extract the 1D sequence of 12 integers from the input grid (if it's 2D, take the first row).
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the extracted 1D input sequence to locate the contiguous sub-sequence (block) consisting of identical non-zero integers. Determine its non-zero value, its starting index within the 1D sequence, and its length.
5.  If no non-zero block is found, return the zero-filled output sequence.
6.  If a block is found, calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 (the shift amount) from its original starting index.
7.  Iterate through the length of the identified block. For each element in the block:
    a.  Calculate its target index in the output sequence based on the `new_start_index`.
    b.  If the target index is within the valid range of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), place the block's non-zero value at that target index in the output sequence. Otherwise (if the target index is less than 0), do nothing (effectively truncating the element).
8.  Return the generated 1D output sequence.
