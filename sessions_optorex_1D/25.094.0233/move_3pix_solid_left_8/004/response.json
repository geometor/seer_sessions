            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" consistently appears across all examples when executing the NumPy version of the `transform` function. This strongly suggests that an operation within the function, likely inside the `find_non_zero_block` helper function, is attempting to evaluate a multi-element NumPy array as a single boolean value (e.g., in an `if` statement).\n\nThe most probable cause is that the input `input_grid`, expected to be a 1D array (a sequence), is actually being passed as a 2D array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)` instead of `(12,)`). When iterating over a 2D array with `enumerate`, each `val` becomes a row (a 1D array), and comparisons like `val != 0` result in a boolean array, triggering the error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to check if the input `input_grid` is 2D with a single row. If so, extract the first row (`input_grid[0]`) to use as the 1D sequence for processing.\n2.  Ensure the `find_non_zero_block` function operates correctly on this extracted 1D array.\n3.  Ensure the output format is a 1D array as shown in the examples.\n4.  Update the YAML description and Natural Language Program to reflect this potential input structure and the necessary handling.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Simulated Analysis):**\n\nAssuming the hypothesis that inputs are passed as 2D arrays (shape (1, 12)) is correct:\n\n*   **Input Dimension:** Likely 2D `(1, 12)`.\n*   **Expected Processing Dimension:** 1D `(12,)`.\n*   **`find_non_zero_block` Iteration:** When iterating `enumerate(input_grid)` on a `(1, 12)` array, `val` becomes a 1D array of shape `(12,)`.\n*   **Error Point:** The comparison `val != 0` inside `find_non_zero_block` attempts to evaluate `array([...]) != 0`, which produces a boolean array `array([False, ..., True, ...])`. This boolean array cannot be implicitly converted to a single True/False value for the `if` statement, hence the error.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
