task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within a sequence three positions to the left."
data_representation:
  - type: grid # Changed from sequence to grid based on error analysis
    format: NumPy ndarray
    dimensionality: Likely 2D with shape (1, 12), representing a single sequence/row.
    elements: integers (0 and one other non-zero integer per sequence)
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - shape: typically (1, 12)
      - elements: list of lists of integers (single inner list)
  - name: sequence # The effective 1D sequence to operate on
    derivation: Extracted from the first row of input_grid if it's 2D.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: list of integers
  - name: zero_element
    value: 0
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0 (constant within the block)
      - contiguity: elements are adjacent within the sequence
      - uniqueness: only one such block per sequence
      - start_index: integer >= 0 (relative to the 1D sequence)
      - end_index: integer < 12 (relative to the 1D sequence)
      - length: integer > 0
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: "The non_zero_block is contained within the sequence, surrounded by zero_elements."
  - type: extraction
    description: "The 1D sequence is extracted from the input_grid (typically the first row)."
actions:
  - name: extract_sequence
    input: input_grid
    output: 1D sequence (NumPy array)
    condition: If input_grid is 2D with shape (1, N), use input_grid[0]. Otherwise, use input_grid directly if already 1D.
  - name: identify_block
    input: 1D sequence
    output: non_zero_block (value, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_block_left
    target: non_zero_block (position)
    parameter: shift_amount (constant value of 3)
    result: new_start_index = original_start_index - 3
  - name: construct_output
    input: sequence length (12), identified block (value, length), new_start_index
    output: output sequence (1D NumPy array)
    process: Create a 1D sequence of zeros, then place the block at the new position, handling boundary truncation (indices < 0 are clipped).
transformation_rule: "Given an input grid (likely 1x12), extract the sequence. Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers. Create a new zero-filled sequence of the same length. Place the identified block into the new sequence, shifted 3 positions to the left compared to its original position. Handle boundary conditions by truncating any part of the block that shifts to an index less than 0."
constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: 3 (to the left)
