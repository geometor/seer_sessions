Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of integers represented as space-separated strings. All sequences have a fixed length of 12.
*   **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. The rest of the elements are zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed is a positional shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Details:** The non-zero block consistently moves 3 positions to the left.
*   **Boundary Behavior:** When the shift causes the block to cross the left boundary (index 0), the portion that would go to negative indices is truncated. The positions vacated by the block at its original location become zeros. The positions at the right end of the sequence, which are not filled by the shifted block, remain zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Locate the contiguous sub-sequence (block) consisting of identical non-zero integers. Determine its value, its starting index, and its length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. If the target starting index is less than 0, begin copying the block into the output sequence starting at index 0, effectively truncating the elements that would have fallen outside the left boundary. Ensure that copying stops at the end of the sequence (index 11).
6.  Return the generated output sequence.
