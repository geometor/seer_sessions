task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within a sequence."
data_representation:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated integers
    length: 12
    elements: integers (0 and one other non-zero integer per sequence)
objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: list of integers
  - name: zero_element
    value: 0
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0 (constant within the block)
      - contiguity: elements are adjacent
      - uniqueness: only one such block per input sequence
      - start_index: integer >= 0
      - end_index: integer < 12
      - length: integer > 0
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: "The non_zero_block is contained within the sequence, surrounded by zero_elements."
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input sequence
    output: non_zero_block (value, start_index, length)
  - name: shift_block_left
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter: shift_amount (constant value of 3)
    result: new_start_index = original_start_index - 3
  - name: construct_output
    input: original sequence length, identified block (value, length), new_start_index
    output: output sequence
    process: Create a sequence of zeros, then place the block at the new position, handling boundary truncation.
transformation_rule: "The output sequence is generated by shifting the non_zero_block from the input sequence 3 positions to the left."
constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: 3 (to the left)
