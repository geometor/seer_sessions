**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided code consistently failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format (a space-separated string) and the actual input format provided during execution (a NumPy array).

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input handling in the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly.
2.  Correct the output handling to return a NumPy array or a list, as expected by the execution environment (assuming it mirrors the input type).
3.  Re-validate the core logic (finding the block, calculating the shift, and constructing the output) using the corrected input/output types.
4.  Update the YAML Fact Document and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the data types and refined transformation steps.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Since the code failed before processing, we can infer the input type is `numpy.ndarray`. Let's re-analyze the examples assuming array input and apply the intended logic mentally or with corrected snippets to gather metrics.

*   **train_1:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0]`, Block: `val=4, start=5, len=3`. New start: `5 - 3 = 2`. Output: `[0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_2:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3]`, Block: `val=3, start=11, len=1`. New start: `11 - 3 = 8`. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0]`
*   **train_3:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]`, Block: `val=1, start=6, len=4`. New start: `6 - 3 = 3`. Output: `[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_4:** Input `[0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0]`, Block: `val=9, start=4, len=2`. New start: `4 - 3 = 1`. Output: `[0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_5:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7]`, Block: `val=7, start=8, len=4`. New start: `8 - 3 = 5`. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0]`
*   **train_6:** Input `[0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`, Block: `val=3, start=3, len=8`. New start: `3 - 3 = 0`. Output: `[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_7:** Input `[0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0]`, Block: `val=4, start=4, len=6`. New start: `4 - 3 = 1`. Output: `[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`

The core logic appears consistent with the examples when the correct input type is considered.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within a sequence 3 positions to the left."
data_representation:
  - type: sequence (array)
    format: numpy.ndarray or similar list/array of integers
    length: 12
    elements: integers (0 and one other non-zero integer per sequence)
objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: list or array of integers
  - name: zero_element

  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0 (constant within the block)
      - contiguity: elements are adjacent
      - uniqueness: only one such block per input sequence

  - name: identify_block
    input: input sequence (array)
    output: non_zero_block (value, start_index, length)
    process: Iterate through the input array to find the first non-zero element (start_index, value), then count consecutive identical elements (length).
  - name: shift_block_left

    result: new_start_index = original_start_index - 3
  - name: construct_output
    input: sequence length (12), identified block (value, length), new_start_index
    output: output sequence (array)
    process: Create an array of zeros of the specified length. Iterate from i = 0 to block_length - 1. Calculate the target index in the output array as new_start_index + i. If the target index is within the bounds [0, 11], place the block_value at that index in the output array.
transformation_rule: "The output sequence (array) is generated by shifting the non_zero_block found in the input sequence (array) 3 positions to the left, truncating any part of the block that shifts beyond index 0."

  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: 3 (to the left)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
2.  Locate the contiguous sub-sequence (block) consisting of identical non-zero integers. Determine its value, its starting index, and its length by iterating through the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence (list or array) of 12 integers, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index found in the input sequence.
5.  Iterate `i` from 0 up to (but not including) the length of the block.
6.  For each `i`, calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
7.  Check if the `target_index` is valid (greater than or equal to 0 and less than 12).
8.  If the `target_index` is valid, place the block's value at that `target_index` in the output sequence.
9.  Return the generated output sequence (list or array).
