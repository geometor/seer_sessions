Okay, let's analyze the input and output pairs to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings containing space-separated integers. They represent sequences of numbers.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action appears to be replacing some of the zero (`0`) values in the input sequence with non-zero values.
3.  **Non-Zero Values:** Non-zero values in the input generally seem to retain their position and value in the output.
4.  **Zero Replacement Logic:** The replacement of zeros depends on the surrounding non-zero numbers. Specifically, a sequence of zeros located *between* two non-zero numbers is replaced by the value of the non-zero number that appears *immediately to its right*.
5.  **Boundary Conditions:**
    *   Zeros appearing *before* the first non-zero number in the sequence remain zero.
    *   Zeros appearing *after* the last non-zero number in the sequence remain zero.
    *   If there are fewer than two non-zero numbers, no zero replacement occurs between them.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      - length
      - elements: integers
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      - length: same as input
      - elements: integers
objects:
  - name: integer_element
    properties:
      - value: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero elements act as boundaries for sequences of zero elements.
  - type: dependency
    description: The replacement value for a zero depends on the value of the nearest non-zero element to its right within the segment defined by two consecutive non-zero elements.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices of all non-zero elements in the input sequence.
  - name: iterate_segments
    description: Process the segments of the sequence between consecutive non-zero elements.
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Replace zero elements within a segment with the value of the right boundary non-zero element of that segment.
  - name: preserve_outer_zeros
    description: Zeros before the first non-zero element and after the last non-zero element are not modified.
  - name: preserve_non_zeros
    description: Non-zero elements retain their original value and position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated integers.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence (e.g., a list) to store the results.
3.  Identify the indices of all non-zero integers in the original input sequence.
4.  Iterate through the identified non-zero indices. For each pair of consecutive non-zero indices, let the left index be `idx_left` and the right index be `idx_right`.
5.  Retrieve the integer value present at `idx_right` in the original input sequence; this is the `fill_value`.
6.  For each index `k` starting from `idx_left + 1` up to `idx_right - 1`:
    *   If the integer at index `k` in the original input sequence is 0, update the integer at index `k` in the results copy to the `fill_value`.
7.  After iterating through all pairs of consecutive non-zero indices, format the modified results sequence back into a string of space-separated integers.
8.  Output the resulting string.
```python

  2. For every sequence of zeros located strictly *between* two consecutive non-zero integers,

  3. Zeros appearing before the first non-zero integer remain zero.
  4. Zeros appearing after the last non-zero integer remain zero.
  5. Non-zero integers retain their original values and positions.
