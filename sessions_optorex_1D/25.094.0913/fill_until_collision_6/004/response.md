**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results consistently show a `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]'`. This error occurs because the input string being processed by the `int()` function (or indirectly via `numpy` array creation) is not a simple sequence of space-separated numbers as initially assumed. Instead, the input appears to be the *string representation* of a list or array, including the square brackets `[` and `]`.

The core transformation logic (filling zeros between non-zero boundaries with the right boundary's value) developed previously seems plausible based on the input/output pairs, but it couldn't be tested due to the input parsing failure.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the understanding of the input format: Recognize that the input is a string containing brackets and numbers.
2.  Update the initial parsing step in the natural language program to include cleaning the input string (removing brackets) before splitting it into numbers.
3.  Re-validate the core transformation logic conceptually against the examples, assuming the corrected parsing.

**Metrics Gathering**

The consistent error across all examples confirms the input format issue. No further computation is needed to understand this specific failure mode. The lengths of input and output sequences remain consistent within each example pair.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input, which is a string representing a sequence of integers, possibly enclosed in brackets (e.g., `"[5 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 4 0 0]"`).
2.  Clean the input string by removing any leading `[` and trailing `]` characters and trimming whitespace.
3.  Parse the cleaned string into a sequence (e.g., a list) of integers by splitting on spaces.
4.  Create a mutable copy of the integer sequence to store the results.
5.  Identify the indices of all non-zero integers in the original parsed sequence.
6.  If there are fewer than two non-zero integers, proceed directly to step 10.
7.  Iterate through the identified non-zero indices. For each pair of *consecutive* non-zero indices, let the left index be `idx_left` and the right index be `idx_right`.
8.  Retrieve the integer value present at `idx_right` in the original parsed sequence; this is the `fill_value`.
9.  For each index `k` starting from `idx_left + 1` up to `idx_right - 1` (i.e., the indices strictly between the boundaries):
    *   If the integer at index `k` in the original parsed sequence is 0, update the integer at index `k` in the results copy to the `fill_value`.
10. Format the modified results sequence back into a string of space-separated integers.
11. Output the resulting string.
