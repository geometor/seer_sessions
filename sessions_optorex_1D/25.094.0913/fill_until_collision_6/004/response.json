            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided execution results consistently show a `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]'`. This error occurs because the input string being processed by the `int()` function (or indirectly via `numpy` array creation) is not a simple sequence of space-separated numbers as initially assumed. Instead, the input appears to be the *string representation* of a list or array, including the square brackets `[` and `]`.\n\nThe core transformation logic (filling zeros between non-zero boundaries with the right boundary's value) developed previously seems plausible based on the input/output pairs, but it couldn't be tested due to the input parsing failure.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the understanding of the input format: Recognize that the input is a string containing brackets and numbers.\n2.  Update the initial parsing step in the natural language program to include cleaning the input string (removing brackets) before splitting it into numbers.\n3.  Re-validate the core transformation logic conceptually against the examples, assuming the corrected parsing.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe consistent error across all examples confirms the input format issue. No further computation is needed to understand this specific failure mode. The lengths of input and output sequences remain consistent within each example pair.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
