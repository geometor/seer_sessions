task_elements:
  - type: sequence_string
    description: Input is a string representation of a sequence of integers, potentially including brackets and spaces.
    properties:
      - format: String containing space-separated integers, enclosed in square brackets '[]'.
  - type: sequence
    description: Intermediate representation is a sequence (e.g., list or NumPy array) of integers derived from the input string.
    properties:
      - length
      - elements: integers
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - length: same as input
      - elements: integers
objects:
  - name: integer_element
    properties:
      - value: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
  - name: non_zero_boundary
    properties:
      - value: integer value > 0
      - index: position in the sequence
  - name: zero_segment
    properties:
      - start_index: position after a left non-zero boundary
      - end_index: position before a right non-zero boundary
      - elements: sequence of zeros
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero elements act as boundaries defining segments potentially containing zeros.
  - type: dependency
    description: The replacement value for a zero_segment depends on the value of the right non-zero boundary defining that segment.
actions:
  - name: clean_input_string
    description: Remove leading/trailing characters (like '[' and ']') from the input string.
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the cleaned input string into a sequence of integers.
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices of all non-zero elements in the integer sequence.
  - name: iterate_segments
    description: Process the segments of the sequence between consecutive non-zero element indices.
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Replace zero elements within a segment with the value of the right boundary non-zero element of that segment.
  - name: preserve_outer_zeros
    description: Zeros before the first non-zero element and after the last non-zero element are not modified.
  - name: preserve_non_zeros
    description: Non-zero elements retain their original value and position.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the modified integer sequence back into a space-separated string.
