  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      - length
      - elements: integers
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      - length: same as input
      - elements: integers
objects:
  - name: integer_element
    properties:
      - value: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero elements act as boundaries for sequences of zero elements.
  - type: dependency
    description: The replacement value for a zero depends on the value of the nearest non-zero element to its right within the segment defined by two consecutive non-zero elements.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices of all non-zero elements in the input sequence.
  - name: iterate_segments
    description: Process the segments of the sequence between consecutive non-zero elements.
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Replace zero elements within a segment with the value of the right boundary non-zero element of that segment.
  - name: preserve_outer_zeros
    description: Zeros before the first non-zero element and after the last non-zero element are not modified.
  - name: preserve_non_zeros
    description: Non-zero elements retain their original value and position.
