They represent sequences of numbers.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action appears to be replacing some of the zero (`0`) values in the input sequence with non-zero values.\n3.  **Non-Zero Values:** Non-zero values in the input generally seem to retain their position and value in the output.\n4.  **Zero Replacement Logic:** The replacement of zeros depends on the surrounding non-zero numbers. Specifically, a sequence of zeros located *between* two non-zero numbers is replaced by the value of the non-zero number that appears *immediately to its right*.\n5.  **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   Zeros appearing *before* the first non-zero number in the sequence remain zero.\n    *   Zeros appearing *after* the last non-zero number in the sequence remain zero.\n    *   If there are fewer than two non-zero numbers, no zero replacement occurs between them.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
