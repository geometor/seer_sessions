task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers.
    properties:
      - length
      - elements: integers (including zero and non-zero)
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is derived from the input array, maintaining length and modifying some zero values. Expected output format seems to be a space-separated string representation of the modified array.
    properties:
      - length: same as input
      - elements: integers
objects:
  - name: integer_element
    properties:
      - value: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the array
  - name: non_zero_element
    description: An element whose value is not 0. Acts as a boundary marker.
    properties:
      - value
      - position (index)
  - name: zero_element_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of one or more zero elements located between two non-zero elements.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero elements define segments containing potential zero elements to be modified.
  - type: dependency
    description: The replacement value for a zero element within a segment depends on the value of the non-zero element defining the right boundary of that segment.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices of all non-zero elements in the input NumPy array.
  - name: iterate_segments
    description: Process the segments of the array between consecutive non-zero element indices.
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Within a segment defined by `idx_left` and `idx_right`, replace zero elements at indices `k` (where `idx_left < k < idx_right`) with the value of the element at `idx_right`.
  - name: preserve_elements
    description: Non-zero elements, zeros before the first non-zero element, and zeros after the last non-zero element are not modified.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the modified NumPy array back into a space-separated string.
