            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The initial analysis assumed the input was a space-separated string, leading to the use of the `.split()` method. However, the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the function receives a NumPy array as input, not a string.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified in the \"dreamer\" phase (filling sequences of zeros between non-zero numbers with the value of the right-hand non-zero number) appears sound based on the visual inspection of the examples. The strategy is to correct the input handling to work directly with NumPy arrays and then re-verify the transformation logic against the examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nThe provided code failed during the initial input processing step (`input_str.split()`) for all examples because the input was a NumPy array, not a string. Therefore, no logical processing or comparison against the expected output occurred.\n\nTo proceed, we need to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays. Assuming the input `input_data` is a NumPy array:\n\n"
