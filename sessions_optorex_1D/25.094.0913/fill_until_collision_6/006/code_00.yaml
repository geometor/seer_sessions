task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input is a 1-dimensional sequence (NumPy array) of integers.
    properties:
      - length
      - elements: integers (including zeros and non-zeros)
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of integers, formatted as a space-separated string.
    properties:
      - length: same as input
      - elements: integers (potentially modified from input)
objects:
  - name: integer_element
    properties:
      - value: can be zero or non-zero
      - position: index within the sequence
  - name: non_zero_boundary
    properties:
      - value: the non-zero integer value
      - index: position in the sequence
  - name: zero_segment
    properties:
      - start_index: index after a left non-zero boundary
      - end_index: index before a right non-zero boundary
      - length: number of zeros in the segment
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero elements act as boundaries defining segments of zero elements.
  - type: dependency
    description: The replacement value for a zero segment depends on the value of the non-zero element defining the right boundary of that segment.
actions:
  - name: receive_input_array
    description: Accept a 1D NumPy array of integers as input.
  - name: copy_array
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input array for modification.
  - name: find_non_zero_indices
    description: Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the original input array.
  - name: iterate_segments
    description: Loop through pairs of consecutive non-zero indices found.
  - name: fill_zeros_in_segment
    description: For each segment between consecutive non-zero indices, replace all original zero elements within that segment in the copied array with the value of the non-zero element at the right boundary index (from the original array).
  - name: preserve_outer_zeros
    description: Implicitly handled by only modifying zeros *between* non-zero boundaries. Zeros before the first non-zero element or after the last non-zero element are not targeted by the filling logic.
  - name: preserve_non_zeros
    description: Implicitly handled by only modifying elements that were originally zero. Non-zero elements are used as boundaries and fill values but are not themselves modified.
  - name: format_output_string
    description: Convert the modified NumPy array into a space-separated string.
