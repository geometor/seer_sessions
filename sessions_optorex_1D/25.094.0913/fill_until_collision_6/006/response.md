## General Assessment and Strategy

The consistent error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples indicates a discrepancy between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string, based on the type hint `input_str: str` and the use of `.strip()`) and the actual type of data passed during the testing phase (a NumPy array).

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept a NumPy array as input, eliminating the need for the `parse_input_string` helper function within `transform`. The core logic for identifying non-zero elements and filling intermediate zeros based on the right neighbor seems conceptually correct based on the initial examples and should be retained, but applied directly to the NumPy array input.

## Metrics and Analysis

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred because the `parse_input_string` function, called at the beginning of `transform`, attempted to execute `input_str.strip('[] ')`. This method is valid for string objects but not for NumPy arrays. Since this error happened for every single train and test example, it confirms that the testing environment provided NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, not strings as the function signature implied.

No further code execution is needed to analyze this specific error, as the cause is clear from the type mismatch. The core transformation logic (identifying non-zeros, iterating segments, filling) was not reached due to this initial error.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers as input.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input array to store the results.
3.  Identify the indices of all non-zero integers in the original input array.
4.  If there are fewer than two non-zero integers, proceed directly to step 8 (no segments to fill).
5.  Iterate through the identified non-zero indices. For each pair of consecutive non-zero indices (let them be `idx_left` and `idx_right`):
    a.  Get the integer value from the *original* input array at `idx_right`. This is the `fill_value`.
    b.  Iterate through all indices `k` such that `idx_left < k < idx_right`.
    c.  If the element at index `k` in the *original* input array is 0, update the element at index `k` in the results *copy* to the `fill_value`.
6.  After iterating through all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, the results copy contains the transformed sequence.
7.  Convert the integers in the modified results copy into strings.
8.  Join these strings with single spaces in between to form the final output string.
9.  Return the final output string.
