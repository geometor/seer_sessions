            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe consistent error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples indicates a discrepancy between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string, based on the type hint `input_str: str` and the use of `.strip()`) and the actual type of data passed during the testing phase (a NumPy array).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept a NumPy array as input, eliminating the need for the `parse_input_string` helper function within `transform`. The core logic for identifying non-zero elements and filling intermediate zeros based on the right neighbor seems conceptually correct based on the initial examples and should be retained, but applied directly to the NumPy array input.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred because the `parse_input_string` function, called at the beginning of `transform`, attempted to execute `input_str.strip('[] ')`. This method is valid for string objects but not for NumPy arrays. Since this error happened for every single train and test example, it confirms that the testing environment provided NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, not strings as the function signature implied.\n\nNo further code execution is needed to analyze this specific error, as the cause is clear from the type mismatch. The core transformation logic (identifying non-zeros, iterating segments, filling) was not reached due to this initial error.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
