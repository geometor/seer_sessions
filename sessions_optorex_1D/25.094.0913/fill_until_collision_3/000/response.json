            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit non-negative integers.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves replacing zero (`0`) values within the sequence. Non-zero values generally remain unchanged in their positions.\n3.  **Context Dependency:** The replacement value for a zero depends on the non-zero numbers surrounding it in the sequence.\n4.  **Two Patterns:** There appear to be two distinct rules for replacing zeros, depending on the input sequence:\n    *   **Pattern A (Forward Fill):** Zeros are replaced by the *last encountered* non-zero number to their left. This pattern seems to apply when the sequence does *not* start with `5`. (See train\\_2, train\\_3, train\\_5, train\\_6).\n    *   **Pattern B (Backward Fill):** Zeros are replaced by the *next upcoming* non-zero number to their right. This pattern seems to apply when the sequence *starts* with `5`. (See train\\_1, train\\_4, train\\_7).\n5.  **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Zeros at the beginning of the sequence (before the first non-zero number) remain zero in both patterns.\n    *   Zeros at the end of the sequence (after the last non-zero number) remain zero in Pattern B (Backward Fill). In Pattern A (Forward Fill), they are filled with the last non-zero number encountered. Let's re-check this.\n        *   train\\_2: `... 3 5` -> `... 3 5` (no trailing zeros)\n        *   train\\_3: `... 6 5` -> `... 6 5` (no trailing zeros)\n        *   train\\_5: `... 2 0 5` -> `... 2 2 5` (zero between 2 and 5 becomes 2)\n        *   train\\_6: `... 3 0 0 5` -> `... 3 3 3 5` (zeros between 3 and 5 become 3)\n        *   It appears my initial \"Forward Fill\" description was slightly off regarding trailing zeros. It fills zeros *between* non-zeros with the preceding non-zero. Let's refine the rules.\n\n**Refined Rule Perception:**\n\n*   **Condition:** Check the value of the *first element* in the input sequence.\n*   **Rule 1 (First Element is 5):** Apply \"Backward Fill\". Iterate through the sequence. Identify contiguous blocks of zeros situated *between* two non-zero numbers. Replace the zeros in such a block with the value of the *right neighbouring* non-zero number. Leading and trailing zeros remain unchanged.\n*   **Rule 2 (First Element is NOT 5):** Apply \"Forward Fill\". Iterate through the sequence. Identify contiguous blocks of zeros situated *between* two non-zero numbers, or *after* the last non-zero number but before the end. Replace the zeros in such a block with the value of the *left neighbouring* non-zero number. Leading zeros (before the first non-zero) remain unchanged.\n\nLet's re-verify Rule 2 (Forward Fill):\n*   train\\_2: `3 [0 0 0 0 0] 6 [0 0 0] 3 5` -> `3 [3 3 3 3 3] 6 [6 6 6] 3 5`. Matches output `3 3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 3 5`.\n*   train\\_3: `0 0 0 0 7 [0 0 0] 6 [0] 6 5` -> `0 0 0 0 7 [7 7 7] 6 [6] 6 5`. Matches output `0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 6 6 6 5`.\n*   train\\_5: `0 0 0 2 [0 0] 6 [0 0] 2 [0] 5` -> `0 0 0 2 [2 2] 6 [6 6] 2 [2] 5`. Matches output `0 0 0 2 2 2 6 6 6 2 2 5`.\n*   train\\_6: `0 1 [0 0 0] 1 9 [0] 3 [0 0] 5` -> `0 1 [1 1 1] 1 9 [9] 3 [3 3] 5`. Matches output `0 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 3 3 3 5`.\n\nOkay, this refined understanding seems consistent. The key difference is how zeros *between* non-zero numbers are filled, conditional on the sequence's starting element.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
