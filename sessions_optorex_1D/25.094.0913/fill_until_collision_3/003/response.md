"""
Transforms an input grid, assumed to contain a single row of integers. 
The transformation involves filling sequences of zeros that are located between non-zero numbers. 
The value used for filling depends on the first element of the row:
- If the first element is 5, zeros are replaced by the value of the nearest non-zero number to their right (Backward Fill).
- Otherwise, zeros are replaced by the value of the nearest non-zero number to their left (Forward Fill).
Zeros before the first non-zero number and zeros after the last non-zero number remain unchanged.
