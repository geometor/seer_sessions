            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed execution on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.` This strongly suggests that the testing environment passes the input not as a standard Python list (as assumed by the code logic like `if not input_grid:`) but as a NumPy array or a similar structure where boolean evaluation of the entire array is disallowed.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (conditional forward/backward fill based on the first element) appears correct when manually traced against the examples. The error is not in the logical concept but in its implementation detail concerning input data type handling.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the code to explicitly handle the input type. The simplest approach is likely to convert the input row (once extracted) into a standard Python list using `list(input_row)` before applying the existing logic. Alternatively, if NumPy is guaranteed, rewrite conditions like `if not input_grid:` to `if input_grid.size == 0:` or similar NumPy-specific checks.\n2.  **Re-verify Logic:** Although the logic seems sound, ensure the implementation details (finding non-zero indices, iterating through pairs, slicing/filling) are correctly translated into code that works with the chosen data structure (list or NumPy array).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince the code failed execution, performance metrics are unavailable. However, re-analyzing the examples confirms the pattern:\n\n*   **Inputs:** All inputs are single sequences (rows) of 12 integers (0-9).\n*   **Outputs:** Corresponding sequences of 12 integers.\n*   **Rule Trigger:** The value of the first element (`input[0]`).\n*   **Cases:**\n    *   `input[0] == 5`: 3 examples (train\\_1, train\\_4, train\\_7) - Use Backward Fill.\n    *   `input[0] != 5`: 4 examples (train\\_2, train\\_3, train\\_5, train\\_6) - Use Forward Fill.\n*   **Zero Handling:**\n    *   Leading zeros (before first non-zero): Always remain 0.\n    *   Trailing zeros (after last non-zero): Always remain 0.\n    *   Zeros *between* non-zero numbers: Filled based on the rule (Backward or Forward).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
