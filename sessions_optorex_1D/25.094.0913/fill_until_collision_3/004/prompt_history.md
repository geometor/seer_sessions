Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit non-negative integers.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves replacing zero (`0`) values within the sequence. Non-zero values generally remain unchanged in their positions.
3.  **Context Dependency:** The replacement value for a zero depends on the non-zero numbers surrounding it in the sequence.
4.  **Two Patterns:** There appear to be two distinct rules for replacing zeros, depending on the input sequence:
    *   **Pattern A (Forward Fill):** Zeros are replaced by the *last encountered* non-zero number to their left. This pattern seems to apply when the sequence does *not* start with `5`. (See train\_2, train\_3, train\_5, train\_6).
    *   **Pattern B (Backward Fill):** Zeros are replaced by the *next upcoming* non-zero number to their right. This pattern seems to apply when the sequence *starts* with `5`. (See train\_1, train\_4, train\_7).
5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Zeros at the beginning of the sequence (before the first non-zero number) remain zero in both patterns.
    *   Zeros at the end of the sequence (after the last non-zero number) remain zero in Pattern B (Backward Fill). In Pattern A (Forward Fill), they are filled with the last non-zero number encountered. Let's re-check this.
        *   train\_2: `... 3 5` -> `... 3 5` (no trailing zeros)
        *   train\_3: `... 6 5` -> `... 6 5` (no trailing zeros)
        *   train\_5: `... 2 0 5` -> `... 2 2 5` (zero between 2 and 5 becomes 2)
        *   train\_6: `... 3 0 0 5` -> `... 3 3 3 5` (zeros between 3 and 5 become 3)
        *   It appears my initial "Forward Fill" description was slightly off regarding trailing zeros. It fills zeros *between* non-zeros with the preceding non-zero. Let's refine the rules.

**Refined Rule Perception:**

*   **Condition:** Check the value of the *first element* in the input sequence.
*   **Rule 1 (First Element is 5):** Apply "Backward Fill". Iterate through the sequence. Identify contiguous blocks of zeros situated *between* two non-zero numbers. Replace the zeros in such a block with the value of the *right neighbouring* non-zero number. Leading and trailing zeros remain unchanged.
*   **Rule 2 (First Element is NOT 5):** Apply "Forward Fill". Iterate through the sequence. Identify contiguous blocks of zeros situated *between* two non-zero numbers, or *after* the last non-zero number but before the end. Replace the zeros in such a block with the value of the *left neighbouring* non-zero number. Leading zeros (before the first non-zero) remain unchanged.

Let's re-verify Rule 2 (Forward Fill):
*   train\_2: `3 [0 0 0 0 0] 6 [0 0 0] 3 5` -> `3 [3 3 3 3 3] 6 [6 6 6] 3 5`. Matches output `3 3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 3 5`.
*   train\_3: `0 0 0 0 7 [0 0 0] 6 [0] 6 5` -> `0 0 0 0 7 [7 7 7] 6 [6] 6 5`. Matches output `0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 6 6 6 5`.
*   train\_5: `0 0 0 2 [0 0] 6 [0 0] 2 [0] 5` -> `0 0 0 2 [2 2] 6 [6 6] 2 [2] 5`. Matches output `0 0 0 2 2 2 6 6 6 2 2 5`.
*   train\_6: `0 1 [0 0 0] 1 9 [0] 3 [0 0] 5` -> `0 1 [1 1 1] 1 9 [9] 3 [3 3] 5`. Matches output `0 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 3 3 3 5`.

Okay, this refined understanding seems consistent. The key difference is how zeros *between* non-zero numbers are filled, conditional on the sequence's starting element.

**YAML Facts:**

  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: list of integers
      - role: input or output

      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: index within the sequence
      - category: zero or non-zero

    properties:
      - relationship: first element
      - relationship: last element
      - relationship: preceding element
      - relationship: succeeding element
      - relationship: between non-zeros
      - relationship: before first non-zero (leading)
      - relationship: after last non-zero (trailing)

  - name: determine_rule
    inputs: first element value
    outputs: fill direction (forward or backward)
    condition: value == 5
  - name: fill_zeros
    inputs: sequence, fill direction
    outputs: modified sequence
    steps:
      - identify non-zero elements and their indices
      - iterate through segments between non-zeros
      - if direction is forward: replace segment zeros with left non-zero value
      - if direction is backward: replace segment zeros with right non-zero value
      - preserve leading zeros
      - preserve trailing zeros (only for backward fill) # Correction: Trailing zeros are handled implicitly by iterating *between* non-zeros. Forward fill also only affects zeros *between* non-zeros based on re-evaluation. Let's simplify.
    refined_steps:
      - create a copy of the input sequence
      - find indices of all non-zero elements
      - iterate through pairs of consecutive non-zero indices (idx_left, idx_right)
      - if rule is Forward Fill: fill sequence[idx_left + 1 : idx_right] with sequence[idx_left]
      - if rule is Backward Fill: fill sequence[idx_left + 1 : idx_right] with sequence[idx_right]
transformation_rule:
  - condition: The first element of the input sequence determines the fill rule.
  - rule_1: If the first element is 5, use Backward Fill (zeros between non-zeros take the value of the right non-zero neighbor).
  - rule_2: If the first element is not 5, use Forward Fill (zeros between non-zeros take the value of the left non-zero neighbor).
  - unchanged: Zeros before the first non-zero element and after the last non-zero element remain zero. # Re-checking trailing zeros on forward fill. Train_5: `...2 0 5` -> `...2 2 5`. Zeros *between* non-zeros. It seems trailing zeros are never filled in either case.
  - final_unchanged: Zeros before the first non-zero element and zeros after the last non-zero element always remain zero.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the first number in the input sequence.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the output sequence.
3.  Find the indices of all non-zero numbers in the sequence. Store these indices in a list, say `non_zero_indices`.
4.  If the list `non_zero_indices` is empty or contains only one index, return the original sequence copy as no filling between non-zeros is possible.
5.  **If the first number of the *original* input sequence is 5 (Backward Fill Rule):**
    *   Iterate through the `non_zero_indices` list from the first index up to the second-to-last index. Let the current index be `i`.
    *   Get the index of the current non-zero number: `idx_left = non_zero_indices[i]`.
    *   Get the index of the *next* non-zero number: `idx_right = non_zero_indices[i+1]`.
    *   Get

"""
Transforms an input sequence (list) of integers based on the following rules:
1. Examine the first number in the input sequence.
2. Create a copy of the input sequence.
3. Find the indices of all non-zero numbers.
4. If there are fewer than two non-zero numbers, return the copy (no filling possible between non-zeros).
5. Determine the fill rule:
    - If the first number of the original input sequence is 5, use "Backward Fill".
    - Otherwise, use "Forward Fill".
6. Iterate through consecutive pairs of non-zero indices found in step 3 (let them be idx_left and idx_right).
7. For each pair, fill the elements in the copied sequence *between* these indices (from idx_left + 1 up to idx_right - 1).
    - If using Backward Fill, fill with the value of the element at idx_right in the original sequence.
    - If using Forward Fill, fill with the value of the element at idx_left in the original sequence.
8. Zeros before the first non-zero number and zeros after the last non-zero number remain unchanged by this process.
9. Return the modified sequence.
