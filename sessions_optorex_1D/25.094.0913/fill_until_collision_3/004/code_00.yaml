elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: list or array of integers (0-9)
      - role: input or output
      - length: 12 (observed in all examples)
  - type: number
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: index within the sequence
      - category: zero or non-zero
      - role: first element (determines rule)
      - role: neighbor (used for filling)
relations:
  - type: positional
    properties:
      - relationship: first element
      - relationship: preceding element
      - relationship: succeeding element
      - relationship: between non-zeros
      - relationship: before first non-zero (leading)
      - relationship: after last non-zero (trailing)
  - type: conditional
    properties:
      - based_on: value of the first element
      - determines: fill direction (forward or backward)
actions:
  - name: determine_rule
    inputs: first element value
    outputs: fill direction ('forward' or 'backward')
    condition: value == 5 -> 'backward', otherwise -> 'forward'
  - name: identify_non_zero_indices
    inputs: sequence
    outputs: list of indices where element is not 0
  - name: fill_zeros_between_non_zeros
    inputs: sequence, non_zero_indices, fill_direction
    outputs: modified sequence
    steps:
      - create a copy of the input sequence
      - iterate through consecutive pairs of non_zero_indices (idx_left, idx_right)
      - for elements between idx_left + 1 and idx_right - 1:
        - if direction is 'forward': replace with sequence[idx_left]
        - if direction is 'backward': replace with sequence[idx_right]
      - preserve elements outside these ranges (leading/trailing zeros, non-zeros)
transformation_rule:
  - Reads the input sequence of integers.
  - Determines the fill direction based on the first element: 'backward' if it's 5, 'forward' otherwise.
  - Identifies the indices of all non-zero elements.
  - If there are fewer than two non-zero elements, returns the original sequence.
  - Creates a copy of the sequence for modification.
  - Iterates through consecutive pairs of non-zero indices (idx_left, idx_right).
  - For each segment of the sequence strictly between idx_left and idx_right:
    - If the fill direction is 'forward', replaces all elements in the segment with the value at idx_left in the original sequence.
    - If the fill direction is 'backward', replaces all elements in the segment with the value at idx_right in the original sequence.
  - Returns the modified sequence.
  - Note: Elements before the first non-zero index and after the last non-zero index remain unchanged.
