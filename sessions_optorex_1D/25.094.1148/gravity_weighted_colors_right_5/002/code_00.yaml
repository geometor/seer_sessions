task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence # Likely implemented as numpy.ndarray based on error
      - element_type: integer
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: 12
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence # Likely expected as numpy.ndarray or compatible list
      - element_type: integer
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: 12
action:
  - name: sort
    parameters:
      - order: descending
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by sorting the elements of the input_sequence in descending order. The element counts remain unchanged.
