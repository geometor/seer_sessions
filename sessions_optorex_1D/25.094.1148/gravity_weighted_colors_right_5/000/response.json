The integers in the sequence are limited to the values 0, 1, and 2. Comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples reveals that the output sequence consistently contains the same counts of each integer (0, 1, 2) as the input sequence, but arranged in a specific order. The output sequence always appears sorted in descending order, with all the 2s appearing first, followed by all the 1s, and finally all the 0s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
