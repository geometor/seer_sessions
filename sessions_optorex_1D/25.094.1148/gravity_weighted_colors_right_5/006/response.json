            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided results clearly indicate that the previous transformation function, which sorted the input sequence in *ascending* order, does not produce the expected output. The `Transformed Output` consistently shows the elements sorted from 0 to 2, while the `Expected Output` shows the elements sorted from 2 to 0 (descending order). The `Pixels Off` metric reflects the number of elements misplaced due to the incorrect sorting direction, and the `Match: False` confirms the mismatch for all examples. The strategy to resolve this is to modify the transformation rule to implement a *descending* sort instead of an ascending sort.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input/output pairs and the provided results:\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All inputs and outputs are sequences of 12 integers.\n2.  **Element Values:** The integers in the sequences are exclusively 0, 1, or 2.\n3.  **Element Conservation:** For every example, the count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) is identical in both the input sequence and the expected output sequence. This was confirmed computationally for examples 1 and 4 and visually for others, and is further supported by the `Color Count Correct: True` metric in the test results.\n4.  **Sorting Order:** The expected output sequences are consistently sorted in descending order (2s first, then 1s, then 0s). The previous code's output was sorted in ascending order.\n5.  **Error Pattern:** The errors (`Pixels Off`) directly correspond to the difference between an ascending sort and a descending sort of the input sequence elements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
