  - name: input_sequence
    # Description updated based on error: likely a numerical array/list in execution
    type: Sequence[int] # Type generalized, likely List[int] or np.ndarray
    description: A sequence of 12 integers, containing only values 0, 1, or 2.
    properties:
      length: 12
      elements: [0, 1, 2]
  - name: output_sequence
    # Description updated based on error: likely a numerical array/list in execution
    type: Sequence[int] # Type generalized, likely List[int] or np.ndarray
    description: A sequence of 12 integers derived from the input sequence.
    properties:
      length: 12
      elements: [0, 1, 2]
      relationship_to_input: Contains the same multiset of elements as the input sequence.

transformation:
  action: sort
  input: input_sequence
  output: output_sequence
  rule: The elements of the input sequence are rearranged to produce the output sequence.
  details: The rearrangement follows a descending order sort rule (largest values appear first, smallest values appear last).
