Each sequence appears to have a fixed length of 12 elements. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the output sequence contains the same integers as the input sequence, but they are arranged in a different order. Specifically, the output sequence seems to be sorted in descending order (from largest to smallest value).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
