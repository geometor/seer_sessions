task_elements:
  - object: input_array
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray
      - dtype: integer
      - content: sequence of digits (0, 1, or 2)
      - shape: 1-dimensional array of fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples)
  - object: output_array
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray
      - dtype: integer
      - content: sequence of digits (0, 1, or 2)
      - shape: 1-dimensional array with the same length as input_array
      - order: elements sorted in descending order (2 > 1 > 0)
  - relationship: input_to_output
    action: sort
    description: The elements (digits) present in the input_array are rearranged to form the output_array.
    constraint: The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input and output arrays.
    rule: The output_array is generated by sorting the elements of the input_array in descending order.
    implementation_note: Use numpy.sort() and reverse the result for descending order.
