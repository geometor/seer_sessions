task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string (space-separated) or 1D array
      - content: sequence of digits (integers 0, 1, or 2)
      - length: variable, but consistent within a single input-output pair (e.g., 12 in examples)
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string (space-separated) or 1D array
      - content: sequence of digits (integers 0, 1, or 2)
      - length: identical to the corresponding input_sequence length
      - order: digits are sorted in descending order (2s first, then 1s, then 0s)
  - relationship: input_to_output_transformation
    action: sort_descending
    description: The output_sequence is created by rearranging the digits from the input_sequence.
    constraints:
      - The multiset of digits in the output must be identical to the multiset of digits in the input (i.e., counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s are preserved).
    rule: Arrange all digits from the input_sequence in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
