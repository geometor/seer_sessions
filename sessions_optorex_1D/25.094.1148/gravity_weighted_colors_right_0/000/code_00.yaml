task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated digits (0, 1, or 2)
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated digits (0, 1, or 2)
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - order: digits sorted in descending order (2 > 1 > 0)
  - relationship: input_to_output
    action: sort
    description: The digits present in the input_sequence are rearranged to form the output_sequence.
    constraint: The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input and output.
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by sorting the digits from the input_sequence in descending order.
