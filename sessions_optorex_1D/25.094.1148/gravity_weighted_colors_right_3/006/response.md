**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results indicate a consistent discrepancy between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` for all examples. While the `Transformed Output` maintains properties like size, color palette, and color count, it fails to match the expected sequence of elements.

Specifically, the `Transformed Output` appears to be sorted in *ascending* order (0s first, then 1s, then 2s), whereas the `Expected Output` is consistently sorted in *descending* order (2s first, then 1s, then 0s).

The code snippet provided *before* the results (`code_00.py`) includes logic (`np.sort(input_array)[::-1]`) that *should* perform a descending sort. This suggests either:
1.  The code snippet shown was not the exact code executed.
2.  There was an issue in the testing harness converting between string representations and NumPy arrays, or in reporting the results, leading to the output appearing ascendingly sorted.

Regardless of the cause of the mismatch in the previous step, the analysis based on the *expected outputs* remains consistent: the task requires sorting the input elements in descending order.

**Strategy:**
The core logic identified initially (sorting in descending order) seems correct based on the `input` -> `Expected Output` relationship. The natural language program should be reaffirmed, and the implementation needs to correctly reflect this descending sort logic. The previous implementation attempt seemingly failed to achieve this, according to the results.

    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
    expected_list = [int(x) for x in expected_str.split()]
    transformed_list = [int(x) for x in transformed_str.split()]

    input_counts = Counter(input_list)
    expected_counts = Counter(expected_list)
    transformed_counts = Counter(transformed_list)

**Metrics Summary:**

*   **Length Preservation:** Input, Expected Output, and Transformed Output lengths are consistently the same (12) for all examples.
*   **Count Preservation:** The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) in the input are preserved in both the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output`.
*   **Expected Output Rule:** The `Expected Output` is consistently confirmed to be the input list sorted in *descending* order (2 > 1 > 0).
*   **Transformed Output Rule:** The `Transformed Output` (as reported in the previous execution results) is consistently confirmed to be the input list sorted in *ascending* order (0 < 1 < 2).
*   **Match Failure:** The `Transformed Output` consistently fails to match the `Expected Output` because the sorting order is inverted.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input list of integers (containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s).
2.  Sort the elements of the input list in descending numerical order (such that all 2s appear first, followed by all 1s, followed by all 0s).
3.  Return the resulting sorted list as the output.
