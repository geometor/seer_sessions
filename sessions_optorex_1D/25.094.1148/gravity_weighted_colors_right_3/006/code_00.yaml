objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - contains integers (0, 1, 2)
      - fixed length (12 in examples)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - contains integers (0, 1, 2)
      - fixed length (12 in examples)
      - derived from input_sequence
      - contains the same elements as input_sequence, but rearranged
      - sorted in descending numerical order (2s first, then 1s, then 0s)

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    applies_to: input_sequence
    results_in: output_sequence
    description: The elements of the input_sequence are sorted to produce the output_sequence.
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) is the same in both the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
  - type: ordering
    applies_to: output_sequence
    description: Elements in the output_sequence are sorted in descending order (2 > 1 > 0).

actions:
  - name: sort_descending
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    description: Rearranges the elements of the input sequence into descending numerical order.
