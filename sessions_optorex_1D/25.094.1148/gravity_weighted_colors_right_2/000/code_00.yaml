Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: String
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces.
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits.
        - Elements: Digits 0, 1, 2.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: String
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces.
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits.
        - Elements: Digits 0, 1, 2.
        - Order: Digits are sorted in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s).
  - Digit:
      Type: Integer
      PossibleValues: [0, 1, 2]

Relationships:
  - The OutputSequence contains the same digits as the InputSequence.
  - The count of each type of digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - The OutputSequence is a reordering (specifically, a descending sort) of the digits present in the InputSequence.

Actions:
  - Parse: Extract individual digits from the InputSequence string.
  - Sort: Arrange the extracted digits in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
  - Format: Join the sorted digits back into a space-separated string to form the OutputSequence.
