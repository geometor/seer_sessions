Objects:
  - InputString:
      Type: String
      Content: String representation of a list of digits, enclosed in brackets '[]' and space-separated.
      Example: "'[2 2 0 1 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0]'"
      Properties:
        - Contains 12 digits.
        - Digits are 0, 1, or 2.
  - IntermediateDigitList:
      Type: List[Integer]
      Content: A list of 12 integers derived from parsing InputString.
      Properties:
        - Length: 12
        - Elements: Integers 0, 1, 2.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: String
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces.
      Properties:
        - Length: 12 digits (plus 11 spaces).
        - Elements: Digits 0, 1, 2.
        - Order: Digits are sorted in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s).
  - Digit:
      Type: Integer
      PossibleValues: [0, 1, 2]

Relationships:
  - The IntermediateDigitList is derived by parsing the InputString.
  - The OutputSequence contains the same digits as the IntermediateDigitList (and thus the InputString).
  - The count of each type of digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between InputString and OutputSequence.
  - The OutputSequence is generated by sorting the IntermediateDigitList in descending order and formatting the result as a space-separated string.

Actions:
  - ParseInputString:
      - Remove leading '[' and trailing ']' from InputString.
      - Split the remaining string by spaces.
      - Convert each part to an integer.
      - Result: IntermediateDigitList.
  - SortDigits: Arrange the digits in IntermediateDigitList in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
  - FormatOutputString:
      - Convert each digit in the sorted list back to a string.
      - Join the string digits with a single space separator.
      - Result: OutputSequence.
