**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed during execution because it assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch.

The core transformation logic, which involves sorting the digits in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s), appears correct based on visual inspection of all input/output pairs. The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) are consistently preserved between the input and the output in all examples.

The strategy to resolve the error is straightforward:
1.  Modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, as NumPy arrays behave similarly to lists in many contexts like iteration and sorting) as input instead of a string.
2.  Remove the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
3.  Adapt the sorting and output formatting steps to work directly with the list/array of integers. The output format is still expected to be a space-separated string.

**Metrics**

Based on visual inspection and counting:

| Example | Input                                   | Output                                  | Count(2) | Count(1) | Count(0) | Sorted Descending |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| train_1 | `[2 2 0 1 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0]`             | `[2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 6        | 1        | 5        | Yes               |
| train_2 | `[2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 2]`             | `[2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 6        | 1        | 5        | Yes               |
| train_3 | `[0 0 0 2 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 2]`             | `[2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 4        | 1        | 7        | Yes               |
| train_4 | `[2 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 0]`             | `[2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`             | 4        | 4        | 4        | Yes               |
| train_5 | `[0 1 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0]`             | `[2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 4        | 2        | 6        | Yes               |
| train_6 | `[0 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 2 2 2 0]`             | `[2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 4        | 3        | 5        | Yes               |
| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2]`             | `[2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`             | 3        | 0        | 9        | Yes               |

The analysis confirms that the transformation rule is consistently a descending sort of the input digits, and the digit counts are preserved. The error is solely related to input data type handling.

**Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List[Integer] or numpy.ndarray  # Updated type
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2).
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits.
        - Elements: Integers 0, 1, 2.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: String # Output remains a space-separated string
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces.
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits represented.
        - Elements: Digits 0, 1, 2.
        - Order: Digits are sorted in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s).
  - Digit:
      Type: Integer
      PossibleValues: [0, 1, 2]

Relationships:
  - The OutputSequence represents the same digits as the InputSequence.
  - The count of each type of digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - The OutputSequence is a string representation of the digits from the InputSequence sorted in descending order.

Actions:
  - Receive: Get the input sequence (List or NumPy array of integers).
  - Sort: Arrange the digits in the input sequence in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
  - Format: Convert the sorted sequence of integers into a space-separated string.
  - Output: Return the formatted string.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers, where each integer is 0, 1, or 2.
2.  Create a new list containing the integers from the input sequence.
3.  Sort this new list of integers in descending order (so all 2s appear first, followed by all 1s, then all 0s).
4.  Convert each integer in the sorted list back into its string representation.
5.  Join these string representations together into a single string, with a space character separating adjacent digit strings.
6.  Output the resulting space-separated string.
