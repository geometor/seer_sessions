Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List or Array of Integers # Updated type based on error analysis
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2).
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits.
        - Elements: Integers 0, 1, 2.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: String # The final required output format IS a string
      Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces.
      Properties:
        - Length: Always 12 digits.
        - Elements: Digits 0, 1, 2.
        - Order: Digits are sorted in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s).
  - Digit:
      Type: Integer
      PossibleValues: [0, 1, 2]

Relationships:
  - The OutputSequence represents the sorted version of the InputSequence.
  - The count of each type of digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between InputSequence and the digits represented in OutputSequence.

Actions:
  - Receive: Accept the InputSequence (as a list or array of integers).
  - Sort: Arrange the digits in the InputSequence in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
  - ConvertToString: Convert each sorted integer digit to its string representation.
  - Format: Join the string representations of the sorted digits into a single string, separating each digit with a space.
  - Return: Output the formatted string.
