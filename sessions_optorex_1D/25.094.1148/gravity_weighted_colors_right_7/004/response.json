            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as sorting the input sequence of digits. The comparison between the input and expected output sequences clearly shows that the output is simply the input sequence sorted in descending numerical order (2s, then 1s, then 0s). The counts of each digit are preserved.\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement this descending sort using `numpy`. However, the execution results show that the `Transformed Output` was consistently sorted in *ascending* order, directly contradicting the `Expected Output`. This discrepancy led to mismatches (`Match: False`) and high `Pixels Off` counts for all examples.\n\nThe error lies purely in the implementation of the sorting logic within the previous `transform` function, not in the understanding of the task's goal. The code `output_array = np.sort(input_array)[::-1]` should technically produce a descending sort, but the logs indicate it produced an ascending sort. This might be due to an environment issue or a misunderstanding of `numpy`'s behavior in that specific context. The strategy is to re-implement the descending sort robustly.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe analysis using `tool_code` confirms the following for all provided examples (train and test):\n\n*   **Length Preservation:** Input and output sequences consistently have the same length (12 in these examples).\n*   **Element Preservation:** The multiset of digits (counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s) is identical between the input and the expected output (`counts_match_expected: true`).\n*   **Expected Output Sorting:** The expected output sequence is always sorted in descending order (`is_expected_sorted_desc: true`).\n*   **Previous Code Output Sorting:** The transformed output from the previous code run was always sorted in ascending order (`is_transformed_sorted_asc: true`), confirming the implementation error.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
