objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - contains: digits (0, 1, 2)
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - contains: digits (0, 1, 2)
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - order: descending numerical value (2s, then 1s, then 0s)
actions:
  - name: sort_digits
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    description: Arranges the digits from the input sequence into descending order.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    via: sort_digits
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
