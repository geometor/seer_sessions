(Verified for train_1 via `tool_code`).\n    *   **Input Data Type (`dtype`):** Likely integers (verified as `int64` for train_1 via `tool_code`).\n    *   **Output Type:** Expected to be a string based on the provided output examples.\n    *   **Transformation Rule:** Sorting in descending order. Verified for `train_1` by comparing element counts in the input array and the output string using `tool_code`, showing conservation of elements {0: 5, 1: 4, 2: 3}. This pattern holds for other examples upon visual inspection.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
