*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples confirms that the input data provided to the `transform` function is consistently a NumPy array, not a string as initially assumed based on the problem description's format.
    *   The previous code failed because it attempted string manipulation methods (`strip`, `split`) on a NumPy array object.
    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (sorting digits 0, 1, 2 in descending order) appears consistent with the input/output pairs, even though the input type was misinterpreted.
    *   The strategy is to modify the transformation steps to directly handle a NumPy array as input: sort the array elements and then format the sorted elements into the required output string format.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    *   **Input Type:** Confirmed via error messages and `tool_code` execution to be `numpy.ndarray`.
    *   **Input Shape:** Consistently `(12,)` based on the problem description and error consistency. (Verified for train_1 via `tool_code`).
    *   **Input Data Type (`dtype`):** Likely integers (verified as `int64` for train_1 via `tool_code`).
    *   **Output Type:** Expected to be a string based on the provided output examples.
    *   **Transformation Rule:** Sorting in descending order. Verified for `train_1` by comparing element counts in the input array and the output string using `tool_code`, showing conservation of elements {0: 5, 1: 4, 2: 3}. This pattern holds for other examples upon visual inspection.

*   **YAML Fact Document:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: input_array
        properties:
          - type: numpy.ndarray
          - dtype: integer (observed: int64)
          - shape: 1D array (observed length: 12)
          - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - object: output_sequence
        properties:
          - type: string
          - format: space-separated integers
          - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
          - length: same as input_array length (12)
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        action: sorting_and_formatting
        input: input_array
        output: output_sequence
        details: The integer elements from the input_array are sorted in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0), converted to strings, and joined with spaces to produce the output_sequence.
      - type: constraint
        property: element_conservation
        description: The multiset of integers in the input_array is identical to the multiset of integers represented in the output_sequence.
      - type: constraint
        property: length_conservation
        description: The number of elements in the output_sequence (when split by space) is equal to the number of elements in the input_array.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the 1D NumPy array of integers as input.
    2.  Sort the elements of the NumPy array in descending numerical order (2 > 1 > 0).
    3.  Convert each integer in the sorted array to its string representation.
    4.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces.
    5.  Output the resulting space-separated string.
