**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected a space-separated string as input (`input_string: str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array.

The strategy for resolving this is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input. The core transformation logic identified (circular left shift by 8 positions) appears consistent across the string representations in the problem description and should be applied directly to the input array. The output format needs to be confirmed, but based on the examples, it seems to be a space-separated string, meaning the transformed array needs to be converted back to this format.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** Confirmed as `numpy.ndarray` for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example where execution was attempted.
*   **Input Shape:** Assuming a 1-dimensional array based on the original string format (e.g., `(12,)`).
*   **Execution Status:** All examples failed at the input processing stage (`input_string.split()`).
*   **Core Logic Test:** The circular shift logic itself was not reached or tested due to the input type mismatch.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - Type: Sequence of integers
  - Representation: NumPy array (initially presented as space-separated strings)
  - Elements: Integers (0-9)
  - Length: 12 (constant)

Transformation:
  - Name: Circular Shift
  - Direction: Left
  - Amount: 8 positions
  - Invariance:
    - Element values are preserved.
    - Element counts are preserved.
    - Sequence length is preserved.

Input_Object:
  - Type: NumPy array
  - Name: input_array
  - Properties:
    - dtype: integer (implicitly)
    - shape: (12,)
    - items: digits

Output_Object:
  - Type: String
  - Name: output_string
  - Properties:
    - Format: Space-separated digits
  - Derivation: Result of applying the circular shift to the input_array and formatting the result.

Relationship:
  - Type: Positional Mapping
  - Rule: Element at index `i` in the input_array moves to index `(i - 8) mod 12` in the transformed array.
  - Alternative Rule: The first 8 elements of the input array are moved to the end of the array, and the last 4 elements are moved to the beginning.
  - Final Step: The transformed array is converted to a space-separated string.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input NumPy array containing 12 integer digits.
2.  Perform a circular left shift on the array by 8 positions. This can be achieved by concatenating the slice from index 8 to the end with the slice from the beginning up to index 8.
3.  Convert the elements of the resulting NumPy array into strings.
4.  Join these string elements with a single space separator to create the final output string.
5.  Return the formatted string.
