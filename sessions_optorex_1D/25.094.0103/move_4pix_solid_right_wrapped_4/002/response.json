            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected a space-separated string as input (`input_string: str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input. The core transformation logic identified (circular left shift by 8 positions) appears consistent across the string representations in the problem description and should be applied directly to the input array. The output format needs to be confirmed, but based on the examples, it seems to be a space-separated string, meaning the transformed array needs to be converted back to this format.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Confirmed as `numpy.ndarray` for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example where execution was attempted.\n*   **Input Shape:** Assuming a 1-dimensional array based on the original string format (e.g., `(12,)`).\n*   **Execution Status:** All examples failed at the input processing stage (`input_string.split()`).\n*   **Core Logic Test:** The circular shift logic itself was not reached or tested due to the input type mismatch.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
