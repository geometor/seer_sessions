Data:
  - Type: Sequence of integers
  - Representation: NumPy array (initially presented as space-separated strings)
  - Elements: Integers (0-9)
  - Length: 12 (constant)

Transformation:
  - Name: Circular Shift
  - Direction: Left
  - Amount: 8 positions
  - Invariance:
    - Element values are preserved.
    - Element counts are preserved.
    - Sequence length is preserved.

Input_Object:
  - Type: NumPy array
  - Name: input_array
  - Properties:
    - dtype: integer (implicitly)
    - shape: (12,)
    - items: digits

Output_Object:
  - Type: String
  - Name: output_string
  - Properties:
    - Format: Space-separated digits
  - Derivation: Result of applying the circular shift to the input_array and formatting the result.

Relationship:
  - Type: Positional Mapping
  - Rule: Element at index `i` in the input_array moves to index `(i - 8) mod 12` in the transformed array.
  - Alternative Rule: The first 8 elements of the input array are moved to the end of the array, and the last 4 elements are moved to the beginning.
  - Final Step: The transformed array is converted to a space-separated string.
