Data:
  - Type: Sequence
  - Format: Space-separated digits
  - Elements: Digits (0-9)
  - Length: 12 (constant)

Transformation:
  - Name: Circular Shift
  - Direction: Left
  - Amount: 8 positions
  - Invariance:
    - Element values are preserved.
    - Element counts are preserved.
    - Sequence length is preserved.

Input_Object:
  - Type: Sequence
  - Name: input_sequence
  - Properties:
    - length: 12
    - items: digits

Output_Object:
  - Type: Sequence
  - Name: output_sequence
  - Properties:
    - length: 12
    - items: digits
  - Derivation: Result of applying the circular shift to the input_sequence.

Relationship:
  - Type: Positional Mapping
  - Rule: Element at index `i` in the input_sequence moves to index `(i - 8) mod 12` in the output_sequence.
  - Alternative Rule: The first 8 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, and the last 4 elements are moved to the beginning.
