            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of digits, presented as space-separated strings.\n*   **Sequence Length:** In all examples, the input and output sequences contain exactly 12 digits.\n*   **Content:** The sequences contain digits from 0 to 9. The specific non-zero digit varies between examples (6, 7, 8, 1, 9, 4, 3), but the digit '0' appears frequently.\n*   **Conservation:** The number of occurrences of each digit is preserved between the input and output. For instance, in `train_1`, there are seven '6's and five '0's in both the input and the output. This suggests the transformation rearranges the existing elements rather than adding, removing, or changing them.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing the input and output sequences, the elements appear to be shifted or rotated. Let's examine `train_1`:\n    *   Input: `6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6`\n    *   Output: `0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0`\n    The elements `[0, 0, 6, 6]` from indices 8, 9, 10, 11 of the input appear at the beginning (indices 0, 1, 2, 3) of the output. The elements `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]` from indices 0-7 of the input appear at the end (indices 4-11) of the output. This pattern corresponds to a circular left shift.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Testing this hypothesis across other examples confirms a consistent circular left shift. The magnitude of the shift seems constant. In `train_1`, the first element '6' moves from index 0 to index 4 (if we consider the block starting `[0,0,6,6,...]`). No, let's track the element at index 8 ('0'). It moves to index 0. This is a shift of -8 positions (or +4 positions right). Let's track the element at index 0 ('6'). It moves to index 4. Shift is +4. Let's re-evaluate: moving the last 4 elements (`[0, 0, 6, 6]`) to the front is equivalent to a circular *right* shift by 4 positions, *or* a circular *left* shift by 12 - 4 = 8 positions.\n    *   Let's test circular left shift by 8:\n        *   `train_1`: `[6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 | 0 0 6 6]` -> `[0 0 6 6 | 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0]` Matches.\n        *   `train_2`: `[7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 | 0 7 7 7]` -> `[0 7 7 7 | 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0]` Matches.\n        *   `train_3`: `[8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 | 8 8 8 8]` -> `[8 8 8 8 | 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8]` Matches.\n        *   `train_5`: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 9 0 0]` -> `[0 9 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` Matches.\n    *   The transformation is consistently a circular left shift by 8 positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
