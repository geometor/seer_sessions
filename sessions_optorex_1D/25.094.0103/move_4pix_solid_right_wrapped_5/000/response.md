Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are consistently lists of 12 integers.
*   The integers appear to be single digits (0-9).
*   The transformation rearranges the elements within the list; no new elements are introduced, and no elements are removed or changed in value.
*   Comparing the input and output lists across all examples reveals a consistent positional shift of elements.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: list_transformation
input_list:
  description: A list of 12 single-digit integers.
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - element_type: integer
    - element_range: 0-9 (observed)
output_list:
  description: A list derived from the input list by rearranging elements.
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - element_type: integer
    - elements: Same multiset of elements as the input list.
transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  action: cyclic_shift
  details:
    - direction: right
    - amount: 4 positions
  relationship: Output list is the input list rotated 4 positions to the right. The last 4 elements of the input become the first 4 elements of the output, followed by the first 8 elements of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input list of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a cyclic right shift (rotation) on the list by 4 positions.
3.  The resulting list is the output.
