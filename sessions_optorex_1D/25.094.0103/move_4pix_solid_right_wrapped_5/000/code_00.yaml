input_list:
  description: A list of 12 single-digit integers.
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - element_type: integer
    - element_range: 0-9 (observed)
output_list:
  description: A list derived from the input list by rearranging elements.
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - element_type: integer
    - elements: Same multiset of elements as the input list.
transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  action: cyclic_shift
  details:
    - direction: right
    - amount: 4 positions
  relationship: Output list is the input list rotated 4 positions to the right. The last 4 elements of the input become the first 4 elements of the output, followed by the first 8 elements of the input.
