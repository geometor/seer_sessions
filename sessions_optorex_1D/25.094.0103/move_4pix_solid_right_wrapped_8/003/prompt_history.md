**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. The input sequence contains digits like 0, 2, 3, and 7. The output sequence contains the exact same digits with the same frequencies as the input, but their positions are altered. The transformation appears to be a consistent rearrangement or shift applied to the entire sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across examples reveals a pattern of circular shifting. Specifically, elements seem to move 4 positions to the right, wrapping around the end of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - contains_digits: [0, 2, 3, 7] # Based on observed examples
output_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - contains_same_elements_as_input: True
transformation:
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 4
  relationship:
    - The output list is the input list rotated 4 positions to the right.
    - The element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i + 4) % 12` in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a right circular shift (rotation) on the sequence by 4 positions.
3.  The element originally at the first position moves to the fifth position.
4.  The element originally at the second position moves to the sixth position.
5.  ...
6.  The element originally at the ninth position moves to the first position (wraps around).
7.  The element originally at the tenth position moves to the second position.
8.  The element originally at the eleventh position moves to the third position.
9.  The element originally at the twelfth position moves to the fourth position.
10. The resulting sequence is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as a right circular shift by 4 positions. However, it failed to account for the input data format. The error messages ("index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1") strongly indicated that the input provided to the `transform` function was not a list/sequence of 12 integers as assumed, but rather a single entity (likely a string or a list containing one string). The execution results confirm this hypothesis.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the process to first parse the input string into a list of integers, then apply the previously determined circular shift logic to this list, and finally format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.

**Metrics:**

Based on the `tool_code` execution and analysis:

*   **Input Structure:** All training inputs are confirmed to be strings.
*   **Input Content:** Each string contains 12 space-separated characters representing integers (0, 2, 3, 7 observed).
*   **Parsing:** Splitting the input string by spaces and converting to integers successfully yields a list of 12 integers for each example.
*   **Transformation Verification:** Applying a right circular shift of 4 positions to the parsed integer list correctly reproduces the expected output sequence for the verified examples (1, 3, 5). This strongly suggests the shift logic is correct.
*   **Output Structure:** The expected output is also a space-separated string of integers.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which is a single string containing twelve integers separated by spaces.
2.  Create a list of integers by splitting the input string at each space and converting the resulting parts into integer values.
3.  Initialize a new list of the same size (12) to store the output integers, initially filled with placeholders (like 0).
4.  Iterate through the created list of integers from index 0 to 11. For each integer at the current index `i`:
    a. Calculate the target index `new_index` by adding 4 to `i` and taking the result modulo 12 (i.e., `new_index = (i + 4) % 12`). This handles the wrap-around for the circular shift.
    b. Place the integer from the input list at index `i` into the output list at the calculated `new_index`.
5.  Convert the integers in the resulting output list back into strings.
6.  Join these strings together into a single string, using a single space as the separator between them.
7.  Return this final string.
