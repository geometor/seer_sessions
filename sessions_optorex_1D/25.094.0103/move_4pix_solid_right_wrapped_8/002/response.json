            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as a right circular shift by 4 positions. However, it failed to account for the input data format. The error messages (\"index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1\") strongly indicated that the input provided to the `transform` function was not a list/sequence of 12 integers as assumed, but rather a single entity (likely a string or a list containing one string). The execution results confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the process to first parse the input string into a list of integers, then apply the previously determined circular shift logic to this list, and finally format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution and analysis:\n\n*   **Input Structure:** All training inputs are confirmed to be strings.\n*   **Input Content:** Each string contains 12 space-separated characters representing integers (0, 2, 3, 7 observed).\n*   **Parsing:** Splitting the input string by spaces and converting to integers successfully yields a list of 12 integers for each example.\n*   **Transformation Verification:** Applying a right circular shift of 4 positions to the parsed integer list correctly reproduces the expected output sequence for the verified examples (1, 3, 5). This strongly suggests the shift logic is correct.\n*   **Output Structure:** The expected output is also a space-separated string of integers.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
