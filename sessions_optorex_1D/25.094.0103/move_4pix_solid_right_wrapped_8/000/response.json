The output sequence contains the exact same digits with the same frequencies as the input, but their positions are altered. The transformation appears to be a consistent rearrangement or shift applied to the entire sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across examples reveals a pattern of circular shifting. Specifically, elements seem to move 4 positions to the right, wrapping around the end of the sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
