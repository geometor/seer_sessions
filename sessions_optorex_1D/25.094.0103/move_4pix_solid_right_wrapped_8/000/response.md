**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. The input sequence contains digits like 0, 2, 3, and 7. The output sequence contains the exact same digits with the same frequencies as the input, but their positions are altered. The transformation appears to be a consistent rearrangement or shift applied to the entire sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across examples reveals a pattern of circular shifting. Specifically, elements seem to move 4 positions to the right, wrapping around the end of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - contains_digits: [0, 2, 3, 7] # Based on observed examples
output_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - contains_same_elements_as_input: True
transformation:
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 4
  relationship:
    - The output list is the input list rotated 4 positions to the right.
    - The element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i + 4) % 12` in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a right circular shift (rotation) on the sequence by 4 positions.
3.  The element originally at the first position moves to the fifth position.
4.  The element originally at the second position moves to the sixth position.
5.  ...
6.  The element originally at the ninth position moves to the first position (wraps around).
7.  The element originally at the tenth position moves to the second position.
8.  The element originally at the eleventh position moves to the third position.
9.  The element originally at the twelfth position moves to the fourth position.
10. The resulting sequence is the output.
