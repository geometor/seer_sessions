Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and determine the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers presented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all examples, both the input and output sequences have a fixed length of 12 elements.
3.  **Content:** The sequences contain integers, predominantly zeros, with some non-zero integers appearing singly or in contiguous blocks. The non-zero values themselves are preserved from input to output.
4.  **Transformation:** The positions of the non-zero elements change between the input and output. The relative order of the non-zero elements appears to be maintained, but their absolute positions shift. Observing multiple examples (e.g., train_1, train_4, train_6) suggests a consistent shift to the right. Crucially, examples like train_5 and train_7 show that elements shifted off the right end reappear at the left end, indicating a circular or wrap-around behavior. Comparing the index change across several examples (index 0 -> 4, index 9 -> 1, index 7 -> 11, index 1 -> 5) reveals a consistent pattern: `new_index = (old_index + 4) % 12`. This corresponds to a circular right shift by 4 positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
  - format: space-separated integers
  - length: 12
Elements:
  - type: integer
  - classification: zero, non-zero
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      - property: ordered list of 12 integers
  - Output_Sequence:
      - property: ordered list of 12 integers
Relationships:
  - Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
  - The length of Input_Sequence and Output_Sequence is identical.
  - The multiset of elements (counts of each integer) is preserved between Input_Sequence and Output_Sequence.
Action:
  - name: circular_shift
  - direction: right
  - amount: 4 positions
  - target: Input_Sequence
  - result: Output_Sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a circular right shift on the sequence by 4 positions.
    *   This means that for each element at index `i` (0-based) in the input sequence, its new position in the output sequence will be `(i + 4) % 12`.
3.  Produce the resulting sequence as the output.
