The non-zero values themselves are preserved from input to output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The positions of the non-zero elements change between the input and output. The relative order of the non-zero elements appears to be maintained, but their absolute positions shift. Observing multiple examples (e.g., train_1, train_4, train_6) suggests a consistent shift to the right. Crucially, examples like train_5 and train_7 show that elements shifted off the right end reappear at the left end, indicating a circular or wrap-around behavior. Comparing the index change across several examples (index 0 -> 4, index 9 -> 1, index 7 -> 11, index 1 -> 5) reveals a consistent pattern: `new_index = (old_index + 4) % 12`. This corresponds to a circular right shift by 4 positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
