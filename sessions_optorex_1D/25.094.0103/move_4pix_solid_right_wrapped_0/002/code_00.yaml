Data:
  - type: sequence
  - format: numpy.ndarray (as input to the function)
  - length: 12
Elements:
  - type: integer
  - classification: zero, non-zero
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      - property: numpy.ndarray of 12 integers
  - Output_Sequence:
      - property: ordered list or numpy.ndarray of 12 integers (intermediate step)
      - property: space-separated string of 12 integers (final output format)
Relationships:
  - Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
  - The length of Input_Sequence and Output_Sequence is identical (12).
  - The multiset of elements (counts of each integer) is preserved between Input_Sequence and Output_Sequence.
Action:
  - name: circular_shift
  - direction: right
  - amount: 4 positions
  - target: Input_Sequence (numpy.ndarray)
  - result: Output_Sequence (formatted as space-separated string)
