            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code consistently failed across all training and test examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type in the function signature (`input_str: str`) and the actual type being passed during execution (`numpy.ndarray`).\n\nThe strategy is to correct the input handling within the `transform` function. Instead of expecting a string and splitting it, the function should directly accept the NumPy array. The core logic of performing a circular right shift by 4 positions appears consistent with the initial analysis of the examples and does not seem to be the cause of the error. The output formatting back to a space-separated string should be retained as the example outputs are strings.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The execution environment passes input data as NumPy arrays (`numpy.ndarray`).\n*   **Error Consistency:** The `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred for every single example (7 train, 1 test shown).\n*   **Root Cause:** The function attempted to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array object.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The underlying logic (circular right shift by 4) was not tested due to the early failure but remains the primary hypothesis based on manual inspection of the input/output pairs.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
