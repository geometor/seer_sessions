            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 1D sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** All example sequences (input and output) have a length of 12.\n*   **Content:** Each sequence typically contains many instances of one dominant number and fewer instances of another number.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the elements within the sequence. The counts of each number remain the same between input and output, but their positions change.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBy comparing input and output pairs, I observe a pattern related to element frequency and position:\n\n1.  **Frequency Analysis:** In each pair, one number appears much more frequently than others. Let's call this the \"background\" number. The number(s) that appear less frequently are the \"foreground\" number(s). In all given examples, there's only one unique foreground number value.\n    *   `train_1`: Background `0`, Foreground `2`\n    *   `train_2`: Background `6`, Foreground `0`\n    *   `train_3`: Background `3`, Foreground `0`\n    *   `train_4`: Background `5`, Foreground `0`\n    *   `train_5`: Background `0`, Foreground `7`\n    *   `train_6`: Background `9`, Foreground `0`\n    *   `train_7`: Background `0`, Foreground `4`\n\n2.  **Positional Shift:** The positions of the foreground number(s) change from input to output. Let's track the indices (0-based):\n    *   `train_1`: Fg `2` at [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> Fg `2` at [0, 8, 9, 10, 11]\n    *   `train_2`: Fg `0` at [4, 5] -> Fg `0` at [8, 9]\n    *   `train_3`: Fg `0` at [0, 1, 2, 3, 11] -> Fg `0` at [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    *   `train_4`: Fg `0` at [0, 1, 2, 11] -> Fg `0` at [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    *   `train_5`: Fg `7` at [4] -> Fg `7` at [8]\n    *   `train_6`: Fg `0` at [3] -> Fg `0` at [7]\n    *   `train_7`: Fg `4` at [0] -> Fg `4` at [4]\n\n3.  **Shift Calculation:** There appears to be a consistent shift applied to the indices of the foreground elements. Let `N=12` be the sequence length. The new index `j` seems related to the old index `i` by `j = (i + shift) % N`. Let's test a shift of +4:\n    *   `train_1`: (4+4)%12=8, (5+4)%12=9, (6+4)%12=10, (7+4)%12=11, (8+4)%12=0. Matches [0, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n    *   `train_2`: (4+4)%12=8, (5+4)%12=9. Matches [8, 9].\n    *   `train_3`: (0+4)%12=4, (1+4)%12=5, (2+4)%12=6, (3+4)%12=7, (11+4)%12=3. Matches [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\n    *   `train_4`: (0+4)%12=4, (1+4)%12=5, (2+4)%12=6, (11+4)%12=3. Matches [3, 4, 5, 6].\n    *   `train_5`: (4+4)%12=8. Matches [8].\n    *   `train_6`: (3+4)%12=7. Matches [7].\n    *   `train_7`: (0+4)%12=4. Matches [4].\n\nThe shift of +4 positions (modulo 12) consistently explains the movement of the foreground elements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
