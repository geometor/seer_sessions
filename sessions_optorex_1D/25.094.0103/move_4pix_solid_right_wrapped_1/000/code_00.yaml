task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: single-digit integers
  - item: number
    properties:
      - role: background (most frequent)
      - role: foreground (least frequent, count > 0)
relationships:
  - type: frequency
    description: Each number has a count within the sequence.
  - type: position
    description: Each number occupies specific indices in the sequence.
actions:
  - action: identify_frequencies
    description: Count occurrences of each unique number in the input sequence.
  - action: determine_roles
    description: Identify the background (most frequent) and foreground (least frequent > 0) numbers.
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a new sequence of length 12 filled with the background number.
  - action: relocate_foreground
    description: For each position 'i' of the foreground number in the input, place it at position '(i + 4) mod 12' in the output sequence.
