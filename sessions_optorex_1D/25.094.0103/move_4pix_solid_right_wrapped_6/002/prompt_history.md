Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** All sequences (input and output) consistently have a length of 12.
3.  **Element Types:** The sequences contain integers. The integer `0` appears to represent an empty or background state. Non-zero integers (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 in the examples) represent distinct objects or filled states.
4.  **Conservation:** The count of each specific non-zero integer and the count of zeros are preserved from input to output. The transformation only rearranges the elements.
5.  **Non-Zero Homogeneity:** In each example pair, there is only one type of non-zero integer present in the input (e.g., only `6`s and `0`s, or only `4`s and `0`s).
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The rearrangement rule appears to depend *specifically* on the value of the non-zero integer present in the sequence. The non-zero elements are collected or moved according to different rules based on their value.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated integers string
    length: 12
Elements:
  - type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/empty
  - type: integer
    value: non-zero (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9)
    role: object/marker
Constraints:
  - conservation: The count of each distinct integer is preserved between input and output.
  - homogeneity: Each input sequence contains only one type of non-zero integer.
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  logic: dependent on the specific non-zero integer value present
  rules:
    - integer_1:
        action: collect and shift right
        details: Collect all '1's into a contiguous block. Determine the index of the first '1' in the input. Place the collected block in the output starting at index (first_index + 4). Fill remaining positions with '0'.
    - integer_4:
        action: collect and place left-offset
        details: Collect all '4's into a contiguous block. Place this block in the output starting at index 1. Fill remaining positions with '0'.
    - integer_5:
        action: collect and place left-offset
        details: Collect all '5's into a contiguous block. Place this block in the output starting at index 1. Fill remaining positions with '0'.
    - integer_6:
        action: conditional placement based on count
        details: Count the number of '6's. If the count is exactly 2, place '6 6' at indices 3 and 4. If the count is greater than 2, collect all '6's into a contiguous block and place it starting at index 0. Fill remaining positions with '0'.
    - integer_7:
        action: split and move to ends
        details: Collect all '7's into a contiguous block. Split the block into two halves (first half size = ceiling(count/2), second half size = floor(count/2)). Place the first half block at the beginning of the output (index 0). Place the second half block at the end of the output. Fill the positions between the two blocks with '0'.
    - integer_9:
        action: collect and shift right
        details: Collect all '9's into a contiguous block. Determine the index of the first '9' in the input. Place the collected block in the output starting at index (first_index + 4). Fill remaining positions with '0'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the non-zero integer value (`N`) present in the list.
3.  Count the total number of occurrences (`count`) of `N`.
4.  Initialize an output list of 12 zeros.
5.  Apply the specific transformation rule based on the value of `N`:
    *   If `N` is 1 or 9: Find the index (`first_idx`) of the first occurrence of `N` in the input list. Place `count` copies of `N` into the output list starting at index `first_idx + 4`.
    *   If `N` is 4 or 5: Place `count` copies of `N` into the output list starting at index 1.
    *   If `N` is 6:
        *   If `count` is 2, set the elements at indices 3 and 4 of the output list to 6.
        *   If `count` is greater than 2, place `count` copies of 6 into the output list starting at index 0.
    *   If `N` is 7: Calculate the size of the first half (`size1 = ceil(count / 2)`) and the second half (`size2 = floor(count / 2)`). Place `size1` copies of 7 at the beginning of the output list (starting at index 0). Place `size2` copies of 7 at the end of the output list (starting at index `12 - size2`).
6.  Convert the output list back into a space-separated string.
```python
import math

"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 space-separated integers based on the value of the single non-zero integer present.

1.  Parses the input string into a list of 12 integers.
2.  Identifies the non-zero integer (N) and its count.
3.  Applies a specific rearrangement rule based on N:
    - If N is 1 or 9: Collects all N's and places them starting at the index of the first N in the input plus 4.
    - If N is 4 or 5: Collects all N's and places them starting at index 1.
    - If N is 6:
        - If count is 2, places '6 6' at indices 3 and 4.
        - If count > 2, collects all 6's and places them starting at index 0.
    - If N is 7: Splits the collected N's into two halves (ceil/floor) and places the first half at the beginning and the second half at the end of the output sequence.
4.  Fills remaining positions with 0s.
5.  Formats the resulting list back into a space-separated string.
