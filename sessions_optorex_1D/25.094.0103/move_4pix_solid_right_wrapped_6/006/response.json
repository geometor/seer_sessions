            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently appears across all examples. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (defined as `input_str: str`) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to directly accept a NumPy array (`input_grid: np.ndarray`) as input, eliminating the initial string parsing step. The core transformation logic, which identifies the non-zero number and applies specific placement rules based on its value, appears sound based on the initial analysis of the examples and should be retained.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nThe error occurs before any core logic is executed, specifically during the attempt to parse the input. Therefore, metrics related to the *output* of the failed code are not applicable. The key observation is the input type mismatch.\n\nRe-analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the initial observations:\n*   **Input:** 1D sequence of 12 integers.\n*   **Output:** 1D sequence of 12 integers (formatted as a space-separated string).\n*   **Content:** Contains zeros and only one unique non-zero integer (`N`) per sequence.\n*   **Transformation:** Rearrangement of the non-zero elements (`N`) into a contiguous block (or blocks for N=7), placed at a specific location determined by the value of `N` and sometimes its count or initial position. Zeros fill the remaining space. The number of non-zero elements and zeros is conserved.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Create an output NumPy array, `output_grid`, of the same size (12 elements), initialized with zeros.\n3.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value (`N`) present in `input_grid`.\n4.  If no non-zero integer `N` is found (i.e., `input_grid` contains only zeros), proceed directly to step 8.\n5.  Count the total number of times `N` appears in `input_grid` (let this be `count`). Find the index of the first occurrence of `N` in `input_grid` (let this be `first_idx`).\n6.  Apply the specific placement rule based on the value of `N` to modify `output_grid`:\n    *   If `N` is 1 or 9: Calculate the target start index `s = first_idx + 4`. Place `count` copies of `N` into `output_grid` starting at index `s`, respecting array boundaries (indices 0 to 11).\n    *   If `N` is 4 or 5: Place `count` copies of `N` into `output_grid` starting at index 1, respecting array boundaries.\n    *   If `N` is 6:\n        *   If `count` is exactly 2: Set `output_grid[3] = N` and `output_grid[4] = N` (if indices are valid).\n        *   If `count` is greater than 2: Place `count` copies of `N` into `output_grid` starting at index 0, respecting array boundaries.\n    *   If `N` is 7: Calculate the size of the first block: `size1 = ceil(count / 2)`. Calculate the size of the second block: `size2 = count - size1`. Place `size1` copies of `N` at the beginning of `output_grid` (starting at index 0). Calculate the start index for the second block: `s2 = 12 - size2`. Place `size2` copies of `N` at the end of `output_grid` (starting at index `s2`), respecting array boundaries.\n7.  Any positions in `output_grid` not explicitly assigned a value of `N` remain zero.\n8.  Convert the `output_grid` array into a single string with elements separated by spaces.\n9.
