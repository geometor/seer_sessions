            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** All sequences (input and output) consistently have a length of 12.\n3.  **Element Types:** The sequences contain integers. The integer `0` appears to represent an empty or background state. Non-zero integers (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 in the examples) represent distinct objects or filled states.\n4.  **Conservation:** The count of each specific non-zero integer and the count of zeros are preserved from input to output. The transformation only rearranges the elements.\n5.  **Non-Zero Homogeneity:** In each example pair, there is only one type of non-zero integer present in the input (e.g., only `6`s and `0`s, or only `4`s and `0`s).\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The rearrangement rule appears to depend *specifically* on the value of the non-zero integer present in the sequence. The non-zero elements are collected or moved according to different rules based on their value.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
