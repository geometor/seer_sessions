The sequences appear to be space-separated strings representing lists of integers. The core transformation involves changing certain occurrences of the digit '2' in the input sequence to '8' in the output sequence. The digit '0' remains unchanged. The change from '2' to '8' seems conditional, based on the value of the preceding element in the sequence. Specifically, a '2' changes to an '8' if and only if the element immediately before it in the input sequence is also a '2'. The first element of the sequence, having no predecessor, is never changed to '8'. All other elements remain the same as in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
