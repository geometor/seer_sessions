The length of the sequence remains the same. The transformation rule specifically targets the number '2'. A '2' can potentially change into an '8' based on its position within a contiguous block (run) of '2's and the element immediately following that block. Zeros remain unchanged. The core logic involves identifying runs of '2's that terminate either just before a '0' or at the very end of the sequence. For such runs, a specific number of '2's at the end of the run are converted to '8's. The number of '2's converted depends on the total length of the run.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
