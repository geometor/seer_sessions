*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of integers containing only 0s and 2s into a sequence containing 0s, 2s, and 8s. The length of the sequence remains the same. The transformation rule specifically targets the number '2'. A '2' can potentially change into an '8' based on its position within a contiguous block (run) of '2's and the element immediately following that block. Zeros remain unchanged. The core logic involves identifying runs of '2's that terminate either just before a '0' or at the very end of the sequence. For such runs, a specific number of '2's at the end of the run are converted to '8's. The number of '2's converted depends on the total length of the run.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous runs of the number '2'. For each run, record its starting index, ending index, and length.
    3.  For each identified run of '2's (with length `L`, starting at index `start`, ending at index `end`):
        a.  Check the element immediately following the run (at index `end + 1`).
        b.  Determine if the run terminates correctly: it terminates correctly if either the run ends at the last index of the sequence OR the element at index `end + 1` is '0'.
        c.  If the run terminates correctly:
            i.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_changes = floor(L / 2)`.
            ii. If `num_changes` is greater than 0, iterate from index `end - num_changes + 1` up to `end` (inclusive). For each index in this range, change the value in the *output* sequence at that index from '2' to '8'.
    4.  Return the modified output sequence.
