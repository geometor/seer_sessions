"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 2s based on contiguous runs of 2s.
Specifically, identifies runs of '2's that end either at the sequence boundary
or immediately before a '0'. For such runs, the last floor(L/2) elements
(where L is the length of the run) are changed from '2' to '8'.
Zeros remain unchanged.
