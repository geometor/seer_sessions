    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray (1D)
        description: The initial sequence of integers, containing only 0s and 2s. Assumed to be 1-dimensional.
      - name: output_sequence
        type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray (1D)
        description: The transformed sequence of integers, containing 0s, 2s, and 8s, with the same length as the input.
      - name: element
        type: int
        description: An individual integer within a sequence (0, 2, or 8).
      - name: run_of_twos
        # represents start_index (inclusive), end_index (inclusive), length
        type: Tuple[int, int, int]
        description: A contiguous subsequence composed entirely of the integer 2, identified by its start index, end index, and length.
    properties:
      - name: value
        applies_to: element
        description: The integer value (0, 2, or 8).
      - name: index
        applies_to: element
        description: The 0-based position of the element within its sequence.
      - name: length
        applies_to: [input_sequence, output_sequence, run_of_twos]
        description: The number of elements.
      - name: start_index
        applies_to: run_of_twos
        description: The index of the first element in the run.
      - name: end_index
        applies_to: run_of_twos
        description: The index of the last element in the run.
    relationships:
      - type: position
        description: An element exists at a specific index in a sequence.
      - type: adjacency
        description: An element is immediately followed by another element or the end of the sequence.
      - type: membership
        description: An element is part of a specific run_of_twos.
      - type: transformation
        description: Elements in the input_sequence map to elements in the output_sequence. Some '2's may transform into '8's based on run properties.
    actions:
      - name: identify_runs_of_twos
        actor: system
        input: input_sequence
        output: List[run_of_twos]
        description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous runs of the integer 2, recording start index, end index, and length for each.
      - name: check_run_termination_condition
        actor: system
        input: run_of_twos, input_sequence
        output: boolean
        description: Determine if a run qualifies for modification. A run qualifies if it ends at the last index of the sequence OR if the element immediately following the run (at index end_index + 1) has a value of 0.
      - name: calculate_number_of_changes
        actor: system
        input: run_of_twos
        output: int
        description: For a qualifying run, calculate the number of '2's to change to '8's as floor(run_length / 2).
      - name: apply_transformation
        actor: system
        input: input_sequence, List[run_of_twos]
        output: output_sequence
        description: Create the output sequence by copying the input. Then, for each qualifying run_of_twos, change the last 'calculate_number_of_changes' elements of that run from '2' to '8' in the output sequence.
