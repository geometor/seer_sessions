            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis identified a potential pattern involving runs of '2's followed by '0's or the end of the sequence. The provided Python code attempts to implement this logic. However, the execution results consistently show an error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This strongly indicates that the execution environment is likely passing the input as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list as the code was written to expect. Comparisons like `if sequence[i] == 2` work element-wise, but if a slice or the whole array were involved in a boolean context elsewhere (which doesn't seem apparent in the provided `transform` function itself, suggesting the error might stem from the testing harness interaction or a misunderstanding of how the input is structured), this error would occur. The core logic of identifying runs and modifying the end based on the following element needs re-validation against all examples. The strategy is to:\n    1.  Confirm the transformation logic by applying it manually or via code execution (assuming list inputs for now) to all examples.\n    2.  Adapt the understanding and potentially the code structure/type handling if the input is indeed consistently a NumPy array in the target environment.\n    3.  Refine the natural language program based on verified logic.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:** Let's execute the provided Python code's logic against the training examples, assuming list inputs, to verify the transformation rule itself, independent of the specific runtime error.\n\n"
