The errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly indicate that the `transform` function, designed for a 1D NumPy array, is receiving a multi-dimensional array (likely 2D with shape (1, N)) during execution. The strategy is to modify the function to explicitly handle this potential 2D input by operating on its first (and presumably only) row, while keeping the core run-modification logic intact.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    The analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistent across all provided training examples. The key parameters for each example are the start indices and lengths of the runs of '2's, and the number of elements changed in each run.\n\n    Let's re-verify the logic programmatically for one example: `train_1`.\n"
