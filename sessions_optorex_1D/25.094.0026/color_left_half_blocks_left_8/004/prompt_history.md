*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of digits (specifically 0, 2, and 8) represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The core transformation involves selectively changing the digit '2' to '8'. The digit '0' appears unchanged and seems to act as a delimiter, separating sequences of '2's.
    *   The transformation rule depends on the context of consecutive sequences (runs) of the digit '2'.
    *   Within a run of '2's, the modification applies only to the latter part of the run.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - type: sequence
        format: space-separated digits
        values: [0, 2, 8]
    objects:
      - object: digit_0
        property: unchanged
        role: delimiter/boundary
      - object: digit_2
        property: potentially changed
      - object: digit_8
        property: result of changing digit_2
      - object: run_of_twos
        description: A contiguous subsequence containing only the digit 2.
        property: length (L)
    action:
      name: modify_run_of_twos
      input: run_of_twos
      output: modified_run
      rule: Change the last floor(L/2) elements of the run from 2 to 8.
    relationships:
      - The transformation is applied independently to each run_of_twos.
      - The position of digit_0 is preserved.
      - The transformation from 2 to 8 only happens within a run_of_twos.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of numbers.
    2.  Initialize an empty list or identify indices marking the start and end of runs of consecutive '2's in the input list.
    3.  Iterate through the identified runs of '2's.
    4.  For each run:
        a.  Determine the length of the run, `L`.
        b.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = floor(L / 2)`.
        c.  Identify the indices corresponding to the last `num_to_change` elements within this specific run in the original list.
        d.  For each of these identified indices, change the value in the list from 2 to 8.
    5.  Convert the modified list back into a space-separated string to produce the final output.
