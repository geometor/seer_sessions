            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: modifying the latter half of consecutive runs of the digit '2' to '8'. However, the code implementation failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch. The strategy is to adapt the logic to operate directly on NumPy arrays, leveraging array indexing and iteration. The fundamental rule of changing the last `floor(L/2)` elements in a run of `L` twos remains the same.\n\n*   **Gather Metrics:**\n    The previous code failed during input parsing, so no meaningful execution metrics were generated. Re-analyzing the examples with the knowledge that the input is a NumPy array:\n    *   All inputs are 1-dimensional NumPy arrays.\n    *   The elements are integers (0 and 2).\n    *   The outputs are also 1-dimensional NumPy arrays containing integers (0, 2, and 8).\n    *   The lengths of the input and output arrays are identical for each example.\n\n    Let's re-examine `train_1` as an example:\n    *   Input: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2])`\n    *   Run 1: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` at indices 3-6. Length L=4. `floor(L/2) = 2`. Change last 2 elements (indices 5, 6).\n    *   Run 2: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` at indices 8-11. Length L=4. `floor(L/2) = 2`. Change last 2 elements (indices 10, 11).\n    *   Expected Output: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8])`. This matches the provided output.\n\n    This pattern holds for the other examples as well.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
