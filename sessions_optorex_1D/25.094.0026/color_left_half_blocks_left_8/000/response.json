The digit '0' appears unchanged and seems to act as a delimiter, separating sequences of '2's.\n    *   The transformation rule depends on the context of consecutive sequences (runs) of the digit '2'.\n    *   Within a run of '2's, the modification applies only to the latter part of the run.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
