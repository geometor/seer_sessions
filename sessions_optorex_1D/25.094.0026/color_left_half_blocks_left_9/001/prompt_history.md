**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers. The input sequences consist of the integers 0 and 2. The output sequences consist of the integers 0, 2, and 8. The length of the input sequence is maintained in the output sequence. The core transformation appears to be the selective replacement of the number 2 with the number 8 based on its context within the sequence. Specifically, the value of an element seems to depend on the value of the element immediately preceding it. The number 0 always remains 0.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains integers 0, 2 in input
      - contains integers 0, 2, 8 in output
      - maintains length between input and output
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: Each element (except the first) has a preceding element.
actions:
  - name: conditional replacement
    input_object: element with value 2
    output_object: element with value 8
    condition: The element immediately preceding the input element also has a value of 2.
  - name: identity transformation
    input_object: element
    output_object: element (unchanged)
    condition: 
      - The element value is 0.
      - The element value is 2, but the preceding element is not 2.
      - The element is the first element in the sequence (index 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence.
2.  Copy the first element from the input sequence to the output sequence without modification.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.
4.  For each element at the current index `i`:
    a.  Check if the element at the current index `i` in the input sequence is 2.
    b.  Check if the element at the preceding index `i-1` in the input sequence is also 2.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, append the number 8 to the output sequence.
    d.  Otherwise (if the element at index `i` is not 2, or the element at index `i-1` is not 2), append the original element from the input sequence at index `i` to the output sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.
