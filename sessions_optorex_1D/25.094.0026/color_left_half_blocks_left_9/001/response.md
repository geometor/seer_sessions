"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on a rule involving adjacent elements.
Specifically, if an element is 2 and the element immediately preceding it is also 2, 
the element is changed to 8 in the output sequence. Otherwise, the element remains unchanged.
The first element of the sequence is never changed.
