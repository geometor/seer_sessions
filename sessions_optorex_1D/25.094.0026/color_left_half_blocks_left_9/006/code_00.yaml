objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains integers 0, 2 in input
      - contains integers 0, 2, 8 in output
      - maintains length between input and output
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence
  - name: block_of_twos
    type: contiguous sub-sequence
    properties:
      - consists solely of the integer 2
      - defined by a start index, end index, and length (k)
      - bounded by 0s or the start/end of the main sequence
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Elements belong to the sequence.
  - type: contiguity
    description: Elements with value 2 can form contiguous blocks.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input_object: sequence
    output_object: list of block_of_twos (each with start_index, end_index, length)
    description: Iterate through the sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the number 2.
  - name: transform_block
    input_object: block_of_twos
    condition: Based on the block's length (k).
    output_effect: Modifies specific elements (changing 2 to 8) within the corresponding section of a *copy* of the original sequence.
    sub_rules:
      - if k = 1: no change
      - if k = 2: change element at end_index to 8
      - if k = 3: change element at end_index to 8
      - if k >= 4: change elements at (end_index - 1) and end_index to 8
  - name: copy_unmodified
    input_object: element
    condition: Element value is 0, or element is a 2 that is not modified by transform_block rules.
    output_effect: Element value remains unchanged in the output sequence.
