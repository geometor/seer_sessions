            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue appears to be an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule, leading to the previous code logic failing to produce the correct outputs. The error message (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") is likely a symptom of how the test harness interacts with the provided code or interprets the input/output format, rather than a direct fault of the intended pure Python list processing logic in the last provided code snippet. It suggests that perhaps the input is being passed as a NumPy array or similar structure where direct boolean evaluation is disallowed. However, focusing on the *pattern* revealed by the examples is crucial.\n\nThe initial hypothesis (changing a '2' to '8' if preceded by a '2') is clearly insufficient. A more robust hypothesis involves identifying contiguous blocks of '2's and applying rules based on the *length* of these blocks. Re-evaluating the examples using this block-based strategy reveals a consistent pattern.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-analyze each input/output pair to precisely define the transformation rule based on the length of contiguous blocks of '2's.\n2.  Update the facts (objects, properties, actions) to reflect this block-based understanding.\n3.  Formulate a new natural language program describing this refined rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Examples:**\n\n| Example | Input Sequence              | Output Sequence             | Blocks of 2s (Input) | Changes Made                                     | Rule Applied                                       |\n| :------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `002220222220`            | `002280222880`            | `(2,2,2)` len 3; `(2,2,2,2,2)` len 5 | `222`->`228`; `22222`->`22288` | len 3: last -> 8; len 5: last two -> 8            |\n| train_2 | `022220220220`            | `022880280280`            | `(2,2,2,2)` len 4; `(2,2)` len 2; `(2,2)` len 2 | `2222`->`2288`; `22`->`28`; `22`->`28` | len 4: last two -> 8; len 2: last -> 8; len 2: last -> 8 |\n| train_3 | `002222202220`            | `002228802280`            | `(2,2,2,2,2)` len 5; `(2,2,2)` len 3 | `22222`->`22288`; `222`->`228` | len 5: last two -> 8; len 3: last -> 8            |\n| train_4 | `002222022220`            | `002288022880`            | `(2,2,2,2)` len 4; `(2,2,2,2)` len 4 | `2222`->`2288`; `2222`->`2288` | len 4: last two -> 8; len 4: last two -> 8            |\n| train_5 | `022022000222`            | `028028000228`            | `(2,2)` len 2; `(2,2)` len 2; `(2,2,2)` len 3 | `22`->`28`; `22`->`28`; `222`->`228` | len 2: last -> 8; len 2: last -> 8; len 3: last -> 8 |\n| train_6 | `022222022000`            | `022288028000`            | `(2,2,2,2,2)` len 5; `(2,2)` len 2 | `22222`->`22288`; `22`->`28` | len 5: last two -> 8; len 2: last -> 8            |\n| train_7 | `000002220220`            | `000002280280`            | `(2,2,2)` len 3; `(2,2)` len 2 | `222`->`228`; `22`->`28` | len 3: last -> 8; len 2: last -> 8            |\n\n**Consolidated Rule:**\n- Find contiguous blocks of the number 2.\n- If a block has length `k=1`, no change within the block.\n- If a block has length `k=2` or `k=3`, change the *last* '2' in the block to '8'.\n- If a block has length `k>=4`, change the *last two* '2's in the block to '8'.\n- Numbers '0' remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
