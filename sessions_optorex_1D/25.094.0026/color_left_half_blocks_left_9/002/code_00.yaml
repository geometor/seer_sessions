objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains integers 0, 2 in input
      - contains integers 0, 2, 8 in output
      - maintains length between input and output
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence
  - name: block_of_twos
    type: contiguous sub-sequence
    properties:
      - composed exclusively of the integer 2
      - length: number of elements (k)
      - start_index: index of the first 2 in the block
      - end_index: index of the last 2 in the block
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Elements are contained within sequences. Blocks_of_twos are contained within sequences.
  - type: positional
    description: Elements and blocks have defined start/end positions within the sequence.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input_object: sequence
    output_object: list of block_of_twos (defined by start_index and length k)
  - name: conditional_replacement_within_block
    input_object: block_of_twos
    output_object: modified elements within the sequence
    conditions:
      - if k == 2: change the element at start_index + 1 to 8.
      - if k == 3: change the element at start_index + 2 to 8.
      - if k >= 4: change the elements at start_index + k - 2 and start_index + k - 1 to 8.
  - name: identity_transformation
    input_object: element
    output_object: element (unchanged)
    condition:
      - The element value is 0.
      - The element value is 2, but it is not modified by the conditional_replacement_within_block action based on its block's properties.
