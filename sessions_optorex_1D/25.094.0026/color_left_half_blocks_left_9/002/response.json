            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis incorrectly identified the transformation rule. The error messages (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) were misleading; while potentially indicating an issue with data types (list vs. NumPy array) in the test harness or the previous code's unused imports, the fundamental problem was the incorrect transformation logic derived from only the first example.\n\nManual re-analysis of all provided training examples revealed a more complex pattern based on the length of contiguous blocks of the number '2'.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Discard the previous simple pairwise comparison logic.\n2.  Implement logic to identify contiguous blocks of '2's within the input sequence.\n3.  Apply specific transformation rules (changing '2' to '8') based on the length (`k`) of each identified block:\n    *   If `k=2`, change the second '2' to '8'.\n    *   If `k=3`, change the third '2' to '8'.\n    *   If `k>=4`, change the last two '2's to '8'.\n4.  Ensure the implementation uses standard Python lists to avoid potential type ambiguity errors.\n5.  Update the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to accurately reflect this block-based logic.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nManual analysis revealed the following key characteristics relevant to the transformation:\n*   **Blocks of 2s:** The transformation only affects elements with the value 2. These transformations depend on the element being part of a contiguous block of 2s.\n*   **Block Length Dependency:** The specific positions within a block that change from 2 to 8 depend directly on the total length (`k`) of that block.\n    *   k=2: Last element changes.\n    *   k=3: Last element changes.\n    *   k>=4: Last two elements change.\n*   **No Change:** Elements with value 0 are never changed. Elements with value 2 that are not modified by the block rules remain 2.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
