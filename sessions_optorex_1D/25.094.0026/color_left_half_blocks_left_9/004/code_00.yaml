objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains integers 0, 2 in input
      - contains integers 0, 2, 8 in output
      - maintains length between input and output
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    properties:
      - value: The repeated integer value in the block (always 2 in this task)
      - start_index: The index of the first element of the block in the original sequence
      - length: The number of elements in the block
      - indices: A list of the original indices covered by the block

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Sequences contain elements.
  - type: contiguity
    description: Elements with the same value (2) can form contiguous blocks within the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input_object: sequence
    output_object: list of blocks (where block value is 2)
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the integer 2. Record their start index and length.
  - name: transform_block
    input_object: block
    condition: Based on block.length
    output_effect: Modifies elements within the original sequence (or a copy) at specific indices derived from the block's properties.
    sub_actions:
      - condition: block.length == 2
        effect: Change the element at index (block.start_index + 1) to 8.
      - condition: block.length == 3
        effect: Change the element at index (block.start_index + 2) to 8.
      - condition: block.length >= 4
        effect: Change the element at index (block.start_index + block.length - 1) to 8 AND change the element at index (block.start_index + block.length - 2) to 8.
  - name: identity_transformation
    input_object: element
    condition: Element value is 0 OR element value is 2 but not modified by transform_block action.
    output_effect: Element value remains unchanged in the output sequence.
