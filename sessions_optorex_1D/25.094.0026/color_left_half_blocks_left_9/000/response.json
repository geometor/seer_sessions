The output sequences consist of the integers 0, 2, and 8. The length of the input sequence is maintained in the output sequence. The core transformation appears to be the selective replacement of the number 2 with the number 8 based on its context within the sequence. Specifically, the value of an element seems to depend on the value of the element immediately preceding it. The number 0 always remains 0.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
