  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains integers 0, 2 in input
      - contains integers 0, 2, 8 in output
      - maintains length between input and output
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: Each element (except the first) has a preceding element.
actions:
  - name: conditional replacement
    input_object: element with value 2
    output_object: element with value 8
    condition: The element immediately preceding the input element also has a value of 2.
  - name: identity transformation
    input_object: element
    output_object: element (unchanged)
    condition: 
      - The element value is 0.
      - The element value is 2, but the preceding element is not 2.
      - The element is the first element in the sequence (index 0).
