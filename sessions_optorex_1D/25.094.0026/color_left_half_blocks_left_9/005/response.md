"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on the length of contiguous blocks of the number 2.
The transformation rules are applied to a copy of the input sequence:
- If a contiguous block of 2s has length k=2, the second 2 in the block is changed to 8.
- If a contiguous block of 2s has length k=3, the third 2 in the block is changed to 8.
- If a contiguous block of 2s has length k>=4, the last two 2s in the block are changed to 8.
- Elements with value 0 and 2s not modified by the above rules (e.g., in blocks of length 1, 
  or the initial elements of longer blocks) remain unchanged.
