The `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error occurred because the code attempted to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified in the previous phase (identifying contiguous blocks of `2`s and modifying the last one or two elements based on block length) appears consistent with the input/output examples upon visual inspection. The failure was solely in the input handling mechanism.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is straightforward: modify the code to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the `.split()` call and adapting the subsequent logic to work with sequence indices.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe primary metric from the error report is the confirmation of the input data type as `numpy.ndarray`. No performance metrics related to the transformation logic itself could be gathered due to the immediate failure upon input processing. All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed with the same error, indicating a consistent input type mismatch.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
