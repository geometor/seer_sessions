The positions of the `0`s remain unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves selectively changing some `2`s to `8`s. This change is not uniform; some `2`s remain `2`s, while others become `8`s.\n5.  **Context Dependency:** The decision to change a `2` to an `8` depends on its position relative to other `2`s. Specifically, it relates to contiguous blocks (sequences) of `2`s.\n6.  **Block Analysis:**\n    *   Blocks of `[2, 2]` often transform into `[2, 8]`.\n    *   Blocks of `[2, 2, 2]` often transform into `[2, 2, 8]`.\n    *   Blocks of `[2, 2, 2, 2]` transform into `[2, 2, 8, 8]`. (See train\\_2)\n    *   Blocks of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` transform into `[2, 2, 2, 8, 8]`. (See train\\_4)\n7.  **Rule Inference:** The transformation seems to depend on the *length* (`L`) of a contiguous block of `2`s:\n    *   If `L=1`, the `2` remains `2`. (Inferred, not explicitly shown)\n    *   If `L=2` or `L=3`, the *last* `2` in the block becomes `8`.\n    *   If `L >= 4`, the *last two* `2`s in the block become `8`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
