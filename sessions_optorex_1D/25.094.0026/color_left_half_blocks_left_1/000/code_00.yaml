task_description: "Transform a sequence of 0s and 2s by selectively replacing some 2s with 8s based on their grouping."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    dtype: integer
    vocabulary: [0, 2]
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    dtype: integer
    vocabulary: [0, 2, 8]
structure:
  - constraint: "Output sequence length equals input sequence length."
  - invariant: "Positions of 0s remain unchanged."
objects:
  - object: "Contiguous block of 2s"
    description: "A maximal sequence of one or more consecutive 2s in the input sequence, delimited by 0s or sequence boundaries."
    properties:
      - name: "Length"
        symbol: L
        description: "The number of 2s in the block."
actions:
  - action: "Conditional Replacement"
    target: "Elements within a 'Contiguous block of 2s'"
    condition: |
      Based on the block's length (L):
      - If L = 1: No replacement occurs.
      - If L = 2 or L = 3: Replace the last '2' in the block with '8'.
      - If L >= 4: Replace the last two '2's in the block with '8'.
    output_effect: "Modifies the elements within the block for the output sequence."
relationships:
  - relationship: "Input to Output Mapping"
    description: "Each element in the output corresponds positionally to an element in the input. 0s map to 0s. 2s map to 2s or 8s based on the block rule."
