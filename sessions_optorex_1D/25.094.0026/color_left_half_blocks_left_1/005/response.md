```python
"""
Transforms a sequence (derived from flattening a potentially multi-dimensional input grid) of 0s and 2s by selectively replacing some 2s with 8s.
The replacement rule depends on the length (L) of contiguous blocks of 2s found in the flattened input:
- If L = 1: The 2 remains unchanged.
- If L = 2 or L = 3: The last 2 in the block becomes 8 in the output.
- If L >= 4: The last two 2s in the block become 8s in the output.
0s remain unchanged in their positions. The function returns the transformed 1D sequence.
