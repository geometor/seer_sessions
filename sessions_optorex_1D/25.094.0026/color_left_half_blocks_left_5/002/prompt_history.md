Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are sequences of single digits represented as strings separated by spaces.
2.  **Digits Involved:** The input sequences consist only of '0' and '2'. The output sequences consist of '0', '2', and '8'.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some '2's in the input sequence to '8's in the output sequence. '0's remain unchanged.
4.  **Context Dependency:** Whether a '2' changes to an '8' depends on its neighboring digits, specifically the presence of other consecutive '2's.
5.  **Pattern:** The change occurs within contiguous blocks of '2's. The specific digits within the block that change depend on the *length* of the block.
    *   Blocks of length 2 (`2 2`) become `2 8`.
    *   Blocks of length 3 (`2 2 2`) become `2 2 8`.
    *   Blocks of length 4 (`2 2 2 2`) become `2 2 8 8`.
    *   Blocks of length 5 (`2 2 2 2 2`, seen in train_2) become `2 2 2 8 8`.
6.  **Rule Generalization:** It appears that for blocks of '2's with length L:
    *   If L=2 or L=3, the last '2' (at index L-1 within the block) becomes '8'.
    *   If L=4 or L=5 (and presumably L > 3), the last two '2's (at indices L-2 and L-1 within the block) become '8'.

**YAML Facts:**

  - object: contiguous_two_block
    properties:
      - start_index: { type: integer, description: Index of the first '2' in the block }

      - length: { type: integer, description: Number of '2's in the block (end_index - start_index + 1) }

transformation:
  action: modify_elements
  target: sequence_element
  condition: The element is part of a contiguous_two_block.
  rule:
    - name: process_short_blocks
      condition: contiguous_two_block.length == 2 OR contiguous_two_block.length == 3
      action: change_value
      target_element_condition: sequence_element.index == contiguous_two_block.end_index
      new_value: 8
    - name: process_long_blocks

      action: change_value
      target_element_condition: sequence_element.index == contiguous_two_block.end_index OR sequence_element.index == (contiguous_two_block.end_index - 1)
      new_value: 8

relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The value of an output element depends on the value and context (membership in a contiguous_two_block and the block's length) of the corresponding input element.
  - Elements with value '0' in the input remain '0' in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to serve as the working output sequence.
3.  Scan the sequence to identify all maximal contiguous blocks consisting only of the digit '2'. For each block, record its start index, end index, and length.
4.  Iterate through the identified blocks:
    a.  If a block has a length of 2 or 3, change the digit at the block's *end index* in the working output sequence to '8'.
    b.  If a block has a length of 4 or more, change the digits at the block's *end index* AND the digit at the index *immediately preceding the end* (end index - 1) in the working output sequence to '8'.
5.  Return the final working output sequence.
