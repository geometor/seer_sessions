"""
Identifies contiguous blocks of the digit '2' in an input sequence (list or array) of digits. 
For each block found:
- If the block length is 2 or 3, the last '2' in the block is changed to '8'.
- If the block length is 4 or more, the last two '2's in the block are changed to '8'.
Digits '0' remain unchanged. The function returns the modified sequence as a list.
