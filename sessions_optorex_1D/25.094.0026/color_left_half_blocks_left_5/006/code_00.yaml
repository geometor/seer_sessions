task_name: TransformSequenceByHalfBlockFloor
description: Modifies a sequence of digits by changing trailing '2's within contiguous blocks of '2's to '8's. The number of '2's changed at the end of each block is determined by the floor of half the block's length.

input_domain:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  allowed_values: [0, 2]
  separator: space
  description: A space-separated sequence of 0s and 2s.

output_domain:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  allowed_values: [0, 2, 8]
  separator: space
  description: A space-separated sequence where some 2s from the input have been changed to 8s.

components:
  - object: sequence_element
    properties:
      - value: { type: integer, description: The digit (0, 2, or 8) }
      - index: { type: integer, description: Position in the sequence (0-based) }
  - object: contiguous_two_block
    properties:
      - start_index: { type: integer, description: Index of the first '2' in the block }
      - end_index: { type: integer, description: Index of the last '2' in the block }
      - length: { type: integer, description: Number of '2's in the block (end_index - start_index + 1) }

transformation:
  action: identify_and_modify_blocks
  target: contiguous_two_block
  rule:
    - name: modify_trailing_elements
      condition: Always applies to each identified contiguous_two_block.
      calculation:
        - variable: k
          operation: floor_division
          value1: contiguous_two_block.length
          value2: 2
          description: Calculate k = floor(length / 2), the number of elements to change.
      action: change_value
      target_element_condition: sequence_element.index >= (contiguous_two_block.end_index - k + 1) AND sequence_element.index <= contiguous_two_block.end_index
      new_value: 8
      pre_condition: k > 0

relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by modifying elements within identified blocks.
  - Elements with value '0' in the input remain '0' in the output.
  - Elements with value '2' in the input may change to '8' in the output if they fall within the trailing `k` positions of a `contiguous_two_block`.
