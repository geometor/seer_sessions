            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Data Format:** The input and output are sequences of single digits represented as strings separated by spaces.\n2.  **Digits Involved:** The input sequences consist only of '0' and '2'. The output sequences consist of '0', '2', and '8'.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some '2's in the input sequence to '8's in the output sequence. '0's remain unchanged.\n4.  **Context Dependency:** Whether a '2' changes to an '8' depends on its neighboring digits, specifically the presence of other consecutive '2's.\n5.  **Pattern:** The change occurs within contiguous blocks of '2's. The specific digits within the block that change depend on the *length* of the block.\n    *   Blocks of length 2 (`2 2`) become `2 8`.\n    *   Blocks of length 3 (`2 2 2`) become `2 2 8`.\n    *   Blocks of length 4 (`2 2 2 2`) become `2 2 8 8`.\n    *   Blocks of length 5 (`2 2 2 2 2`, seen in train_2) become `2 2 2 8 8`.\n6.  **Rule Generalization:** It appears that for blocks of '2's with length L:\n    *   If L=2 or L=3, the last '2' (at index L-1 within the block) becomes '8'.\n    *   If L=4 or L=5 (and presumably L > 3), the last two '2's (at indices L-2 and L-1 within the block) become '8'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
