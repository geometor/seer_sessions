"""
Identifies contiguous blocks of the digit '2' in an input sequence (list or array) of digits. 
For each block of length L found:
- Calculate k = floor(L / 2).
- Change the last k elements (from index end_index - k + 1 to end_index) of that block from '2' to '8'.
Digits '0' remain unchanged. The function returns the modified sequence as a list.
