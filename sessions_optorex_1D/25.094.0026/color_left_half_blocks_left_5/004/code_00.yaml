task_name: TransformSequenceByTwoBlocksFloorDiv
description: Modifies a sequence of digits by changing a specific number of trailing '2's to '8's within contiguous blocks of '2's, based on the block's length.

input_domain:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  allowed_values: [0, 2]
  separator: space
  description: A space-separated sequence of 0s and 2s.

output_domain:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  allowed_values: [0, 2, 8]
  separator: space
  description: A space-separated sequence where some 2s from the input have been changed to 8s.

components:
  - object: sequence_element
    properties:
      - value: { type: integer, description: The digit (0, 2, or 8) }
      - index: { type: integer, description: Position in the sequence (0-based) }
  - object: contiguous_two_block
    properties:
      - start_index: { type: integer, description: Index of the first '2' in the block }
      - end_index: { type: integer, description: Index of the last '2' in the block }
      - length: { type: integer, description: Number of '2's in the block (L = end_index - start_index + 1) }

transformation:
  action: modify_elements
  target: sequence_element
  condition: The element is part of a contiguous_two_block.
  rule:
    - name: process_two_blocks
      condition: contiguous_two_block identified
      action: change_value
      parameters:
        - num_to_change: { value: floor(contiguous_two_block.length / 2), description: Calculate k, the number of trailing '2's to change.}
      target_element_condition: sequence_element.index >= (contiguous_two_block.end_index - num_to_change + 1) AND sequence_element.index <= contiguous_two_block.end_index
      new_value: 8

relationships:
  - The output sequence preserves the length and '0' positions of the input sequence.
  - The value of an output element corresponding to an input '2' depends on its membership in a contiguous_two_block and the block's length.
  - For each contiguous_two_block of length L, the last floor(L/2) elements within that block are changed from '2' to '8' in the output.
