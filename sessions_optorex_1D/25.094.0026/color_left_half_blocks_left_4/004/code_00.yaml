Task: Transform a 1D NumPy array of integers based on contiguous subsequences.

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Content: 1D array of integers 0 and 2.
  Role: Initial state.

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Content: 1D array of integers 0, 2, and 8.
  Role: Transformed state.
  Constraint: Same length as the input array.

Elements:
  - Value_0:
      Property: Integer value 0.
      Behavior: Remains unchanged in the output at the same index.
      Role: Acts as a boundary for sequences of 2s.
  - Value_2:
      Property: Integer value 2.
      Behavior: Can either remain 2 or change to 8.
      Role: Forms contiguous subsequences (runs) between 0s or array boundaries.
  - Value_8:
      Property: Integer value 8.
      Behavior: Appears only in the output array.
      Origin: Replaces a 2 from the input array based on a rule.
  - Sequence_of_2s:
      Property: A contiguous subarray containing only the integer 2.
      Property: Length (L).
      Relationship: Bounded by 0s or the start/end of the main array.
      Action: Triggers transformation of some of its trailing 2s to 8s.

TransformationRule:
  Action: Iterate through the input array to identify all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of the integer 2.
  Initialize: Create an output array as a copy of the input array.
  For_Each_Sequence:
    - Input: A sequence of 2s starting at index `start_idx` with length `L`.
    - Calculate: Number of elements to change `N = (L + (1 if L is even else 0)) // 2`. (Integer division).
    - Calculate: Index where changes start `change_start_idx = start_idx + L - N`.
    - Modify: In the output array, change the elements from index `change_start_idx` up to (but not including) `start_idx + L` to the integer 8.
  Other_Elements: Elements 0 and any 2s not part of the last N elements of a sequence remain unchanged in the output array.
  Iteration_Control: Ensure the main iteration index advances past the currently processed sequence of 2s to avoid reprocessing.
