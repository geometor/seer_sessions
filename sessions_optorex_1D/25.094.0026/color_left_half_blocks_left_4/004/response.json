            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format and the format the `transform` function was designed for. The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly shows the function received a NumPy array instead of the anticipated space-separated string.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the approach to directly process NumPy arrays. Eliminate the string splitting step.\n2.  **Adapt Logic:** Re-implement the sequence detection and modification logic to work with array indexing and slicing on NumPy arrays.\n3.  **Maintain Core Rule:** The underlying rule of identifying contiguous sequences of '2's and changing a calculated number of trailing '2's to '8's based on sequence length appears consistent with the examples and should be preserved.\n4.  **Verify Data Types:** Ensure the code operates on the numerical values (0, 2, 8) within the array, not string representations ('0', '2', '8').\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nSince the previous code failed during input processing (`split`), no meaningful metrics regarding the transformation logic itself could be gathered from the failed execution.\n\n**Analysis based on Error Message and Task Description:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Confirmed to be `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Element Type:** Based on the examples, the arrays contain integers (0 and 2).\n*   **Output Type:** Should also be a `numpy.ndarray` containing integers (0, 2, and 8).\n*   **Array Dimensionality:** The examples suggest 1-dimensional arrays.\n*   **Core Logic Validity:** The identified pattern of changing the end of '2' sequences based on length `L` using the formula `num_changes = (L + (L % 2 == 0)) // 2` seems consistent with all provided input/output pairs. The failure was purely an implementation error related to data type handling.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
