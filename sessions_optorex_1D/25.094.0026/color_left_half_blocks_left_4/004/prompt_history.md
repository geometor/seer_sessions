Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single strings representing sequences of digits.
2.  **Digits:** The digits involved are '0', '2', and '8'. The input only contains '0' and '2'. The output contains '0', '2', and '8'.
3.  **Length:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.
4.  **'0' Behavior:** The digit '0' seems to act as a separator or boundary. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
5.  **'2' Behavior:** The digit '2' can either remain '2' or change to '8'.
6.  **'8' Origin:** The digit '8' only appears in the output and always originates from a '2' in the input.
7.  **Transformation Pattern:** The change from '2' to '8' appears dependent on the position of the '2' within a *contiguous sequence* of '2's. Specifically, it affects the '2's at the end of such sequences.

Let's analyze the sequences of '2's and how many at the end change:

*   `2 2` (Length 2) -> `2 8` (1 change) - Examples: train_2, train_6, train_7
*   `2 2 2` (Length 3) -> `2 2 8` (1 change) - Examples: train_1, train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5
*   `2 2 2 2` (Length 4) -> `2 2 8 8` (2 changes) - Examples: train_4, train_7
*   `2 2 2 2 2` (Length 5) -> `2 2 2 8 8` (2 changes) - Example: train_5
*   `2 2 2 2 2 2` (Length 6) -> `2 2 2 8 8 8` (3 changes) - Example: train_1
*   `2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (Length 7) -> `2 2 2 2 8 8 8` (3 changes) - Example: train_3

The number of '2's changing to '8' at the end of a sequence of length `L` seems to follow the pattern:
`num_changes = (L + (L % 2 == 0)) // 2`
(Where `//` is integer division, `%` is modulo, and `(L % 2 == 0)` evaluates to 1 if L is even, 0 if L is odd).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Transform a sequence of digits based on contiguous subsequences.

Input:
  Type: String
  Content: Sequence of digits '0' and '2'.
  Role: Initial state.

Output:
  Type: String
  Content: Sequence of digits '0', '2', and '8'.
  Role: Transformed state.
  Constraint: Same length as input.

Elements:
  - Digit_0:
      Property: Value is 0.
      Behavior: Remains unchanged in the output at the same position.
      Role: Acts as a boundary for sequences of '2's.
  - Digit_2:
      Property: Value is 2.
      Behavior: Can either remain '2' or change to '8'.
      Role: Forms contiguous sequences between '0's or sequence boundaries.
  - Digit_8:
      Property: Value is 8.
      Behavior: Appears only in the output.
      Origin: Replaces a '2' from the input based on a rule.
  - Sequence_of_2s:
      Property: A contiguous subsequence containing only '2's.
      Property: Length (L).
      Relationship: Bounded by '0's or the start/end of the main sequence.
      Action: Triggers transformation of some of its '2's to '8's.

TransformationRule:
  Action: Identify all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of '2's.
  For_Each_Sequence:
    - Input: Sequence of '2's of length L.
    - Calculate: Number of changes `N = (L + (L % 2 == 0)) // 2`.
    - Modify: Change the last N digits '2' in that sequence to '8'.
  Other_Digits: Digits '0' and any '2's not part of the last N elements of a sequence remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right using an index.
3.  If the digit at the current index is '0', copy it to the output and move to the next index.
4.  If the digit at the current index is '2':
    a.  Determine the length (`L`) of the contiguous sequence of '2's starting at the current index.
    b.  Calculate the number of '2's to change at the end of this sequence: `num_changes = (L + (L is even)) // 2`. (Where `(L is even)` is 1 if L is even, 0 otherwise).
    c.  Copy the first `L - num_changes` '2's of this sequence directly to the output.
    d.  Copy the remaining `num_changes` '2's as '8's to the output.
    e.  Advance the index by `L` positions to move past the processed sequence.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
6.  Return the final output sequence.
