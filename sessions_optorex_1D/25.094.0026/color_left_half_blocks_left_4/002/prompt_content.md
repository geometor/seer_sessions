"""
Transforms a sequence of digits ('0', '2') based on contiguous subsequences of '2's.
Identifies maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of '2's.
For each sequence of '2's with length L, calculates the number of changes N = (L + (L is even)) // 2.
Changes the last N digits '2' in that sequence to '8'.
Digits '0' and any '2's not part of the last N elements of a sequence remain unchanged.
