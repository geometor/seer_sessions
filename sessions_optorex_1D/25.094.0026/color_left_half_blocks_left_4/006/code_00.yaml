Task: Transform a 1D sequence of integers based on contiguous subsequences.

Input_Format:
  Type: 1D NumPy array
  Element_Type: Integer
  Allowed_Values: 0, 2
  Role: Represents the initial state of a sequence.

Output_Format:
  Type: 1D NumPy array
  Element_Type: Integer
  Allowed_Values: 0, 2, 8
  Role: Represents the transformed state of the sequence.
  Constraint: Must have the same length as the input array.

Core_Objects:
  - Element_0:
      Value: 0
      Behavior: Remains unchanged in the output at the same position.
      Role: Acts as a boundary or separator for sequences of 2s.
  - Element_2:
      Value: 2
      Behavior: Can either remain 2 or be transformed to 8 based on position within a sequence.
      Role: Forms contiguous sequences.
  - Element_8:
      Value: 8
      Behavior: Appears only in the output.
      Origin: Replaces an Element_2 from the input according to the transformation rule.
  - Sequence_of_2s:
      Definition: A maximal contiguous subsequence within the input array containing only the value 2.
      Property: Length (L).
      Relationship: Bounded by Element_0 or the start/end boundaries of the main array.
      Action_Trigger: Its presence and length determine the transformation within it.

Transformation_Rule:
  Scope: Applied independently to each maximal contiguous Sequence_of_2s.
  Input_Per_Sequence: Sequence_of_2s of length L.
  Calculation:
    - Determine_Parity: Check if L is even or odd.
    - Parity_Bonus: Add 1 if L is even, 0 if L is odd.
    - Calculate_Changes (N): N = (L + Parity_Bonus) // 2 (integer division).
  Modification:
    - Identify: The last N elements within the current Sequence_of_2s in the array.
    - Change_Value: Replace the value of these last N elements from 2 to 8 in the output array.
  No_Change_Condition: All Element_0 and any Element_2 not part of the last N elements of any Sequence_of_2s remain unchanged.
