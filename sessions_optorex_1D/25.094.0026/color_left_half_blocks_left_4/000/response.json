The input only contains '0' and '2'. The output contains '0', '2', and '8'.\n3.  **Length:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.\n4.  **'0' Behavior:** The digit '0' seems to act as a separator or boundary. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.\n5.  **'2' Behavior:** The digit '2' can either remain '2' or change to '8'.\n6.  **'8' Origin:** The digit '8' only appears in the output and always originates from a '2' in the input.\n7.  **Transformation Pattern:** The change from '2' to '8' appears dependent on the position of the '2' within a *contiguous sequence* of '2's. Specifically, it affects the '2's at the end of such sequences.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences of '2's and how many at the end change:\n\n*   `2 2` (Length 2) -> `2 8` (1 change) - Examples: train_2, train_6, train_7\n*   `2 2 2` (Length 3) -> `2 2 8` (1 change) - Examples: train_1, train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5\n*   `2 2 2 2` (Length 4) -> `2 2 8 8` (2 changes) - Examples: train_4, train_7\n*   `2 2 2 2 2` (Length 5) -> `2 2 2 8 8` (2 changes) - Example: train_5\n*   `2 2 2 2 2 2` (Length 6) -> `2 2 2 8 8 8` (3 changes) - Example: train_1\n*   `2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (Length 7) -> `2 2 2 2 8 8 8` (3 changes) - Example: train_3\n\nThe number of '2's changing to '8' at the end of a sequence of length `L` seems to follow the pattern:\n`num_changes = (L + (L % 2 == 0)) // 2`\n(Where `//` is integer division, `%` is modulo, and `(L % 2 == 0)` evaluates to 1 if L is even, 0 if L is odd).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
