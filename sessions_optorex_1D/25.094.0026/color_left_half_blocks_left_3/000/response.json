            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is always equal to the length of the output sequence (12 in these examples).\n3.  **Digits:** The input sequences contain only the digits `0` and `2`. The output sequences contain the digits `0`, `2`, and `8`.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation primarily involves changing some occurrences of the digit `2` in the input sequence to the digit `8` in the output sequence. The digit `0` always remains `0`.\n5.  **Pattern:** The change from `2` to `8` does not happen for every `2`. It seems dependent on the context, specifically on consecutive runs of `2`s. Observing the examples, within a continuous block (run) of `2`s, the latter part of the block tends to be converted to `8`s.\n6.  **Run Analysis:** Let's analyze the runs of `2`s:\n    *   A run of length `L`.\n    *   If `L=1`, the `2` remains `2`. (Example: `train_1`, index 8: `0 2 0` -> `0 2 0`). This is implicitly covered by the rule below, but good to note.\n    *   If `L=2`, the run `2 2` becomes `2 8`. (Example: `train_4`, indices 1,2: `0 2 2 0` -> `0 2 8 0`). Keep 1, change 1.\n    *   If `L=3`, the run `2 2 2` becomes `2 2 8`. (Example: `train_1`, indices 8,9,10: `0 2 2 2 0` -> `0 2 2 8 0`). Keep 2, change 1.\n    *   If `L=4`, the run `2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 8 8`. (Example: `train_3`, indices 1,2,3,4: `0 2 2 2 2 0` -> `0 2 2 8 8 0`). Keep 2, change 2.\n    *   If `L=8`, the run `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8`. (Example: `train_5`, indices 4-11). Keep 4, change 4.\n7.  **Rule Derivation:** For a run of `L` consecutive `2`s, the first `ceil(L/2)` elements remain `2`, and the last `floor(L/2)` elements are changed to `8`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
