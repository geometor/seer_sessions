Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    elements: [0, 2] for input, [0, 2, 8] for output
    length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)

Objects:
  - name: sequence_element
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 2, or 8)
      - index: integer (position in sequence)
  - name: run_of_twos
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: integer (number of consecutive '2's)
    definition: A contiguous subsequence containing only the value 2.

Relationships:
  - sequence_element `belongs_to` sequence
  - sequence_element `precedes` another sequence_element
  - run_of_twos `is_part_of` sequence
  - output sequence `is_derived_from` input sequence

Actions:
  - name: transform
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Identify runs of consecutive '2's in the input sequence.
      - For each run:
        - Calculate its length (L).
        - Determine the split point: keep first ceil(L/2) elements, change last floor(L/2) elements.
        - Modify the corresponding elements in the output sequence (change '2' to '8' for the latter part).
      - Copy '0' elements directly from input to output.
