Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous blocks (runs) consisting solely of the digit 2. A run ends when a 0 is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.\n2. For each identified run of 2s:\n   a. Determine the length of the run (L).\n   b. Calculate the number of elements at the end of this run that should be changed to 8. This number is floor(L / 2).\n   c. If this number is greater than zero, modify the output sequence by changing the value from 2 to 8 for the last floor(L / 2) positions occupied by this specific run. The first ceil(L / 2) elements of the run retain their value of 2.\n3. Elements that were originally 0 in the input sequence remain 0 at their corresponding positions in the output sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_runs_of_twos(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous runs of the value 2 in the sequence.\n    Yields tuples of (start_index, end_index, run_length).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(sequence)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        if sequence[i] == 2:\n            # Found the start of a potential run\n            start_index = i\n            j = i + 1\n            # Find the end of the run\n            while j < n and sequence[j] == 2:\n                j += 1\n            end_index = j - 1 # Inclusive end index\n            run_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n            yield (start_index, end_index, run_length)\n            # Move the main iterator past the processed run\n            i = j\n        else:\n            # If not 2, move to the next element\n            i += 1\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid (1D array).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a NumPy array for consistent handling\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = input_array.copy()\n    \n    # Find all runs of '2's in the input array\n    runs = find_runs_of_twos(input_array)\n    \n    # Process each run to potentially change elements to '8'\n    for start_index, end_index, run_length in runs:\n        # Calculate the number of elements to change to '8'\n        # This is the integer part of L / 2, or floor(L / 2)\n        num_to_change = math.floor(run_length / 2)\n        \n        # If there are elements to change\n        if num_to_change > 0:\n            # Calculate the starting index within the sequence for the change\n            change_start_index = end_index - num_to_change + 1\n            \n            # Update the output grid by changing the relevant '2's to '8's\n            # Slicing works directly on NumPy arrays\n            output_grid[change_start_index : end_index + 1] = 8\n            \n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid.tolist() # Convert back to list if needed, assuming original format was list-like\n\n```"
