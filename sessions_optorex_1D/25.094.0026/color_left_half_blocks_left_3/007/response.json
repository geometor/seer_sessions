Identify contiguous runs (blocks) consisting solely of the integer 2 within the input sequence.\n2. For each identified run of 2s:\n   a. Determine the length of the run (L).\n   b. Calculate the number of elements at the end of this run that should be changed to 8. This number is floor(L / 2).\n   c. If this number is greater than zero, modify the corresponding positions in the output sequence by changing the value from 2 to 8 for the last floor(L / 2) elements of the run. The first ceil(L / 2) elements of the run remain 2.\n3. Elements that were originally 0 in the input sequence remain 0 in the output sequence.\nThe output sequence will contain integers 0, 2, and 8.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math\n# Using standard libraries only\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid (1D list).\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of integers (0s and 2s).
