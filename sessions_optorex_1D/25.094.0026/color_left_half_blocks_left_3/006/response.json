            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code execution resulted in identical errors (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") across all examples. This error typically arises when a boolean condition is evaluated on a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values, rather than a single True/False value. Given that the transformation logic derived (identifying runs of '2's and modifying the latter half) appears consistent with all input/output pairs when viewed as 1D sequences, the error likely stems from an unexpected input format provided by the execution environment (e.g., a 1D NumPy array or even a 2D array with one row being treated in a way that confuses standard boolean checks) rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Assume 1D Sequence:** Maintain the hypothesis that the core logic operates on a 1D sequence, as this aligns with the visual examples and the derived rule.\n2.  **Input Handling:** Modify the code to explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs by converting the input to a standard Python list at the beginning. This should ensure the subsequent indexing and comparison operations (`input_list[i] == 2`) work as intended for scalar values.\n3.  **Refine Terminology:** Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to consistently refer to the data structure as a \"sequence\" or \"list\" rather than potentially ambiguous terms like \"grid\".\n4.  **Verify Logic:** Re-verify the run-detection and modification logic (`floor(L/2)` elements changed) against the examples. The logic appears sound and correctly explains all provided training cases.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the assumption of 1D sequences:\n\n| Example   | Input Length | Output Length | # Runs of 2s | Run Details (Length -> Output Modification) | Correctly Explained by Rule? |\n| :-------- | :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |\n| `train_1` | 12           | 12            | 2            | `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) <br> `2 2 2` (L=3) -> Change 1 (`2 2 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_2` | 12           | 12            | 3            | `2 2 2` (L=3) -> Change 1 (`2 2 8`) <br> `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) <br> `2 2 2` (L=3) -> Change 1 (`2 2 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_3` | 12           | 12            | 2            | `2 2 2 2` (L=4) -> Change 2 (`2 2 8 8`) <br> `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_4` | 12           | 12            | 2            | `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) <br> `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_5` | 12           | 12            | 2            | `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) <br> `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2` (L=8) -> Change 4 (`2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_6` | 12           | 12            | 2            | `2 2 2` (L=3) -> Change 1 (`2 2 8`) <br> `2 2 2 2` (L=4) -> Change 2 (`2 2 8 8`) | Yes                          |\n| `train_7` | 12           | 12            | 3            | `2 2 2 2` (L=4) -> Change 2 (`2 2 8 8`) <br> `2 2 2` (L=3) -> Change 1 (`2 2 8`) <br> `2 2` (L=2) -> Change 1 (`2 8`) | Yes                          |\n\nThe rule `floor(L/2)` correctly determines the number of elements to change to `8` at the end of each run of `2`s of length `L`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
