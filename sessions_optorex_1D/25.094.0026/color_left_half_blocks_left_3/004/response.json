            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the transformation rule identified: locate runs of consecutive '2's and change the last `floor(length / 2)` elements of each run to '8'. The code uses NumPy for array handling.\n\nThe consistent error across all examples, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\", strongly suggests an issue with how NumPy array elements are being compared within conditional statements (`if` or `while`). This typically happens when a comparison like `array_element == value` results in a boolean array instead of a single boolean, which Python cannot directly evaluate in a condition. This could stem from the input data being unexpectedly nested or multi-dimensional when converted to a NumPy array, or an error in indexing that retrieves a slice instead of a single element.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the core transformation logic against the examples. (The logic seems correct).\n2.  Identify the exact location of the faulty comparison. (Likely within the `find_runs_of_twos` function's conditions: `sequence[i] == 2` or `sequence[j] == 2`).\n3.  Hypothesize that the input format within the testing environment might interact poorly with `np.array()` or indexing, leading to non-scalar values being compared.\n4.  Rewrite the implementation using standard Python lists and loops, avoiding NumPy, to bypass the specific NumPy ambiguity error. This assumes the input can be treated as a standard 1D list of integers.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nWe cannot execute code here to get dynamic metrics. However, based on visual inspection and manual tracing:\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a 1D sequence (list) of integers (0s and 2s). Example: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]`\n*   **Output Format:** A 1D sequence (list) of integers (0s, 2s, and 8s). Example: `[0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 0]`\n*   **Sequence Length:** Constant (12) across all provided examples.\n*   **Transformation Rule Consistency:** The rule \"find runs of 2s of length L, change the last floor(L/2) elements to 8\" appears consistent across all 7 training examples.\n    *   `train_1`: Runs (2,2) -> (2,8); (2,2,2) -> (2,2,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_2`: Runs (2,2,2) -> (2,2,8); (2,2) -> (2,8); (2,2,2) -> (2,2,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_3`: Runs (2,2,2,2) -> (2,2,8,8); (2,2) -> (2,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_4`: Runs (2,2) -> (2,8); (2,2) -> (2,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_5`: Runs (2,2) -> (2,8); (2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2) -> (2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_6`: Runs (2,2,2) -> (2,2,8); (2,2,2,2) -> (2,2,8,8) -> Correct.\n    *   `train_7`: Runs (2,2,2,2) -> (2,2,8,8); (2,2,2) -> (2,2,8); (2,2) -> (2,8) -> Correct.\n*   **Error Cause:** The NumPy ambiguity error implies that a comparison intended to yield a single True/False (e.g., `is this element equal to 2?`) is instead yielding multiple True/False values (a boolean array). This points to the variable being compared (likely `sequence[i]` or `sequence[j]`) not being a scalar integer as expected.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
