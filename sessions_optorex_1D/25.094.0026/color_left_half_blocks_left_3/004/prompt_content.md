"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or 1D array) of 0s and 2s into an output sequence of 0s, 2s, and 8s based on the following rule:
1. Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous blocks (runs) consisting solely of the digit 2. A run ends when a 0 is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.
2. For each identified run of 2s:
   a. Determine the length of the run (L).
   b. Calculate the number of elements at the end of this run that should be changed to 8. This number is floor(L / 2).
   c. If this number is greater than zero, modify the output sequence by changing the value from 2 to 8 for the last floor(L / 2) positions occupied by this specific run. The first ceil(L / 2) elements of the run retain their value of 2.
3. Elements that were originally 0 in the input sequence remain 0 at their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
