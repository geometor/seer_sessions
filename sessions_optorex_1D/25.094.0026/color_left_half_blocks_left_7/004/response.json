            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: a digit '2' is replaced by '8' if the immediately preceding digit is also '2'. The provided Python code implements this logic. However, the code consistently fails across all examples with a `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, numpy.ndarray found`. This error occurs during the `' '.join()` operation within the `format_output` function, which is called at the end of the `transform` function.\n\nThis suggests that the list `output_digits` being passed to `' '.join()` does not contain only Python strings as expected. It might contain NumPy data types (like `np.str_` or even inadvertently a NumPy array object) which are incompatible with the standard `str.join()` method.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Transformation Logic:** Re-verify the rule ('2' follows '2' -> second '2' becomes '8') against all examples. This rule appears consistent and correct.\n2.  **Address Type Error:** The primary focus is resolving the `TypeError`. The solution will involve ensuring that all elements appended to the `output_digits` list within the `transform` function are explicitly converted to standard Python strings before the `format_output` function is called or modify the join operation to handle potential NumPy types.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input type (NumPy array of string-like elements) and the transformation rule, emphasizing the type handling required for the output formatting.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Input Format:** All inputs are sequences of digits represented as strings within a 1D NumPy array.\n*   **Output Format:** All outputs are single strings with digits separated by spaces.\n*   **Digits:** Input uses '0', '2'. Output uses '0', '2', '8'.\n*   **Rule Consistency:** The rule \"replace '2' with '8' if preceded by '2'\" holds true for all 7 training examples. The first element is never changed. '0's are never changed. Only '2's are potentially changed.\n*   **Error Consistency:** The `TypeError` is identical for all examples, pointing to a systematic issue in how the output list is constructed or joined, likely related to the interaction between NumPy types and standard Python string operations.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
