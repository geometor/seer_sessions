Task: Sequence Transformation (NumPy Array Input)

Input_Type: numpy.ndarray
Output_Type: str

Elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: A 1D NumPy array containing strings, where each string is a single digit ('0' or '2').
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[str]
    description: A list of strings representing the transformed digits ('0', '2', or '8').
  - name: digit
    type: str
    properties:
      - value: '0', '2', or '8'
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)

Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A digit (string) at index 'i' is adjacent to the digit at index 'i-1' (preceding) and 'i+1' (succeeding) within the NumPy array.

Actions:
  - name: iterate
    description: Traverse the input NumPy array from the second element (index 1) to the end.
  - name: compare_adjacent
    description: Compare the string value of the current element with the string value of the immediately preceding element in the array.
  - name: replace_digit
    description: Change the string value of an element in the output list based on a condition.
  - name: copy_digit
    description: Keep the string value of an element unchanged when adding to the output list.
  - name: format_output
    description: Join the elements of the processed list of strings into a single space-separated string.

Conditions for Transformation:
  - An element at index 'i' (where i > 0) is transformed if:
    - Its string value is '2'.
    - The string value of the element at index 'i-1' is also '2'.
  - If the condition is met, the corresponding element added to the output list is '8'.
  - Otherwise, the element's original string value from the input array is added to the output list.
  - The element at index 0 is never transformed and is copied directly to the output list.
