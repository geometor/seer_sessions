**General Assessment:**

The core transformation logic identified previously appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs: a '2' is changed to an '8' if and only if it is immediately preceded by another '2'. The first element is never changed.

The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]`) strongly suggest an issue with how the input data is being handled *before* or *during* the call to the `transform` function within the testing environment. The function signature `transform(input_array: np.ndarray) -> str` correctly anticipates a NumPy array, but the error indicates that either the input being passed is not a NumPy array as expected, or some intermediate step (possibly within the test harness itself, outside the provided `transform` code) is incorrectly attempting to convert the string representation of the entire array into an integer.

Since the provided `transform` code correctly handles a NumPy array input and implements the observed logic, the strategy is to proceed with the assumption that the `transform` function *should* receive a NumPy array. We will verify the transformation logic itself against the examples.

**Metrics:**

We will simulate the intended transformation logic on each input string to verify its correctness against the expected output.

Overall Assessment (New Logic):
Does the new logic consistently produce the *provided* outputs? True

```
**Assessment and Strategy Update:**

The initial hypothesis ("change '2' to '8' if preceded by '2'") did not match the provided outputs for most examples. The metric generation revealed discrepancies.

Analysis of the discrepancies led to a new hypothesis:
1.  Identify contiguous blocks (sequences) of the digit '2'.
2.  For each block of length N, change the last `floor(N/2)` digits in that block from '2' to '8'. (`floor(N/2)` is equivalent to integer division `N // 2`).

The `tool_code` execution confirmed that this new hypothesis correctly reproduces *all* the provided training outputs. Therefore, the YAML facts and natural language program will be updated based on this revised understanding. The input format is still assumed to be a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) of digit strings.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation by Block Modification

Elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[String] or numpy.ndarray[String]
    description: A sequence of single digits represented as strings.
  - name: digit
    type: String
    properties:
      - value: '0', '2', or '8'
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)
  - name: block
    type: Subsequence
    description: A contiguous subsequence consisting solely of the digit '2'.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The index immediately after the block ends.
      - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index).

Relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: Digits belonging to the same block are adjacent in the sequence.
  - type: separation
    description: Blocks are separated by digits other than '2' (e.g., '0') or the sequence boundaries.

Actions:
  - name: scan_sequence
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify elements and structures.
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Detect contiguous subsequences composed entirely of '2's.
  - name: calculate_modification_count
    description: For a block of length N, determine the number of digits to change (floor(N/2)).
  - name: modify_block_end
    description: Change the value of the specified number of digits at the end of a block from '2' to '8'.
  - name: copy_sequence
    description: Create an initial copy of the input sequence for modification.
  - name: copy_digit
    description: Keep the value of digits not part of the modification unchanged ('0's and the initial '2's in blocks).

Conditions for Transformation:
  - A digit at position 'i' is transformed if:
    - It is part of a contiguous block of '2's.
    - Let the block start at index 's' and end just before index 'e' (length N = e - s).
    - Let the number of digits to change be M = floor(N / 2).
    - The digit's position 'i' satisfies `e - M <= i < e`.
  - If the condition is met, the digit's value becomes '8'.
  - Otherwise, the digit's value remains the same as in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digit strings.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence (e.g., a list) to serve as the initial output sequence.
3.  Initialize a pointer `i` to the start of the sequence (index 0).
4.  While `i` is less than the length of the sequence:
    a.  Check the digit at index `i`.
    b.  If the digit is not '2', increment `i` and continue to the next iteration (go back to step 4).
    c.  If the digit is '2', find the end of the contiguous block of '2's starting at `i`. Let this block end just before index `j`.
    d.  Calculate the length of the block: `N = j - i`.
    e.  Calculate the number of '2's to change to '8': `M = N // 2` (integer division for floor).
    f.  Iterate from index `k = j - M` up to (but not including) `j`:
        i. Change the digit at index `k` in the output sequence to '8'.
    g.  Update the pointer `i` to `j` (to move past the processed block).
5.  Join the elements of the modified output sequence with spaces to form the final output string.
