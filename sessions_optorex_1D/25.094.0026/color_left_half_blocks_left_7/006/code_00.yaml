Task: Sequence Transformation by Block Modification

Elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[String] or numpy.ndarray[String]
    description: A sequence of single digits represented as strings.
  - name: digit
    type: String
    properties:
      - value: '0', '2', or '8'
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)
  - name: block
    type: Subsequence
    description: A contiguous subsequence consisting solely of the digit '2'.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The index immediately after the block ends.
      - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index).

Relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: Digits belonging to the same block are adjacent in the sequence.
  - type: separation
    description: Blocks are separated by digits other than '2' (e.g., '0') or the sequence boundaries.

Actions:
  - name: scan_sequence
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify elements and structures.
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Detect contiguous subsequences composed entirely of '2's.
  - name: calculate_modification_count
    description: For a block of length N, determine the number of digits to change (floor(N/2)).
  - name: modify_block_end
    description: Change the value of the specified number of digits at the end of a block from '2' to '8'.
  - name: copy_sequence
    description: Create an initial copy of the input sequence for modification.
  - name: copy_digit
    description: Keep the value of digits not part of the modification unchanged ('0's and the initial '2's in blocks).

Conditions for Transformation:
  - A digit at position 'i' is transformed if:
    - It is part of a contiguous block of '2's.
    - Let the block start at index 's' and end just before index 'e' (length N = e - s).
    - Let the number of digits to change be M = floor(N / 2).
    - The digit's position 'i' satisfies `e - M <= i < e`.
  - If the condition is met, the digit's value becomes '8'.
  - Otherwise, the digit's value remains the same as in the input.
