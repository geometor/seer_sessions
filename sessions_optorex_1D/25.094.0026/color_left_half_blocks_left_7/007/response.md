"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of digit strings based on the following rule:
1. Identify contiguous blocks (sequences) of the digit '2'.
2. For each block of length N, change the last floor(N/2) digits 
   in that block from '2' to '8'.
3. Digits '0' and the initial '2's within a block (those not part of the 
   last floor(N/2)) remain unchanged.
The input is expected as a 1D NumPy array of strings, and the output is a 
single string with elements joined by spaces.
