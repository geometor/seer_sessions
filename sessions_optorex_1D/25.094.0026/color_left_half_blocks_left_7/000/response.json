The positions of '0's also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core change involves replacing some occurrences of the digit '2' with the digit '8'.\n5.  **Conditional Change:** Observing the examples, a '2' seems to be replaced by an '8' only when it is immediately preceded by another '2'. The first '2' in such a pair remains unchanged, while the subsequent '2'(s) change to '8'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
