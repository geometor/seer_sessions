Task: Sequence Transformation

Elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[Integer]
    description: A sequence of single digits.
  - name: digit
    type: Integer
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)

Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A digit at position 'i' is adjacent to the digit at position 'i-1' (preceding) and 'i+1' (succeeding).

Actions:
  - name: iterate
    description: Traverse the input sequence from left to right (index 1 onwards).
  - name: compare_adjacent
    description: Compare the value of the current digit with the value of the immediately preceding digit.
  - name: replace_digit
    description: Change the value of a digit based on a condition.
  - name: copy_digit
    description: Keep the value of a digit unchanged.

Conditions for Transformation:
  - A digit at position 'i' (where i > 0) is transformed if:
    - Its value is 2.
    - The value of the digit at position 'i-1' is also 2.
  - If the condition is met, the digit's value becomes 8.
  - Otherwise, the digit's value remains the same as in the input.
  - The digit at position 0 is never transformed.
