The digit 8 appears only in the output.\n3.  **Observed Changes:** The digit 0 always remains 0. The digit 2 sometimes remains 2 and sometimes changes to 8.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change from 2 to 8 depends on the *grouping* or *runs* of consecutive 2s. Examining the examples reveals that within a contiguous block of `N` twos, the last `floor(N/2)` twos are converted to 8s. The beginning part of the block of twos remains unchanged. Zeros act as separators for these blocks of twos.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
