Objects:
  - name: IntegerSequence
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (0 or 2 for input, 0, 2, or 8 for output)
      - length: integer
  - name: RunOfTwos
    properties:
      - elements: list containing only the integer 2
      - length: integer (N)
      - start_index: integer (position in the main sequence)
      - end_index: integer (position in the main sequence)
Relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: RunOfTwos
    object: IntegerSequence
    details: Runs of Twos are contiguous subsequences within the IntegerSequence.
  - type: separation
    element: integer 0
    function: Acts as a boundary, separating potential RunsOfTwos.
Actions:
  - name: IdentifyRuns
    input: IntegerSequence
    output: List of RunOfTwos objects (including their lengths and indices)
    description: Scan the sequence to find consecutive blocks of the digit 2.
  - name: CalculateModificationCount
    input: RunOfTwos
    output: integer (count)
    description: For a run of length N, calculate floor(N / 2).
  - name: ModifySequence
    input:
      - IntegerSequence (original)
      - RunOfTwos
      - ModificationCount (k)
    output: IntegerSequence (modified)
    description: Change the value from 2 to 8 for the last 'k' elements within the identified RunOfTwos in the sequence. Apply this for all identified runs.
