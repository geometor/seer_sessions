Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers (specifically 0 and 2 in the input, 0, 2, and 8 in the output), represented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Core Elements:** The significant digits are 0 and 2. The digit 8 appears only in the output.
3.  **Observed Changes:** The digit 0 always remains 0. The digit 2 sometimes remains 2 and sometimes changes to 8.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change from 2 to 8 depends on the *grouping* or *runs* of consecutive 2s. Examining the examples reveals that within a contiguous block of `N` twos, the last `floor(N/2)` twos are converted to 8s. The beginning part of the block of twos remains unchanged. Zeros act as separators for these blocks of twos.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence (or work on a copy of the input sequence).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous runs (subsequences) consisting solely of the digit `2`. Note the starting index and the length (`N`) of each run.
3.  For each identified run of `2`s with length `N` starting at index `start_idx`:
    a.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `k = floor(N / 2)`.
    b.  If `k > 0`, change the value of the elements in the sequence from index `start_idx + N - k` to `start_idx + N - 1` (inclusive) from `2` to `8`.
4.  Ensure all elements not part of the last `k` elements of a run (including zeros and the initial `2`s in longer runs) retain their original values.
5.  Return the modified sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the previous code expected a string input but received a NumPy array during testing. The core transformation logic, however, appears sound based on the initial analysis and visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is:
1.  **Confirm Logic:** Verify the identified transformation rule (changing the last `floor(N/2)` elements of each run of `N` twos to 8s) against all provided training examples. This involves simulating the logic on each input and comparing the result to the expected output.
2.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the program to accept the input as a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the confirmed logic and the correct input/output data types (sequences of integers).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's apply the transformation logic (conceptually, as the previous code failed on input type) to each training example to confirm its validity.

**Metric Analysis:** The simulation confirms that the previously identified logic correctly transforms the input to the expected output for all 7 training examples. The failure was solely due to the input type mismatch in the execution environment.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers.
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to serve as the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous runs (subsequences) consisting solely of the digit `2`. For each run, record its starting index (`start_idx`) and its length (`N`).
4.  For each identified run:
    a.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `k = floor(N / 2)`.
    b.  If `k` is greater than 0:
        i.  Determine the starting index for the modification: `change_start = start_idx + N - k`.
        ii. Iterate from `change_start` up to (but not including) `start_idx + N`.
        iii. In the output sequence copy, set the element at the current iteration index to `8`.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.
