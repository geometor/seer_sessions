Objects:
  - name: IntegerSequence
    properties:
      - elements: list or array of integers (input contains 0, 2; output contains 0, 2, 8)
      - length: integer
  - name: RunOfTwos
    properties:
      - elements: list containing only the integer 2
      - length: integer (N)
      - start_index: integer (position in the IntegerSequence)
      - end_index: integer (position in the IntegerSequence)
Relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: RunOfTwos
    object: IntegerSequence
    details: Runs of Twos are contiguous subsequences within the IntegerSequence, bounded by 0s or the sequence ends.
  - type: boundary
    element: integer 0
    function: Separates RunsOfTwos. Always maps to 0 in the output.
Actions:
  - name: IdentifyRunsOfTwos
    input: IntegerSequence (input sequence)
    output: List of RunOfTwos objects (or tuples representing start_index and length)
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the digit 2.
  - name: CalculateModificationCount
    input: RunOfTwos (specifically its length N)
    output: integer (k)
    description: Calculate k = floor(N / 2). This is the number of elements at the end of the run to modify.
  - name: ApplyTransformation
    input:
      - IntegerSequence (input sequence)
      - List of RunOfTwos (identified from the input)
    output: IntegerSequence (output sequence)
    description: Create a copy of the input sequence. For each identified RunOfTwos of length N starting at index `s`, if `k = floor(N / 2)` is greater than 0, change the values in the copied sequence from index `s + N - k` to `s + N - 1` (inclusive) from 2 to 8.
