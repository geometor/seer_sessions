"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
The sequence contains only 0s and 2s.
The transformation identifies contiguous runs of the digit 2. 
For each run of length N, it changes the last floor(N / 2) elements of that run from 2 to 8. 
Digits 0 and the initial elements of the runs of 2s (those not part of the last floor(N/2)) remain unchanged.
The output is the modified sequence of integers, formatted back into a space-separated string.
