Objects:
  - name: IntegerSequence
    properties:
      - elements: A sequence (list or array) of integers. Input contains only 0 and 2. Output contains 0, 2, and 8.
      - length: integer
  - name: RunOfTwos
    properties:
      - elements: A contiguous subsequence containing only the integer 2.
      - length: integer (N), N >= 1
      - start_index: integer (position in the parent IntegerSequence)
      - end_index: integer (position in the parent IntegerSequence)
Relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: RunOfTwos
    object: IntegerSequence
    details: RunsOfTwos are contiguous subsequences within the IntegerSequence.
  - type: boundary
    element: Integer 0
    function: Defines the boundaries between RunsOfTwos. Runs cannot span across a 0.
Actions:
  - name: IdentifyRunsOfTwos
    input: IntegerSequence
    output: List of RunOfTwos objects (including their lengths and start indices)
    description: Iterate through the sequence, identifying start and end points of contiguous blocks of the digit 2.
  - name: CalculateModificationCount
    input: RunOfTwos (specifically its length N)
    output: integer (k)
    description: Calculate k = floor(N / 2) using integer division (N // 2).
  - name: ApplyTransformation
    input:
      - IntegerSequence (original or copy)
      - List of RunOfTwos
    output: IntegerSequence (transformed)
    description: |
      For each identified RunOfTwos with length N and start index S:
      1. Calculate k = N // 2.
      2. If k > 0, modify the elements in the sequence from index (S + N - k) to (S + N - 1) by changing their value from 2 to 8.
      3. Elements with value 0 and the first (N - k) elements of any RunOfTwos remain unchanged.
