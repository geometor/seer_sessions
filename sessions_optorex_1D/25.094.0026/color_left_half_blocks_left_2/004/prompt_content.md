"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers (containing 0s and 2s).
It identifies contiguous runs of the digit 2. For each run of length N, 
it changes the last floor(N / 2) elements of that run from 2 to 8. 
Digits 0 and the initial elements of the runs of 2s (those not part of the last floor(N/2)) remain unchanged.
The output is the modified sequence of integers.
