Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers (specifically 0 and 2 in the input, 0, 2, and 8 in the output), represented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Core Elements:** The significant digits are 0 and 2. The digit 8 appears only in the output.
3.  **Observed Changes:** The digit 0 always remains 0. The digit 2 sometimes remains 2 and sometimes changes to 8.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change from 2 to 8 depends on the *grouping* or *runs* of consecutive 2s. Examining the examples reveals that within a contiguous block of `N` twos, the last `floor(N/2)` twos are converted to 8s. The beginning part of the block of twos remains unchanged. Zeros act as separators for these blocks of twos.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: IntegerSequence
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (0 or 2 for input, 0, 2, or 8 for output)
      - length: integer
  - name: RunOfTwos
    properties:
      - elements: list containing only the integer 2
      - length: integer (N)
      - start_index: integer (position in the main sequence)
      - end_index: integer (position in the main sequence)
Relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: RunOfTwos
    object: IntegerSequence
    details: Runs of Twos are contiguous subsequences within the IntegerSequence.
  - type: separation
    element: integer 0
    function: Acts as a boundary, separating potential RunsOfTwos.
Actions:
  - name: IdentifyRuns
    input: IntegerSequence
    output: List of RunOfTwos objects (including their lengths and indices)
    description: Scan the sequence to find consecutive blocks of the digit 2.
  - name: CalculateModificationCount
    input: RunOfTwos
    output: integer (count)
    description: For a run of length N, calculate floor(N / 2).
  - name: ModifySequence
    input:
      - IntegerSequence (original)
      - RunOfTwos
      - ModificationCount (k)
    output: IntegerSequence (modified)
    description: Change the value from 2 to 8 for the last 'k' elements within the identified RunOfTwos in the sequence. Apply this for all identified runs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence (or work on a copy of the input sequence).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous runs (subsequences) consisting solely of the digit `2`. Note the starting index and the length (`N`) of each run.
3.  For each identified run of `2`s with length `N` starting at index `start_idx`:
    a.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `k = floor(N / 2)`.
    b.  If `k > 0`, change the value of the elements in the sequence from index `start_idx + N - k` to `start_idx + N - 1` (inclusive) from `2` to `8`.
4.  Ensure all elements not part of the last `k` elements of a run (including zeros and the initial `2`s in longer runs) retain their original values.
5.  Return the modified sequence.
