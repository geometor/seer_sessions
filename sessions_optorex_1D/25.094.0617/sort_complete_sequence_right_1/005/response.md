```python
"""
Modifies elements in a 1D sequence of 12 integers based on the values at specific related indices in the input sequence.
The transformation involves two groups of indices: (1, 2, 3) and (4, 6).
It identifies a dominant non-zero digit (N) from the input.
If input[1] == N, output[1] becomes 0. If input[2] was 0, output[2] becomes N. If input[2] was not 0 but input[3] was 0, output[3] becomes N.
If input[4] == N, output[4] becomes 0. If input[6] was 0, output[6] becomes N.
Other elements remain unchanged.
