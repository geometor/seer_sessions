            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified by the execution results is a type mismatch. The previous code expected a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and used the `.split()` method, but the execution environment seems to be passing a NumPy array directly to the `transform` function. This caused the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. The core transformation logic derived from the initial analysis appears to correctly predict the output for all provided training examples based on manual verification. The strategy is to adapt the code to accept a NumPy array as input, eliminating the string parsing step, while keeping the transformation logic the same.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The previous execution failed due to input type errors, so no metrics could be gathered programmatically. However, manual analysis of the examples confirms:\n    *   **Input Type:** The actual input is likely a NumPy array of integers.\n    *   **Sequence Length:** All input/output sequences have a length of 12.\n    *   **Dominant Digit (N):** In each example, `N` is the first non-zero digit found in the input sequence (and usually the very first element).\n    *   **Transformation Loci:** Changes exclusively occur at indices 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   **Rule Consistency:** The rule identified (\"If input[i] == N, set output[i] = 0. If also input[j] == 0, set output[j] = N\" for pairs i,j = (1, 2) and (4, 6)) consistently explains the transformation from input to output in all 7 training examples. Example 4 shows the case where no conditions are met, resulting in no change. Examples 6 and 7 show cases where `input[i] == N` but `input[j] != 0`, resulting only in `output[i]` being set to 0.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
