"""
Modifies elements in a sequence based on values at specific index pairs.
Specifically, it processes two pairs of indices: (1, 2) and (4, 6). 
For each pair (i, j), if the element at index i equals the dominant non-zero digit N (usually found at index 0), the element at index i is set to 0 in the output. 
Additionally, if the element at index i was N and the element at index j was 0 in the input, the element at index j is set to N in the output. 
Other elements remain unchanged.
