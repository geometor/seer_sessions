Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of 12 single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences primarily consist of the digit '0' and one other unique non-zero digit (e.g., 3, 9, 4, 6, 8). Let's call this the "dominant digit" or "X".
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input sequence to produce the output sequence. Observing the examples, the *positions* of the non-zero digit X in the output appear constant across all examples, regardless of their positions in the input. The *value* of X in the output is determined by the value of X found in the input.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output consistently places the dominant digit X at indices 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (using 0-based indexing). All other positions (indices 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11) are filled with '0'.
