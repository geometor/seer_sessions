Task: DigitPatternReplacement
Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Shape: (12,)
  DataType: Integer (e.g., int64)
  Content: A sequence of 12 digits, containing zeros and potentially one unique non-zero digit (referred to as 'X').
Output:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: A fixed pattern where the dominant digit 'X' from the input occupies specific indices, and all other indices are '0'.
Transformation:
  Action: IdentifyDominantDigit
    Input: Input NumPy array
    Output: The unique non-zero digit 'X'. If the input contains only zeros, 'X' is considered '0'. If multiple unique non-zero digits exist (unexpected based on examples), the behavior is undefined by current examples but should ideally raise an error or handle predictably.
  Action: ConstructOutputPattern
    Parameters:
      - DominantDigit ('X')
      - FixedIndices: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
      - OutputLength: 12
    Process: Create a sequence of 12 zeros. Place the DominantDigit 'X' at each index specified in FixedIndices.
  Action: FormatOutput
    Input: The constructed sequence of 12 digits.
    Output: A string with digits separated by single spaces.
Constants:
  OutputLength: 12
  DominantDigitIndices: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
  ZeroDigitIndices: [1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11] # Derived from the above
