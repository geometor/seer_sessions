**General Assessment**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function expected a 1-dimensional NumPy array of shape `(12,)`, but the input provided was consistently a 2-dimensional array of shape `(1, 12)`. The core logic of identifying a "dominant" non-zero digit and placing it into a fixed pattern seems correct based on the visual comparison of input/output pairs.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle the `(1, 12)` input shape. This can be achieved by flattening the input array to `(12,)` before processing it. The underlying transformation rule definition remains unchanged.

**Metrics**

The primary metric revealed by the execution errors is the input data shape.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Simulate input based on the error messages and typical task format
# Example 1 Input: '3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0'
input_array_simulated = np.array([[3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print(f"Simulated Input Array Shape: {input_array_simulated.shape}")
print(f"Simulated Input Array Dimensions: {input_array_simulated.ndim}")

# Flatten the array to the expected shape
flattened_array = input_array_simulated.flatten()
print(f"Flattened Array Shape: {flattened_array.shape}")
print(f"Flattened Array Dimensions: {flattened_array.ndim}")
```
```
Simulated Input Array Shape: (1, 12)
Simulated Input Array Dimensions: 2
Flattened Array Shape: (12,)
Flattened Array Dimensions: 1

```
The metrics confirm the input array has shape `(1, 12)` and 2 dimensions. Flattening converts it to the desired `(12,)` shape with 1 dimension.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
Task: Replace digits in a sequence based on a fixed pattern derived from the input's dominant digit.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integer digits.
  Format_Representation: NumPy array of shape (1, 12).
  Properties:
    - Contains predominantly zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (let's call this 'X').
    - If no non-zero digits exist, 'X' is considered 0.
    - The positions of 'X' in the input sequence are variable and irrelevant to the output structure.

Output:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integer digits.
  Format_Representation: Space-separated string.
  Structure: Fixed pattern.
  Properties:
    - The digit 'X' (identified from the input) is placed at indices 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (0-based).
    - The digit '0' is placed at indices 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Identify the unique non-zero digit ('X') from the input sequence.
  Action: Construct a new sequence of 12 digits.
  Action: Populate the new sequence by placing 'X' at the fixed target indices [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] and '0' at all other indices.
  Action: Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.

Constants:
  - Sequence Length: 12
  - Target Indices for Dominant Digit: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
  - Target Indices for Zero: [1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11]
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of 12 digits (represented as a 1x12 NumPy array).
2.  Examine the input sequence to find the unique non-zero digit present; if only zeros are present, consider the unique digit to be 0. Let this digit be called 'X'.
3.  Create a new sequence of 12 digits, initially all zeros.
4.  Place the digit 'X' into the new sequence at indices 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
5.  Ensure all other indices (1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11) in the new sequence contain the digit 0.
6.  Convert the resulting sequence of 12 digits into a string format, with each digit separated by a single space.
