The core logic of identifying a \"dominant\" non-zero digit and placing it into a fixed pattern seems correct based on the visual comparison of input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle the `(1, 12)` input shape. This can be achieved by flattening the input array to `(12,)` before processing it. The underlying transformation rule definition remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe primary metric revealed by the execution errors is the input data shape.\n\n"
