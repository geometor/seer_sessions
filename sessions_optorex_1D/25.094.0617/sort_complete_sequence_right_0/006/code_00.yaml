Task: Replace digits in a sequence based on a fixed pattern derived from the input's dominant digit.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integer digits.
  Format_Representation: NumPy array of shape (1, 12).
  Properties:
    - Contains predominantly zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (let's call this 'X').
    - If no non-zero digits exist, 'X' is considered 0.
    - The positions of 'X' in the input sequence are variable and irrelevant to the output structure.

Output:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integer digits.
  Format_Representation: Space-separated string.
  Structure: Fixed pattern.
  Properties:
    - The digit 'X' (identified from the input) is placed at indices 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (0-based).
    - The digit '0' is placed at indices 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Identify the unique non-zero digit ('X') from the input sequence.
  Action: Construct a new sequence of 12 digits.
  Action: Populate the new sequence by placing 'X' at the fixed target indices [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] and '0' at all other indices.
  Action: Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.

Constants:
  - Sequence Length: 12
  - Target Indices for Dominant Digit: [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
  - Target Indices for Zero: [1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11]
