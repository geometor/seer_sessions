objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: The sequence of numbers produced as output.
  - name: sequence_element
    type: integer
    description: An individual number within a sequence.
  - name: target_position
    type: index
    value: 1 # (using 0-based indexing for the second element)
    description: The specific position in the sequence that is subject to modification.
  - name: replacement_value
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: The value used to replace the element at the target position.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the output sequence (equal to input length).
  - object: sequence_element
    property: value
    description: The numerical value of the element.
  - object: sequence_element
    property: position
    description: The index of the element within the sequence.

actions:
  - name: read_input
    description: Obtain the input sequence.
  - name: identify_target_element
    description: Locate the element at the target_position (index 1) in the input_sequence.
  - name: replace_element
    description: Change the value of the identified target element to the replacement_value (0).
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output_sequence by taking the input_sequence and applying the replacement.
  - name: format_output
    description: Present the output sequence as space-separated integers.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The element at index 1 is set to 0; all other elements remain unchanged.
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: Elements not at index 1 maintain their original value and position in the output sequence relative to the input sequence.
