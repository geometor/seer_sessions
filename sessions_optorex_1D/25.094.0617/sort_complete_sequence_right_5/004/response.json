            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the `transform` function assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1-dimensional NumPy array. The error message \"index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1\" strongly indicates that `input_grid` is actually a 2-dimensional NumPy array with a shape of `(1, N)`, where N is the number of integers in the input string (12 in the examples). The code attempted to access `output_grid[1]`, which refers to the second *row* (index 1 of axis 0). Since there is only one row (size 1 for axis 0), this access is invalid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Input Structure:** Confirm the assumption that the input is loaded as a 2D NumPy array with shape `(1, N)` using `tool_code`.\n2.  **Correct Array Indexing:** Modify the logic to access the element at the second *column* (index 1 of axis 1) within the *first row* (index 0 of axis 0). The correct index is `(0, 1)`.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Adjust the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the 2D array structure and the correct indexing `(0, 1)`.\n4.  **Add Robustness:** Ensure the code checks if the array has at least one row and at least two columns before attempting the modification.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
