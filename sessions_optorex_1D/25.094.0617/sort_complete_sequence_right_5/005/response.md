"""
Accept the input as a 2-dimensional NumPy array (grid) with shape `(1, N)`.
Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
Check if the grid has at least one row and at least two columns.
If the condition is met, modify the output grid by setting the value of the element
at row index 0 and column index 1 to 0.
Return the modified output grid.
