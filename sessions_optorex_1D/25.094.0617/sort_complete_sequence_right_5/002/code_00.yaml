objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray # Updated type
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input, structured as a NumPy array.
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray # Updated type
    description: The sequence of numbers produced as output, structured as a NumPy array.
  - name: array_element
    type: integer # Or potentially float depending on NumPy array dtype, but examples show integers
    description: An individual number within an array.
  - name: target_position
    type: index
    value: 1 # (using 0-based indexing for the second element)
    description: The specific index in the array that is subject to modification.
  - name: replacement_value
    type: integer # Or float matching array dtype
    value: 0
    description: The value used to replace the element at the target position.

properties:
  - object: input_array
    property: shape
    description: The dimensions of the input array (likely 1D).
  - object: input_array
    property: size
    description: The total number of elements in the input array.
  - object: input_array
    property: dtype
    description: The data type of the elements in the input array.
  - object: output_array
    property: shape
    description: The dimensions of the output array (same as input).
  - object: output_array
    property: size
    description: The total number of elements in the output array (same as input).
  - object: output_array
    property: dtype
    description: The data type of the elements in the output array (same as input).
  - object: array_element
    property: value
    description: The numerical value of the element.
  - object: array_element
    property: position
    description: The index of the element within the array.

actions:
  - name: receive_input_array
    description: Obtain the input NumPy array.
  - name: create_output_copy # Important for not modifying the original input in place unless intended
    description: Create a mutable copy of the input array.
  - name: identify_target_element
    description: Access the element at the target_position (index 1) in the copied array.
  - name: modify_element_value
    description: Change the value of the element at index 1 in the copied array to the replacement_value (0).
  - name: return_output_array
    description: Return the modified NumPy array.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_array
    to: output_array
    rule: The element at index 1 of the input array is set to 0 in the output array; all other elements retain their original values and positions.
  - type: positional_invariance
    description: Elements not at index 1 maintain their original value and position in the output array relative to the input array.
  - type: type_consistency
    description: The input and output are both NumPy arrays of the same shape and size.
