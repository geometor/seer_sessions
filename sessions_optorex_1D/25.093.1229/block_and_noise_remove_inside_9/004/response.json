This strongly suggests the testing environment provides the input as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`), while the code assumed a 1D list or array. The comparison `x != 0` within a list comprehension failed because `x` was an entire row array, not a single integer. The core logic (finding the non-zero span, identifying the most frequent digit within that span, and replacing the span with that digit) appears correct based on manual checks against the examples.\n\n*   **Strategy:** The primary fix involves modifying the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input. It should extract the relevant 1D sequence (likely the first row), apply the existing logic, and then format the output appropriately (likely returning a 2D NumPy array matching the input dimensions).\n\n*   **Metrics:** (Based on manual application of the intended logic)\n    *   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 1, 7, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. Non-zero span indices 1-8. Segment `[1, 7, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Dominant digit: 1. Output: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0]`. Non-zero span indices 3-9. Segment `[6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6]`. Dominant digit: 6. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3]`. Non-zero span indices 0-11. Segment `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3]`. Dominant digit: 3. Output: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 4:** Input `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Non-zero span indices 2-9. Segment `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2]`. Dominant digit: 2. Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 5:** Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5]`. Non-zero span indices 0-11. Segment `[5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5]`. Dominant digit: 5. Output: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 6:** Input `[5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Non-zero span indices 0-11. Segment `[5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Dominant digit: 5. Output: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Example 7:** Input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. Non-zero span indices 0-11. Segment `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. Dominant digit: 3. Output: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. Matches expected.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The algorithm logic is sound for all training examples. The implementation error was due to incorrect input type handling.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
