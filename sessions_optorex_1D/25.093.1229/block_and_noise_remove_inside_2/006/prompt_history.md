Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Structure:** The sequences appear to have a fixed length within each example pair, and the length is consistent across the provided training examples (length 12).
3.  **Key Feature:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a 'dominant' digit within a specific segment of the input sequence and replacing other digits within that segment with the dominant one.
4.  **Boundaries:** The digit '0' appears to act as a boundary marker. Leading and trailing '0's in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence. The core transformation happens *between* these boundary zeros (or on the entire sequence if no boundary zeros exist).
5.  **Dominant Digit:** The dominant digit within the active segment (between boundary '0's or the whole sequence) is the digit that occurs most frequently in that segment.
6.  **Transformation Action:** All digits within the active segment are replaced by the calculated dominant digit. Digits outside this segment (the boundary '0's) remain unchanged.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: list_of_integers
output_type: list_of_integers
input_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence
output_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence
  - length: same as input length
objects:
  - sequence: the list of input digits
  - boundary_zeros: leading and trailing zeros in the sequence
  - active_segment: the subsequence between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive)
  - dominant_digit: the most frequent digit within the active_segment
relationships:
  - boundary_zeros define the active_segment. If no non-zero elements exist, the sequence remains unchanged. If no boundary zeros exist, the active_segment is the entire sequence.
  - boundary_zeros are preserved in the output.
actions:
  - identify_boundaries: find the index of the first and last non-zero elements.
  - define_segment: extract the subsequence between the identified boundaries.
  - calculate_frequencies: count occurrences of each digit within the active_segment.
  - find_dominant: determine the digit with the highest frequency in the active_segment.
  - replace_segment: substitute all elements within the active_segment in the original sequence with the dominant_digit.
  - construct_output: combine the preserved boundary_zeros (if any) with the modified segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
3.  If no non-zero digits are found (the sequence consists entirely of zeros), return the input sequence unchanged.
4.  Define the "active segment" as the subsequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
5.  Count the frequency of each digit (1 through 9) within the active segment.
6.  Determine the "dominant digit", which is the digit with the highest frequency in the active segment. (Assume there will be a unique most frequent digit based on examples).
7.  Create the output sequence:
    a.  Copy the digits from the input sequence from the beginning up to (but not including) `start_index`.
    b.  Append the dominant digit repeated `(end_index - start_index + 1)` times.
    c.  Append the digits from the input sequence from `end_index + 1` to the end.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rules:
1. Identify the segment of the sequence bounded by the first and last non-zero digits (inclusive).
2. If the sequence contains only zeros, return it unchanged.
3. Find the digit (1-9) that appears most frequently within this segment (the "dominant digit").
4. Replace all digits within the identified segment with the dominant digit.
5. Digits outside the segment (leading/trailing zeros) remain unchanged.
