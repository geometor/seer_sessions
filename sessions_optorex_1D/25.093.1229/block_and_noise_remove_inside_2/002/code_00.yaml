task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: bytes (representing a space-separated string of digits)
output_type: string (space-separated string of digits)
input_properties:
  - format: space-separated single-digit integers (0-9)
  - encoding: utf-8 (assumed)
  - structure: linear sequence
output_properties:
  - format: space-separated single-digit integers (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence
  - length: same as input length
objects:
  - sequence: the list of input digits obtained after decoding and splitting the input string.
  - boundary_zeros: leading and trailing zeros in the sequence.
  - active_segment: the subsequence between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive). Identified by indices.
  - dominant_digit: the digit (1-9) that occurs most frequently within the active_segment. Ties are implicitly handled by `Counter.most_common(1)`.
relationships:
  - boundary_zeros define the active_segment. If no non-zero elements exist, the sequence remains unchanged. If no boundary zeros exist, the active_segment is the entire sequence.
  - boundary_zeros are preserved in their original positions in the output.
  - The length of the active_segment determines how many times the dominant_digit replaces original values.
actions:
  - decode_input: Convert input bytes to a string (e.g., using UTF-8 decoding).
  - parse_sequence: Split the decoded string by spaces and convert elements to integers.
  - identify_boundaries: Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`) and the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
  - handle_all_zeros: If no non-zero digits are found, return the original sequence (formatted as a string).
  - extract_segment: Get the sublist of digits from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
  - calculate_frequencies: Count occurrences of each digit within the active_segment.
  - find_dominant: Determine the digit with the highest frequency in the active_segment.
  - construct_output_list: Create a new list by concatenating:
      - the part of the original sequence before `start_index`.
      - the dominant_digit repeated for the length of the active_segment.
      - the part of the original sequence after `end_index`.
  - format_output: Join the elements of the output list with spaces to create the final output string.
