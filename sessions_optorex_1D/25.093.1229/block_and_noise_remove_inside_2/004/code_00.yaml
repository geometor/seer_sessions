task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: list_of_integers # Adjusted: Input is effectively a list/array of integers
output_type: list_of_integers # Output should also be a list/array of integers
input_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence (list or NumPy array)
output_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence (list or NumPy array)
  - length: same as input length
objects:
  - sequence: the input list/array of digits
  - boundary_indices: the start and end indices of the segment containing non-zero elements
  - active_segment: the sub-sequence between the boundary_indices (inclusive)
  - dominant_digit: the most frequent digit within the active_segment
relationships:
  - Boundary indices define the active_segment.
  - If no non-zero elements exist (start_index is -1), the sequence remains unchanged.
  - If boundary indices exist, elements outside these indices are preserved.
actions:
  - identify_boundaries: find the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`) and the last non-zero element (`end_index`) in the input sequence.
  - check_for_all_zeros: if `start_index` is -1, return the original sequence.
  - define_segment: extract the subsequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
  - calculate_frequencies: count occurrences of each digit within the active_segment.
  - find_dominant: determine the digit with the highest frequency in the active_segment.
  - construct_output: create a new sequence by:
      - taking elements from the original sequence before `start_index`.
      - appending the `dominant_digit` repeated `(end_index - start_index + 1)` times.
      - taking elements from the original sequence after `end_index`.
