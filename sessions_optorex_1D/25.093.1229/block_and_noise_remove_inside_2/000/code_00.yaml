task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: list_of_integers
output_type: list_of_integers
input_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence
output_properties:
  - element_type: single_digit_integer (0-9)
  - structure: linear sequence
  - length: same as input length
objects:
  - sequence: the list of input digits
  - boundary_zeros: leading and trailing zeros in the sequence
  - active_segment: the subsequence between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive)
  - dominant_digit: the most frequent digit within the active_segment
relationships:
  - boundary_zeros define the active_segment. If no non-zero elements exist, the sequence remains unchanged. If no boundary zeros exist, the active_segment is the entire sequence.
  - boundary_zeros are preserved in the output.
actions:
  - identify_boundaries: find the index of the first and last non-zero elements.
  - define_segment: extract the subsequence between the identified boundaries.
  - calculate_frequencies: count occurrences of each digit within the active_segment.
  - find_dominant: determine the digit with the highest frequency in the active_segment.
  - replace_segment: substitute all elements within the active_segment in the original sequence with the dominant_digit.
  - construct_output: combine the preserved boundary_zeros (if any) with the modified segment.
