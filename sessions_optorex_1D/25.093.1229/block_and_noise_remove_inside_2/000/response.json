Leading and trailing '0's in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence. The core transformation happens *between* these boundary zeros (or on the entire sequence if no boundary zeros exist).\n5.  **Dominant Digit:** The dominant digit within the active segment (between boundary '0's or the whole sequence) is the digit that occurs most frequently in that segment.\n6.  **Transformation Action:** All digits within the active segment are replaced by the calculated dominant digit. Digits outside this segment (the boundary '0's) remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
