objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: The initial 1D array of integers provided.
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: The transformed 1D array of integers.
  - name: non_zero_indices
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: An array containing the indices of non-zero elements in the input_array.
  - name: non_zero_subsequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: A contiguous slice of the input_array containing only non-zero digits, bounded by zeros or the array ends.
  - name: boundary_zeros
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: Slices of the input_array containing the zero digits at the beginning and end that delimit the non_zero_subsequence.
  - name: most_frequent_digit
    type: integer
    description: The non-zero integer that occurs most often within the non_zero_subsequence.

properties:
  - object: integer
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the integer (0-9 in examples).
  - object: integer
    name: frequency
    description: The count of occurrences of an integer within a sequence or subsequence.
  - object: non_zero_subsequence
    name: length
    description: The number of elements in the subsequence.
  - object: input_array
    name: shape
    description: The dimensions of the array (always 1D in examples).
  - object: input_array
    name: size
    description: The total number of elements in the array.

actions:
  - name: find_non_zero_indices
    description: Identify the indices of all elements not equal to zero in the input_array (e.g., using np.where).
  - name: determine_subsequence_boundaries
    description: Find the minimum (start) and maximum (end) index from the non_zero_indices. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist.
  - name: extract_subsequences
    description: Isolate the non_zero_subsequence, leading zeros, and trailing zeros using array slicing based on the identified boundaries.
  - name: calculate_mode
    description: Determine the most_frequent_digit within the extracted non_zero_subsequence (e.g., using collections.Counter).
  - name: replace_subsequence_elements
    description: Modify the slice corresponding to the non_zero_subsequence in a copy of the input_array, setting all its elements to the most_frequent_digit. Alternatively, create a new array filled with the mode.
  - name: reconstruct_array
    description: Combine the leading boundary_zeros slice, the modified/new subsequence, and the trailing boundary_zeros slice to form the output_array (if not modifying in-place). Ensure the output is a NumPy array.
