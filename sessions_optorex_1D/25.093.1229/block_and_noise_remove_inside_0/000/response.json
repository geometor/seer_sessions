The transformation specifically targets a contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits within the input sequence. The leading and trailing zero digits act as delimiters for this subsequence and remain unchanged in the output. Within the identified non-zero subsequence, the core operation is to find the digit that appears most frequently (the mode). Subsequently, every digit within this non-zero subsequence is replaced by this most frequent digit. The length of the sequence remains the same.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
