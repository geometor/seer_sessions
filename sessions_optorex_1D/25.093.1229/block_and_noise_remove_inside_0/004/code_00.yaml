objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array of integers
    description: The initial grid of numbers.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array of integers
    description: The transformed grid of numbers, having the same dimensions as the input_grid.
  - name: non_zero_cells
    type: List of coordinate pairs (row, col)
    description: The locations of all cells in the input_grid with a value not equal to zero.
  - name: bounding_box
    type: Rectangular region defined by coordinates
    description: The smallest rectangular area in the grid that encloses all non_zero_cells. Defined by (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - name: bounding_box_subgrid
    type: 2D NumPy array of integers
    description: The portion of the input_grid corresponding to the bounding_box.
  - name: non_zero_values_in_box
    type: List of integers
    description: A collection of the values from non_zero_cells that fall within the bounding_box.
  - name: mode_digit
    type: Integer
    description: The digit that appears most frequently among the non_zero_values_in_box.

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    name: dimensions
    description: The height and width (number of rows and columns) of the grid.
  - object: bounding_box
    name: coordinates
    description: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) defining the top-left and bottom-right corners (inclusive).
  - object: mode_digit
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the most frequent non-zero digit.

actions:
  - name: find_non_zero_cells
    description: Identify the row and column indices of all elements in the input_grid that are not zero.
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    description: Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the non_zero_cells to define the bounding_box. Handle the case where there are no non-zero cells.
  - name: extract_values_in_box
    description: Select all non-zero values from the input_grid that are located within the determined bounding_box.
  - name: calculate_mode
    description: Find the most frequent value (mode) among the extracted non_zero_values_in_box. Handle potential ties (e.g., return the smallest or largest mode, though examples suggest simple mode is sufficient). If no non-zero values exist in the box, this step might result in a default value or require specific handling.
  - name: fill_bounding_box
    description: Create the output_grid by copying the input_grid, then modifying the region corresponding to the bounding_box by setting all its cells to the calculated mode_digit.
  - name: handle_empty_grid
    description: If the input_grid contains no non-zero cells, the output_grid is identical to the input_grid.

relationships:
  - type: definition
    subject: bounding_box
    object: non_zero_cells
    description: The bounding_box is defined by the spatial extent of the non_zero_cells.
  - type: containment
    subject: non_zero_values_in_box
    object: bounding_box_subgrid

    subject: mode_digit
    object: non_zero_values_in_box
    description: The mode_digit is calculated based on the frequencies of the non_zero_values_in_box.
  - type: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid by filling the bounding_box with the mode_digit.
