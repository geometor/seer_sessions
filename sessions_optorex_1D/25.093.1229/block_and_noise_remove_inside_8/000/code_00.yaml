task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - length: constant between input and output
  - item: segments
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequences
      - definition: maximal runs of non-zero numbers within the input sequence
      - boundaries: defined by the presence of zero(s) or the start/end of the sequence
  - item: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: delimiter
      - behavior: remains unchanged in its position during transformation
  - item: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: part of transformable segments
action:
  - name: identify_segments
    inputs:
      - input sequence
    outputs:
      - list of non-zero segments
      - list of positions of zeros
  - name: find_most_frequent
    inputs:
      - a non-zero segment
    outputs:
      - the digit that appears most frequently within the segment
    notes: If there is a tie, the examples provided do not show how ties are resolved, but the current examples do not have ties within non-zero segments. It's assumed a simple mode calculation is sufficient.
  - name: replace_segment_content
    inputs:
      - a non-zero segment
      - the most frequent digit for that segment
    outputs:
      - a new segment of the same length, filled entirely with the most frequent digit
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    inputs:
      - list of transformed segments
      - list of original zero positions
    outputs:
      - the final output sequence
relationships:
  - The output sequence structure mirrors the input sequence in terms of the placement of zeros.
  - The content of non-zero segments in the output depends on the frequency analysis of the corresponding segment in the input.
