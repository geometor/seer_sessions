task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - source_format: potentially space-separated string or list/array
  - item: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - length: same as input_sequence
  - item: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: delimiter
      - behavior: remains unchanged in position and value from input to output
  - item: non_zero_segment
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - content: consists only of digits 1-9
      - definition: a maximal run of non-zero digits bounded by zeros or sequence ends
  - item: segment_mode
    properties:
      - type: integer (digit 1-9)
      - definition: the most frequently occurring digit within a non_zero_segment
      - tie_breaking: (not explicitly defined by examples, assume standard mode behavior e.g., first encountered mode)

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    inputs: raw_input (string or list/array)
    outputs: sequence_of_integers (e.g., python list)
    description: Convert the input into a standard internal representation like a list of integers.
  - name: identify_segments_and_zeros
    inputs: sequence_of_integers
    outputs:
      - list_of_non_zero_segments (each segment is a list of integers)
      - list_of_indices_of_zeros
    description: Iterate through the sequence, collecting non-zero numbers into segments and recording the positions of zeros.
  - name: calculate_mode
    inputs: non_zero_segment (list of integers)
    outputs: segment_mode (integer)
    description: Determine the most frequent integer in the segment.
  - name: transform_segment
    inputs:
      - non_zero_segment (list of integers)
      - segment_mode (integer)
    outputs: transformed_segment (list of integers)
    description: Create a new list of the same length as the input segment, filled entirely with the segment_mode.
  - name: reconstruct_output
    inputs:
      - list_of_transformed_segments
      - list_of_indices_of_zeros
      - original_sequence_length
    outputs: output_sequence (list of integers)
    description: Assemble the final sequence by placing the transformed segments and zeros into their correct positions corresponding to the original input structure.

relationships:
  - The positions of zeros in the input_sequence are identical to their positions in the output_sequence.
  - Each non_zero_segment in the input corresponds to a transformed_segment in the output, occupying the same span of indices.
  - The content of a transformed_segment is determined solely by the segment_mode of its corresponding non_zero_segment from the input.
