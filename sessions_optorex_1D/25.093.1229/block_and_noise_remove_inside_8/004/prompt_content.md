"""
Transforms a sequence of single-digit integers by identifying contiguous non-zero segments,
finding the most frequent digit (mode) within each segment, and replacing all digits
in that segment with the mode. Zeros act as delimiters and remain unchanged.

def find_mode(segment):
  """
    Finds the most frequent element (mode) in a list of numbers.
    If there are ties, it returns the element that appears first among the most frequent ones
    based on Counter's behavior (usually the one encountered first in the segment).

    Args:
        segment: A list of non-zero integers.

    Returns:
        The most frequent integer in the segment. Returns None if the segment is empty.
