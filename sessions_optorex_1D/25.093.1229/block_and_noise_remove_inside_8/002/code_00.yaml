task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or NumPy array of integers
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - length: constant between input and output
  - item: segments
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequences
      - definition: maximal runs of non-zero numbers within the input sequence
      - boundaries: defined by the presence of zero(s) or the start/end of the sequence
  - item: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: delimiter / separator
      - behavior: remains unchanged in its position during transformation
  - item: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: part of transformable segments
action:
  - name: identify_segments_and_zeros
    inputs:
      - input sequence (list or array)
    outputs:
      - list of non-zero segments (as lists of integers)
      - list indicating original positions (e.g., a parallel list marking zero positions or storing segment start/end indices)
  - name: find_most_frequent
    inputs:
      - a non-zero segment (list of integers)
    outputs:
      - the digit that appears most frequently within the segment (mode)
    notes: Assumes `collections.Counter.most_common(1)` behavior for tie-breaking (typically the element encountered first among ties).
  - name: replace_segment_content
    inputs:
      - original segment length
      - the most frequent digit for that segment
    outputs:
      - a new list segment of the specified length, filled entirely with the most frequent digit
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    inputs:
      - list of transformed segments
      - information about original zero positions
    outputs:
      - the final output sequence (list or array)
relationships:
  - The output sequence maintains the same length and the same positions for all zero elements as the input sequence.
  - The content of non-zero runs in the output is determined by the mode of the corresponding run in the input.
