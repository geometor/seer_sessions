task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or NumPy array of integers
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - length: constant between input and output
  - item: segments
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequences
      - definition: maximal runs of non-zero numbers within the input sequence
      - boundaries: defined by the presence of zero(s) or the start/end of the sequence
  - item: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: delimiter
      - behavior: remains unchanged in its position during transformation
  - item: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: part of transformable segments
action:
  - name: iterate_sequence
    inputs:
      - input sequence (list or NumPy array)
    process:
      - process each element individually
    outputs:
      - elements for conditional checks and segment building
  - name: identify_segments_and_zeros
    inputs:
      - elements from iterate_sequence
    process:
      - Check if the current element is zero.
      - If zero, finalize any current non-zero segment being built and record the zero's position.
      - If non-zero, add it to the current non-zero segment.
    outputs:
      - list of identified non-zero segments (as lists of integers)
      - list corresponding to the positions of zeros and processed non-zero segments
  - name: find_most_frequent
    inputs:
      - a non-zero segment (list of integers)
    outputs:
      - the integer digit that appears most frequently within the segment (mode)
    notes: Assumes `collections.Counter.most_common(1)` provides the desired tie-breaking (first encountered element among ties).
  - name: transform_segment
    inputs:
      - a non-zero segment
      - the most frequent digit (mode) for that segment
    outputs:
      - a new list of the same length as the input segment, filled entirely with the mode digit
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    inputs:
      - list of transformed segments
      - list representing original structure (zeros and placeholders for segments)
    outputs:
      - the final output sequence (as a list of integers)
relationships:
  - The output sequence structure mirrors the input sequence structure concerning zero placement.
  - Non-zero segments in the output are replaced versions of corresponding input segments, based on the mode calculation.
  - Input data type might be NumPy array, requiring careful element handling during iteration and comparison.
