"""
Transforms a sequence of single-digit integers. It identifies contiguous segments of non-zero numbers,
finds the most frequent number (mode) within each segment, and replaces all numbers in that segment
with the mode. Zeros act as delimiters between segments and remain unchanged in their positions.

    Finds the most frequent element (mode) in a list of numbers.
