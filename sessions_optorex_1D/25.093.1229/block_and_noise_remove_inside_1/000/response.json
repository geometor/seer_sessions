These zeros often define a boundary or frame around a central segment of non-zero numbers.\n*   **Transformation Focus:** The primary changes occur within the segment bounded by the first and last non-zero numbers in the input sequence. Elements outside this segment (the leading/trailing zeros) remain unchanged.\n*   **Central Tendency:** Within the active segment, one specific digit appears to become dominant in the output, replacing all other digits in that segment. This dominant digit is the one that occurs most frequently in the *input* segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
