Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
Objects:
  - Sequence: The entire list of integers.
  - Segment: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence.
    Properties:
      - Start Index: Index of the first non-zero element in the input sequence.
      - End Index: Index of the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
      - Elements: The integers within the segment.
  - Digit: Individual integer elements within the sequence/segment.
    Properties:
      - Value: The integer value (0-9).
      - Frequency: Count of occurrences within the segment.
Properties:
  - Boundary Elements: Leading and/or trailing zeros in the sequence. They are typically preserved.
  - Dominant Digit: The digit with the highest frequency within the identified segment of the input.
Action:
  - Identify Segment: Locate the sub-sequence between the first and last non-zero elements (inclusive) in the input.
  - Calculate Frequencies: Count the occurrences of each distinct digit within the identified segment.
  - Determine Dominant Digit: Find the digit with the maximum frequency in the segment.
  - Replace: Modify the input sequence by replacing all elements within the identified segment with the dominant digit.
  - Preserve Boundaries: Keep the elements outside the segment (leading/trailing zeros) unchanged.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by modifying only the segment between the first and last non-zero elements.
  - The value used for replacement within the segment is determined by the most frequent digit present in that same segment in the input.
Special Case:
  - If the input sequence contains only zeros, or no non-zero elements, the output is identical to the input.
