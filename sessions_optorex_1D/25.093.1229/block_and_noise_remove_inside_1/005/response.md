```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or 1D NumPy array) of single-digit integers based on the following rule:
1. Identify the segment of the sequence between the first and last non-zero digits (inclusive).
2. If no non-zero digits exist (sequence is all zeros), return the original sequence.
3. Count the frequency of each digit within this identified segment in the *input* sequence.
4. Determine the digit with the highest frequency (the dominant digit or mode) within that segment.
5. Create a new sequence, initially a copy of the input.
6. Replace all digits within the identified segment boundaries (from the first non-zero index to the last non-zero index, inclusive) in the new sequence with the calculated dominant digit.
7. Digits outside this segment (leading/trailing zeros) remain unchanged.
