            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core logic identified previously appears correct and consistent across all training examples. The transformation involves:\n1.  Identifying the sub-sequence bounded by the first and last non-zero elements.\n2.  Finding the most frequent digit (mode) within that specific sub-sequence in the input.\n3.  Replacing *all* elements within that sub-sequence boundary in the output with the calculated mode.\n4.  Leaving elements outside this boundary (leading/trailing zeros) unchanged.\n\nThe execution errors (`TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`) encountered during testing likely stemmed from an unexpected input format provided by the test harness (e.g., a 2D NumPy array representing a single row instead of a flat list or 1D array) interacting poorly with the NumPy array assignment `output_sequence_np[start_index : end_index + 1] = dominant_digit`. The isolated testing using `tool_code` confirmed the core logic and the assignment work correctly when the input sequence is handled as a 1D array and the dominant digit is a standard Python integer.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the core transformation logic but ensure the implementation is robust to potential input format variations (list, 1D array, 2D array with one row) by explicitly converting the input to a 1D NumPy array before processing. The YAML and Natural Language Program will be updated slightly for clarity but the fundamental description remains the same.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nThe following analysis confirms the pattern across all examples:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                  | Non-Zero Segment Bounds (Input Indices) | Input Segment             | Dominant Digit (Mode) | Output Sequence                 |\n| :------ | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ |\n| train_1 | `0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 7 0 0 0`       | 1 to 8                                  | `8 8 8 8 8 8 2 7`         | 8                     | `0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0`       |\n| train_2 | `0 1 1 1 1 7 1 9 1 1 1 1`       | 1 to 11                                 | `1 1 1 1 7 1 9 1 1 1 1`   | 1                     | `0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`       |\n| train_3 | `0 0 0 0 4 8 1 7 4 4 4 0`       | 4 to 10                                 | `4 8 1 7 4 4 4`           | 4                     | `0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0`       |\n| train_4 | `0 0 6 9 6 5 6 6 8 6 6 6`       | 2 to 11                                 | `6 9 6 5 6 6 8 6 6 6`     | 6                     | `0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6`       |\n| train_5 | `0 0 0 0 4 4 7 4 4 4 4 4`       | 4 to 11                                 | `4 4 7 4 4 4 4 4`         | 4                     | `0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4`       |\n| train_6 | `0 6 6 6 6 5 6 6 6 3 0 0`       | 1 to 9                                  | `6 6 6 6 5 6 6 6 3`       | 6                     | `0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0`       |\n| train_7 | `0 0 0 4 1 7 4 4 4 4 1 0`       | 3 to 10                                 | `4 1 7 4 4 4 4 1`         | 4                     | `0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0`       |\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirmed that the calculation of boundaries, segment extraction, dominant digit identification (using `Counter` and `most_common`), and array replacement work as expected with appropriate data types (converting NumPy scalars to Python `int` before counting, and using the resulting Python `int` for replacement).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
