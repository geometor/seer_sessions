Data:
  Type: Sequence of single-digit integers.
  Format: Can be list, 1D NumPy array, or potentially 2D NumPy array (1xN or Nx1). Needs normalization to 1D for processing.
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples).
Objects:
  - Sequence: The input list/array of integers.
  - Boundary_Zeros: Contiguous blocks of zeros at the beginning and/or end of the sequence. These are preserved.
  - Non_Zero_Segment: The contiguous sub-sequence between the first non-zero element and the last non-zero element (inclusive) in the *input* sequence.
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Index of the first non-zero element.
      - End_Index: Index of the last non-zero element.
      - Elements: The integer digits within this segment from the input.
      - Dominant_Digit: The single digit that appears most frequently within the 'Elements'. Calculated using frequency count (mode).
Properties:
  - Preserved: Elements outside the Non_Zero_Segment (the Boundary_Zeros) remain unchanged in the output.
  - Modified: Elements inside the Non_Zero_Segment boundary are all changed in the output.
Action:
  - Normalize_Input: Ensure the input data is treated as a 1D sequence of integers.
  - Identify_Boundaries: Find the start and end indices of the Non_Zero_Segment. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist (return input as is).
  - Extract_Segment: Isolate the Non_Zero_Segment from the input sequence based on the identified boundaries.
  - Calculate_Dominant_Digit: Determine the mode (most frequent digit) of the extracted Input Segment.
  - Construct_Output: Create the output sequence by:
      1. Copying the original input sequence.
      2. Replacing all elements within the range [Start_Index, End_Index] (inclusive) of the copied sequence with the calculated Dominant_Digit.
Relationship:
  - The output is a transformation of the input where the central non-zero portion is homogenized to its most frequent value, while the zero padding is maintained.
Edge Case:
  - If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output is identical to the input.
