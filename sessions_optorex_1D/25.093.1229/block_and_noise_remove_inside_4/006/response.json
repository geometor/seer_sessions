            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" consistently occurred across all examples. This indicates the code is attempting a boolean check directly on a NumPy array object, likely during input validation or processing. The ARC testing environment often provides inputs as NumPy arrays, even for data that appears 1-dimensional (represented as a 2D array with one row).\n    *   The core logic identified in the initial analysis (identifying contiguous non-zero \"islands\" and replacing each island's digits with the most frequent digit within that island) appears to correctly describe the transformation seen in all training examples. The failure is not in the conceptual understanding of the rule but in the code's handling of the specific data structures provided by the testing environment.\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  Modify the code's input handling to explicitly check for and correctly process NumPy array inputs, particularly the `np.array([[d1, d2, ...]])` format. Avoid direct boolean checks on the array object itself (e.g., `if not input_grid:` should be replaced with checks like `if input_grid.size == 0:` or similar, depending on the intended validation).\n    2.  Ensure the code extracts the relevant sequence (likely the first row of the input NumPy array) before proceeding with the island detection and transformation logic.\n    3.  Maintain the core algorithm: iterate through the sequence, identify non-zero islands, find the dominant digit by frequency within each island, and update an output sequence accordingly.\n    4.  Return the result in the expected format (likely a NumPy array or list-of-lists matching the input structure).\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    *   Since the code failed execution, runtime metrics are unavailable.\n    *   Manual analysis confirms the \"island dominance by frequency\" rule holds for all 7 training examples.\n    *   **Example 1:** Island `[9 9 9 7 9 8]`. Frequencies: `{9: 4, 7: 1, 8: 1}`. Dominant: `9`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 2:** Island `[8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3]`. Frequencies: `{3: 8, 8: 1}`. Dominant: `3`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 3:** Island `[6 3 6 6 6 6]`. Frequencies: `{6: 5, 3: 1}`. Dominant: `6`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 4:** Island `[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4]`. Frequencies: `{4: 9, 3: 1}`. Dominant: `4`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 5:** Island `[4 4 6 9 4 4 4 4 4 4]`. Frequencies: `{4: 8, 6: 1, 9: 1}`. Dominant: `4`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 6:** Island `[2 8 8 8 8 8 8]`. Frequencies: `{8: 6, 2: 1}`. Dominant: `8`. Output matches.\n    *   **Example 7:** Island `[2 7 7 7 1 7 7 7]`. Frequencies: `{7: 6, 1: 1, 2: 1}`. Dominant: `7`. Output matches.\n    *   The transformation consistently applies only to contiguous blocks of non-zero digits. Zeroes act as separators and remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
