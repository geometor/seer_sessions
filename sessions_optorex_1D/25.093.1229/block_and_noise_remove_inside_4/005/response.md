"""
Transforms an input grid (represented as a list containing a single list of digits) 
by identifying contiguous subsequences (islands) of non-zero digits within the inner list. 
Within each island, it finds the most frequently occurring digit (the dominant digit). 
All digits within that island in the inner list are then replaced by this dominant 
digit in the output sequence. Zero digits act as separators between islands and remain 
unchanged. The output is returned in the same list-of-lists format as the input.
