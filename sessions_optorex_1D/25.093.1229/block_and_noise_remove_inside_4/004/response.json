            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The error `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` occurring in all examples strongly indicates a fundamental mismatch between the data structure the `transform` function *expected* to receive and the structure it *actually* received from the testing harness.\n    *   Specifically, the error likely happened within the `collections.Counter` in the `find_dominant_digit` helper function. `Counter` requires hashable items (like integers or strings) as keys. Receiving this error means it was likely passed a list containing *lists* instead of a list containing *integers*.\n    *   This suggests the input provided by the harness to the `transform` function was probably a list containing a single inner list (e.g., `[[0, 9, 9, ...]]`), representing a single row. The previous code iterated over the outer list (of length 1), treating the inner list `[0, 9, 9, ...]` as a single element, and attempted to count occurrences of these inner lists within an \"island\", leading to the error.\n    *   The core logic described in the initial perception (identifying non-zero islands, finding the dominant digit by frequency, replacing island elements) seems conceptually correct based on the input/output pairs and the simulation performed. The failure was in handling the input data structure.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  Modify the `transform` function to expect an input structure like `list[list[int]]`.\n    2.  Extract the *first* (and presumably only) inner list from the input.\n    3.  Apply the island identification, dominant digit finding, and replacement logic to this *inner list*.\n    4.  Package the resulting transformed list back into the same `list[list[int]]` structure for the output.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Format:** Assumed to be `list[list[int]]`. Example: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`.\n    *   **Output Format:** Expected to be `list[list[int]]`. Example: `[[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`.\n    *   **Data Structure:** The core data is a 1D sequence of integers, but it's nested within another list.\n    *   **Key Logic:** Island identification (contiguous non-zeros), frequency counting within islands, replacement with the most frequent element.\n    *   **Tool Code Simulation:** The simulation confirmed that the core algorithm works correctly when applied to a flat list of integers derived from the examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
