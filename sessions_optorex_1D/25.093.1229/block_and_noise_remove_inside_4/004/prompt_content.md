"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits (provided as a list or NumPy array) by 
identifying contiguous subsequences (islands) of non-zero digits. Within each 
island, it finds the most frequently occurring digit (the dominant digit). All 
digits within that island in the input sequence are then replaced by this 
dominant digit in the output sequence. Zero digits act as separators between 
islands and remain unchanged in the output. The function returns the transformed 
sequence as a list of integers.
