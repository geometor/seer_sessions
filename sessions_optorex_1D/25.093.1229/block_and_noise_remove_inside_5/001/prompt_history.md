*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both single sequences (lists) of integers.
    *   The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.
    *   The transformation appears to modify some elements within the sequence while leaving others unchanged.
    *   Specifically, the number `0` seems to act as a boundary or is otherwise ignored by the main transformation rule, always remaining `0` in the output where it was `0` in the input.
    *   The core transformation involves identifying the most frequent non-zero number in the input sequence.
    *   All other non-zero numbers in the input sequence are then replaced by this most frequent non-zero number in the output sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - input:
          type: sequence
          element_type: integer
          range: 0-9
      - output:
          type: sequence
          element_type: integer
          length: same_as_input
    transformation_properties:
      - invariant_elements:
          - type: integer
          - value: 0
      - target_value_determination:
          scope: non-zero elements of input sequence
          method: find most frequent element
          name: dominant_non_zero_number
      - modification_rule:
          condition: element is non-zero AND element is NOT dominant_non_zero_number
          action: replace element with dominant_non_zero_number
    relationships:
      - output element at index i depends on input element at index i and the global property (dominant_non_zero_number) of the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input sequence and identify all non-zero numbers.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each unique non-zero number to find the number that appears most frequently (the `dominant_non_zero_number`). If there is a tie, the specific examples do not clarify the tie-breaking rule, but assume one exists (e.g., highest value wins, lowest value wins, or first encountered wins - although frequency seems the primary driver). Based on the examples, frequency alone is sufficient.
    3.  Create a new sequence (the output) with the same length as the input sequence.
    4.  Iterate through the input sequence, element by element, along with its index:
        a.  If the current input element is `0`, place `0` at the corresponding index in the output sequence.
        b.  If the current input element is non-zero, place the `dominant_non_zero_number` (determined in step 2) at the corresponding index in the output sequence.
    5.  Return the newly created output sequence.
