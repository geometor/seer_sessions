"""
Transforms a sequence of single-digit integers. 
The rule is to identify the most frequent non-zero digit in the entire input sequence. 
Then, create a new sequence where every non-zero digit from the input is replaced by this most frequent non-zero digit. 
Digits that are 0 in the input remain 0 in the output.
The length of the sequence remains unchanged. Assumes input is a list or 1D numpy array of integers.
