Input:
  Type: Grid (likely 1xN or Nx1, representing a sequence)
  Elements: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  Properties: Contains zero and non-zero digits.

Output:
  Type: Grid (same dimensions as input)
  Elements: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  Properties: Derived from the input grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify the most frequent non-zero digit globally within the input grid.
  Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  Condition: For each cell in the input grid:
    - If the digit is 0, keep it as 0 in the corresponding output cell.
    - If the digit is non-zero, replace it with the globally identified most frequent non-zero digit in the corresponding output cell.
  Edge Case: If the input contains only zeros, the output is identical to the input.
  Implicit Step: If the input is received as a multi-dimensional array/list (e.g., 1xN), flatten it first to determine the frequencies across all elements.
