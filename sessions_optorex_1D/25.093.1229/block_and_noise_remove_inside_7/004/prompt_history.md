*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant from input to output (12 elements in all provided examples).
    *   The core task is to modify certain elements within the sequence based on the values of their adjacent elements.
    *   The number `0` appears to be static; it never changes its value and does not seem to influence its neighbors' changes.
    *   Non-zero numbers can
