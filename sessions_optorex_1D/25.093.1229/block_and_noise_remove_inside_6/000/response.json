The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.\n2.  **Digit Preservation:** The digit `0` seems to be preserved in its original position from input to output.\n3.  **Digit Replacement:** Non-zero digits in the input are sometimes replaced in the output.\n4.  **Dominant Digit:** In each example, there appears to be a single \"dominant\" non-zero digit. All other non-zero digits in the input sequence are replaced by this dominant digit in the output sequence.\n5.  **Determining the Dominant Digit:** The dominant non-zero digit seems to be the non-zero digit that occurs most frequently in the input sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
