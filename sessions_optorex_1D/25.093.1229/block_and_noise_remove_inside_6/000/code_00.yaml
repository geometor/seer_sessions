# Task: Replace non-zero digits based on frequency
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers derived from the InputSequence.
  - Digit:
      type: int
      range: 0-9
      properties:
        - value: The integer value of the digit.
        - is_zero: Boolean indicating if the digit is 0.
        - frequency: Count of occurrences within the InputSequence.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence has the same length as InputSequence.
  - The digit at a specific index in OutputSequence depends on the digit at the same index in InputSequence and the overall frequency of non-zero digits in InputSequence.

Actions:
  - Identify_Non_Zero_Digits: Filter the InputSequence to get only non-zero digits.
  - Calculate_Frequencies: Determine the count of each unique non-zero digit.
  - Find_Most_Frequent_Non_Zero: Identify the non-zero digit with the highest frequency.
  - Map_Input_To_Output: Iterate through the InputSequence. If a digit is 0, keep it. If a digit is non-zero, replace it with the most frequent non-zero digit.
