Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (or lists) of single-digit integers. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.
2.  **Digit Preservation:** The digit `0` seems to be preserved in its original position from input to output.
3.  **Digit Replacement:** Non-zero digits in the input are sometimes replaced in the output.
4.  **Dominant Digit:** In each example, there appears to be a single "dominant" non-zero digit. All other non-zero digits in the input sequence are replaced by this dominant digit in the output sequence.
5.  **Determining the Dominant Digit:** The dominant non-zero digit seems to be the non-zero digit that occurs most frequently in the input sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# Task: Replace non-zero digits based on frequency
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers derived from the InputSequence.
  - Digit:
      type: int
      range: 0-9
      properties:
        - value: The integer value of the digit.
        - is_zero: Boolean indicating if the digit is 0.
        - frequency: Count of occurrences within the InputSequence.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence has the same length as InputSequence.
  - The digit at a specific index in OutputSequence depends on the digit at the same index in InputSequence and the overall frequency of non-zero digits in InputSequence.

Actions:
  - Identify_Non_Zero_Digits: Filter the InputSequence to get only non-zero digits.
  - Calculate_Frequencies: Determine the count of each unique non-zero digit.
  - Find_Most_Frequent_Non_Zero: Identify the non-zero digit with the highest frequency.
  - Map_Input_To_Output: Iterate through the InputSequence. If a digit is 0, keep it. If a digit is non-zero, replace it with the most frequent non-zero digit.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify all non-zero digits present in the input sequence.
3.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-zero digit.
4.  Determine the non-zero digit that has the highest frequency (the "dominant non-zero digit").
5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
6.  Iterate through the input sequence, index by index:
    a.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is `0`, place `0` at the corresponding index in the output sequence.
    b.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is non-zero, place the dominant non-zero digit (determined in step 4) at the corresponding index in the output sequence.
7.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits based on the following rule:
1. Identify all non-zero digits in the input sequence.
2. Count the frequency of each unique non-zero digit.
3. Determine the non-zero digit with the highest frequency (the "dominant non-zero digit").
4. Create a new output sequence.
5. For each digit in the input sequence:
    a. If the digit is 0, keep it as 0 in the output sequence.
    b. If the digit is non-zero, replace it with the dominant non-zero digit in the output sequence.
The resulting sequence is the output.
