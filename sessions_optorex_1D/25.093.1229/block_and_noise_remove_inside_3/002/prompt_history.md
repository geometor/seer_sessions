Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The transformation appears to focus on homogenizing the non-zero elements based on frequency.

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or strings representing space-separated lists) of integers.
2.  **Key Operation:** The core operation seems to involve identifying the most frequent non-zero digit within the input sequence.
3.  **Element Preservation:** Zero elements (`0`) in the input sequence seem to be preserved in their original positions in the output sequence.
4.  **Element Replacement:** All non-zero elements in the input sequence are replaced by the single most frequent non-zero digit found in the input.
5.  **Assumption:** Based on the examples, there appears to always be a unique most frequent non-zero digit. Cases with ties or no non-zero digits are not explicitly shown, but the pattern suggests zeros are untouched, and other digits conform to the most frequent non-zero one.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The transformed sequence of single-digit integers, same length as the input.
  - name: non_zero_elements
    type: List[int]
    description: A subset of the input_sequence containing only elements not equal to zero.
  - name: mode_digit
    type: int
    description: The single digit that appears most frequently among the non_zero_elements. Assumed to be unique and non-zero based on examples.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the sequence, equal to the input_sequence length.

actions:
  - name: filter_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_elements
    description: Create a new list containing only the elements from the input_sequence that are not zero.
  - name: find_mode
    input: non_zero_elements
    output: mode_digit
    description: Determine the element that occurs most frequently in the non_zero_elements list. Handle the case where non_zero_elements is empty (though not shown in examples, implies no change or specific handling).
  - name: transform_sequence
    input:
      - input_sequence
      - mode_digit
    output: output_sequence
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence. If an element is zero, keep it. If an element is non-zero, replace it with the mode_digit.

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    object1: input_sequence
    object2: output_sequence
    details: Zero elements maintain their value and position.
  - type: replacement
    object1: input_sequence
    object2: output_sequence
    details: All non-zero elements in the input are replaced by the mode_digit in the output, maintaining their positions.
  - type: derivation
    object1: non_zero_elements
    object2: mode_digit
    details: The mode_digit is derived from the frequency analysis of non_zero_elements.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify all the non-zero integers within the input sequence.
3.  If there are no non-zero integers, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
4.  If there are non-zero integers, count the occurrences of each unique non-zero integer.
5.  Determine the non-zero integer that occurs most frequently (the mode).
6.  Construct the output sequence, having the same length as the input sequence.
7.  Iterate through each position of the input sequence:
    *   If the integer at the current position in the input sequence is zero, place a zero at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    *   If the integer at the current position in the input sequence is non-zero, place the mode (determined in step 5) at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
