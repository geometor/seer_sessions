The transformation appears to focus on homogenizing the non-zero elements based on frequency.\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or strings representing space-separated lists) of integers.\n2.  **Key Operation:** The core operation seems to involve identifying the most frequent non-zero digit within the input sequence.\n3.  **Element Preservation:** Zero elements (`0`) in the input sequence seem to be preserved in their original positions in the output sequence.\n4.  **Element Replacement:** All non-zero elements in the input sequence are replaced by the single most frequent non-zero digit found in the input.\n5.  **Assumption:** Based on the examples, there appears to always be a unique most frequent non-zero digit. Cases with ties or no non-zero digits are not explicitly shown, but the pattern suggests zeros are untouched, and other digits conform to the most frequent non-zero one.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
