            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. They are presented as space-separated strings but represent numerical lists.\n2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying specific patterns within the input sequence and selectively preserving parts of that pattern while replacing others.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The non-zero digits and their contiguous occurrences (runs) appear crucial. The lengths of these runs seem to determine what is kept in the output.\n4.  **Filtering/Selection:** The process filters the input based on the longest contiguous sequence of a non-zero digit. Only the elements belonging to this longest sequence are retained in their original positions; all other elements become zero.\n5.  **Zero Handling:** Zeros in the input act as separators between sequences of non-zero digits and are generally preserved in the output unless they are replaced by a digit from the selected longest sequence (which doesn't happen in the examples, as the longest sequence only replaces non-zeros or other parts of shorter sequences).\n6.  **Tie-breaking (Implicit):** Although not explicitly shown with conflicting examples, if multiple non-zero digit sequences share the maximum length, a rule must exist. Common defaults would be to keep the first occurrence or the last. Based on the provided examples, it's consistent that *a* longest sequence is chosen, but the specific tie-breaker isn't definitively tested. Let's assume for now the *first* longest sequence encountered is kept.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
