"""
Identifies and isolates the longest contiguous sequence (run) of a single 
non-zero digit within an input sequence of digits. The input might be 
represented as a 2D grid/array with a single row. If multiple runs share 
the maximum length, the one appearing earliest (smallest start index) is chosen. 
The output sequence retains only the digits from this chosen run in their 
original positions, with all other positions set to zero. The output sequence
has the same length as the input sequence and is returned as a 1D array.
