task_description: Identify and isolate the longest contiguous sequence (run) of a single non-zero digit within an input sequence of digits. If multiple runs share the maximum length, the one appearing earliest (smallest start index) is chosen. The output sequence retains only the digits from this chosen run in their original positions, with all other positions set to zero. The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
input_format_note: Input might be provided as a 2D array with one row; the processing logic should target the single row as the 1D sequence.
elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence_of_integers # Can be list or 1D numpy array derived from potentially 2D input
    description: The initial sequence of digits to be processed.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence_of_integers # Typically numpy array
    description: The resulting sequence after applying the transformation.
    relationship: derived from input_sequence by isolating the longest run. Has the same length as input_sequence.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value > 0
    description: Digits that form the basis of contiguous runs.
  - name: zero_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value == 0
    description: Acts as a separator between runs and the default background value in the output.
  - name: contiguous_run
    type: object
    properties:
      - digit_value: integer (non-zero)
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: integer (end_index - start_index + 1)
    description: A sequence of identical, adjacent non-zero digits within the input_sequence.
    relationship: Identified within input_sequence.
actions:
  - name: extract_1d_sequence
    input: raw_input_data # Potentially 2D array
    output: input_sequence # Guaranteed 1D sequence
    description: Ensure the input data is treated as a 1D sequence (e.g., extract the first row if input is 2D).
  - name: find_runs
    input: input_sequence (1D)
    output: list_of_contiguous_runs
    description: Scan the 1D input_sequence to identify all contiguous_runs of non-zero digits.
  - name: find_longest_run
    input: list_of_contiguous_runs
    output: target_run (a single contiguous_run object, or null/None if no non-zero runs exist)
    description: Determine the run with the maximum length. If multiple runs share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest start_index.
  - name: generate_output
    input:
      - input_sequence_length
      - target_run
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a sequence of zeros with the same length as the input_sequence. If a target_run was found, populate the corresponding indices (from start_index to end_index) in the output_sequence with the digit_value of the target_run.
