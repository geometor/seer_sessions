Each input sequence appears to contain predominantly zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (which I'll call the \"dominant digit\"). The transformation rule seems to filter the input sequence based on the contiguity of the dominant digit. Specifically, it retains blocks of the dominant digit that are of length two or more, while isolated instances (blocks of length one) of the dominant digit are replaced with zero. The original zero elements remain zero in the output. The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
