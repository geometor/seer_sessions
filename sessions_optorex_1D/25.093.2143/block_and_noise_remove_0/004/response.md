**General Assessment:**

The error message "Input grid must be a 1D array" clearly indicates the core issue: the previous code assumed a 1D input structure based on the string representation, while the execution environment provides the input as a 2D NumPy array. The examples given were visually presented as single lines, but they are processed as 2D grids (likely single-row grids in this case).

The transformation logic identified previously (finding a dominant non-zero digit and keeping only contiguous blocks of length 2 or more of that digit, replacing others with zero) appears correct when applied row-wise to the examples.

The strategy is to modify the approach to:
1.  Accept a 2D NumPy array as input.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  Apply the dominant digit identification and block filtering logic independently to each row.
4.  Construct the output grid row by row based on the results.

**Metrics:**

Based on the re-evaluation assuming 1x12 input grids:

| Example | Input Shape (Assumed) | Output Shape (Assumed) | Dominant Digit | Input Blocks (Value, Length) | Kept Blocks (Value, Length) | Matches Output? |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- |
| train_1 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 1) | (8, 3)                      | Yes             |
| train_2 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 8), (8, 1)               | (8, 8)                      | Yes             |
| train_3 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 6              | (6, 3), (6, 1), (6, 1), (6, 1) | (6, 3)                      | Yes             |
| train_4 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 7              | (7, 1), (7, 1), (7, 6)       | (7, 6)                      | Yes             |
| train_5 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 1), (8, 10)              | (8, 10)                     | Yes             |
| train_6 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 6              | (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 1)       | (6, 5)                      | Yes             |
| train_7 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 4              | (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 1) | (4, 2)                      | Yes             |

The analysis strongly suggests the logic is correct but needs to operate on rows of a 2D grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the grid.
        - shape: The dimensions of the grid (rows, columns).
        - rows: Ordered list of 1D arrays representing grid rows.
  - row:
      description: A 1D horizontal sequence of digits within the grid.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the row.
        - length: The number of digits (columns) in the row.
        - dominant_digit: The single non-zero digit that appears most frequently in the row (or the smallest if tied). If only zeros or multiple non-zeros with equal frequency, handling might default to 0 or a specific rule. For this task, only one non-zero digit appears per row in examples.
  - digit:
      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value (0-9).
        - position: The (row, column) index of the digit within the grid.
  - horizontal_block:
      description: A contiguous horizontal subsequence of identical non-zero digits within a single row.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the row's dominant_digit).
        - row_index: The row index where the block occurs.
        - start_col: The starting column index of the block.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_col - start_col + 1).
actions:
  - iterate_rows: Process the grid one row at a time.
  - identify_dominant_digit_in_row: Find the single non-zero digit present in the current row.
  - identify_horizontal_blocks: Scan the current row to find all contiguous horizontal blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks_by_length: Select horizontal blocks based on a length criterion (>= 2).
  - construct_output_row: Build the output row based on the filtered blocks and original zeros from the input row.
  - assemble_output_grid: Combine the processed output rows into the final output grid.
relationships:
  - horizontal_contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the same row.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not horizontally contiguous with another identical dominant digit within its row (forms a horizontal block of length 1).
rules:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each row of the input grid.
  - Within a row:
    - Zeros in the input row remain zeros in the output row.
    - The single non-zero digit present in the input row is the "dominant digit" for that row.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length >= 2 in the input row are retained in the output row at their original positions.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length 1 (isolated horizontally) in the input row are replaced by zero in the output row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index `r`.
3.  For the current input row `input_row = input_grid[r]`:
    a.  Identify the single non-zero digit present in `input_row` (the "dominant digit"). If the row contains only zeros, the corresponding output row remains all zeros; proceed to the next row.
    b.  Scan `input_row` from left to right (column index `c`).
    c.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed solely of the dominant digit. Record the start column index, end column index, and length of each block found in this row.
    d.  For each identified horizontal block of the dominant digit in the current row:
        i.  If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the dominant digit value to the corresponding positions (row `r`, columns from start_col to end_col) in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
