            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"Input grid must be a 1D array\" clearly indicates the core issue: the previous code assumed a 1D input structure based on the string representation, while the execution environment provides the input as a 2D NumPy array. The examples given were visually presented as single lines, but they are processed as 2D grids (likely single-row grids in this case).\n\nThe transformation logic identified previously (finding a dominant non-zero digit and keeping only contiguous blocks of length 2 or more of that digit, replacing others with zero) appears correct when applied row-wise to the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the approach to:\n1.  Accept a 2D NumPy array as input.\n2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n3.  Apply the dominant digit identification and block filtering logic independently to each row.\n4.  Construct the output grid row by row based on the results.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the re-evaluation assuming 1x12 input grids:\n\n| Example | Input Shape (Assumed) | Output Shape (Assumed) | Dominant Digit | Input Blocks (Value, Length) | Kept Blocks (Value, Length) | Matches Output? |\n| :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- |\n| train_1 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 1) | (8, 3)                      | Yes             |\n| train_2 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 8), (8, 1)               | (8, 8)                      | Yes             |\n| train_3 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 6              | (6, 3), (6, 1), (6, 1), (6, 1) | (6, 3)                      | Yes             |\n| train_4 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 7              | (7, 1), (7, 1), (7, 6)       | (7, 6)                      | Yes             |\n| train_5 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 8              | (8, 1), (8, 10)              | (8, 10)                     | Yes             |\n| train_6 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 6              | (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 1)       | (6, 5)                      | Yes             |\n| train_7 | (1, 12)               | (1, 12)                | 4              | (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 1) | (4, 2)                      | Yes             |\n\nThe analysis strongly suggests the logic is correct but needs to operate on rows of a 2D grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
