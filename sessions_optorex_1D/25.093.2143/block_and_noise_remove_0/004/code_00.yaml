objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the grid.
        - shape: The dimensions of the grid (rows, columns).
        - rows: Ordered list of 1D arrays representing grid rows.
  - row:
      description: A 1D horizontal sequence of digits within the grid.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the row.
        - length: The number of digits (columns) in the row.
        - dominant_digit: The single non-zero digit that appears most frequently in the row (or the smallest if tied). If only zeros or multiple non-zeros with equal frequency, handling might default to 0 or a specific rule. For this task, only one non-zero digit appears per row in examples.
  - digit:
      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value (0-9).
        - position: The (row, column) index of the digit within the grid.
  - horizontal_block:
      description: A contiguous horizontal subsequence of identical non-zero digits within a single row.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the row's dominant_digit).
        - row_index: The row index where the block occurs.
        - start_col: The starting column index of the block.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_col - start_col + 1).
actions:
  - iterate_rows: Process the grid one row at a time.
  - identify_dominant_digit_in_row: Find the single non-zero digit present in the current row.
  - identify_horizontal_blocks: Scan the current row to find all contiguous horizontal blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks_by_length: Select horizontal blocks based on a length criterion (>= 2).
  - construct_output_row: Build the output row based on the filtered blocks and original zeros from the input row.
  - assemble_output_grid: Combine the processed output rows into the final output grid.
relationships:
  - horizontal_contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the same row.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not horizontally contiguous with another identical dominant digit within its row (forms a horizontal block of length 1).
rules:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each row of the input grid.
  - Within a row:
    - Zeros in the input row remain zeros in the output row.
    - The single non-zero digit present in the input row is the "dominant digit" for that row.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length >= 2 in the input row are retained in the output row at their original positions.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length 1 (isolated horizontally) in the input row are replaced by zero in the output row.
