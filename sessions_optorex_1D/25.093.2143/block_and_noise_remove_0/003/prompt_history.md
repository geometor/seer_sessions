**Perception of the Elements:**

The task operates on sequences of single-digit integers. Each input sequence appears to contain predominantly zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (which I'll call the "dominant digit"). The transformation rule seems to filter the input sequence based on the contiguity of the dominant digit. Specifically, it retains blocks of the dominant digit that are of length two or more, while isolated instances (blocks of length one) of the dominant digit are replaced with zero. The original zero elements remain zero in the output. The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:

        - position: The index of the digit within the sequence.
  - block:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the main sequence.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the dominant_digit).
        - start_index: The position of the first digit in the block.
        - end_index: The position of the last digit in the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

  - identify_blocks: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks: Select blocks based on a length criterion.
  - construct_output: Build the output sequence based on the filtered blocks and original zeros.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the sequence.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not contiguous with another identical dominant digit (forms a block of length 1).
rules:
  - Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length >= 2 in the input are retained in the output at their original positions.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length 1 (isolated) in the input are replaced by zero in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence to identify the single non-zero digit present (the "dominant digit"). If no non-zero digit exists, return the input sequence unchanged.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying all contiguous blocks composed solely of the dominant digit. Record the start index, end index, and length of each block.
4.  For each identified block of the dominant digit:
    *   If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the digits from this block in the input sequence to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed across all examples due to a type mismatch: it expected a space-separated string input but received a NumPy array. This requires modifying the input handling part of the `transform` function. The core logic derived from the first example – identifying a single dominant non-zero digit and preserving only contiguous blocks of that digit with a length of two or more, while replacing isolated instances (length 1) and preserving original zeros – appears consistent across all provided training examples. The strategy is to adapt the function signature and input processing to accept NumPy arrays while keeping the established transformation logic.

**Metrics:**

The analysis across all training examples confirms the pattern:

| Example | Input Sequence                 | Output Sequence                | Dominant Digit | Blocks (Digit, Start, End, Length) | Kept Blocks (Length >= 2) | Removed Blocks (Length < 2) |

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of single-digit integers.
2.  Determine the 'dominant' non-zero digit within the input array. If the array contains only zeros, return a copy of the input array. (Note: The provided examples consistently feature only one type of non-zero digit per sequence; the logic should ideally handle potential variations, e.g., by choosing the most frequent non-zero digit if multiple exist, although this isn't required by the examples).
3.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Iterate through the input array to identify contiguous blocks (sequences of identical adjacent digits) consisting solely of the dominant digit. For each block, note its starting index, ending index, and length.
5.  For each identified block of the dominant digit:
    *   If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the dominant digit value into the corresponding positions (from the block's start index to its end index) in the output array.
6.  Return the constructed output array. Isolated dominant digits (blocks of length 1) are implicitly handled, as they are not copied over the initial zeros in the output array.
