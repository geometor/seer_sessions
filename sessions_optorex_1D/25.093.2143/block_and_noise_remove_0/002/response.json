            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed across all examples due to a type mismatch: it expected a space-separated string input but received a NumPy array. This requires modifying the input handling part of the `transform` function. The core logic derived from the first example \u2013 identifying a single dominant non-zero digit and preserving only contiguous blocks of that digit with a length of two or more, while replacing isolated instances (length 1) and preserving original zeros \u2013 appears consistent across all provided training examples. The strategy is to adapt the function signature and input processing to accept NumPy arrays while keeping the established transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe analysis across all training examples confirms the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                 | Output Sequence                | Dominant Digit | Blocks (Digit, Start, End, Length) | Kept Blocks (Length >= 2) | Removed Blocks (Length < 2) |\n| :------ | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |\n| 1       | `[8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 8]`  | `[0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`  | 8              | `(8,0,0,1)`, `(8,3,5,3)`, `(8,8,8,1)`, `(8,11,11,1)` | `(8,3,5,3)`               | `(8,0,0,1)`, `(8,8,8,1)`, `(8,11,11,1)` |\n| 2       | `[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 0 0]`  | `[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]`  | 8              | `(8,0,7,8)`, `(8,9,9,1)`         | `(8,0,7,8)`               | `(8,9,9,1)`               |\n| 3       | `[0 6 6 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 6]`  | `[0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`  | 6              | `(6,1,3,3)`, `(6,6,6,1)`, `(6,9,9,1)`, `(6,11,11,1)` | `(6,1,3,3)`               | `(6,6,6,1)`, `(6,9,9,1)`, `(6,11,11,1)` |\n| 4       | `[0 0 7 0 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 7]`  | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7]`  | 7              | `(7,2,2,1)`, `(7,4,4,1)`, `(7,6,11,6)` | `(7,6,11,6)`              | `(7,2,2,1)`, `(7,4,4,1)`   |\n| 5       | `[8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]`  | `[0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]`  | 8              | `(8,0,0,1)`, `(8,2,11,10)`        | `(8,2,11,10)`             | `(8,0,0,1)`               |\n| 6       | `[0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 0]`  | `[0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0]`  | 6              | `(6,2,6,5)`, `(6,8,8,1)`, `(6,10,10,1)`| `(6,2,6,5)`               | `(6,8,8,1)`, `(6,10,10,1)`|\n| 7       | `[4 0 0 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 4 0]`  | `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`  | 4              | `(4,0,0,1)`, `(4,3,3,1)`, `(4,5,6,2)`, `(4,10,10,1)`| `(4,5,6,2)`               | `(4,0,0,1)`, `(4,3,3,1)`, `(4,10,10,1)`|\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
