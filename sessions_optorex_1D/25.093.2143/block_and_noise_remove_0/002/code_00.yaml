objects:
  - sequence:
      description: An ordered list (specifically, a NumPy array) of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the sequence.
        - length: The number of digits in the sequence.
        - dominant_digit: The single non-zero digit that appears most frequently in the input (or the smallest if ties exist). Assumed to be unique non-zero digit based on examples.
  - digit:
      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value (0-9).
        - position: The index of the digit within the sequence.
  - block:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (specifically, the dominant digit) within the main sequence.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the dominant_digit).
        - start_index: The position of the first digit in the block.
        - end_index: The position of the last digit in the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - identify_dominant_digit: Find the single non-zero digit present in the input sequence. Handles cases with only zeros or multiple distinct non-zeros (though not seen in examples).
  - identify_blocks: Scan the input sequence (NumPy array) to find all contiguous blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks: Select blocks based on the length criterion (length >= 2).
  - construct_output: Build the output sequence (as a NumPy array) based on the filtered blocks and original zeros.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the sequence.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not contiguous with another identical dominant digit (forms a block of length 1).
rules:
  - Input is a NumPy array of single-digit integers.
  - Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output.
  - Identify the 'dominant' non-zero digit (appears to be the only non-zero digit in the examples).
  - Find all contiguous blocks of this dominant digit.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length >= 2 in the input are retained in the output at their original positions.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length 1 (isolated) in the input are replaced by zero in the output.
  - Output should be a NumPy array of the same length as the input.
