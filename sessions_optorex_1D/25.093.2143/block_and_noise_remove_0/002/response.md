**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed across all examples due to a type mismatch: it expected a space-separated string input but received a NumPy array. This requires modifying the input handling part of the `transform` function. The core logic derived from the first example – identifying a single dominant non-zero digit and preserving only contiguous blocks of that digit with a length of two or more, while replacing isolated instances (length 1) and preserving original zeros – appears consistent across all provided training examples. The strategy is to adapt the function signature and input processing to accept NumPy arrays while keeping the established transformation logic.

**Metrics:**

The analysis across all training examples confirms the pattern:

| Example | Input Sequence                 | Output Sequence                | Dominant Digit | Blocks (Digit, Start, End, Length) | Kept Blocks (Length >= 2) | Removed Blocks (Length < 2) |

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence:
      description: An ordered list (specifically, a NumPy array) of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the sequence.
        - length: The number of digits in the sequence.
        - dominant_digit: The single non-zero digit that appears most frequently in the input (or the smallest if ties exist). Assumed to be unique non-zero digit based on examples.
  - digit:
      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value (0-9).
        - position: The index of the digit within the sequence.
  - block:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (specifically, the dominant digit) within the main sequence.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the dominant_digit).
        - start_index: The position of the first digit in the block.
        - end_index: The position of the last digit in the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - identify_dominant_digit: Find the single non-zero digit present in the input sequence. Handles cases with only zeros or multiple distinct non-zeros (though not seen in examples).
  - identify_blocks: Scan the input sequence (NumPy array) to find all contiguous blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks: Select blocks based on the length criterion (length >= 2).
  - construct_output: Build the output sequence (as a NumPy array) based on the filtered blocks and original zeros.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the sequence.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not contiguous with another identical dominant digit (forms a block of length 1).
rules:
  - Input is a NumPy array of single-digit integers.
  - Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output.
  - Identify the 'dominant' non-zero digit (appears to be the only non-zero digit in the examples).
  - Find all contiguous blocks of this dominant digit.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length >= 2 in the input are retained in the output at their original positions.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length 1 (isolated) in the input are replaced by zero in the output.
  - Output should be a NumPy array of the same length as the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of single-digit integers.
2.  Determine the 'dominant' non-zero digit within the input array. If the array contains only zeros, return a copy of the input array. (Note: The provided examples consistently feature only one type of non-zero digit per sequence; the logic should ideally handle potential variations, e.g., by choosing the most frequent non-zero digit if multiple exist, although this isn't required by the examples).
3.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Iterate through the input array to identify contiguous blocks (sequences of identical adjacent digits) consisting solely of the dominant digit. For each block, note its starting index, ending index, and length.
5.  For each identified block of the dominant digit:
    *   If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the dominant digit value into the corresponding positions (from the block's start index to its end index) in the output array.
6.  Return the constructed output array. Isolated dominant digits (blocks of length 1) are implicitly handled, as they are not copied over the initial zeros in the output array.
