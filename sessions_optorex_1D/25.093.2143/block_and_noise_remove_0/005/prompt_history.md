**Perception of the Elements:**

The task operates on sequences of single-digit integers. Each input sequence appears to contain predominantly zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (which I'll call the "dominant digit"). The transformation rule seems to filter the input sequence based on the contiguity of the dominant digit. Specifically, it retains blocks of the dominant digit that are of length two or more, while isolated instances (blocks of length one) of the dominant digit are replaced with zero. The original zero elements remain zero in the output. The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

  - sequence:
      description: An ordered list of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the sequence.
        - length: The number of digits in the sequence.
        - dominant_digit: The single non-zero digit that appears in the input (if any).
  - digit:
      description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value (0-9).
        - position: The index of the digit within the sequence.
  - block:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the main sequence.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The value of the digits in the block (must be the dominant_digit).
        - start_index: The position of the first digit in the block.
        - end_index: The position of the last digit in the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - identify_dominant_digit: Find the single non-zero digit present in the input sequence.
  - identify_blocks: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the dominant digit.
  - filter_blocks: Select blocks based on a length criterion.
  - construct_output: Build the output sequence based on the filtered blocks and original zeros.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the sequence.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not contiguous with another identical dominant digit (forms a block of length 1).
rules:
  - Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length >= 2 in the input are retained in the output at their original positions.
  - Dominant digits forming a block of length 1 (isolated) in the input are replaced by zero in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence to identify the single non-zero digit present (the "dominant digit"). If no non-zero digit exists, return the input sequence unchanged.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying all contiguous blocks composed solely of the dominant digit. Record the start index, end index, and length of each block.
4.  For each identified block of the dominant digit:
    *   If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the digits from this block in the input sequence to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The error message "Input grid must be a 1D array" clearly indicates the core issue: the previous code assumed a 1D input structure based on the string representation, while the execution environment provides the input as a 2D NumPy array. The examples given were visually presented as single lines, but they are processed as 2D grids (likely single-row grids in this case).

The transformation logic identified previously (finding a dominant non-zero digit and keeping only contiguous blocks of length 2 or more of that digit, replacing others with zero) appears correct when applied row-wise to the examples.

The strategy is to modify the approach to:
1.  Accept a 2D NumPy array as input.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  Apply the dominant digit identification and block filtering logic independently to each row.
4.  Construct the output grid row by row based on the results.

  - assemble_output_grid: Combine the processed output rows into the final output grid.
relationships:
  - horizontal_contiguity: Digits are adjacent to each other in the same row.
  - isolation: A dominant digit is not horizontally contiguous with another identical dominant digit within its row (forms a horizontal block of length 1).
rules:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each row of the input grid.
  - Within a row:
    - Zeros in the input row remain zeros in the output row.
    - The single non-zero digit present in the input row is the "dominant digit" for that row.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length >= 2 in the input row are retained in the output row at their original positions.
    - Dominant digits forming a horizontal block of length 1 (isolated horizontally) in the input row are replaced by zero in the output row.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its row index `r`.
3.  For the current input row `input_row = input_grid[r]`:
    a.  Identify the single non-zero digit present in `input_row` (the "dominant digit"). If the row contains only zeros, the corresponding output row remains all zeros; proceed to the next row.
    b.  Scan `input_row` from left to right (column index `c`).
    c.  Identify all contiguous horizontal blocks composed solely of the dominant digit. Record the start column index, end column index, and length of each block found in this row.
    d.  For each identified horizontal block of the dominant digit in the current row:
        i.  If the block's length is 2 or greater, copy the dominant digit value to the corresponding positions (row `r`, columns from start_col to end_col) in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
