The length of the sequence appears consistent (12 digits in all examples).\n2.  **Content:** The sequences consist of digits (0-9).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing certain non-zero digits in the input sequence to 0 in the output sequence. Digits that are already 0 remain 0. Not all non-zero digits are changed.\n4.  **Pattern:** The key pattern relates to whether a non-zero digit is \"isolated\" or part of a larger group of identical adjacent digits. Specifically, a non-zero digit seems to be changed to 0 only if it is *not* adjacent to another digit of the *same* value.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
