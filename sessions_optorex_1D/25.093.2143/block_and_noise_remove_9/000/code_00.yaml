Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Integers (0-9)
  Format: Space-separated string
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)

Objects:
  - Name: Digit
    Properties:
      - value: Integer (0-9)
      - position: Index in the sequence (0-based)
  - Name: Block
    Definition: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero digits.
    Properties:
      - value: The digit composing the block.
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - start_index: The index of the first digit in the block.
      - end_index: The index of the last digit in the block.

Transformation:
  Action: Modify digit value
  Target: Non-zero digits within the input sequence.
  Condition: A non-zero digit's value is changed to 0 if and only if it constitutes a Block of length 1.
  Output: A new sequence reflecting these changes.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Digits have left and right neighbors (except at the boundaries).
  - Membership: Digits belong to Blocks.
  - Identity: Digits within a Block share the same non-zero value.
