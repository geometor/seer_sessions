task_elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: A list of single-digit integers representing the input or output state.
    properties:
      - length: The number of elements in the sequence.
      - elements: The individual integers (0-9).

  - object: Element
    description: A single integer within a sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The integer number (0-9).
      - position: The zero-based index of the element within its sequence.

  - object: Block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero elements within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer common to all elements in the block.
      - start_index: The position (index) of the first element of the block.
      - end_index: The position (index) of the last element of the block.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

relationships:
  - type: Contains
    description: A Sequence contains multiple Elements.
  - type: Forms
    description: One or more adjacent Elements with the same non-zero value form a Block.

actions:
  - action: IdentifyUniqueNonZeros
    description: Find all unique non-zero integer values present in the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Set of unique non-zero integers.

  - action: FindValueBlocks
    description: For a given non-zero value N, find all contiguous Blocks of N within the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
      - N (a non-zero integer value)
    outputs:
      - List of Blocks (each described by value, start_index, end_index, length).

  - action: SelectLongestBlock
    description: >
      From a list of Blocks corresponding to a specific value N, select the single Block
      with the maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one
      with the smallest start_index (the one appearing earliest in the sequence).
    inputs:
      - List of Blocks for value N
    outputs:
      - The single selected Block (or null/None if no blocks were found).

  - action: ConstructOutput
    description: >
      Create the output sequence by initializing a sequence of zeros with the same length
      as the input. Then, for each unique non-zero value from the input, identify its
      selected longest block (if any) and place its value into the corresponding positions
      (from start_index to end_index) in the output sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence length
      - Set of selected longest Blocks (one for each unique non-zero value present in the input).
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence.
