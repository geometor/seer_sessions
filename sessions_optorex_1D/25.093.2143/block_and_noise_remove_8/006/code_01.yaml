task_elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: A 1D list/array of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - elements: List of integers.
      - length: Number of elements.

  - object: Value
    description: A distinct non-zero integer present in the input sequence.

  - object: Block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero Elements.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value of the block's elements.
      - start_index: The sequence index where the block begins.
      - end_index: The sequence index where the block ends.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

relationships:
  - type: Contains
    description: The input Sequence contains Elements.
  - type: GroupsInto
    description: Contiguous identical non-zero Elements group into Blocks.
  - type: AssociatedWith
    description: Each Block is associated with a unique non-zero Value.

actions:
  - action: IdentifyUniqueNonZeros
    description: Find all unique non-zero integer values in the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Set of unique non-zero Values.

  - action: FindValueBlocks
    description: For a specific non-zero Value, find all Blocks of that Value in the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
      - Value
    outputs:
      - List of Blocks corresponding to the Value.

  - action: SelectLongestBlock
    description: From a list of Blocks for a given Value, select the single Block with the maximum length. If multiple Blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the minimum start_index.
    inputs:
      - List of Blocks for a Value
    outputs:
      - The selected Block (or None if input list is empty).

  - action: GenerateOutputSequence
    description: Create an output Sequence of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros. Then, for each unique non-zero Value, populate the indices corresponding to its selected longest Block with that Value.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence Length
      - Set of selected longest Blocks (one per unique non-zero Value).
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence.
