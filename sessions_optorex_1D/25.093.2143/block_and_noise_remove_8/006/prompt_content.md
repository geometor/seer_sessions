"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by identifying contiguous blocks (runs)
of each unique non-zero value. For each unique non-zero value, only the single
longest block is preserved in the output. If multiple blocks share the maximum
length for a given value, the block that appears earliest (smallest start index)
in the input sequence is chosen. All elements corresponding to non-selected
blocks, and all original zero elements that are not part of a selected longest
block, become zero in the output sequence. The output sequence has the same
length as the input sequence.
