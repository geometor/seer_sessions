task_elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: A list of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - length: The number of elements in the sequence.
      - elements: The individual integers in the sequence.

  - object: Element
    description: A single integer within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The integer itself (0-9).
      - position: The index of the element in the sequence.

  - object: Block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero elements.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer that makes up the block.
      - start_index: The position of the first element of the block.
      - end_index: The position of the last element of the block.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

relationships:
  - type: BelongsTo
    description: An Element belongs to a Sequence.
  - type: Forms
    description: Multiple contiguous Elements with the same non-zero value form a Block.

actions:
  - action: IdentifyBlocks
    description: For a given non-zero value N, find all contiguous Blocks of N within the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Sequence
      - N (non-zero integer value)
    outputs:
      - List of Blocks (each containing value, start_index, end_index, length)

  - action: FindLongestBlock
    description: From a list of Blocks for a specific value N, find the Block with the maximum length. (Assumes a unique longest block based on examples).
    inputs:
      - List of Blocks for value N
    outputs:
      - The single Block with the greatest length.

  - action: FilterSequence
    description: Create the output sequence by preserving elements belonging to the longest block for each non-zero value and replacing all other non-zero elements with 0.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
      - Set of longest Blocks (one for each unique non-zero value in the input)
    outputs:
      - Output Sequence
