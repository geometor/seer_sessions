The positions of the zeros in the input generally seem to be preserved, unless a non-zero number at that position is changed to zero.\n3.  **Key Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate on contiguous blocks (or runs) of identical non-zero numbers. For each unique non-zero number present in the input (e.g., '3' in `train_1`, '5' in `train_3`), the rule identifies all contiguous blocks of that number.\n4.  **Filtering Logic:** Within the set of blocks for a specific number, the block with the maximum length is identified. Only the elements belonging to this longest block are retained in the output sequence. All other occurrences of that same number (belonging to shorter blocks) are replaced with 0.\n5.  **Independence:** This process seems to be applied independently for each distinct non-zero value found in the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
