task_elements:
  - object: Sequence
    description: A 1D array or list of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - length: The number of elements in the sequence.
      - elements: The individual integers in the sequence (values 0-9).

  - object: Element
    description: A single integer within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The integer itself (0-9).
      - position: The index of the element in the sequence.

  - object: Block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero elements.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer that makes up the block.
      - start_index: The position (0-based index) of the first element of the block.
      - end_index: The position (0-based index) of the last element of the block.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

relationships:
  - type: BelongsTo
    description: An Element belongs to a Sequence.
  - type: Forms
    description: One or more contiguous Elements with the same non-zero value form a Block.
  - type: HasProperty
    description: A Block has properties like value, start_index, end_index, and length.

actions:
  - action: InitializeOutput
    description: Create an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence (for length)
    outputs:
      - Initialized Output Sequence (all zeros)

  - action: IdentifyUniqueNonZeros
    description: Find all unique non-zero integer values present in the input sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
    outputs:
      - Set of unique non-zero integers.

  - action: FindValueBlocks
    description: For a given non-zero value N, find all contiguous Blocks of N within the input Sequence.
    inputs:
      - Input Sequence
      - N (a non-zero integer value)
    outputs:
      - List of Blocks (each containing value, start_index, end_index, length) for value N.

  - action: FindLongestBlockForValue
    description: From a list of Blocks for a specific value N, find the Block with the maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one that appears earliest in the sequence (lowest start_index).
    inputs:
      - List of Blocks for value N
    outputs:
      - The single Block with the greatest length (or None if no blocks exist).

  - action: PopulateOutput
    description: For each identified longest block (one per unique non-zero value), copy the block's value into the corresponding positions (from start_index to end_index) in the output sequence.
    inputs:
      - Output Sequence (initially all zeros)
      - The longest Block identified for a specific non-zero value.
    outputs:
      - Modified Output Sequence (with the longest block's values inserted).
