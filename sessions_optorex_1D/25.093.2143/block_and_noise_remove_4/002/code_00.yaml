Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers (potentially provided as a 1D NumPy array).
  Properties:
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9).
    - Elements are ordered.
    - Can be empty.

Output:
  Type: List of integers.
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input sequence.
    - Derived from the input sequence.
    - Contains only zeros except for the elements of the selected longest block from the input.
    - If input is empty, output is empty.
    - If input contains no non-zero numbers, output contains only zeros.

Core Objects:
  - Sequence: The input (potentially NumPy array) and output (Python list).
  - Element: Individual integer within a sequence.
  - Block: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
    Properties:
      - Start Index (inclusive, 0-based)
      - End Index (inclusive, 0-based)
      - Length (number of elements)

Relationships & Actions:
  - Input Handling: Ensure the input sequence is treated as a 1D list of scalar numbers, regardless of original type (e.g., flatten and convert NumPy array).
  - Identification: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers. Record the start index, end index, and length of each block. Handle blocks at the start/end of the sequence correctly.
  - Comparison: Compare the identified blocks based on their properties.
  - Selection:
    - Find the maximum length among all blocks.
    - Identify all blocks that have this maximum length.
    - If one or more blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest start index (the one appearing earliest in the sequence).
    - If no non-zero blocks are found, no block is selected.
  - Transformation:
    - Create an output list of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros.
    - If a block was selected, copy the integer elements from that block (using its start and end indices) from the original input sequence into the corresponding positions in the output list.
    - If no block was selected, the output list remains all zeros.
