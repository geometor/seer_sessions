**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The key elements are the integers themselves, specifically whether they are zero or non-zero, and their positions within the sequence. The transformation seems to operate based on identifying contiguous groups (or "blocks") of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. The length and position of these blocks appear crucial. The output retains only one specific block of non-zero numbers from the input, replacing all other elements with zeros.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9)
    - Can contain zeros and non-zeros
    - Elements are ordered

Output:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input list
    - Derived from the input list

Core Objects:
  - Sequence: The input and output lists.
  - Element: Individual integer within a sequence.
  - Block: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
    Properties:
      - Start Index
      - End Index
      - Length (number of elements)
      - Elements (the actual non-zero integers)

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identification: The process identifies all contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
  - Comparison: The lengths of these blocks are compared.
  - Selection: The block with the maximum length is selected. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the one occurring earliest (smallest start index) in the sequence is chosen. (Note: Although ties weren't explicitly tested with conflicting outcomes in the examples, selecting the first longest is a reasonable default assumption).
  - Transformation: An output sequence of the same length as the input is created, initially filled with zeros.
  - Preservation: The elements of the selected longest block are copied from the input sequence to their original positions in the output sequence. All other positions in the output sequence remain zero.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks (sequences) of non-zero integers. For each block, note its starting position, ending position, and length.
3.  Find the block that has the greatest length among all identified blocks. If there is a tie for the greatest length, select the block that appears earliest in the input sequence (i.e., the one with the smallest starting position).
4.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
5.  Copy the integers from the selected longest block (identified in step 3) into the corresponding positions (using the starting and ending positions noted in step 2) in the new sequence created in step 4.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
