Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9)
    - Can contain zeros and non-zeros
    - Elements are ordered

Output:
  Type: List of integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input list
    - Derived from the input list

Core Objects:
  - Sequence: The input and output lists.
  - Element: Individual integer within a sequence.
  - Block: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
    Properties:
      - Start Index
      - End Index
      - Length (number of elements)
      - Elements (the actual non-zero integers)

Relationships & Actions:
  - Identification: The process identifies all contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
  - Comparison: The lengths of these blocks are compared.
  - Selection: The block with the maximum length is selected. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the one occurring earliest (smallest start index) in the sequence is chosen. (Note: Although ties weren't explicitly tested with conflicting outcomes in the examples, selecting the first longest is a reasonable default assumption).
  - Transformation: An output sequence of the same length as the input is created, initially filled with zeros.
  - Preservation: The elements of the selected longest block are copied from the input sequence to their original positions in the output sequence. All other positions in the output sequence remain zero.
