The key elements are the integers themselves, specifically whether they are zero or non-zero, and their positions within the sequence. The transformation seems to operate based on identifying contiguous groups (or \"blocks\") of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. The length and position of these blocks appear crucial. The output retains only one specific block of non-zero numbers from the input, replacing all other elements with zeros.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

(Note: Although ties weren't explicitly tested with conflicting outcomes in the examples, selecting the first longest is a reasonable default assumption).\n  - Transformation: An output sequence of the same length as the input is created, initially filled with zeros.\n  - Preservation: The elements of the selected longest block are copied from the input sequence to their original positions in the output sequence.
