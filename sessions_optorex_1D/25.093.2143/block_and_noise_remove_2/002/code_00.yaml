objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers # Confirmed assumption based on successful python execution
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - name: group
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence within the input sequence
      - composition: consists of one or more non-zero integers
      - boundaries: delimited by zeros or sequence ends
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer (0-based index of the first element)
          - end_index: integer (0-based index of the last element)
          - length: integer (number of elements in the group)

actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous groups of non-zero numbers.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence
    outputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects (each with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified groups. Returns 0 if no groups exist.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
    outputs:
      - max_length: integer
  - name: filter_groups_by_max_length
    description: Select only those groups whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
      - max_length: integer
    outputs:
      - longest_groups: list of group objects
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence by placing the elements of the longest groups at their original positions in a sequence otherwise filled with zeros.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence (used to get original values for longest groups)
      - longest_groups: list of group objects (filtered by max length)
      - sequence_length: integer (length of the input/output sequence)
    outputs:
      - output_sequence: sequence

relationships:
  - A group's elements correspond to a slice of the input sequence.
  - The output sequence preserves elements from the input sequence if and only if they belong to a group whose length is equal to the maximum length found across all groups in the input.
  - All positions in the output sequence corresponding to original zeros or elements of non-maximal-length groups are set to zero.
  - If multiple groups share the same maximum length, all of them are preserved in the output. (Implicitly confirmed by the logic, though no examples explicitly test this).
  - If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output is also a sequence of zeros.
