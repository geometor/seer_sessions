            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt resulted in consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...` errors across all training examples. This strongly indicates that the input data, assumed to be `List[int]`, was actually processed as NumPy arrays within the execution environment where the tests were run. The comparison `val != 0` inside the `find_groups` function likely failed because `val` was an element from a NumPy array, and the comparison results in a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated directly in an `if` condition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Data Type:** Verify the exact data type being passed to the `transform` function in the execution environment. Assuming it's NumPy arrays.\n2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the code, particularly the `find_groups` function, to correctly handle NumPy arrays and their element-wise comparisons. Standard Python `int` comparisons should work if elements are accessed correctly, but if the comparison itself yields an array, it needs adjustment. However, given the input format shown (`0 0 1...`), it's more likely that the *parsing* into the function created NumPy arrays, or the test harness used NumPy. The core logic of finding groups, max length, and filtering seems correct conceptually, but its implementation needs to be robust to the actual data type.\n3.  **Re-test:** Re-run the logic mentally or with code execution against the examples to ensure the adapted logic produces the correct outputs.\n\n## Metrics and Error Reproduction\n\nLet's simulate the execution with the assumption that the input is processed in a way that triggers the NumPy error. Since the provided code uses standard Python lists and integers, the error suggests the *testing environment* might be converting the input or using NumPy internally. The error `ValueError: The truth value of an array...` typically occurs with NumPy arrays. We can't directly reproduce the *exact* testing environment error without knowing how it passes data, but we can confirm the *provided Python code* works correctly with standard Python lists.\n\n"
