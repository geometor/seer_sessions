"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by identifying contiguous groups of 
non-zero numbers. It determines the maximum length among these groups and 
constructs an output sequence containing only the elements from the group(s) 
with the maximum length, placed at their original positions. All other 
elements in the output sequence are set to zero.
