objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or 1D array of integers
      - length: 12 (fixed in examples)
      - elements: integers (0 represents a separator/absence, non-zero represents content)
  - name: group
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence within the input sequence
      - composition: consists only of non-zero integers
      - boundaries: delimited by zeros or the sequence ends
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer (0-based index of the first element)
          - end_index: integer (0-based index of the last element)
          - length: integer (number of elements in the group)
          - elements: the actual non-zero integer values from the input sequence belonging to this group

actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous groups of non-zero numbers.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence
    outputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects (each with start_index, end_index, length, and potentially elements)
  - name: find_max_group_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified groups. Returns 0 if no groups exist.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
    outputs:
      - max_length: integer
  - name: filter_longest_groups
    description: Select only those groups from the list whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
      - max_length: integer
    outputs:
      - longest_groups: list of group objects (containing only groups with length == max_length)
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence. Initialize it with zeros. Then, for each group in the 'longest_groups' list, copy its original elements from the input sequence into the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence (needed to retrieve original elements)
      - longest_groups: list of group objects (identified as having the max length)
      - sequence_length: integer (length of the input/output sequence)
    outputs:
      - output_sequence: sequence (same length as input, containing only elements from the longest groups, zeros elsewhere)

relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
  - Elements in the output sequence are either zero or are identical to elements from the input sequence.
  - A non-zero element appears in the output sequence *if and only if* it was part of a contiguous non-zero group in the input sequence, *and* that group's length was equal to the maximum length found among *all* contiguous non-zero groups in the input sequence.
  - If multiple groups share the maximum length, all of them are preserved in the output.
  - If the input contains no non-zero elements, the output consists entirely of zeros.
