The transformation logic focuses on identifying contiguous blocks (groups) of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. The core operation is to filter these groups based on their length, keeping only the longest group(s) and replacing all other elements (including shorter non-zero groups and original zeros) with zeros in the output.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (length 12) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Grouping:** The key operation involves identifying contiguous runs of non-zero numbers. Zeros act as separators between these groups. The specific non-zero value within a group does not seem to affect the grouping itself, only its distinction from zero.\n3.  **Filtering Logic:** The primary criterion for keeping a group is its length (number of consecutive non-zero elements). Only the group(s) with the maximum length found in the input sequence are preserved in the output.\n4.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence is constructed by placing the longest group(s) from the input into an initially zero-filled sequence at their original positions. Elements belonging to shorter non-zero groups or original zero elements become zero in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
