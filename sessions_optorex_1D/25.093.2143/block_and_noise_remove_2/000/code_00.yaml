objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - name: group
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - composition: consists of one or more non-zero integers
      - boundaries: delimited by zeros or sequence ends
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer
          - end_index: integer
          - length: integer (number of elements)
          - elements: list of non-zero integers from the input sequence

actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous groups of non-zero numbers.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence
    outputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects (each with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified groups.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
    outputs:
      - max_length: integer
  - name: filter_groups
    description: Select only those groups whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
      - max_length: integer
    outputs:
      - longest_groups: list of group objects
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence by placing the elements of the longest groups at their original positions in a sequence otherwise filled with zeros.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence
      - longest_groups: list of group objects
      - sequence_length: integer (e.g., 12)
    outputs:
      - output_sequence: sequence

relationships:
  - A group's elements are a subset of the input sequence's elements.
  - The output sequence preserves elements from the input sequence only if they belong to a group with the maximum length.
  - All other positions in the output sequence are filled with zero.
