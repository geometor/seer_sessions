objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list-like sequence of integers (can be Python list or NumPy array)
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - name: group
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence within the input sequence
      - composition: consists of one or more non-zero integers
      - boundaries: delimited by zeros or the sequence's start/end
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer (0-based)
          - end_index: integer (0-based, inclusive)
          - length: integer (number of elements in the group)
          - values: the sequence of non-zero integers comprising the group

actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous groups of non-zero numbers.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence
    outputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects (each with start_index, end_index, length, values)
  - name: find_max_length
    description: Determine the maximum length among all identified groups. Returns 0 if no groups exist.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
    outputs:
      - max_length: integer
  - name: filter_groups_by_max_length
    description: Select only those groups whose length equals the maximum length.
    inputs:
      - list_of_groups: list of group objects
      - max_length: integer
    outputs:
      - longest_groups: list of group objects (only those matching max_length)
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    description: Create the output sequence by placing the elements (values) of the longest groups at their original positions (start_index to end_index) in a sequence otherwise filled with zeros.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence: sequence (used to get original values for longest groups)
      - longest_groups: list of group objects
      - sequence_length: integer (length of the input/output sequence, e.g., 12)
    outputs:
      - output_sequence: sequence (same length and type characteristics as input, but potentially different values)

relationships:
  - A group's `values` are a direct slice of the `input_sequence` from `start_index` to `end_index`.
  - The `output_sequence` preserves elements from the `input_sequence` only if they belong to a group identified in `longest_groups`.
  - All positions in the `output_sequence` not corresponding to an element within one of the `longest_groups` are filled with zero.
  - If multiple groups share the maximum length, all of them are preserved in the output. (Though not observed in examples, the logic supports this).
  - If no non-zero groups exist in the input, the output is entirely zeros.
