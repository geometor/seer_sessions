"""
Filter a sequence of integers to retain only the single longest contiguous subsequence of non-zero values, preserving its original position. If multiple subsequences share the same maximum length, the one appearing earliest (lowest start index) in the input is chosen. All other elements are set to zero. The input is expected as a grid (list of lists) containing a single row, and the output format matches this structure.
