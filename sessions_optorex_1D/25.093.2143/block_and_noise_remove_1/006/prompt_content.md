"""
Given an input grid containing a single row of integers, identify the longest 
contiguous sequence of non-zero integers within that row. Create an output grid 
of the same dimensions (one row, same length) where the identified longest 
sequence is preserved in its original position, and all other elements are set 
to zero.

    # 5. If a longest block exists (length > 0), copy its elements from the input row 
    #    to the corresponding positions in the output row.
    # 6. Construct the output grid containing only the transformed row.
