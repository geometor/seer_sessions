            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers and preserving only that sequence in its original position, surrounded by zeros. The provided Python code implements this logic correctly for a flat list. However, the error messages (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") across all examples strongly indicate that the input data structure is not a flat list as initially assumed. This type of error typically occurs in NumPy or similar array libraries when attempting a boolean check on an entire array or when comparing an array to a scalar in a context expecting a single boolean value. Given the context of similar ARC tasks, it's highly probable that the input is a grid (list of lists), specifically a 1xN grid (a list containing a single list representing one row). The existing logic needs to be applied to the *inner* list (the single row) rather than the outer list containing that row. The output should also maintain the 1xN grid structure.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  Confirm the input structure by assuming it's a list containing one list (e.g., `[[0, 7, 7, ...]]`).\n    2.  Modify the `transform` function to first extract the single row (the inner list) from the input grid.\n    3.  Apply the existing `find_longest_nonzero_block` function to this extracted row.\n    4.  Construct the output as a 1xN grid, where the single row contains the result of the transformation applied to the input row.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The core logic identified (finding the longest contiguous non-zero block) appears correct for all examples when applied to the *content* of the single row within the input grid. The lengths and start indices identified by the `find_longest_nonzero_block` function (when applied to the inner list) correspond precisely to the non-zero segments present in the output grids for all training examples. The error is purely structural, related to accessing the data within the assumed grid format.\n\n    Let's re-verify the block identification for each example assuming the input is `[[...]]` and we operate on the inner list:\n    *   **train_1:** Input `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]`. Blocks: `(start=1, len=4)`, `(start=7, len=1)`, `(start=11, len=1)`. Longest: `(start=1, len=4)`. Output `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_2:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. Blocks: `(start=3, len=1)`, `(start=6, len=6)`. Longest: `(start=6, len=6)`. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_3:** Input `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]`. Blocks: `(start=1, len=6)`, `(start=8, len=1)`, `(start=11, len=1)`. Longest: `(start=1, len=6)`. Output `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_4:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. Blocks: `(start=3, len=1)`, `(start=8, len=3)`. Longest: `(start=8, len=3)`. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_5:** Input `[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0]`. Blocks: `(start=0, len=1)`, `(start=4, len=1)`, `(start=7, len=2)`, `(start=10, len=1)`. Longest: `(start=7, len=2)`. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_6:** Input `[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6]`. Blocks: `(start=0, len=1)`, `(start=3, len=1)`, `(start=5, len=4)`, `(start=11, len=1)`. Longest: `(start=5, len=4)`. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected output structure.\n    *   **train_7:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Blocks: `(start=3, len=1)`, `(start=8, len=4)`. Longest: `(start=8, len=4)`. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Matches expected output structure.\n\n    The metrics confirm the core logic is sound; the implementation needs adjustment for the 1xN grid structure. No need for `tool_code` execution as the analysis is straightforward based on the error message and pattern matching.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
