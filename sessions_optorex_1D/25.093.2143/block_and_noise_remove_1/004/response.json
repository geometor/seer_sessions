            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule based on identifying and isolating the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero integers within a 1D input list. The previous code correctly implemented this core logic by finding blocks, determining the maximum length, and reconstructing the output.\n\nThe errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly indicate an issue with how the input data structure (likely a NumPy array provided by the testing framework, even if conceptually representing a single list) is handled in boolean checks within the `transform` function, specifically the initial emptiness checks (`if not input_grid` or `if not input_grid[0]`). The underlying algorithm for finding the longest non-zero block appears correct based on the input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Assume the input `input_grid` is provided as a list containing a single list (representing a 1-row grid), potentially implemented as a NumPy array by the framework.\n2.  Modify the initial checks in the `transform` function to use `len()` to determine emptiness, avoiding direct boolean evaluation of the potential NumPy array, which causes the reported error.\n3.  Maintain the core logic for finding and isolating the longest non-zero block.\n4.  Ensure the function returns the output in the same structure (a list containing a single list).\n5.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the grid structure (even if just one row) and the refined checks.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n| Example | Input Length | Output Length | Non-Zero Blocks (Start, Length) | Longest Block (Start, Length) | Output Matches Longest Block | Error Cause (Hypothesized) |\n| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------- |\n| train_1 | 12           | 12            | (1, 4), (7, 1), (11, 1)         | (1, 4)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_2 | 12           | 12            | (3, 1), (6, 6)                  | (6, 6)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_3 | 12           | 12            | (1, 6), (8, 1), (11, 1)         | (1, 6)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_4 | 12           | 12            | (3, 1), (8, 3)                  | (8, 3)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_5 | 12           | 12            | (0, 1), (4, 1), (7, 2), (10, 1) | (7, 2)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_6 | 12           | 12            | (0, 1), (3, 1), (5, 4), (11, 1) | (5, 4)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n| train_7 | 12           | 12            | (3, 1), (8, 4)                  | (8, 4)                        | Yes                          | Boolean check on array     |\n\n*Confirmation:* All examples have input and output lists of length 12. The core logic of finding the *longest* block holds for all examples. The error is consistently related to type/structure handling, not the core transformation logic.\n\n**Updated Facts:**\n\n"
