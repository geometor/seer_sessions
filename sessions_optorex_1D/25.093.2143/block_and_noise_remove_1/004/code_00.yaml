task_description: Given an input grid containing a single row of integers, identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero integers within that row. Create an output grid of the same dimensions (one row, same length) where the identified longest sequence is preserved in its original position, and all other elements are set to zero.
input_data:
  type: grid (list of lists)
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (N=12 in examples)
  row_element_type: list of integers
  properties: The row contains zeros and non-zero integers.
output_data:
  type: grid (list of lists)
  dimensions: 1 row, N columns (N=12 in examples)
  row_element_type: list of integers
  properties: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous sequence of non-zero integers copied from the input row's longest non-zero block.

  steps:
    - Check if the input grid or its first row is empty. If so, return an empty grid structure (e.g., [] or [[]] depending on expectation). Use `len()` for checks to avoid errors with array-like inputs.
    - Extract the first (and only) row from the input grid.
    - Find all contiguous subsequences (blocks) of non-zero integers in the extracted row. Record the start index and length of each block.
    - Identify the block with the maximum length. (Assumption: If there are ties for the longest length, the first occurring block is chosen).
    - Create a new list (output row) of the same length as the input row, initialized with zeros.
    - If a longest non-zero block was found (length > 0):
        - Copy the elements of this longest block from the input row into the new output row at the corresponding indices (same start index).
    - Package the output row into a list to form the output grid (list of lists).
  relationships:
    - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (1xN).
    - The non-zero elements in the output row correspond exactly to the elements of the longest contiguous non-zero block in the input row, maintaining original values and position.
    - All other elements in the output row are zero.
