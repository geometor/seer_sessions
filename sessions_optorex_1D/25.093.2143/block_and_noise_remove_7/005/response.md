"""
Transforms an input sequence (1D array of digits) by identifying all contiguous blocks 
(runs) of identical, non-zero digits. It finds the maximum length among these blocks. 
If multiple blocks share this maximum length, it selects the one with the smallest 
starting index (the earliest occurring block). The output sequence is created by 
filling the positions corresponding to this selected block with its digit value, 
and filling all other positions with zeros. If no non-zero blocks exist, the 
output is all zeros.
