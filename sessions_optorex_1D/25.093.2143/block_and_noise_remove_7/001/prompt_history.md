*   **Perception of task elements**:
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.
    *   The transformation rule appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks (subsequences) of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence.
    *   Specifically, the rule focuses on the *longest* such block.
    *   The output sequence retains only this longest block of identical non-zero numbers, preserving its original value and position.
    *   All other elements in the output sequence are set to zero.
    *   If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the examples suggest the one occurring earliest (minimum starting index) or latest (maximum starting index) might be chosen, but all examples provided have a unique longest block or the relative position doesn't matter for the outcome shown. Based on the examples, preserving the block at its original index seems key.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: input_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - contains: single digits (0-9)
      - object: output_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - contains: single digits (0-9)
          - length: same as input_sequence
      - object: block
        properties:
          - type: contiguous sub-sequence within input_sequence
          - criteria: elements are identical and non-zero
          - attributes: value, length, start_index, end_index
      - object: zero
        properties:
          - value: 0
          - role: placeholder/replacement value
    relationships:
      - input_sequence transformed_to output_sequence
      - output_sequence derived_from input_sequence
    actions:
      - identify: all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers in the input_sequence.
      - find: the block with the maximum length among those identified. (Assume uniqueness or a tie-breaking rule if necessary, though not explicit in examples).
      - create: an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
      - copy: the identified longest block from the input_sequence to the output_sequence, maintaining its original position (start and end indices).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Examine the input sequence and identify all contiguous sub-sequences (blocks) where all elements are identical and greater than zero. Record the value, length, and starting index of each such block.
    2.  Determine the maximum length found among all identified blocks.
    3.  Select the block that has this maximum length. (If multiple blocks share the maximum length, assume the one with the smallest starting index is chosen, although the provided examples do not definitively test this tie-breaking scenario).
    4.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
    5.  If a longest block was identified in step 3, copy the elements of that block into the corresponding positions (using its original starting index and length) in the new sequence created in step 4.
    6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
