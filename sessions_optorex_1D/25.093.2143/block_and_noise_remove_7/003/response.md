"""
Transforms an input sequence (1D array of digits) by identifying all contiguous blocks 
(runs) of identical, non-zero digits. It finds the maximum length among these blocks. 
If multiple blocks share this maximum length, it selects the one with the smallest 
starting index. The output sequence is created by filling the positions corresponding 
to this selected block with its digit value, and filling all other positions with zeros. 
If no non-zero blocks exist, the output is all zeros.
