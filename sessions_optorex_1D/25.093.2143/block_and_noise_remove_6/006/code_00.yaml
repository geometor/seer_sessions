Task: Keep only the first longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers from a potentially multi-dimensional input treated as a 1D sequence.

Input:
  Type: List[int] or NumPy array (potentially multi-dimensional).
  Conceptual Structure: Treated as a single flat sequence of integers.
  Properties:
    - Contains non-negative integers.
    - Zero (0) acts as a delimiter for contiguous blocks.
    - Non-zero numbers form the elements of contiguous blocks.

Output:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Same total number of elements as the flattened input.
    - Contains mostly zeros.
    - Preserves one specific contiguous block of non-zero numbers from the flattened input sequence.

Transformation:
  Action: Flatten the input data structure (if multi-dimensional) into a 1D sequence (list) of integers.
  Action: Identify all contiguous blocks (sequences) of non-zero numbers in the flattened 1D sequence.
  Action: For each block, record its start index, end index, and length in the 1D sequence.
  Action: Determine the maximum length found among all identified blocks.
  Action: Select the block that has this maximum length and has the smallest starting index (i.e., the first one encountered).
  Action: Construct the output list, initially filled with zeros, having the same length as the flattened input sequence.
  Action: Copy the values from the selected block (using its recorded start/end indices from the flattened input) into the corresponding positions in the output list.

Relationships:
  - Output elements corresponding to the selected block match the input elements at the same position in the flattened sequence.
  - All other output elements are zero.
  - The selection criteria for the block are maximum length and earliest starting position in the flattened sequence.
  - If no non-zero blocks exist, the output is all zeros.
