"""
Identifies all contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
Determines the maximum length among these blocks.
Selects the first block (by starting index) that achieves this maximum length.
Constructs the output sequence by placing the selected block's numbers at their
original positions and filling all other positions with zero. If no non-zero
numbers exist, the output is all zeros.
