"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array, treated as 1D) by keeping
only the first longest contiguous sequence (block) of non-zero numbers found
within it. All other elements are replaced with zero. If multiple blocks share
the maximum length, the one occurring earliest (smallest starting index) in the
flattened sequence is chosen. If no non-zero numbers are present, the output is
a sequence of zeros of the same length.
