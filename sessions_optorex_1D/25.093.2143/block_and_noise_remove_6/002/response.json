            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, although type-hinted to accept `List[int]`, is being called with NumPy arrays in the testing environment. Standard Python comparisons like `input_list[i] != 0` or `input_list[i] == 0` work element-wise on NumPy arrays, producing a boolean array rather than a single boolean value, which causes the ambiguity error in conditional statements (`if`, `while`).\n\nThe core logic derived previously (identifying all contiguous non-zero blocks, finding the maximum length, selecting the first block with that length, and creating the output) appears to correctly match the transformation observed in all training examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to ensure the implementation correctly handles element-wise comparisons, likely by adapting the code to explicitly work with NumPy arrays if that's the environment's standard, or by ensuring comparisons yield single boolean values where needed (e.g., comparing individual elements accessed by index). For the **dreamer** phase, the focus remains on the logical steps, which seem sound. The **coder** will need to address the implementation detail causing the runtime error.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Consistency:** All 7 training examples consistently follow the pattern of identifying the *first* contiguous block of non-zero numbers that has the *maximum* length found in the input.\n*   **Input/Output Length:** Input and output lists/arrays maintain the same length (12 in all examples).\n*   **Data Types:** Input consists of non-negative integers. Output retains some original non-zero integers, with others replaced by 0.\n*   **Block Identification:** The logic correctly identifies blocks and their properties (start, end, length) in all examples.\n    *   Example 1: Max length 3, first block starts at index 1.\n    *   Example 2: Max length 3, first block starts at index 3.\n    *   Example 3: Max length 4, first block starts at index 7.\n    *   Example 4: Max length 3, first block starts at index 0.\n    *   Example 5: Max length 2, first block starts at index 4.\n    *   Example 6: Max length 7, first block starts at index 3.\n    *   Example 7: Max length 5, first block starts at index 3.\n*   **Error Type:** The runtime error is consistently a `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity, occurring across all examples, indicating a systematic issue with how conditions are evaluated, likely due to NumPy array inputs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
