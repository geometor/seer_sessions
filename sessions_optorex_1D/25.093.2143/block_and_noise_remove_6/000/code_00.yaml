Task: Keep the first longest contiguous block of non-zero numbers.

Input:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Contains non-negative integers.
    - Zero acts as a delimiter for blocks.
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples).

Output:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Same length as input.
    - Contains mostly zeros.
    - Preserves one specific contiguous block of non-zero numbers from the input.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers in the input.
  Action: Calculate the length of each block.
  Action: Find the maximum length among all blocks.
  Action: Select the first block (by starting index) that has the maximum length.
  Action: Construct the output list by placing the selected block's numbers at their original positions and filling all other positions with zero.

Relationships:
  - Output elements corresponding to the selected block match the input elements.
  - All other output elements are zero.
  - The selection criteria for the block are maximum length and earliest starting position.
