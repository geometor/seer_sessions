            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or sequences) of integers, always of the same length (12 in the examples).\n2.  **Key Values:** The lists contain non-negative integers. The number `0` seems to act as a separator or background, while non-zero numbers form foreground \"objects\" or \"blocks\".\n3.  **Transformation Characteristic:** The transformation significantly reduces the number of non-zero elements in the output compared to the input. Typically, only one contiguous block of non-zero numbers from the input is preserved in the output. All other positions become `0`.\n4.  **Identifying the Preserved Block:** By comparing the inputs and outputs, the block of non-zero numbers that is preserved appears to be the *longest* contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers present in the input.\n5.  **Handling Ties:** The examples provided don't explicitly show a tie in the length of the longest blocks. However, examining the order:\n    *   train_1: Longest block `[4, 4, 4]` (length 3) starts at index 1. Output keeps this.\n    *   train_4: Longest block `[8, 8, 8]` (length 3) starts at index 0. Output keeps this.\n    *   train_5: Longest block `[1, 1]` (length 2) starts at index 4. Output keeps this.\n    *   This suggests that if there were multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the one appearing *earliest* (smallest starting index) in the input list is the one preserved.\n6.  **Output Construction:** The output list is constructed by taking the original input list and replacing all numbers with `0`, *except* for the numbers within the identified (first, longest) contiguous block of non-zero numbers.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Each block's information should include its starting index, ending index, and length.\n2.  Iterate through the input list, identifying each contiguous sequence (block) of non-zero numbers. For each block found, record its start index, end index, and calculate its length. Add this information to the list of blocks.\n3.  If no non-zero blocks are found, the output is a list of zeros with the same length as the input.\n4.  If blocks were found, determine the maximum length among all recorded blocks.\n5.  Find the first block in the recorded list (ordered by start index) that has this maximum length. This is the \"target block\".\n6.  Create a new list of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.\n7.  Copy the numbers from the input list that belong to the \"target block\" (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) into the corresponding positions in the new list.\n8.  The resulting new list is the output."
