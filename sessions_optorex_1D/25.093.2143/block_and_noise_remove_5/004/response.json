            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**1. General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, determine the maximum length of such blocks, and keep only the *latest occurring* block among those with the maximum length, zeroing out everything else.\n\nThe execution results show that the previously attempted code failed significantly, returning the input unchanged instead of the transformed output. This indicates a flaw in the implementation logic or execution environment that caused the `output_sequence` (initialized with zeros) to not be correctly populated with the selected block's values, or perhaps it was overwritten.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to:\n*   Re-verify the \"latest longest block\" hypothesis against all examples using code execution for precise block identification.\n*   Confirm that the previously formulated natural language program and YAML facts accurately capture this rule.\n*   The implementation error needs to be addressed by the coder phase, ensuring the output array is correctly constructed based *only* on the selected block and zeros elsewhere.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's use the `_find_blocks` helper function (from the refined code example) to analyze the blocks in each training input and verify the selection process.\n\n"
