objects:
  - sequence:
      description: A list of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - length: The number of digits in the sequence.
        - digits: The individual integer elements.
  - block:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the main sequence.
      properties:
        - digit_value: The non-zero integer that makes up the block.
        - length: The number of digits in the block.
        - start_index: The 0-based index of the first digit of the block in the main sequence.
        - end_index: The 0-based index of the last digit of the block in the main sequence.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits. Record their digit value, start index, end index, and length.
      inputs: input_sequence
      outputs: list_of_blocks
  - find_max_length:
      description: Determine the maximum length among all identified blocks. If no blocks exist, the max length is 0.
      inputs: list_of_blocks
      outputs: max_length
  - filter_by_max_length:
      description: Select blocks from the list that have the maximum length.
      inputs: list_of_blocks, max_length
      outputs: list_of_longest_blocks
  - select_last_block:
      description: If one or more blocks have the maximum length, choose the one with the largest start_index (the one appearing latest in the sequence). If no blocks were found initially, there is no block to select.
      inputs: list_of_longest_blocks
      outputs: selected_block (or null/none if no blocks)
  - generate_output:
      description: Create the output sequence. Initialize a sequence of the same length as the input, filled with zeros. If a 'selected_block' exists, copy its 'digit_value' into the output sequence from the block's 'start_index' to its 'end_index'. Otherwise, the output remains all zeros.
      inputs: input_sequence_length, selected_block (optional)
      outputs: output_sequence
relationships:
  - comparison: Block lengths are compared to find the maximum.
  - position: Block start indices are compared to select the last block among those with maximum length.
  - transformation: The input sequence is transformed into the output sequence based on the properties of the identified blocks. The selected block directly determines the non-zero elements of the output.
