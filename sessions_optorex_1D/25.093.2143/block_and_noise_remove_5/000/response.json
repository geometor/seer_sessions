Specifically, the longest block of identical non-zero digits seems to be preserved.\n    *   If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum length, the block that appears latest (furthest to the right) in the sequence is the one preserved.\n    *   All digits in the input sequence that are not part of the selected block (including zeros and digits from other non-selected blocks) are replaced with '0' in the output sequence.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
