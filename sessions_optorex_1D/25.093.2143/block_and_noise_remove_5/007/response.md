"""
Identifies all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. 
Finds the maximum length among these blocks. Selects the block(s) with this maximum length. 
If there are multiple blocks with the maximum length, chooses the one that appears latest (furthest to the right, i.e., highest start index) in the sequence. 
Creates an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros. 
Places the digits of the selected block at their original positions in the output sequence. 
All other positions remain zero.
