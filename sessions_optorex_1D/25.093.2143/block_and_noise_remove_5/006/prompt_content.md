"""
Identify all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. 
Find the maximum length among these blocks. Select the block(s) with this maximum length. 
If there are multiple blocks with the maximum length, choose the one that appears latest (furthest to the right, i.e., highest start index) in the sequence. 
Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros. 
Place the digits of the selected block at their original positions in the output sequence. 
All other positions remain zero.
