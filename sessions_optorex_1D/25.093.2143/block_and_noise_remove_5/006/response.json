The comparison between the input, expected output, and the actual output generated by the provided code reveals a flaw in the implementation, not necessarily the logic. In every test case, the `transform` function returned the original input sequence, indicating that the step responsible for constructing the new output sequence (filling with zeros and then placing the selected block) was either missing, bypassed, or incorrectly implemented. The strategy for resolving the error is to ensure the code correctly initializes an output sequence of zeros and then populates the segment corresponding to the `selected_block` with its `digit_value`.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The `_find_blocks` function appears to work correctly based on manual verification against the examples. The issue lies within the main `transform` function's handling of the results from `_find_blocks`. The critical failure is that the `output_sequence`, which is correctly initialized with zeros, is not modified according to the `selected_block`'s properties before being returned (or the modified sequence is somehow discarded). The code returns the *input* sequence instead of the constructed *output* sequence.\n\n    Let's use `tool_code` to verify the block finding and selection logic for a couple of examples:\n    "
