            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe Python code failed execution on all provided examples with the identical error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This specific error strongly indicates that the input data being passed to the `transform` function during testing is not a simple list of integers as initially perceived from the flat string representation (`0 0 1 0...`). Instead, the elements being iterated over and compared (`val != 0`) are likely NumPy arrays or sequences with multiple elements.\n\nThis typically occurs when operating on multi-dimensional data (like a grid or matrix) where the iteration yields rows or columns. The comparison `array != 0` results in a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated as a single True/False value in an `if` condition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-interpret Input Structure:** Assume the input is effectively a 2D structure (e.g., a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array), where each primary element (`val` in the loop `for val in data_list`) represents a row (or possibly column). Based on the examples, it appears to be an N x M grid, likely 12x1 given the initial formatting, treated as a list/array of 12 rows.\n2.  **Adapt \"Non-Zero\" Definition:** A \"non-zero\" element in this context likely means a row containing at least one non-zero value. The `_find_non_zero_indices` function needs to be adapted to check this condition (e.g., using `numpy.any()`).\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The fundamental transformation logic (find the contiguous block of \"non-zero\" rows, shift this block vertically by 3 positions, pad with \"zero\" rows) remains the same.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the handling of row-based structures and the modified definition of a \"non-zero\" element.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n*   **Consistency:** The *same* `ValueError` occurred for *all* 7 training examples and the single test example.\n*   **Error Location:** The error originates specifically within the `_find_non_zero_indices` helper function, at the line `if val != 0:`.\n*   **Implication:** This implies that `val` is consistently an object for which direct comparison to `0` followed by boolean evaluation is ambiguous \u2013 characteristic of a multi-element array (specifically a NumPy array, given the error message is common with NumPy).\n*   **Input Structure Hypothesis:** The most plausible input structure causing this error is a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array, where iteration yields entire rows. Example: `input_list = np.array([[0], [0], [1], [0], ...])`. During iteration, `val` would be `np.array([0])` or `np.array([1])`. While `np.array([1]) != 0` results in `array([ True])`, which *can* evaluate to True, if a row had multiple elements like `np.array([7, 4])`, then `np.array([7, 4]) != 0` yields `array([ True, True])`, causing the ambiguity error in the `if` statement. Therefore, even if the examples *look* like Nx1 grids, the code must handle potentially NxM grids, or the test harness uses NumPy arrays in a way that triggers this.\n*   **Transformation Validation (Conceptual):** Assuming the input is row-based (e.g., 12x1), the original logic holds:\n    *   `train_1`: Row `[1]` at index 2 shifts to index 5. Output: `[[0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [1], [0], ..., [0]]`. Matches.\n    *   `train_2`: Rows `[7]` (index 0) and `[4]` (index 1) shift to start at index 3. Output: `[[0], [0], [0], [7], [4], [0], ..., [0]]`. Matches.\n    *   This pattern holds for all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
