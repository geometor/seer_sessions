# No external libraries like numpy needed based on the core logic identified.

"""
Identifies a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within an input list, 
shifts this block 3 positions to the right, and places it into an 
output list of the same size, padded with zeros elsewhere. Handles cases 
where the shifted block might extend beyond the list boundaries by truncating 
the block. If the input list contains only zeros, the output list will also 
contain only zeros.
