*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers.
    *   All provided examples have sequences of length 12.
    *   The core transformation involves relocating a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the sequence.
    *   The relative order and values of the non-zero numbers are preserved.
    *   The block of non-zero numbers is consistently shifted 3 positions to the right.
    *   The output sequence is padded with zeros in the positions not occupied by the shifted block.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant (12).

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input list of integers.
    2.  Initialize an output list of the same length as the input list, filled entirely with zeros.
    3.  Identify the index of the first non-zero element in the input list (`first_nz_index`). If no non-zero elements exist, the output list remains all zeros; proceed to step 7.
    4.  Identify the index of the last non-zero element in the input list (`last_nz_index`).
    5.  Extract the sublist (the "block") from the input list starting at `first_nz_index` and ending at `last_nz_index` (inclusive).
    6.  Place this extracted block into the output list, starting at index `first_nz_index + 3`. Ensure the elements are placed correctly relative to this new starting position.
    7.  Return the constructed output list.
