Task: Relocate a sequence segment.
Input:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Fixed length (12)
    - Contains zeros and non-zero digits.
Output:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Same length as input.
Objects:
  - Zero: Represents empty space or background.
  - Non-Zero Digit: Represents content to be moved.
  - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits. Identified by its start and end index in the input.
Action:
  Name: Shift Right
  Target: Non-Zero Block
  Parameter: Shift amount (3 positions)
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is generated by taking the input sequence, identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers, removing it, and re-inserting it 3 positions to the right of its original starting position.
  - A new sequence, initially filled with zeros, is used to construct the output.
  - The relative order of elements within the Non-Zero Block is preserved.
Edge Cases (Implicit):
  - If no non-zero block exists, the output is likely identical to the input (sequence of all zeros).
  - The shift operation assumes the shifted block fits within the sequence boundaries.
