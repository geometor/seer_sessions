Zeros seem to fill the space.\n*   **Key Observation:** Comparing input and output, the contiguous block of non-zero numbers is shifted 3 positions to the right. The relative order of the digits within the block remains unchanged. The vacated positions and any positions overwritten by the shift are filled with zeros.\n\n**Fact Extraction:**\n\n"

Identified by its start and end index in the input.\nAction:\n  Name: Shift Right\n  Target: Non-Zero Block\n  Parameter: Shift amount (3 positions)\nRelationship:\n  - The output sequence is generated by taking the input sequence, identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers, removing it, and re-inserting it 3 positions to the right of its original starting position.\n  - A new sequence, initially filled with zeros, is used to construct the output.\n  - The relative order of elements within the Non-Zero Block is preserved.\nEdge Cases (Implicit):\n  - If no non-zero block exists, the output is likely identical to the input (sequence of all zeros).\n  - The shift operation assumes the shifted block fits within the sequence boundaries.\n```"
