Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence is consistently 12 in all provided examples.
*   **Content:** The sequences contain zeros and other digits (1-9).
*   **Structure:** The non-zero digits often appear clustered together, forming a contiguous block, surrounded by zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve relocating the block of non-zero digits within the sequence. Zeros seem to fill the space.
*   **Key Observation:** Comparing input and output, the contiguous block of non-zero numbers is shifted 3 positions to the right. The relative order of the digits within the block remains unchanged. The vacated positions and any positions overwritten by the shift are filled with zeros.

**Fact Extraction:**


```yaml
Task: Relocate a sequence segment.
Input:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Fixed length (12)
    - Contains zeros and non-zero digits.
Output:
  Type: List
  Element_Type: Integer
  Properties:
    - Same length as input.
Objects:
  - Zero: Represents empty space or background.
  - Non-Zero Digit: Represents content to be moved.
  - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits. Identified by its start and end index in the input.
Action:
  Name: Shift Right
  Target: Non-Zero Block
  Parameter: Shift amount (3 positions)
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is generated by taking the input sequence, identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers, removing it, and re-inserting it 3 positions to the right of its original starting position.
  - A new sequence, initially filled with zeros, is used to construct the output.
  - The relative order of elements within the Non-Zero Block is preserved.
Edge Cases (Implicit):
  - If no non-zero block exists, the output is likely identical to the input (sequence of all zeros).
  - The shift operation assumes the shifted block fits within the sequence boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Find the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`) of this block. If no non-zero numbers are present, return the original sequence.
2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new sequence by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.
4.  Copy the identified block of non-zero numbers (from `start_index` to `end_index` of the input sequence) into the new sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index.
5.  Return the new sequence.
