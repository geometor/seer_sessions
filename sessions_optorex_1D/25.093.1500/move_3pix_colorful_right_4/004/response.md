**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training examples with a `ValueError` related to NumPy array truth value ambiguity. This indicates that the input data, assumed to be a simple list of integers, is likely being passed to the `transform` function (or its helper `find_nonzero_block`) as a NumPy array, potentially even a multi-dimensional one (e.g., shape (1, 12)). The comparison `if digit != 0` fails when `digit` is an array resulting from iterating over a multi-dimensional array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the code to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, ensuring the core logic operates on a flattened, 1D sequence of integers.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Re-verify the core transformation logic (find the first contiguous non-zero block, shift it right by 3 positions into an array of zeros) against all examples now that the input format issue is identified.
3.  **Refine Implementation:** Correct the `find_nonzero_block` and `transform` functions based on the refined understanding of input types and the transformation rule.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language program to accurately reflect the input structure and transformation.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's re-examine the examples using code execution to confirm the structure and the proposed transformation rule (find first non-zero block, shift right by 3).


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_nonzero_block_indices(sequence):
    """Finds start and end indices (inclusive) of the first contiguous non-zero block."""
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    in_block = False
    sequence_length = len(sequence)

    for i, digit in enumerate(sequence):
        if digit != 0 and not in_block:
            start_index = i
            in_block = True
        if digit == 0 and in_block:
            end_index = i - 1
            break
        if digit != 0 and in_block and i == sequence_length - 1:
            end_index = i
            break
            
    if start_index != -1 and end_index != -1:
        return start_index, end_index
    # Handle case where only the first element is non-zero and the rest are zero
    elif start_index == 0 and in_block and end_index == -1 and sequence_length > 1 and all(d == 0 for d in sequence[1:]):
        return start_index, start_index
    # Handle case where only the last element is non-zero (already covered by loop logic)
    # Handle case where a single non-zero element exists somewhere in the middle
    elif start_index != -1 and in_block and end_index == -1:
         return start_index, start_index # Should be covered by the 'digit == 0 and in_block' check earlier
    else:
        return None # No block found

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The metrics confirm that the core logic identified previously is correct for all provided training examples and the hypothesized edge cases:
1.  The input is a 1D sequence of 12 integers.
2.  The transformation identifies the first contiguous block of non-zero integers.
3.  It calculates a target starting position by adding 3 to the block's original starting index.
4.  It creates a new sequence of 12 zeros.
5.  It copies the identified block into the new sequence starting at the target position.
6.  If the block extends beyond the sequence boundary (length 12) during the copy, the exceeding part is truncated (or simply not copied).
7.  If no non-zero block is found, the output is a sequence of 12 zeros.

The previous code failure was therefore due to incorrect handling of the input data type (likely NumPy array) within the function, not an error in the transformation logic itself.

  Dimensions: 1D (or treat as flattened 1D)
  Length: 12
  Properties:
    - Contains zeros and non-zero digits (0-9).
Output:
  Type: Sequence (List)
  Element_Type: Integer
  Dimensions: 1D
  Length: 12
Objects:
  - Zero (0): Represents empty space or background filler.
  - Non_Zero_Digit: An integer from 1 to 9.
  - Non_Zero_Block: 
      Type: Sub-sequence
      Definition: The first contiguous sequence of one or more Non_Zero_Digits found when scanning the input from left to right.
      Properties:
        - start_index: The 0-based index of the first digit in the block within the input sequence.
        - end_index: The 0-based index of the last digit in the block within the input sequence.
        - content: The ordered list of Non_Zero_Digits in the block.
  - Input_Sequence: The original sequence of 12 integers.
  - Output_Sequence: The transformed sequence of 12 integers. Initialized with all Zeros.
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right_And_Copy
  Source_Object: Non_Zero_Block from Input_Sequence
  Target_Object: Output_Sequence
  Parameters:
    - shift_amount: 3 (integer)
  Procedure:
    1. Identify the Non_Zero_Block in the Input_Sequence.
    2. If no Non_Zero_Block is found, the Output_Sequence remains all Zeros.
    3. If a Non_Zero_Block is found:
       a. Calculate the target_start_index = Non_Zero_Block.start_index + shift_amount.
       b. Iterate through the Non_Zero_Block.content. For each digit at relative position `i` (0-based) within the block:
          i. Calculate the target_index = target_start_index + `i`.
          ii. If target_index is within the bounds of the Output_Sequence (0 <= target_index < 12), place the digit at Output_Sequence[target_index].
          iii. If target_index is out of bounds, the digit is discarded (truncation).
Relationship:
  - The Output_Sequence is derived from the Input_Sequence by relocating the identified Non_Zero_Block according to the Shift_Right_And_Copy action.
  - The relative order of digits within the Non_Zero_Block is preserved in the Output_Sequence, subject to boundary truncation.
Edge Cases:
  - Input contains only Zeros: Output is all Zeros.
  - Non_Zero_Block shift results in the entire block being placed outside the sequence boundaries: Output is all Zeros.
  - Non_Zero_Block shift results in partial truncation: Only the part of the block fitting within the boundaries appears in the Output_Sequence.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers (handle potential NumPy array format by flattening if necessary).
2.  Create a new output sequence of length 12, initialized with all zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence from left to right (index 0 to 11) to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. This marks the `start_index` of the non-zero block.
4.  If no non-zero digit is found, return the output sequence (which is all zeros).
5.  Continue scanning from the `start_index` until either a zero is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached. The index of the last non-zero digit found in this contiguous block is the `end_index`.
6.  Extract the sub-sequence (the non-zero block) from the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
7.  Calculate the target starting position in the output sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 3`.
8.  Iterate through the extracted non-zero block. For each digit and its relative position `i` within the block (where `i` goes from 0 to `block_length - 1`):
    a.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = target_start_index + i`.
    b.  Check if the `target_index` is valid (i.e., `0 <= target_index < 12`).
    c.  If the `target_index` is valid, place the current digit from the block into the output sequence at the `target_index`.
    d.  If the `target_index` is invalid (>= 12), stop copying the rest of the block (truncation occurs).
9.  Return the final output sequence.
