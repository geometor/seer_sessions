"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or array of 12 integers) by identifying the 
first contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting this block 3 positions 
to the right within a new sequence of 12 zeros. If no non-zero block exists, 
returns a sequence of 12 zeros. The relative order of the digits within the 
block is preserved.
