Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings containing space-separated integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** All example sequences (input and output) have a length of 12 integers.
*   **Content:** The sequences consist of single-digit non-negative integers, primarily zeros and some non-zero values.
*   **Core Transformation:** The primary change between input and output is the position of the non-zero numbers. The non-zero numbers maintain their relative order within their block. Zeros act as padding or background.
*   **Pattern:** It appears a contiguous block of non-zero numbers is identified in the input and then shifted to the right by a fixed amount in the output. The space created by the shift, and the space originally occupied by zeros, are filled with zeros.

**Detailed Observations:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Block:** In each input, there's a sequence of one or more non-zero numbers grouped together (e.g., `1 5 7 4 3 8 2` in train_1, `1 1 8 5` in train_2, `1` in train_3).
2.  **Shift Amount:** Let's track the starting position (index, 0-based) of the non-zero block.
    *   train_1: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_2: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_3: Starts at index 6 -> Starts at index 9 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_4: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_5: Starts at index 0 -> Starts at index 3 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_6: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)
    *   train_7: Starts at index 6 -> Starts at index 9 (Shift = +3)
3.  **Consistency:** The shift amount is consistently +3 positions to the right for the *start* of the non-zero block.
4.  **Zero Handling:** The output sequence is reconstructed by placing the original non-zero block at its new shifted position and filling all other positions with zeros. The total length remains 12.

**YAML Fact Document:**

task_description: Shift a block of non-zero numbers within a sequence.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - content: non-negative integers (mostly zeros and single digits)
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence
      - content: contiguous non-zero integers from the input sequence
      - relative_order: preserved between input and output
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding or background element
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence
    output:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - block_content: list of integers
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3 (constant)
    output:
      - new_start_index: integer
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input:
      - total_length: integer
      - new_start_index: integer
      - block_content: list of integers
    output:
      - output_sequence: list of integers (filled with zeros and the shifted block)
relationships:
  - The output sequence is a transformation of the input sequence.
  - The non_zero_block is extracted from the input and inserted into the output at a new position.
  - The position shift is constant (+3) based on the starting index of the non_zero_block.
  - Zeros fill the positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Find the first contiguous sequence (block) of non-zero integers within the input sequence. Record its starting index and the sequence of numbers itself.
3.  If no non-zero numbers are found, the output is identical to the input.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero block by adding 3 to its original starting index.
5.  Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
6.  Place the recorded non-zero block into the new sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  The resulting sequence is the output.
