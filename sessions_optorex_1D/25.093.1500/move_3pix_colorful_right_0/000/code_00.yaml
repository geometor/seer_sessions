task_description: Shift a block of non-zero numbers within a sequence.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - content: non-negative integers (mostly zeros and single digits)
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence
      - content: contiguous non-zero integers from the input sequence
      - relative_order: preserved between input and output
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding or background element
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence
    output:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - block_content: list of integers
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3 (constant)
    output:
      - new_start_index: integer
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input:
      - total_length: integer
      - new_start_index: integer
      - block_content: list of integers
    output:
      - output_sequence: list of integers (filled with zeros and the shifted block)
relationships:
  - The output sequence is a transformation of the input sequence.
  - The non_zero_block is extracted from the input and inserted into the output at a new position.
  - The position shift is constant (+3) based on the starting index of the non_zero_block.
  - Zeros fill the positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block.
