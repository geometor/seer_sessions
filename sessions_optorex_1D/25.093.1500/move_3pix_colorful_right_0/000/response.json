The non-zero numbers maintain their relative order within their block. Zeros act as padding or background.\n*   **Pattern:** It appears a contiguous block of non-zero numbers is identified in the input and then shifted to the right by a fixed amount in the output. The space created by the shift, and the space originally occupied by zeros, are filled with zeros.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-Zero Block:** In each input, there's a sequence of one or more non-zero numbers grouped together (e.g., `1 5 7 4 3 8 2` in train_1, `1 1 8 5` in train_2, `1` in train_3).\n2.  **Shift Amount:** Let's track the starting position (index, 0-based) of the non-zero block.\n    *   train_1: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_2: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_3: Starts at index 6 -> Starts at index 9 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_4: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_5: Starts at index 0 -> Starts at index 3 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_6: Starts at index 2 -> Starts at index 5 (Shift = +3)\n    *   train_7: Starts at index 6 -> Starts at index 9 (Shift = +3)\n3.  **Consistency:** The shift amount is consistently +3 positions to the right for the *start* of the non-zero block.\n4.  **Zero Handling:** The output sequence is reconstructed by placing the original non-zero block at its new shifted position and filling all other positions with zeros. The total length remains 12.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
