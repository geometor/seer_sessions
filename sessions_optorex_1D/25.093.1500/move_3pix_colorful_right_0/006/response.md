**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results indicate a consistent error across all examples: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically arises in Python when a boolean check (like `if condition:`) is performed on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, as NumPy doesn't know whether to evaluate the condition based on *any* element being true or *all* elements being true.

This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, while designed based on the observed *logic*, was implemented assuming standard Python lists and integers, but the testing environment is passing NumPy arrays as input.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Type:** Verify that the input to the `transform` function in the execution environment is indeed a NumPy array.
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the Python code (specifically the `_find_first_non_zero_block` helper and potentially parts of `transform`) to correctly handle NumPy arrays and their element-wise comparison semantics. This might involve explicit loops, using NumPy functions like `np.nonzero`, or converting the input NumPy array to a Python list at the beginning of the function. Given the nature of the task (finding the *first* block), iterating through the array elements might be the most straightforward approach.
3.  **Retest:** Ensure the adapted code passes all training examples.

**Metrics Gathering**

The core logic identified previously (shifting the first non-zero block right by 3 positions) appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples. Let's re-verify the parameters for each training case:


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_str, output_str):
    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]
    n = len(input_list)

    # Find first non-zero block in input
    input_start_index = -1
    input_block = []
    for i, num in enumerate(input_list):
        if num != 0:
            if input_start_index == -1:
                input_start_index = i
            input_block.append(num)
        elif input_start_index != -1:
            break # End of first block

    # Find first non-zero block in output
    output_start_index = -1
    output_block = []
    for i, num in enumerate(output_list):
         if num != 0:
            if output_start_index == -1:
                output_start_index = i
            output_block.append(num)
         elif output_start_index != -1:
             break # End of first block

    if input_start_index != -1:
        shift = output_start_index - input_start_index
        block_len = len(input_block)
        return {
            "input_start": input_start_index,
            "input_block": input_block,
            "block_len": block_len,
            "output_start": output_start_index,
            "output_block": output_block,
            "shift": shift,
            "length": n
        }
    else: # Handle cases with no non-zero block (though none seem present here)
         return {
            "input_start": None,
            "input_block": [],
            "block_len": 0,
            "output_start": None,
            "output_block": [],
            "shift": None,
            "length": n
         }

examples = [
    ("0 0 1 5 7 4 3 8 2 0 0 0", "0 0 0 0 0 1 5 7 4 3 8 2"),
    ("0 0 1 1 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 0", "0 0 0 0 0 1 1 8 5 0 0 0"),

]

analysis_results = []
for i, (inp, outp) in enumerate(examples):
    result = analyze_example(inp, outp)
    analysis_results.append(f"Example {i+1}: {result}")

print("\n".join(analysis_results))
```
```

```
The analysis confirms the initial hypothesis:
*   In all examples, a single contiguous block of non-zero integers exists.
*   The relative order and values of the numbers within the block are preserved.
*   The block's starting position is consistently shifted exactly 3 indices to the right.
*   The total length of the sequence remains 12.
*   Positions outside the shifted block in the output are filled with zeros.

The failure was purely an implementation issue related to handling the data type (likely NumPy arrays) used in the test environment.

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
task_description: Shifts the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers found in an input sequence 3 positions to the right, padding with zeros.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or numpy array of integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - content: non-negative integers
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence or sub-array
      - content: the first contiguous sequence of non-zero integers found in the input sequence
      - relative_order: preserved between input and output
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding element filling space not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence (list or numpy array)
    output:
      - start_index: integer (0-based index of the first element of the block, or indicator like None if no block)
      - block_content: list or numpy array of integers (the block itself)
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3 (constant positive integer)
    output:
      - new_start_index: integer (calculated start index for the output)
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input:
      - total_length: integer (length of the original sequence)
      - new_start_index: integer
      - block_content: list or numpy array of integers
    output:
      - output_sequence: list or numpy array of integers (of total_length, filled with zeros and the shifted block)
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non_zero_block.
  - The relocation is a fixed rightward shift of 3 positions applied to the block's starting index.
  - Elements of the non_zero_block that would fall outside the sequence boundaries after shifting are truncated.
  - If no non_zero_block exists in the input, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (which may be a list or a NumPy array) of integers. Let its length be N.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the starting index of the *first* non-zero element.
3.  If no non-zero element is found, return the original input sequence.
4.  If a non-zero element is found at `start_index`, continue iterating from that position to identify the contiguous block of all subsequent non-zero elements. Store this block.
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.
6.  Create a new output sequence of length N, initially filled entirely with zeros.
7.  Iterate through the stored non-zero block. For each element in the block at relative position `i` (0-based within the block), calculate its target index in the output sequence as `new_start_index + i`.
8.  If the calculated `target_index` is within the bounds of the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= target_index < N`), place the block element at that index in the output sequence. Otherwise (if the element would fall outside the sequence due to the shift), discard that element (truncation).
9.  Return the constructed output sequence (maintaining the original data type if possible, e.g., return a NumPy array if the input was an array).
