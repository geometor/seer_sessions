            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed during execution because it expected a string input (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method on it. However, the testing environment supplied the input as a `numpy.ndarray` object, which does not have a `.split()` method.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying a non-zero block and shifting it right by 3 positions) appears consistent across the examples based on the initial analysis. The strategy to resolve the error involves modifying the function signature and internal logic to directly accept and process a list or numpy array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`) and the final string joining step (`\" \".join(...)`). The output should also likely be a list or numpy array of integers, matching the probable expected output format in the test environment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the original examples and the error message:\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially `List[int]`) in the execution environment, contrary to the initial assumption of `str`.\n*   **Output Data Type:** Likely expected to be `numpy.ndarray` or `List[int]`.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 integers for both input and output in all training examples.\n*   **Element Type:** Integers.\n*   **Non-Zero Block:** A single contiguous block of non-zero integers is present in each input.\n*   **Transformation:** The non-zero block is shifted 3 positions to the right.\n*   **Relative Order:** The relative order of elements within the non-zero block is preserved.\n*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted non-zero block are filled with 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
