**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed during execution because it expected a string input (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method on it. However, the testing environment supplied the input as a `numpy.ndarray` object, which does not have a `.split()` method.

The core transformation logic (identifying a non-zero block and shifting it right by 3 positions) appears consistent across the examples based on the initial analysis. The strategy to resolve the error involves modifying the function signature and internal logic to directly accept and process a list or numpy array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`) and the final string joining step (`" ".join(...)`). The output should also likely be a list or numpy array of integers, matching the probable expected output format in the test environment.

**Metrics:**

Based on the original examples and the error message:

*   **Input Data Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially `List[int]`) in the execution environment, contrary to the initial assumption of `str`.
*   **Output Data Type:** Likely expected to be `numpy.ndarray` or `List[int]`.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 integers for both input and output in all training examples.
*   **Element Type:** Integers.
*   **Non-Zero Block:** A single contiguous block of non-zero integers is present in each input.
*   **Transformation:** The non-zero block is shifted 3 positions to the right.
*   **Relative Order:** The relative order of elements within the non-zero block is preserved.
*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted non-zero block are filled with 0.

actions:
  - name: identify_first_non_zero_block # Renamed for clarity
    input: input_sequence (list/array of integers)
    output:
      - start_index: integer (or None if no block found)
      - block_content: list of integers (or empty list if no block found)
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: start_index
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3 (constant)
    output:
      - new_start_index: integer
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input:
      - total_length: integer
      - new_start_index: integer
      - block_content: list of integers
    output:
      - output_sequence: list or array of integers # Updated based on error
relationships:
  - The output sequence is a transformation of the input sequence.
  - The first non_zero_block is extracted from the input and inserted into the output at a new position.
  - The position shift is constant (+3) based on the starting index of the non_zero_block.
  - Zeros fill the positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block.
  - If no non-zero block exists, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Find the starting index and the content of the *first* contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
3.  If no non-zero integers are found, return a copy of the original input sequence.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block by adding 3 to its original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initialized entirely with zeros.
6.  Determine the number of elements in the non-zero block found in step 2.
7.  Place the elements of the non-zero block into the new output sequence, starting at the target starting index calculated in step 4. Ensure that the placement does not exceed the bounds of the output sequence; truncate the block if necessary.
8.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.
