actions:
  - name: standardize_input
    inputs:
      - raw input sequence (list, np.array 1D/2D)
    outputs:
      - flattened 1D list of 12 integers
    description: "Ensure the input is represented as a flat list of integers."
  - name: identify_block
    inputs:
      - standardized input list
    outputs:
      - block_values (list of non-zero digits)
      - start_index (integer, index of the first digit in the block, or None if no block)
    description: "Find the first contiguous sequence of non-zero digits. Record the digits and the index where the block begins. Returns None for start_index if no non-zero digits are found."
  - name: calculate_new_position
    inputs:
      - start_index
      - shift_amount (constant: 3)
    outputs:
      - new_start_index (integer)
    description: "Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding the shift amount to the original start index."
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - sequence_length (constant: 12)
      - block_values
      - new_start_index
    outputs:
      - output sequence (list of 12 integers)
    description: "Create a new sequence containing 12 zeros. Place the block_values into this sequence starting at the new_start_index, respecting the sequence boundaries (length 12)."
relationships:
  - The output sequence length is identical to the input sequence length (12).
  - The relative order and values of digits within the non-zero block are preserved during the shift.
  - The shift amount is constant (+3 positions) for all examples.
  - The positions in the output not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly 12 digits.
  - If non-zero digits exist, they form a single contiguous block.
  - If the shift causes the block to extend beyond index 11, only the parts of the block fitting within indices 0-11 are placed in the output.
