Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences of 12 single-digit integers, separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain the digit '0' and other digits (1-9). The non-zero digits appear to form a single contiguous block within the sequence. The '0's seem to act as padding or background.
3.  **Transformation:** By comparing inputs and outputs, it's clear that the contiguous block of non-zero digits present in the input is relocated within the output sequence. The relative order and values of the digits within this block remain unchanged.
4.  **Movement:** The block of non-zero digits consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.
5.  **Padding:** The positions in the output sequence that are not occupied by the shifted block are filled with '0'. The original positions of the block in the input become '0's in the output, and any '0's originally in the target location of the shifted block are overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: shift_block
    inputs:
      - block
      - start index
      - shift amount (constant: 3)
    outputs:
      - new start index
    description: "Calculate the new starting position by adding 3 to the original start index."
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original sequence length (constant: 12)
      - shifted block
      - new start index
    outputs:
      - output sequence
    description: "Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length, then place the shifted block at its new starting position."
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block.
  - The length of the input and output sequences is identical (12).
  - The relative order of digits within the non-zero block is preserved.
  - The shift amount is constant (3 positions to the right).
assumptions:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation assumes the sequence length is sufficient; if shifting pushes part of the block beyond index 11, it gets placed up to index 11 (effectively truncating or fitting within the fixed length).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine the starting index and the ending index of this block. If no non-zero digits exist, the output remains all zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure placement respects the 12-digit boundary of the output sequence.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
