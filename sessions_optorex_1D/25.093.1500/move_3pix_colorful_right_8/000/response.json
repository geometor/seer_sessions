The non-zero digits appear to form a single contiguous block within the sequence. The '0's seem to act as padding or background.\n3.  **Transformation:** By comparing inputs and outputs, it's clear that the contiguous block of non-zero digits present in the input is relocated within the output sequence. The relative order and values of the digits within this block remain unchanged.\n4.  **Movement:** The block of non-zero digits consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.\n5.  **Padding:** The positions in the output sequence that are not occupied by the shifted block are filled with '0'. The original positions of the block in the input become '0's in the output, and any '0's originally in the target location of the shifted block are overwritten.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
