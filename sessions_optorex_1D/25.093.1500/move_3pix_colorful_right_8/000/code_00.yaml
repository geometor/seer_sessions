task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - name: length
        value: 12
      - name: items
        value: single digits (0-9)
  - type: block
    properties:
      - name: content
        value: contiguous sequence of non-zero digits
      - name: source
        value: identified within the input sequence
  - type: background
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
      - name: role
        value: padding / filler
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    inputs:
      - input sequence
    outputs:
      - non-zero block
      - start index of the block
      - end index of the block
    description: "Find the first and last non-zero digits to define the contiguous block."
  - name: shift_block
    inputs:
      - block
      - start index
      - shift amount (constant: 3)
    outputs:
      - new start index
    description: "Calculate the new starting position by adding 3 to the original start index."
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original sequence length (constant: 12)
      - shifted block
      - new start index
    outputs:
      - output sequence
    description: "Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length, then place the shifted block at its new starting position."
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block.
  - The length of the input and output sequences is identical (12).
  - The relative order of digits within the non-zero block is preserved.
  - The shift amount is constant (3 positions to the right).
assumptions:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation assumes the sequence length is sufficient; if shifting pushes part of the block beyond index 11, it gets placed up to index 11 (effectively truncating or fitting within the fixed length).
