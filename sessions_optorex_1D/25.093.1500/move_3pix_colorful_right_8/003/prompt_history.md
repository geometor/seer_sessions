Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences of 12 single-digit integers, separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain the digit '0' and other digits (1-9). The non-zero digits appear to form a single contiguous block within the sequence. The '0's seem to act as padding or background.
3.  **Transformation:** By comparing inputs and outputs, it's clear that the contiguous block of non-zero digits present in the input is relocated within the output sequence. The relative order and values of the digits within this block remain unchanged.
4.  **Movement:** The block of non-zero digits consistently shifts 3 positions to the right.
5.  **Padding:** The positions in the output sequence that are not occupied by the shifted block are filled with '0'. The original positions of the block in the input become '0's in the output, and any '0's originally in the target location of the shifted block are overwritten.

**YAML Facts:**

relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the non-zero block.
  - The length of the input and output sequences is identical (12).
  - The relative order of digits within the non-zero block is preserved.
  - The shift amount is constant (3 positions to the right).
assumptions:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation assumes the sequence length is sufficient; if shifting pushes part of the block beyond index 11, it gets placed up to index 11 (effectively truncating or fitting within the fixed length).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine the starting index and the ending index of this block. If no non-zero digits exist, the output remains all zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 3 to its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure placement respects the 12-digit boundary of the output sequence.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code failed execution because it expects a string input which it then parses (`input_str.split()`), while the testing environment appears to pass the input directly as a numerical sequence (indicated by the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`).

The core logic implemented in the `find_nonzero_block` function and the subsequent shifting mechanism seems consistent with the visual pattern observed across all training examples (identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence of 12).

The strategy is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step.
2.  Keep the `find_nonzero_block` helper function as its logic remains valid.
3.  Ensure the output is returned in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array of integers, matching the corrected input assumption).

**Metrics**

Based on the provided examples and the execution error:

*   **Input Data Type:** Interpreted by the execution environment as `numpy.ndarray` (or similar sequence type like a list), not a string.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for all inputs and outputs.
*   **Data Elements:** Integers ranging from 0 to 9.
*   **Key Feature:** A single contiguous block of non-zero digits exists in each input (or the input is all zeros).
*   **Transformation:** Rightward shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Amount:** Constant +3 positions.
*   **Boundary Handling:** When shifting, the block is placed starting at the new index. If the block extends beyond index 11, it appears to be implicitly handled by placing elements up to index 11 (based on the code's boundary check `if output_index < n:`).
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error occurred for all examples, confirming the input type mismatch is the primary issue.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the starting index of the first non-zero digit.
4.  If no non-zero digit is found, return the initialized output sequence of zeros.
5.  If a non-zero digit is found, continue iterating from the start index to identify the end index of the contiguous block of non-zero digits, collecting these digit values into a separate list (the "block").
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the original starting index found in step 3.
7.  Iterate through the collected block digits. For each digit, calculate its position in the output sequence (new start index + index within the block).
8.  If the calculated output position is within the bounds of the output sequence (index 0 to 11), place the digit at that position in the output sequence, overwriting the initial zero.
9.  Return the final output sequence.
