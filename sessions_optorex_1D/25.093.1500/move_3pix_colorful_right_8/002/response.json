            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code failed execution because it expects a string input which it then parses (`input_str.split()`), while the testing environment appears to pass the input directly as a numerical sequence (indicated by the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`).\n\nThe core logic implemented in the `find_nonzero_block` function and the subsequent shifting mechanism seems consistent with the visual pattern observed across all training examples (identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence of 12).\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step.\n2.  Keep the `find_nonzero_block` helper function as its logic remains valid.\n3.  Ensure the output is returned in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array of integers, matching the corrected input assumption).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the provided examples and the execution error:\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** Interpreted by the execution environment as `numpy.ndarray` (or similar sequence type like a list), not a string.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for all inputs and outputs.\n*   **Data Elements:** Integers ranging from 0 to 9.\n*   **Key Feature:** A single contiguous block of non-zero digits exists in each input (or the input is all zeros).\n*   **Transformation:** Rightward shift of the non-zero block.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Constant +3 positions.\n*   **Boundary Handling:** When shifting, the block is placed starting at the new index. If the block extends beyond index 11, it appears to be implicitly handled by placing elements up to index 11 (based on the code's boundary check `if output_index < n:`).\n*   **Error Consistency:** The same `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error occurred for all examples, confirming the input type mismatch is the primary issue.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
