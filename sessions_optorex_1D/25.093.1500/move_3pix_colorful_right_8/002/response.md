**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code failed execution because it expects a string input which it then parses (`input_str.split()`), while the testing environment appears to pass the input directly as a numerical sequence (indicated by the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`).

The core logic implemented in the `find_nonzero_block` function and the subsequent shifting mechanism seems consistent with the visual pattern observed across all training examples (identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence of 12).

The strategy is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step.
2.  Keep the `find_nonzero_block` helper function as its logic remains valid.
3.  Ensure the output is returned in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array of integers, matching the corrected input assumption).

**Metrics**

Based on the provided examples and the execution error:

*   **Input Data Type:** Interpreted by the execution environment as `numpy.ndarray` (or similar sequence type like a list), not a string.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for all inputs and outputs.
*   **Data Elements:** Integers ranging from 0 to 9.
*   **Key Feature:** A single contiguous block of non-zero digits exists in each input (or the input is all zeros).
*   **Transformation:** Rightward shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Amount:** Constant +3 positions.
*   **Boundary Handling:** When shifting, the block is placed starting at the new index. If the block extends beyond index 11, it appears to be implicitly handled by placing elements up to index 11 (based on the code's boundary check `if output_index < n:`).
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error occurred for all examples, confirming the input type mismatch is the primary issue.

  - name: calculate_new_position
    inputs:

    description: "Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the original start index."
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original sequence length (constant: 12)
      - non-zero block values
      - new start index
    outputs:
      - output sequence (list/array of integers)
    description: "Create a new sequence of 12 zeros, then place the non-zero block values into this sequence starting at the calculated new start index, respecting the sequence boundaries."
relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length and data type as the input sequence.
  - The relative order and values of digits within the non-zero block are preserved during the shift.
  - The shift magnitude is constant (+3).
assumptions:
  - Input is a list or array of 12 integers.
  - Each input contains at most one contiguous block of non-zero digits.
  - If no non-zero digits exist, the output is all zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the starting index of the first non-zero digit.
4.  If no non-zero digit is found, return the initialized output sequence of zeros.
5.  If a non-zero digit is found, continue iterating from the start index to identify the end index of the contiguous block of non-zero digits, collecting these digit values into a separate list (the "block").
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the original starting index found in step 3.
7.  Iterate through the collected block digits. For each digit, calculate its position in the output sequence (new start index + index within the block).
8.  If the calculated output position is within the bounds of the output sequence (index 0 to 11), place the digit at that position in the output sequence, overwriting the initial zero.
9.  Return the final output sequence.
