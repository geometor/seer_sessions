task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits 3 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - name: data_type
        value: list or array of integers
      - name: length
        value: 12
      - name: items
        value: single digits (0-9)
  - type: block
    properties:
      - name: content
        value: contiguous sequence of non-zero digits
      - name: source
        value: identified within the input sequence
      - name: uniqueness
        value: assumed to be the single non-zero feature in the sequence
  - type: background
    properties:
      - name: value
        value: 0
      - name: role
        value: padding / filler
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    inputs:
      - input sequence (list/array of integers)
    outputs:
      - non-zero block values (list of integers)
      - start index of the block (integer)
      - end index of the block (integer)
    description: "Find the first and last index of the contiguous sequence of non-zero digits and extract the digit values."
  - name: calculate_new_position
    inputs:
      - original start index
      - shift amount (constant: 3)
    outputs:
      - new start index
    description: "Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the original start index."
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original sequence length (constant: 12)
      - non-zero block values
      - new start index
    outputs:
      - output sequence (list/array of integers)
    description: "Create a new sequence of 12 zeros, then place the non-zero block values into this sequence starting at the calculated new start index, respecting the sequence boundaries."
relationships:
  - The output sequence has the same length and data type as the input sequence.
  - The relative order and values of digits within the non-zero block are preserved during the shift.
  - The shift magnitude is constant (+3).
assumptions:
  - Input is a list or array of 12 integers.
  - Each input contains at most one contiguous block of non-zero digits.
  - If no non-zero digits exist, the output is all zeros.
