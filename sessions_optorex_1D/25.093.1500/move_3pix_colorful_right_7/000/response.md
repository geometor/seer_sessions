*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits, represented as strings separated by spaces.
    *   The core operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the right.
    *   Specifically, the entire sequence seems to be shifted 3 positions to the right.
    *   The first 3 elements of the output sequence are always zeros.
    *   The elements shifted off the right end of the input sequence are discarded.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant at 12.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - length: 12
      - name: output_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - length: 12
      - name: padding_elements
        properties:
          - value: 0
          - count: 3
    actions:
      - name: shift_right
        parameters:
          - object: input_sequence
          - amount: 3 positions
      - name: prepend
        parameters:
          - object: shifted_sequence
          - elements: padding_elements
      - name: truncate
        parameters:
          - object: input_sequence (before shifting)
          - position: Keep first 9 elements (length - shift_amount)
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is formed by taking the first 9 elements of the input sequence and placing them starting at the 4th position of the output sequence.
      - The first 3 positions of the output sequence are filled with padding elements (zeros).
    constants:
      - sequence_length: 12
      - shift_amount: 3
      - padding_value: 0
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Start with the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Take the first 9 digits from the input sequence (from index 0 to 8).
    3.  Create a new sequence of 12 digits.
    4.  Place three '0' digits at the beginning of the new sequence (at indices 0, 1, and 2).
    5.  Place the 9 digits selected in step 2 into the new sequence, starting from the 4th position (index 3) and continuing to the end (index 11).
    6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
