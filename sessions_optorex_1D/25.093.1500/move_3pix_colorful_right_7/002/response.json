            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The provided code consistently failed across all training and test examples with the error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.\n    *   This error occurs within the `parse_input` function, specifically at the line `input_str.strip().split()`.\n    *   The error message clearly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not the expected string (`input_str`). The `.strip()` method is a string method and cannot be called on a NumPy array.\n    *   The core transformation logic (shifting elements right by 3, padding with zeros) was therefore never actually executed or tested due to this initial input type mismatch.\n    *   **Strategy:** The primary fix involves modifying the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a standard Python list) directly, removing or bypassing the `parse_input` step which assumes string input. The rest of the logic (calculating slice indices, creating padding, concatenating) needs to be adapted to work with list/array types. The `format_output` function might still be necessary if the final required output format is a space-separated string.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Consistency:** The `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` error occurred in 100% of the examples (7 train, 1 test shown).\n    *   **Error Location:** The error consistently originates in the `parse_input` function due to incorrect input type assumption.\n    *   **Untested Logic:** The core data transformation logic (slicing, padding, concatenation) was not reached in any example.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
