            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: a right shift of the sequence content by 3 positions, prepending with zeros, and truncating the original end.\n    *   The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` consistently occurs because the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it. However, the execution environment is passing a NumPy array directly to the function.\n    *   The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept the NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) as input, removing the string parsing step (`parse_input_string`). The output formatting step (`format_output_list`) should still be used to produce the final string output.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** The execution errors confirm that the `transform` function receives `numpy.ndarray` as input across all examples.\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** The core logic (shift, truncate, pad) derived from visual inspection appears consistent across the examples provided initially. The errors prevented testing this logic programmatically.\n    *   **Input/Output Length:** All input and output examples show sequences of length 12.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
