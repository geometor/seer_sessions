*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: a right shift of the sequence content by 3 positions, prepending with zeros, and truncating the original end.
    *   The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` consistently occurs because the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it. However, the execution environment is passing a NumPy array directly to the function.
    *   The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept the NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) as input, removing the string parsing step (`parse_input_string`). The output formatting step (`format_output_list`) should still be used to produce the final string output.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** The execution errors confirm that the `transform` function receives `numpy.ndarray` as input across all examples.
    *   **Transformation Logic:** The core logic (shift, truncate, pad) derived from visual inspection appears consistent across the examples provided initially. The errors prevented testing this logic programmatically.
    *   **Input/Output Length:** All input and output examples show sequences of length 12.

        parameters:

        parameters:
          - value: 0

        parameters:
          - sequence1: padding_elements

        output: output_sequence (as list/array)
      - name: format_output
        parameters:
          - object: output_sequence (as list/array)
        output: space-separated string representation
    relationships:
      - The output_sequence (before formatting) is formed by concatenating the padding_elements followed by the truncated_input_segment.
    constants:
      - sequence_length: 12
      - shift_amount: 3
      - padding_value: 0
      - elements_to_keep: 9 # sequence_length - shift_amount
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a sequence (NumPy array or list) of 12 integers.
    2.  Select the first 9 integers from the input sequence.
    3.  Create a sequence containing three '0' integers (the padding).
    4.  Concatenate the padding sequence followed by the selected 9 integers to create a new sequence of 12 integers.
    5.  Convert the resulting sequence of integers into a single string, with each integer separated by a space.
    6.  Return the formatted string.
