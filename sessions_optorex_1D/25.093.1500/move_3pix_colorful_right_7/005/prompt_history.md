*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits, represented as strings separated by spaces.
    *   The core operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the right.
    *   Specifically, the entire sequence seems to be shifted 3 positions to the right.
    *   The first 3 elements of the output sequence are always zeros.
    *   The elements shifted off the right end of the input sequence are discarded.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant at 12.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Start with the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Take the first 9 digits from the input sequence (from index 0 to 8).
    3.  Create a new sequence of 12 digits.
    4.  Place three '0' digits at the beginning of the new sequence (at indices 0, 1, and 2).
    5.  Place the 9 digits selected in step 2 into the new sequence, starting from the 4th position (index 3) and continuing to the end (index 11).
    6.  The resulting sequence is the output.

## General Assessment

The provided information shows a consistent transformation rule across all examples, but the previous code failed during execution. The error messages (`invalid literal for int()`) and the warnings (`Input sequence length is 1`) strongly indicate that the `transform` function was not correctly handling the input format provided by the execution environment. The initial analysis assumed the function would receive a space-separated string, parse it, transform it, and format it back to a string. However, the errors suggest either the function received the raw string and attempted conversion incorrectly, or it received a pre-parsed list/array (perhaps wrapped in another list, leading to length 1) and didn't handle that structure as expected.

The core transformation logic observed (right shift by 3, padding with zeros) appears correct and is consistent across all examples, as verified by the code execution below.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic based on the consistent examples.
2.  Assume the `transform` function *must* handle the input string format as presented in the examples (`"digit digit ..."`) and produce the output string format.
3.  Implement the `transform` function robustly to parse the input string into a list of integers, perform the transformation logic, and format the resulting list back into a space-separated string.

## Metrics and Verification

The following metrics were gathered and verified using `tool_code`:

*   **Input Format:** Space-separated string of digits.
*   **Output Format:** Space-separated string of digits.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output across all examples.
*   **Transformation:** Right shift by 3 positions.
*   **Padding:** Prepend 3 zeros (`0`) to the shifted sequence.
*   **Truncation:** The first 9 elements (Length - Shift Amount) of the input sequence are kept; the last 3 are discarded.

The verification confirms that the logic (take first 9, prepend 3 zeros) correctly transforms the input to the output for all provided examples.

    parameters:

    output: output_sequence
  - name: format_list_to_string
    parameters:
      - input: output_sequence
    output: output_string

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is formed by concatenating the padding_elements and the truncated_input_sequence.
  - The output_string is the space-separated string representation of the output_sequence.
  - The truncated_input_sequence consists of the first (sequence_length - shift_amount) elements of the input_sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing 12 digits separated by spaces.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers (the `input_sequence`).
3.  Determine the number of elements to keep from the start of the `input_sequence`, which is the total sequence length (12) minus the shift amount (3), resulting in 9 elements.
4.  Select the first 9 elements from the `input_sequence` to create a `truncated_input_sequence`. Discard the remaining elements.
5.  Create a `padding_sequence` consisting of 3 zero (0) digits.
6.  Construct the `output_sequence` by concatenating the `padding_sequence` followed by the `truncated_input_sequence`. The `output_sequence` will have 12 elements.
7.  Format the `output_sequence` back into a single string with elements separated by spaces.
8.  Return the formatted output string.
