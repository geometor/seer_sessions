task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence 3 positions to the right."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    description: "A sequence of single digits (0-9) separated by spaces."
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 0
    description: "Represents empty space or padding within the sequence."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    description: "A contiguous sub-sequence containing only non-zero digits (1-9)."
    relationship: "Contained within the main sequence."
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: "The fixed number of positions the non_zero_block is moved to the right."
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: sequence
    output: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    description: "Find the first and last non-zero digits to define the boundaries of the non_zero_block."
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: sequence, non_zero_block, start_index, shift_amount
    output: modified_sequence
    description: "Move the non_zero_block 3 positions to the right within the sequence, adjusting the positions of the zero digits accordingly."
constraints:
  - "The length of the sequence remains unchanged."
  - "The digits within the non_zero_block and their relative order remain unchanged."
  - "There is only one contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence."
  - "The shift is always exactly 3 positions to the right."
