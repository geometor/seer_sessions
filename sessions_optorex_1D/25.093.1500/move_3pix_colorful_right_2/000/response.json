This block might be at the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle, surrounded by '0's.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. The non-zero block itself remains unchanged in terms of the digits it contains and their order. The surrounding '0's adjust their positions to accommodate this shift. Specifically, the block consistently moves 3 positions to the right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
