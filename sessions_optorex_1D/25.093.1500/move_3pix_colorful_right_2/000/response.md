Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
*   **Key Components:** The sequences consist of '0' digits and non-zero digits (1-9).
*   **Pattern:** In each input sequence, there's a contiguous block of non-zero digits. This block might be at the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle, surrounded by '0's.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. The non-zero block itself remains unchanged in terms of the digits it contains and their order. The surrounding '0's adjust their positions to accommodate this shift. Specifically, the block consistently moves 3 positions to the right.

**Facts:**

  - name: shift_block_right
    input: sequence, non_zero_block, start_index, shift_amount
    output: modified_sequence
    description: "Move the non_zero_block 3 positions to the right within the sequence, adjusting the positions of the zero digits accordingly."
constraints:
  - "The length of the sequence remains unchanged."
  - "The digits within the non_zero_block and their relative order remain unchanged."
  - "There is only one contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence."
  - "The shift is always exactly 3 positions to the right."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the sequence. Determine its starting and ending positions.
3.  If no non-zero block exists (all zeros), return the input sequence unchanged.
4.  Create a new sequence of the same length, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting position for the non-zero block by adding 3 to its original starting position.
6.  Copy the identified non-zero block into the new sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
7.  Return the new sequence.
