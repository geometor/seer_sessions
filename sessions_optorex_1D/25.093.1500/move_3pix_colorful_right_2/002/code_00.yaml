task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a numerical array 3 positions to the right."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: numpy_array_or_list
    description: "A 1-dimensional sequence (list or NumPy array) of numbers (integers observed)."
  - name: zero_value
    type: number
    value: 0
    description: "Represents empty space or padding within the sequence."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    description: "A contiguous sub-sequence containing only non-zero numbers."
    relationship: "Contained within the main sequence."
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: "The fixed number of positions the non_zero_block is moved to the right."
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: sequence
    output: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    description: "Find the first and last non-zero numbers to define the boundaries of the contiguous non_zero_block."
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: sequence, non_zero_block, start_index, shift_amount
    output: modified_sequence
    description: "Create a new sequence of the same length, filled with zeros, and place the non_zero_block shifted 3 positions to the right compared to its original start index."
constraints:
  - "The input is a 1D list or NumPy array of numbers."
  - "The length of the sequence remains unchanged in the output."
  - "The numbers within the non_zero_block and their relative order remain unchanged."
  - "There is only one contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input sequence."
  - "The shift is always exactly 3 positions to the right."
  - "Elements of the block shifted past the end of the array are truncated." # Observed implicitly in example 5 & 6
