Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
*   **Key Components:** The sequences consist of '0' digits and non-zero digits (1-9).
*   **Pattern:** In each input sequence, there's a contiguous block of non-zero digits. This block might be at the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle, surrounded by '0's.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the contiguous block of non-zero digits. The non-zero block itself remains unchanged in terms of the digits it contains and their order. The surrounding '0's adjust their positions to accommodate this shift. Specifically, the block consistently moves 3 positions to the right.

**Facts:**

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed across all examples with the same error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function was written expecting a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment supplied NumPy arrays.

The underlying logic identified in the previous "dreamer" phase (finding a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it 3 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence) appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The strategy for resolution is to rewrite the `transform` function and its helper (`find_non_zero_block`) to operate directly on NumPy arrays, eliminating the string parsing (`.split()`) and joining (`' '.join()`).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Due to the immediate type error, the provided code could not execute to provide internal metrics. However, we can analyze the inputs and outputs manually or conceptually to confirm the pattern holds and gather relevant data points. The key metric is the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output.

*   **train_1:** Input block `[6 3 9 3 2 8]` starts at index 2. Output block starts at index 5 (2+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_2:** Input block `[9 9 9 6 5]` starts at index 0. Output block starts at index 3 (0+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_3:** Input block `[3 1 7 2 3]` starts at index 3. Output block starts at index 6 (3+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_4:** Input block `[6 5 2 5 1 8 8]` starts at index 0. Output block starts at index 3 (0+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_5:** Input block `[4 2 9 1 6]` starts at index 4. Output block starts at index 7 (4+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_6:** Input block `[4 7 4 7 3 9]` starts at index 3. Output block starts at index 6 (3+3). Length = 12.
*   **train_7:** Input block `[4 4 6]` starts at index 0. Output block starts at index 3 (0+3). Length = 12.

**Observations:**
*   All inputs are 1D sequences of length 12.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
*   The transformation consistently involves shifting this block 3 positions to the right.
*   The length of the sequence remains 12, with zeros filling the vacated space and any space before the shifted block.
*   The values and order within the non-zero block are preserved.
