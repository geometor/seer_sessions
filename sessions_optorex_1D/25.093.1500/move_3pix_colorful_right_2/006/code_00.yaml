task_description: "Shift the single contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a 1D numerical array 3 positions to the right, maintaining array length."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: 1d_numerical_array # Changed from list_of_digits/string
    description: "A 1D array of numbers (likely integers), typically of fixed length (e.g., 12)."
    properties:
      - length: Fixed (e.g., 12 based on examples)
  - name: zero_value
    type: number
    value: 0
    description: "Represents empty or padding elements within the sequence."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_array # Changed from sub_sequence
    description: "A contiguous sub-array containing only non-zero numbers."
    relationship: "Contained within the main sequence. Assumed to be unique per sequence based on examples."
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: "The fixed number of positions the non_zero_block is moved to the right."
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: sequence (array)
    output: block_values, start_index, end_index
    description: "Find the start and end indices and the values of the contiguous block of non-zero numbers."
  - name: shift_block_right
    input: sequence (array), block_values, start_index, shift_amount
    output: modified_sequence (array)
    description: "Create a new array of the same size, initialized with zeros, and place the block_values starting at start_index + shift_amount, respecting array boundaries."
constraints:
  - "The length of the sequence remains unchanged."
  - "The numbers within the non_zero_block and their relative order remain unchanged."
  - "There is only one contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input sequence."
  - "The shift is always exactly 3 positions to the right."
  - "Input is provided as a numerical array (e.g., NumPy array), not a string." # Added based on error
