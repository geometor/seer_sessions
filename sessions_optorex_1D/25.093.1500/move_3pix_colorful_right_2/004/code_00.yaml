task_description: "Shift the single contiguous block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence exactly 3 positions to the right, maintaining sequence length by padding with zeros."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    representation: space-separated_string
    length: 12 # observed in all examples
    description: "A sequence of single digits (0-9)."
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 0
    representation: '0'
    description: "Represents empty space or padding within the sequence."
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    value_range: 1-9
    representation: '1' through '9'
    description: "Digits forming the block to be shifted."
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    composition: "Composed exclusively of non_zero_digits."
    property: "Must be contiguous (no zeros within the block)."
    cardinality: "Exactly one such block exists in the input sequence."
    description: "The segment of the sequence that is moved."
  - name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: "The 0-based index of the first digit in the non_zero_block in the input sequence."
  - name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: "The 0-based index of the last digit in the non_zero_block in the input sequence."
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: "The fixed number of positions the non_zero_block is moved to the right."
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input_string (space-separated digits)
    output: list_of_digit_characters
    description: "Convert the input string into a list of characters."
  - name: find_non_zero_block_indices
    input: list_of_digit_characters
    output: start_index, end_index
    description: "Iterate through the list to find the first non-zero digit (start_index) and the last consecutive non-zero digit (end_index). Returns None if no non-zero digits found."
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input: list_of_digit_characters, start_index, end_index, shift_amount
    output: new_list_of_digit_characters
    description: "Create a new list of the same length, filled with '0'. Calculate the new start position (start_index + shift_amount). Copy the slice corresponding to the non_zero_block from the input list to the new list, starting at the new start position. Handle boundary conditions if the shift pushes the block partially or fully out of bounds (though not observed in examples)."
  - name: format_output
    input: new_list_of_digit_characters
    output: output_string (space-separated digits)
    description: "Join the elements of the new list with spaces."
constraints:
  - "Input and output sequences have the same fixed length (12)."
  - "The input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits."
  - "Digits within the non_zero_block maintain their value and relative order."
  - "The shift is always exactly 3 positions to the right."
  - "If the input contains only zeros, the output is identical to the input." # Inferred, but consistent.
