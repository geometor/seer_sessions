**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero digits 3 positions to the right. The provided examples consistently demonstrate this pattern. However, the NumPy-based Python code (`code_00.py`) failed to implement this transformation, resulting in outputs identical to the inputs across all test cases.

The likely cause of failure is an error in the implementation of the block identification or shifting logic within the NumPy code. The logic itself, as described in the initial natural language program and observations, appears sound and consistent with the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Revert to Simpler Implementation:** Discard the NumPy approach for now, as it introduced errors. Revert to the conceptually simpler list/string manipulation approach outlined in the first Python code block in the initial prompt. This approach directly mirrors the observed operations on the sequence elements.
2.  **Refine Implementation Details:** Ensure the list-based implementation correctly handles:
    *   Parsing the input string into a list of digit characters.
    *   Accurately finding the start and end indices of the *first* contiguous non-zero block.
    *   Handling the edge case where no non-zero block exists (all zeros).
    *   Creating the new list initialized with zeros.
    *   Calculating the new start index (original start + 3).
    *   Copying the non-zero block elements to the new list at the shifted positions, being careful with list indices.
    *   Joining the resulting list back into a space-separated string.
3.  **Validate:** Mentally walk through one or two examples using the refined list-based logic to confirm it produces the correct output.

**Metrics Gathering**

Based on visual inspection and manual calculation across all training examples:

*   **Input/Output Format:** Space-separated strings of single digits.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 digits in all examples.
*   **Key Element:** A single contiguous block of non-zero digits (1-9).
*   **Transformation:** Positional shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Direction:** Right.
*   **Shift Amount:** Exactly 3 positions for all examples.
*   **Padding:** Zeros ('0') act as padding. Original positions of the block become zeros, and the new sequence maintains the original length.

*Example Breakdown (train_1):*
Input: `0 0 6 3 9 3 2 8 0 0 0 0`
Non-zero block: `6 3 9 3 2 8`
Original start index: 2
Original end index: 7
Block length: 6
Shift amount: +3
New start index: 2 + 3 = 5
New end index: 7 + 3 = 10
Output: `0 0 0 0 0 6 3 9 3 2 8 0` (Indices 5 through 10 are filled with the block)

*Example Breakdown (train_5):*
Input: `0 0 0 0 4 2 9 1 6 0 0 0`
Non-zero block: `4 2 9 1 6`
Original start index: 4
Original end index: 8
Block length: 5
Shift amount: +3
New start index: 4 + 3 = 7
New end index: 8 + 3 = 11
Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 9 1 6` (Indices 7 through 11 are filled with the block)

The metrics consistently support the rule across all provided examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a single string of space-separated digits.
2.  Split the input string into a list of individual digit characters. Let the length of this list be `N`.
3.  Initialize `start_index` and `end_index` to track the non-zero block (e.g., set to `None`).
4.  Iterate through the list of digit characters with their indices (`i` from 0 to `N-1`):
    a.  If the current character is not '0':
        i.  If `start_index` is `None`, set `start_index` to the current index `i`.
        ii. Set `end_index` to the current index `i`.
    b.  If the current character is '0' and `start_index` is not `None`, this signifies the end of the *first* contiguous block; stop searching further.
5.  If `start_index` remains `None` after checking the entire list (meaning all digits were '0'), join the original list back into a space-separated string and return it.
6.  Create a new list `output_list` of length `N`, initially filled with '0' characters.
7.  Define the `shift_amount` as 3.
8.  Calculate the `new_start_index` as `start_index + shift_amount`.
9.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `(end_index - start_index)`:
    a.  Calculate the source index in the original list: `source_idx = start_index + i`.
    b.  Calculate the target index in the `output_list`: `target_idx = new_start_index + i`.
    c.  If `target_idx` is less than `N` (i.e., within the bounds of the list), copy the character from the original list at `source_idx` to the `output_list` at `target_idx`.
10. Join the characters in the `output_list` with spaces to form the output string.
11. Return the output string.
