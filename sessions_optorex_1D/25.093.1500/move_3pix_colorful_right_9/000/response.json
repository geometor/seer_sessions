The core operation appears to be spatial rearrangement based on the values within the sequence. Specifically, non-zero elements are treated as a cohesive block that is shifted within the sequence.\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output (12 elements in all examples).\n2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the individual integers in the sequence. We can distinguish between zero and non-zero integers. A significant composite object is the contiguous block of non-zero integers.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the block of consecutive non-zero integers (if any exist) and shifts this entire block 3 positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift and the positions originally occupied by the start of the shifted block become zeros. If the input consists entirely of zeros, the output remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
