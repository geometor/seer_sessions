"""
Identifies the sub-sequence within the input sequence that starts at the first non-zero 
element and ends at the last non-zero element (the "non-zero span"). This entire span 
is then shifted 3 positions to the right. The output sequence is initialized with zeros, 
and the shifted span is placed into it. Elements shifted beyond the sequence boundary 
are truncated. If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output sequence also 
contains only zeros.
