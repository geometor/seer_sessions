**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation appears to be spatial rearrangement based on the values within the sequence. Specifically, non-zero elements are treated as a cohesive block that is shifted within the sequence.

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the individual integers in the sequence. We can distinguish between zero and non-zero integers. A significant composite object is the contiguous block of non-zero integers.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the block of consecutive non-zero integers (if any exist) and shifts this entire block 3 positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift and the positions originally occupied by the start of the shifted block become zeros. If the input consists entirely of zeros, the output remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: non_zero_block
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of the input_sequence containing only non-zero integers, bounded by zeros or the sequence ends.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - elements: The non-zero integers forming the block.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    source: non_zero_block (from input_sequence)
    target: non_zero_block (in output_sequence)
    details: The starting index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is exactly 3 greater than its starting index in the input_sequence.
  - type: element_replacement
    details: All positions in the output_sequence are initially zero. The non_zero_block from the input is then placed into the output_sequence at the calculated shifted position.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    description: Find the first and last indices bounding the contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers. Extract this sequence. Handle the case where no non-zero numbers exist.
  - action: construct_output
    input: input_sequence_length, non_zero_block, start_index
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length as the input. Place the non_zero_block into this new sequence starting at index (start_index + 3). If no non_zero_block was found, the output is the sequence of zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero number (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero number (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-zero numbers are found in the input sequence, the process is complete, and the initialized output sequence (all zeros) is the result.
5.  If non-zero numbers are found, extract the sub-sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) from the input sequence. This is the `non_zero_block`.
6.  Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the `start_index`.
7.  Place the extracted `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target position.
8.  Return the final output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt failed consistently across all examples with a NumPy-specific error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous..."). This indicates the issue likely wasn't with the core transformation logic itself (which seemed correct based on manual checks) but rather with how the code interacted with NumPy arrays during conditional checks or iteration within the `find_non_zero_span` helper function or its usage.

The core logic identified previously seems sound:
1.  Identify the contiguous block (span) of non-zero numbers, defined by the index of the first non-zero number and the index of the last non-zero number.
2.  If no non-zero numbers exist, the output is all zeros.
3.  If non-zero numbers exist, shift this entire span 3 positions to the right.
4.  Create an output sequence of the same length, initialized to zeros.
5.  Place the shifted span into the output sequence. Elements shifted beyond the sequence boundary are truncated (discarded).

**Strategy:**
1.  **Verify Logic:** Re-confirm the "shift span right by 3" logic against all examples using code execution for precise metrics.
2.  **Refine Implementation Approach:** Adopt a robust method for identifying the non-zero span, potentially using NumPy's built-in functions like `np.nonzero` to avoid potential pitfalls with manual iteration and boolean checks on array elements if that was the source of the previous error.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the verified logic, including handling of edge cases like all-zero inputs and boundary truncation.

**Metrics Analysis (using `tool_code`):**

**Assessment of `tool_code` Error:** The error `TypeError: Object of type int64 is not JSON serializable` occurred because the NumPy arrays contained `int64` type numbers by default, which the standard Python `json` library cannot serialize directly.

All examples match the 'shift span right by 3' rule: True

```
**Metrics Summary:** The code execution confirms that the "shift the non-zero span right by 3 positions" rule correctly describes the transformation for all provided training examples. The calculation handles edge cases (single non-zero element) and boundary conditions (truncation is implicit in the copying logic) correctly according to the examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift the contiguous block of non-zero numbers 3 positions to the right within the sequence.
task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    type: List[int] or 1D np.ndarray
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: non_zero_span
    type: sub-sequence (List[int] or 1D np.ndarray slice)
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence starting at the first non-zero element and ending at the last non-zero element of the input sequence. If no non-zero elements exist, this span is considered empty.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-zero element in the input sequence (if exists).
      - end_index: The index of the last non-zero element in the input sequence (if exists).
      - elements: The sequence of numbers within the span.
  - item: shift_amount
    type: int
    value: 3
    description: The fixed number of positions to shift the non_zero_span to the right.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_transformation
    source: non_zero_span (from input sequence)
    target: non_zero_span (in output sequence)
    details: The non_zero_span identified in the input sequence is placed into the output sequence such that its first element is at index (start_index + shift_amount).
  - type: boundary_handling
    details: If the calculated target position for any element of the shifted span falls outside the bounds of the sequence length, that element is omitted (truncated).
  - type: default_state
    details: The output sequence is initialized with zeros. Positions not overwritten by the shifted span remain zero. If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output sequence remains all zeros.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_span
    input: input_sequence
    output: start_index, end_index, span_elements (or indicators of non-existence)
    description: Find the indices bounding the first and last non-zero elements. Extract the elements within this span. Handle the case of an all-zero input.
  - action: construct_output_sequence
    input: sequence_length, start_index, span_elements, shift_amount
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a zero-filled sequence of the specified length. Calculate the target start index by adding shift_amount to the input start_index. Copy the span_elements into the output sequence starting at the target start index, respecting sequence boundaries (truncation). If no span exists, return the zero-filled sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled with zeros.
2.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the input sequence.
3.  If there are no non-zero elements, return the zero-filled output sequence.
4.  Otherwise, determine the `start_index` (index of the first non-zero element) and the `end_index` (index of the last non-zero element).
5.  Extract the sub-sequence (the `non_zero_span`) from the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the `non_zero_span` in the output sequence by adding 3 to the `start_index`.
7.  Copy the elements from the `non_zero_span` into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that copying stops if the target index reaches the end of the output sequence (effectively truncating the span if it shifts partially or fully out of bounds).
8.  Return the final output sequence.
