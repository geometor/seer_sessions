task_description: Shift the contiguous block of non-zero numbers 3 positions to the right within the sequence.
task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    type: List[int] or 1D np.ndarray
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: non_zero_span
    type: sub-sequence (List[int] or 1D np.ndarray slice)
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence starting at the first non-zero element and ending at the last non-zero element of the input sequence. If no non-zero elements exist, this span is considered empty.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-zero element in the input sequence (if exists).
      - end_index: The index of the last non-zero element in the input sequence (if exists).
      - elements: The sequence of numbers within the span.
  - item: shift_amount
    type: int
    value: 3
    description: The fixed number of positions to shift the non_zero_span to the right.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_transformation
    source: non_zero_span (from input sequence)
    target: non_zero_span (in output sequence)
    details: The non_zero_span identified in the input sequence is placed into the output sequence such that its first element is at index (start_index + shift_amount).
  - type: boundary_handling
    details: If the calculated target position for any element of the shifted span falls outside the bounds of the sequence length, that element is omitted (truncated).
  - type: default_state
    details: The output sequence is initialized with zeros. Positions not overwritten by the shifted span remain zero. If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output sequence remains all zeros.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_span
    input: input_sequence
    output: start_index, end_index, span_elements (or indicators of non-existence)
    description: Find the indices bounding the first and last non-zero elements. Extract the elements within this span. Handle the case of an all-zero input.
  - action: construct_output_sequence
    input: sequence_length, start_index, span_elements, shift_amount
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a zero-filled sequence of the specified length. Calculate the target start index by adding shift_amount to the input start_index. Copy the span_elements into the output sequence starting at the target start index, respecting sequence boundaries (truncation). If no span exists, return the zero-filled sequence.
