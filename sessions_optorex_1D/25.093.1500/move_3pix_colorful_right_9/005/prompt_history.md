**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation appears to be spatial rearrangement based on the values within the sequence. Specifically, non-zero elements are treated as a cohesive block that is shifted within the sequence.

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the individual integers in the sequence. We can distinguish between zero and non-zero integers. A significant composite object is the contiguous block of non-zero integers.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the block of consecutive non-zero integers (if any exist) and shifts this entire block 3 positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift and the positions originally occupied by the start of the shifted block become zeros. If the input consists entirely of zeros, the output remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

  - item: input_sequence

      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: output_sequence

    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: non_zero_block
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of the input_sequence containing only non-zero integers, bounded by zeros or the sequence ends.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - elements: The non-zero integers forming the block.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    source: non_zero_block (from input_sequence)
    target: non_zero_block (in output_sequence)
    details: The starting index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is exactly 3 greater than its starting index in the input_sequence.
  - type: element_replacement
    details: All positions in the output_sequence are initially zero. The non_zero_block from the input is then placed into the output_sequence at the calculated shifted position.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    description: Find the first and last indices bounding the contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers. Extract this sequence. Handle the case where no non-zero numbers exist.
  - action: construct_output
    input: input_sequence_length, non_zero_block, start_index
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length as the input. Place the non_zero_block into this new sequence starting at index (start_index + 3). If no non_zero_block was found, the output is the sequence of zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero number (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero number (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-zero numbers are found in the input sequence, the process is complete, and the initialized output sequence (all zeros) is the result.
5.  If non-zero numbers are found, extract the sub-sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) from the input sequence. This is the `non_zero_block`.
6.  Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the `start_index`.
7.  Place the extracted `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target position.
8.  Return the final output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core transformation logic identified previously—finding the span of consecutive non-zero numbers and shifting this span 3 positions to the right within a zero-padded sequence of the same length—appears consistent across all provided training examples. The errors reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") indicate a specific type of runtime error in the Python code, likely stemming from using a NumPy array in a boolean context (e.g., `if my_array:`). This usually happens when checking if an array is non-empty or contains certain values without using explicit functions like `a.any()` or `a.all()`.

Given that the conceptual logic seems sound based on the examples, the strategy is to:

1.  **Pinpoint the Error:** Although the provided code snippet doesn't immediately reveal an obvious misuse of array truth values (especially since it converts the input NumPy array to a Python list early on), the error must be occurring. We will proceed assuming the error lies in the interaction between the input array and conditional checks, possibly within the `find_non_zero_span` function if it were ever called directly with an array, or within the main `transform` function's conditional `if span:`, although the latter seems less likely given `span` should be a tuple or None.
2.  **Refine Logic:** Ensure the logic correctly handles edge cases like all zeros, non-zeros at the beginning/end, and shifts that push elements beyond the array bounds (truncation seems to be the observed behavior).
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Verify sequence length, start/end indices of non-zero spans, and the shift amount (+3) for all examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to be precise and unambiguous, reflecting the confirmed logic and addressing potential implementation pitfalls like the array truth value error.

    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12 (consistent across examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12 (same as input_sequence)
      - elements: single digits (0-9), derived from input_sequence
  - item: non_zero_span
    type: List[int]
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence within the input_sequence, starting from the first non-zero element and ending at the last non-zero element.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-zero element in the input_sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last non-zero element in the input_sequence.
      - elements: The sequence of integers from start_index to end_index (inclusive) in the input_sequence.
      - presence: May not exist if the input_sequence contains only zeros.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    source: non_zero_span (from input_sequence)
    target: non_zero_span (in output_sequence)
    details: >
      If a non_zero_span exists in the input, its starting position in the
      output_sequence is exactly 3 indices greater than its starting index
      in the input_sequence. The elements of the span maintain their relative order.
  - type: element_placement
    details: >
      The output_sequence is initialized with zeros. If a non_zero_span exists
      in the input, its elements are copied into the output_sequence starting at the
      calculated shifted position (input start_index + 3). Elements that would be
      placed beyond the bounds of the output_sequence are truncated (not included).
  - type: zero_handling
    details: >
      If the input_sequence contains only zeros (no non_zero_span), the
      output_sequence also contains only zeros.
actions:
  - action: find_span_indices
    input: input_sequence
    output: start_index, end_index (or indication of non-existence)
    description: >
      Iterate through the input_sequence to find the index of the first non-zero
      element (start_index) and the index of the last non-zero element (end_index).
      If no non-zero elements are found, indicate this.
  - action: construct_output
    input: input_sequence_length, input_sequence, span_indices (start_index, end_index)
    output: output_sequence
    description: >
      1. Create a new sequence of zeros with the specified input_sequence_length.
      2. Check if span_indices were found.
      3. If yes: Calculate the target_start_index = start_index + 3.
         Iterate from i = start_index to end_index of the input_sequence.
         Calculate the target_index = target_start_index + (i - start_index).
         If target_index is within the bounds (0 <= target_index < input_sequence_length),
         copy the element input_sequence[i] to output_sequence[target_index].
      4. If no: The output_sequence remains all zeros.
      5. Return the constructed output_sequence.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero integer (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero integer (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-zero integers are found (i.e., the input sequence is all zeros), return the output sequence (which is also all zeros).
5.  If non-zero integers are found:
    a.  Calculate the target starting position for the span in the output sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 3`.
    b.  Iterate through the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). Let the current index be `i`.
    c.  For each element `input_sequence[i]`, calculate its corresponding position in the output sequence: `target_index = target_start_index + (i - start_index)`.
    d.  Check if the calculated `target_index` is valid (i.e., `0 <= target_index < 12`).
    e.  If the `target_index` is valid, place the element `input_sequence[i]` into the output sequence at `output_sequence[target_index]`. Otherwise (if `target_index` is out of bounds), do nothing (the element is effectively truncated).
6.  Return the final output sequence.
