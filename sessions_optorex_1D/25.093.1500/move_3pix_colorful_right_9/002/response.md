**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The previous code expected a string (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method, which failed because the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the contiguous block of non-zero numbers (the "span") and shifting it 3 positions to the right appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input handling to accept a list or array of integers directly.
2.  Verify the span identification and shifting logic against all examples using the correct input type.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the input type and the transformation steps on the numerical sequence.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the input sequences across the training examples:


```
Train 1: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 5, 'first_non_zero_idx': 4, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 5}
Train 2: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 1, 'first_non_zero_idx': 4, 'last_non_zero_idx': 4, 'span_length': 1}
Train 3: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 5, 'first_non_zero_idx': 1, 'last_non_zero_idx': 5, 'span_length': 5}
Train 4: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7, 'first_non_zero_idx': 0, 'last_non_zero_idx': 6, 'span_length': 7}
Train 5: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 1, 'first_non_zero_idx': 3, 'last_non_zero_idx': 3, 'span_length': 1}
Train 6: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7, 'first_non_zero_idx': 2, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 7}
Train 7: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 8, 'first_non_zero_idx': 1, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 8}
```

These metrics confirm:
*   All input sequences have a length of 12.
*   The identification of the first and last non-zero indices appears correct based on the examples.
*   The "span" correctly covers the block from the first to the last non-zero element, inclusive.
*   The shift amount required to match the output is consistently `start_index + 3`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    type: List[int]  # Or numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: output_sequence
    type: List[int]  # Or numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: single digits (0-9), initially all zeros.
  - item: non_zero_span
    type: List[int]
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of the input_sequence starting from the first non-zero element and ending at the last non-zero element.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first non-zero element in the input_sequence. Null/None if sequence is all zeros.
      - end_index: The index of the last non-zero element in the input_sequence. Null/None if sequence is all zeros.
      - elements: The integers from the input sequence within this span.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    source: non_zero_span (from input_sequence)
    target: non_zero_span (in output_sequence)
    details: The starting index of the non_zero_span in the output_sequence is exactly 3 positions greater than its starting index ('start_index') in the input_sequence.
  - type: element_transfer
    details: The elements constituting the non_zero_span in the input are copied into the output_sequence at the calculated shifted position. All other positions in the output remain zero.
actions:
  - action: find_non_zero_indices
    input: input_sequence
    output: start_index, end_index
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero element and the index of the last non-zero element. Return special values (e.g., None or -1) if no non-zero elements are found.
  - action: construct_output
    input: input_sequence, start_index, end_index
    output: output_sequence
    description: >
      Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length as the input.
      If valid start_index and end_index were found:
        Calculate the target start index as start_index + 3.
        Extract the sub-sequence (non_zero_span) from the input_sequence between start_index and end_index (inclusive).
        Copy the extracted sub-sequence into the new sequence, starting at the target start index, ensuring not to exceed the bounds of the sequence.
      Return the new sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (as a list or array).
2.  Determine the length (`N`) of the input sequence.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of length `N`, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the *first* non-zero number (`start_index`) and the index of the *last* non-zero number (`end_index`).
5.  If no non-zero numbers are found (i.e., `start_index` could not be determined), return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
6.  If non-zero numbers were found:
    a.  Calculate the target starting position for the span in the output sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 3`.
    b.  Iterate from `i = start_index` up to `end_index` (inclusive):
        i.  Let `current_input_index = i`.
        ii. Calculate the corresponding `current_output_index = target_start_index + (i - start_index)`.
        iii. If `current_output_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (i.e., less than `N`), copy the number from `input_sequence[current_input_index]` to `output_sequence[current_output_index]`.
7.  Return the final output sequence.
