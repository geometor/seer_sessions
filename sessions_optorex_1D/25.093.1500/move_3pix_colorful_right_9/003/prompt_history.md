**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation appears to be spatial rearrangement based on the values within the sequence. Specifically, non-zero elements are treated as a cohesive block that is shifted within the sequence.

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the individual integers in the sequence. We can distinguish between zero and non-zero integers. A significant composite object is the contiguous block of non-zero integers.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the block of consecutive non-zero integers (if any exist) and shifts this entire block 3 positions to the right. The positions vacated by the shift and the positions originally occupied by the start of the shifted block become zeros. If the input consists entirely of zeros, the output remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of the input_sequence containing only non-zero integers, bounded by zeros or the sequence ends.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last element of the block in the input_sequence.
      - elements: The non-zero integers forming the block.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    source: non_zero_block (from input_sequence)
    target: non_zero_block (in output_sequence)
    details: The starting index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is exactly 3 greater than its starting index in the input_sequence.
  - type: element_replacement
    details: All positions in the output_sequence are initially zero. The non_zero_block from the input is then placed into the output_sequence at the calculated shifted position.

    description: Create a new sequence of zeros with the same length as the input. Place the non_zero_block into this new sequence starting at index (start_index + 3). If no non_zero_block was found, the output is the sequence of zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero number (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero number (`end_index`).
4.  If no non-zero numbers are found in the input sequence, the process is complete, and the initialized output sequence (all zeros) is the result.
5.  If non-zero numbers are found, extract the sub-sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) from the input sequence. This is the `non_zero_block`.
6.  Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 to the `start_index`.
7.  Place the extracted `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target position.
8.  Return the final output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The previous code expected a string (`input_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method, which failed because the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the contiguous block of non-zero numbers (the "span") and shifting it 3 positions to the right appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input handling to accept a list or array of integers directly.
2.  Verify the span identification and shifting logic against all examples using the correct input type.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the input type and the transformation steps on the numerical sequence.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the input sequences across the training examples:


```
Train 1: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 5, 'first_non_zero_idx': 4, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 5}
Train 2: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 1, 'first_non_zero_idx': 4, 'last_non_zero_idx': 4, 'span_length': 1}
Train 3: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 5, 'first_non_zero_idx': 1, 'last_non_zero_idx': 5, 'span_length': 5}
Train 4: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7, 'first_non_zero_idx': 0, 'last_non_zero_idx': 6, 'span_length': 7}
Train 5: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 1, 'first_non_zero_idx': 3, 'last_non_zero_idx': 3, 'span_length': 1}
Train 6: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7, 'first_non_zero_idx': 2, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 7}
Train 7: {'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 8, 'first_non_zero_idx': 1, 'last_non_zero_idx': 8, 'span_length': 8}
```

These metrics confirm:
*   All input sequences have a length of 12.
*   The identification of the first and last non-zero indices appears correct based on the examples.
*   The "span" correctly covers the block from the first to the last non-zero element, inclusive.
*   The shift amount required to match the output is consistently `start_index + 3`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (as a list or array).
2.  Determine the length (`N`) of the input sequence.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of length `N`, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the *first* non-zero number (`start_index`) and the index of the *last* non-zero number (`end_index`).
5.  If no non-zero numbers are found (i.e., `start_index` could not be determined), return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
6.  If non-zero numbers were found:
    a.  Calculate the target starting position for the span in the output sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 3`.
    b.  Iterate from `i = start_index` up to `end_index` (inclusive):
        i.  Let `current_input_index = i`.
        ii. Calculate the corresponding `current_output_index = target_start_index + (i - start_index)`.
        iii. If `current_output_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (i.e., less than `N`), copy the number from `input_sequence[current_input_index]` to `output_sequence[current_output_index]`.
7.  Return the final output sequence.
