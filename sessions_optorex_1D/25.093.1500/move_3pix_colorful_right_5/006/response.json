            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe consistent error, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous,\" across all examples strongly suggests that the `transform` function is receiving the input grid as a 2D NumPy array (likely shape `(1, N)`) instead of the expected 1D array (shape `(N,)`). When the code iterates through `grid` (if 2D) or performs element-wise comparisons like `val != 0`, it results in a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated as a single truth value in standard Python `if` statements.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle this potential 2D input by ensuring operations are performed on the 1D sequence contained within. This typically involves selecting the first row (index `[0]`) of the input array at the beginning of the `transform` function before passing it to the helper function or processing it further. The core logic of identifying the contiguous non-zero block and shifting it right by 3 positions appears correct based on the initial examples and should be retained.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** Sequences of integers, consistently represented with 12 elements in all examples. The error suggests they are likely being passed as `(1, 12)` NumPy arrays.\n*   **Data Type:** Integers. Includes zeros and positive integers.\n*   **Core Operation:** Shifting a contiguous block of non-zero numbers.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Fixed at 3 positions to the right.\n*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted block are filled with 0.\n*   **Block Integrity:** The order and values of the numbers within the non-zero block are preserved.\n*   **Edge Cases Observed:**\n    *   Blocks starting at different positions (e.g., index 1, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n    *   Blocks of varying lengths (e.g., length 1, 2, 3, 6, 8).\n    *   Blocks ending near or at the end of the sequence.\n*   **Error Pattern:** Uniform failure across all examples indicates a systematic issue, likely input format handling, rather than a logic error specific to certain data patterns.\n\n**(No code execution needed for metrics gathering as the error prevents analysis of the transformation itself; the metrics are derived from observing the input/output pairs and the nature of the error.)**\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
