objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array of integers (likely shape (1, N)) or 1D NumPy array (shape (N,))
    properties:
      - represents: a single sequence of integers
      - length: N (observed as 12 in examples)
      - contains: a single contiguous block of non-zero integers surrounded by zeros, or all zeros.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 1D NumPy array of integers
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input sequence length)
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - contains: the non-zero block from the input, shifted right, padded with zeros.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: 1D sequence/array of integers
    properties:
      - extracted_from: the effective 1D sequence of input_grid
      - contains_only: integers > 0
      - contiguous: yes
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: The fixed number of positions the non_zero_block is shifted to the right.
  - name: sequence_length
    type: integer
    value: N (derived from input, observed as 12)

actions:
  - name: preprocess_input
    actor: system
    input: input_grid (potentially 2D)
    output: effective_1d_input (1D NumPy array)
    description: Extracts the 1D sequence from the input grid (e.g., selects the first row if input is 2D).
  - name: locate_block
    actor: system
    input: effective_1d_input
    output: start_index, end_index, non_zero_block
    description: Finds the start and end indices of the first contiguous non-zero block in the 1D sequence and extracts the block. Returns null/None indicators if no block is found.
  - name: calculate_new_position
    actor: system
    input: start_index, shift_amount
    output: new_start_index
    description: Calculates the target starting index for the block in the output sequence.
  - name: construct_output
    actor: system
    input: non_zero_block, new_start_index, sequence_length
    output: output_grid (1D NumPy array)
    description: Creates a new 1D array of the target length initialized with zeros, places the non_zero_block at the new_start_index (handling boundary conditions), and returns the result.

relationships:
  - The output_grid is a transformation of the effective 1D sequence from the input_grid.
  - The non_zero_block in the output_grid starts at an index exactly `shift_amount` (3) positions greater than its starting index in the effective 1D input sequence.
  - The relative order and values within the non_zero_block remain unchanged.
  - If the shifted block exceeds the sequence boundary, it is truncated.
