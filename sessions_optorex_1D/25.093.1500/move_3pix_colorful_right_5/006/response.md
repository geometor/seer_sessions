**General Assessment and Strategy**

The consistent error, "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous," across all examples strongly suggests that the `transform` function is receiving the input grid as a 2D NumPy array (likely shape `(1, N)`) instead of the expected 1D array (shape `(N,)`). When the code iterates through `grid` (if 2D) or performs element-wise comparisons like `val != 0`, it results in a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated as a single truth value in standard Python `if` statements.

The strategy is to modify the code to explicitly handle this potential 2D input by ensuring operations are performed on the 1D sequence contained within. This typically involves selecting the first row (index `[0]`) of the input array at the beginning of the `transform` function before passing it to the helper function or processing it further. The core logic of identifying the contiguous non-zero block and shifting it right by 3 positions appears correct based on the initial examples and should be retained.

**Metrics**

Based on the provided examples:

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Sequences of integers, consistently represented with 12 elements in all examples. The error suggests they are likely being passed as `(1, 12)` NumPy arrays.
*   **Data Type:** Integers. Includes zeros and positive integers.
*   **Core Operation:** Shifting a contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
*   **Shift Amount:** Fixed at 3 positions to the right.
*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted block are filled with 0.
*   **Block Integrity:** The order and values of the numbers within the non-zero block are preserved.
*   **Edge Cases Observed:**
    *   Blocks starting at different positions (e.g., index 1, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    *   Blocks of varying lengths (e.g., length 1, 2, 3, 6, 8).
    *   Blocks ending near or at the end of the sequence.
*   **Error Pattern:** Uniform failure across all examples indicates a systematic issue, likely input format handling, rather than a logic error specific to certain data patterns.

**(No code execution needed for metrics gathering as the error prevents analysis of the transformation itself; the metrics are derived from observing the input/output pairs and the nature of the error.)**

    input: effective_1d_input
    output: start_index, end_index, non_zero_block
    description: Finds the start and end indices of the first contiguous non-zero block in the 1D sequence and extracts the block. Returns null/None indicators if no block is found.
  - name: calculate_new_position
    actor: system

    output: new_start_index
    description: Calculates the target starting index for the block in the output sequence.
  - name: construct_output
    actor: system
    input: non_zero_block, new_start_index, sequence_length
    output: output_grid (1D NumPy array)
    description: Creates a new 1D array of the target length initialized with zeros, places the non_zero_block at the new_start_index (handling boundary conditions), and returns the result.

relationships:
  - The output_grid is a transformation of the effective 1D sequence from the input_grid.
  - The non_zero_block in the output_grid starts at an index exactly `shift_amount` (3) positions greater than its starting index in the effective 1D input sequence.
  - The relative order and values within the non_zero_block remain unchanged.
  - If the shifted block exceeds the sequence boundary, it is truncated.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid. Ensure it is treated as a 1D sequence of `N` integers (if input is a 1xN 2D array, use the first row).
2.  Initialize a new 1D output sequence of length `N` with all zeros.
3.  Scan the 1D input sequence to find the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`) of the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
4.  If no non-zero numbers are found (no block exists), return the initialized all-zero output sequence.
5.  If a block is found:
    a.  Extract the `non_zero_block` from the input sequence using `start_index` and `end_index`.
    b.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output sequence by adding 3 (`shift_amount`) to the original `start_index`.
    c.  Determine the portion of the `non_zero_block` that fits within the output sequence bounds starting at `new_start_index`. Let the length of this portion be `effective_block_length`.
    d.  Copy the first `effective_block_length` elements of the `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
