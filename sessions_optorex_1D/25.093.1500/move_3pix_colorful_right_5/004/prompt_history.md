*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
    *   All sequences appear to have a fixed length (12 in the examples).
    *   The core operation involves locating a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input sequence.
    *   This block of non-zero numbers is then shifted exactly 3 positions to the right in the output sequence.
    *   The positions vacated by the shift and the positions before the original block (if any) are filled with zeros.
    *   The positions after the shifted block are also filled with zeros up to the fixed length of the sequence.
    *   If the input contains only zeros, the output remains all zeros (implied, though no example shows this).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:

      - name: calculate_new_position
        actor: system
        input: start_index, shift_amount
        output: new_start_index
        description: Calculates the starting position for the block in the output sequence.
      - name: construct_output
        actor: system
        input: non_zero_block, new_start_index, sequence_length
        output: output_sequence
        description: Creates a new sequence of the target length, places the non_zero_block at the new_start_index, and pads the rest with zeros.
    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is a transformation of the input_sequence.
      - The non_zero_block in the output_sequence starts at an index exactly 3 positions greater than its starting index in the input_sequence.
      - The relative order and values of the numbers within the non_zero_block remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous subsequence of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Determine its starting and ending indices.
    2.  If no non-zero numbers are found, return the input sequence as is.
    3.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero subsequence by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-zero subsequence into the new sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
    6.  Return the newly constructed sequence.
