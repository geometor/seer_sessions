Transforms a 1D NumPy integer array (or the first row of a 2D array) by 
identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shifting this 
block exactly 3 positions to the right within an array of the same fixed 
length, padding the remaining positions with zeros. If no non-zero block 
is found, an all-zero array is returned.
