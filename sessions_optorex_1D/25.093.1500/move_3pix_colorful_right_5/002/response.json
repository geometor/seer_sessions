            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where a contiguous block of non-zero integers within a fixed-length sequence is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The surrounding elements are zeros. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that the input/output data types are NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists, and the previous code implementation likely contained an operation that attempted to evaluate an entire array or array slice in a boolean context where a single `True` or `False` was expected.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n1.  Acknowledge that the inputs/outputs are likely NumPy arrays.\n2.  Verify the core transformation logic (find block, shift right by 3) holds for all examples using NumPy-aware methods.\n3.  Update the implementation (specifically the block finding and array construction/modification steps) to correctly handle NumPy arrays and avoid ambiguous boolean comparisons.\n4.  Refine the natural language program and facts to reflect the use of NumPy arrays and the precise transformation steps.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis of the 7 training examples and the successful execution of the test code:\n\n*   **Data Type:** Assumed to be NumPy arrays based on the error message. The test code successfully uses NumPy arrays.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Consistently +3 positions to the right for the start index of the non-zero block.\n*   **Block Integrity:** The sequence of non-zero numbers within the block remains unchanged in value and relative order.\n*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted block in the output array are filled with 0.\n*   **Block Finding:** The logic needs to find the *first* contiguous block of non-zero numbers.\n    *   Example 1: Input block `[1]` at index 5 -> Output block `[1]` at index 8.\n    *   Example 2: Input block `[1]` at index 4 -> Output block `[1]` at index 7.\n    *   Example 3: Input block `[6 2 7 1 5 4]` at index 3 -> Output block `[6 2 7 1 5 4]` at index 6.\n    *   Example 4: Input block `[6 5 7 2]` at index 4 -> Output block `[6 5 7 2]` at index 7.\n    *   Example 5: Input block `[4 2 6 9 3 6 7 1]` at index 1 -> Output block `[4 2 6 9 3 6 7 1]` at index 4.\n    *   Example 6: Input block `[9 7 6]` at index 6 -> Output block `[9 7 6]` at index 9.\n    *   Example 7: Input block `[3 1]` at index 5 -> Output block `[3 1]` at index 8.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Initialize an output NumPy array of the same shape (12,) and type, filled with zeros.\n3.  Iterate through the input array to find the start index of the first non-zero element. If no non-zero element is found, return the initialized all-zero output array.\n4.  Once the first non-zero element (start of the block) is found at `start_index`, continue iterating to find the end index (`end_index`) which is the index *after* the last element of the contiguous non-zero block.\n5.  Extract the `non_zero_block` sub-array from the input array using `input_array[start_index:end_index]`.\n6.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output array by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.\n7.  Calculate the `new_end_index` for the block in the output array (`new_start_index + length_of_block`).\n8.  Check if `new_start_index` is less than the array length (12).\n9.  If it is, copy the `non_zero_block` into the output array starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that the copying process respects the boundary of the output array (i.e., if the shifted block would partially extend beyond index 11, only copy the part that fits). Slicing assignment `output_array[new_start_index:new_end_index] = non_zero_block` (adjusting `new_end_index` if necessary to stay within bounds) handles this.\n10. Return the constructed output array."
