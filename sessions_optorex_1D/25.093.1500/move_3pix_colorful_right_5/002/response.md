## General Assessment

The provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where a contiguous block of non-zero integers within a fixed-length sequence is shifted exactly 3 positions to the right. The surrounding elements are zeros. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" strongly suggests that the input/output data types are NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists, and the previous code implementation likely contained an operation that attempted to evaluate an entire array or array slice in a boolean context where a single `True` or `False` was expected.

The strategy to resolve this is:
1.  Acknowledge that the inputs/outputs are likely NumPy arrays.
2.  Verify the core transformation logic (find block, shift right by 3) holds for all examples using NumPy-aware methods.
3.  Update the implementation (specifically the block finding and array construction/modification steps) to correctly handle NumPy arrays and avoid ambiguous boolean comparisons.
4.  Refine the natural language program and facts to reflect the use of NumPy arrays and the precise transformation steps.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis of the 7 training examples and the successful execution of the test code:

*   **Data Type:** Assumed to be NumPy arrays based on the error message. The test code successfully uses NumPy arrays.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.
*   **Shift Amount:** Consistently +3 positions to the right for the start index of the non-zero block.
*   **Block Integrity:** The sequence of non-zero numbers within the block remains unchanged in value and relative order.
*   **Padding:** Positions outside the shifted block in the output array are filled with 0.
*   **Block Finding:** The logic needs to find the *first* contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
    *   Example 1: Input block `[1]` at index 5 -> Output block `[1]` at index 8.
    *   Example 2: Input block `[1]` at index 4 -> Output block `[1]` at index 7.
    *   Example 3: Input block `[6 2 7 1 5 4]` at index 3 -> Output block `[6 2 7 1 5 4]` at index 6.
    *   Example 4: Input block `[6 5 7 2]` at index 4 -> Output block `[6 5 7 2]` at index 7.
    *   Example 5: Input block `[4 2 6 9 3 6 7 1]` at index 1 -> Output block `[4 2 6 9 3 6 7 1]` at index 4.
    *   Example 6: Input block `[9 7 6]` at index 6 -> Output block `[9 7 6]` at index 9.
    *   Example 7: Input block `[3 1]` at index 5 -> Output block `[3 1]` at index 8.

    description: The fixed length of the input and output arrays.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_block
    actor: system
    input: input_array
    output: start_index, end_index, non_zero_block (or None if no non-zeros)
    description: Iterates through the input_array to find the start and end indices (exclusive) of the first contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers and extracts this sequence.
  - name: calculate_new_indices
    actor: system
    input: start_index, block_length, shift_amount
    output: new_start_index, new_end_index
    description: Calculates the target start and end indices for the block in the output array by adding the shift_amount to the original start_index.
  - name: construct_output_array
    actor: system
    input: non_zero_block, new_start_index, new_end_index, sequence_length
    output: output_array
    description: Creates a new NumPy array of zeros with the specified sequence_length. Places the non_zero_block into this array at the calculated new_start_index, ensuring it does not exceed array bounds. If no non_zero_block was found in the input, returns an all-zero array.
relationships:
  - The output_array is derived from the input_array.
  - If a non_zero_block exists in the input_array starting at index `i`, it appears in the output_array starting at index `i + 3`.
  - The relative order and values of the numbers within the non_zero_block are preserved.
  - Elements in the output_array corresponding to positions before the new_start_index or after the new_end_index are zero.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence as a 1D NumPy integer array of length 12.
2.  Initialize an output NumPy array of the same shape (12,) and type, filled with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input array to find the start index of the first non-zero element. If no non-zero element is found, return the initialized all-zero output array.
4.  Once the first non-zero element (start of the block) is found at `start_index`, continue iterating to find the end index (`end_index`) which is the index *after* the last element of the contiguous non-zero block.
5.  Extract the `non_zero_block` sub-array from the input array using `input_array[start_index:end_index]`.
6.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output array by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.
7.  Calculate the `new_end_index` for the block in the output array (`new_start_index + length_of_block`).
8.  Check if `new_start_index` is less than the array length (12).
9.  If it is, copy the `non_zero_block` into the output array starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that the copying process respects the boundary of the output array (i.e., if the shifted block would partially extend beyond index 11, only copy the part that fits). Slicing assignment `output_array[new_start_index:new_end_index] = non_zero_block` (adjusting `new_end_index` if necessary to stay within bounds) handles this.
10. Return the constructed output array.
