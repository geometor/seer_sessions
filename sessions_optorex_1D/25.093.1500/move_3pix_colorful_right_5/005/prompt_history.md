*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
    *   All sequences appear to have a fixed length (12 in the examples).
    *   The core operation involves locating a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input sequence.
    *   This block of non-zero numbers is then shifted exactly 3 positions to the right in the output sequence.
    *   The positions vacated by the shift and the positions before the original block (if any) are filled with zeros.
    *   The positions after the shifted block are also filled with zeros up to the fixed length of the sequence.
    *   If the input contains only zeros, the output remains all zeros (implied, though no example shows this).

*   **Facts:**

    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is a transformation of the input_sequence.
      - The non_zero_block in the output_sequence starts at an index exactly 3 positions greater than its starting index in the input_sequence.
      - The relative order and values of the numbers within the non_zero_block remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous subsequence of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Determine its starting and ending indices.
    2.  If no non-zero numbers are found, return the input sequence as is.
    3.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero subsequence by adding 3 to its original starting index.
    5.  Copy the identified non-zero subsequence into the new sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
    6.  Return the newly constructed sequence.

*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: finding a contiguous block of non-zero integers and shifting it right by 3 positions within a fixed-length sequence (12).
    *   The provided NumPy code attempts to implement this logic.
    *   The consistent error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" across all examples indicates a fundamental issue in how boolean conditions involving NumPy arrays are handled within the code, likely within an `if` statement comparing arrays or attempting to evaluate the truthiness of a multi-element array directly.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Pinpoint the exact line causing the boolean ambiguity error. Although the loop `if val != 0:` seems correct for iterating elements, the error suggests an array is being evaluated in a boolean context somewhere. Re-inspect the code for any implicit array comparisons or truthiness checks.
        2.  Gather detailed metrics from the examples to confirm the consistency of the "+3 shift" rule and the block identification.
        3.  Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program based on these metrics and the understanding of the required fix (avoiding array truthiness ambiguity).

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

        input: input_sequence
        output: block_properties (input_start_index, input_end_index)
        description: Iterates through the input sequence to find the start and end indices of the *first* contiguous block of non-zero numbers. Returns None for indices if no block is found.

        description: Calculates the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding shift_amount to input_start_index. Only applicable if input_start_index is not None.
      - name: construct_output_sequence
        actor: system

        description: >
          Creates a new sequence of zeros with the defined sequence_length.
          If a non_zero_block was found in the input (input_start_index is not None),
          extracts the block using input_start_index and input_end_index.
          Copies the extracted block into the new sequence starting at new_start_index.
          Handles potential clipping if the shifted block exceeds the sequence_length.
          If no block was found, returns the sequence of zeros.

    relationships:
      - The output_sequence length always equals the input_sequence length (12).
      - If a non_zero_block exists in the input starting at `s`, it appears in the output starting at `s + 3`.
      - The content and relative order of elements within the non_zero_block are preserved in the output.
      - Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted block are filled with 0.
      - If the input contains no non-zero elements, the output is all zeros.
      - The shift operation might cause the tail end of the block to be truncated if `s + 3 + block_length > 12`.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Receive the input sequence (a list/array of 12 integers).
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length (12) with all zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index` - exclusive) of the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
    4.  If no non-zero numbers are found (`start_index` remains undetermined):
        *   Return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
    5.  If a non-zero block is found:
        *   Extract the `non_zero_block` from the input sequence using `start_index` and `end_index`.
        *   Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 3 to the original `start_index`.
        *   Determine the number of elements from the `non_zero_block` that can fit into the output sequence starting at `new_start_index` without exceeding the total length of 12. Let this be `effective_length`.
        *   Copy the first `effective_length` elements of the `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`.
        *   Return the modified output sequence.
