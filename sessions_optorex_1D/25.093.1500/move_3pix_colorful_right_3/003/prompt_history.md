Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of a single line containing a sequence of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, both the input and output sequences have a length of 12 integers.
3.  **Content:** The sequences contain digits (0-9). Zeros appear frequently, often padding the sequences. Non-zero digits appear in contiguous blocks within the examples.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core group of non-zero numbers (and potentially adjacent zeros that are part of the main 'block') appears to be shifted to the right within the sequence. The amount of shift seems consistent across examples.
5.  **Shift Amount:** Let's quantify the shift.
    *   Example 1: `1 1 7 5` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 2: `9 4 3 3` starts at index 2 in the input and index 5 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 3: `2 5 ... 6 6` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 4: `3 1 6 7` starts at index 5 in the input and index 8 in the output. Shift = 3.
    The shift appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.
6.  **Padding:** When the sequence is shifted right, the newly opened positions at the beginning (left side) of the sequence are filled with zeros. Elements shifted off the right end are discarded (though in these examples, the shifted block never reaches the end).

**YAML Facts:**

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all training and testing examples. This indicates that the `transform` function, which was designed to accept a string (`input_str`) based on the visual format of the examples, is actually being called with a NumPy array object in the testing environment.

The core logic derived previously (shifting the sequence elements 3 positions to the right and padding with zeros) appears visually correct based on the input/output pairs. However, the type mismatch prevents the execution and validation of this logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array as input instead of a string.
2.  **Remove String Parsing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` function call within `transform`, as the input is already in a numerical array format.
3.  **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify that the `shift_right` function works correctly with a list derived from the input NumPy array (or modify it to work directly with NumPy arrays if more efficient).
4.  **Maintain Output Formatting:** Keep the `format_output` function to convert the final processed list or array back into the required space-separated string format.
5.  **Re-evaluate Logic (if necessary):** Once the type error is resolved, re-evaluate the core shifting logic if the tests still fail.

**Metrics**

*   **Error Consistency:** 100% of examples (7/7 train, 1/1 test reported) failed with the identical `TypeError`.
*   **Input Type:** Inferred input type in the execution environment is `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistent length of 12 observed in all input/output examples.
*   **Shift Amount:** Visually inferred shift amount is 3 positions to the right.

*(No code execution is needed to gather these specific metrics, as they are derived directly from the error messages and the initial problem description.)*

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a standard Python list of integers.
3.  Define the shift amount as 3.
4.  Get the length of the integer list.
5.  Create a new output list of the same length, initialized with zeros.
6.  Iterate through the input list from index 0 up to (but not including) index `length - shift_amount`. For each element at index `i` in the input list, copy its value to index `i + shift_amount` in the output list.
7.  Convert the integers in the resulting output list into strings.
8.  Join the string representations of the integers with single spaces to form the final output string.
9.  Return the generated output string.
