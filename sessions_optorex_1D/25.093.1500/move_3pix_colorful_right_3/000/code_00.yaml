task_description: Right-shift a sequence of integers by a fixed amount.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - name: length
        value: 12 (observed in examples)
        description: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - name: content
        description: Contains integers, including zeros used for padding and a block of primary digits.
actions:
  - action: shift_right
    target: sequence
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        value: 3
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence elements to the right.
    result:
      - description: Elements from input index `i` move to output index `i + 3`.
      - description: The first 'amount' (3) positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
      - description: Elements shifted beyond the original sequence length are discarded.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the input_sequence, shifting all its elements 3 positions to the right, and padding the first 3 positions with zeros. The length remains constant.
