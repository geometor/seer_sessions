            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of a single line containing a sequence of space-separated integers.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, both the input and output sequences have a length of 12 integers.\n3.  **Content:** The sequences contain digits (0-9). Zeros appear frequently, often padding the sequences. Non-zero digits appear in contiguous blocks within the examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core group of non-zero numbers (and potentially adjacent zeros that are part of the main 'block') appears to be shifted to the right within the sequence. The amount of shift seems consistent across examples.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** Let's quantify the shift.\n    *   Example 1: `1 1 7 5` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 2: `9 4 3 3` starts at index 2 in the input and index 5 in the output. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 3: `2 5 ... 6 6` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.\n    *   Example 4: `3 1 6 7` starts at index 5 in the input and index 8 in the output. Shift = 3.\n    The shift appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.\n6.  **Padding:** When the sequence is shifted right, the newly opened positions at the beginning (left side) of the sequence are filled with zeros. Elements shifted off the right end are discarded (though in these examples, the shifted block never reaches the end).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
