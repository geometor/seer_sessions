            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: a right shift of the sequence elements by 3 positions, with the leftmost positions being padded with zeros. The python code implemented this logic. However, the errors (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) across all examples indicate a fundamental mismatch between the function's expected input/output *format* and the format used by the testing environment. The error message itself suggests that a string containing spaces (like the expected output string) was improperly passed to a function expecting a single integer string (like `int()`). This points towards an issue in how the function signature or return type interacts with the testing harness, rather than an error in the shift logic itself. The most likely scenario is that the testing harness provides input as a numerical array (like NumPy) and expects the output in a similar numerical format (NumPy array or list of ints) for comparison, whereas the previous code returned a formatted string.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Maintain the core shift logic (right shift by 3, pad with 0).\n2.  Assume the input is provided as a `numpy.ndarray` representing the sequence (likely shape `(1, N)` or `(N,)`).\n3.  Modify the `transform` function to return the result as a `list[int]` or `numpy.ndarray` instead of a formatted string. This allows the testing harness to perform a direct numerical comparison. Returning `list[int]` is often a safe intermediate step.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect these assumptions about input/output types.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nNo complex calculations are needed here. The metrics are observational:\n*   Input Type (Assumed based on common practice and previous code): `numpy.ndarray`\n*   Output Type (Hypothesized based on error analysis): `list[int]` or `numpy.ndarray`\n*   Sequence Length (Observed): 12 elements in all examples.\n*   Shift Amount (Observed): 3 positions to the right.\n*   Padding Value (Observed): 0.\n*   Error Type (Observed): `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...` occurred consistently, suggesting a type mismatch during comparison or processing by the test harness.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
