Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of a single line containing a sequence of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, both the input and output sequences have a length of 12 integers.
3.  **Content:** The sequences contain digits (0-9). Zeros appear frequently, often padding the sequences. Non-zero digits appear in contiguous blocks within the examples.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core group of non-zero numbers (and potentially adjacent zeros that are part of the main 'block') appears to be shifted to the right within the sequence. The amount of shift seems consistent across examples.
5.  **Shift Amount:** Let's quantify the shift.
    *   Example 1: `1 1 7 5` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 2: `9 4 3 3` starts at index 2 in the input and index 5 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 3: `2 5 ... 6 6` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 4: `3 1 6 7` starts at index 5 in the input and index 8 in the output. Shift = 3.
    The shift appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.
6.  **Padding:** When the sequence is shifted right, the newly opened positions at the beginning (left side) of the sequence are filled with zeros. Elements shifted off the right end are discarded (though in these examples, the shifted block never reaches the end).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Right-shift a sequence of integers by a fixed amount.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - name: length
        value: 12 (observed in examples)
        description: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - name: content
        description: Contains integers, including zeros used for padding and a block of primary digits.
actions:
  - action: shift_right
    target: sequence
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        value: 3
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence elements to the right.
    result:
      - description: Elements from input index `i` move to output index `i + 3`.
      - description: The first 'amount' (3) positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
      - description: Elements shifted beyond the original sequence length are discarded.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the input_sequence, shifting all its elements 3 positions to the right, and padding the first 3 positions with zeros. The length remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of integers.
2.  Define the shift amount as 3.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
4.  Fill the first `shift_amount` (3) positions of the output sequence with the integer 0.
5.  Copy the elements from the input sequence, starting from the first element (index 0) up to the element at index `length - 1 - shift_amount`, into the output sequence, starting at index `shift_amount`.
6.  Return the generated output sequence.
