Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of a single line containing a sequence of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, both the input and output sequences have a length of 12 integers.
3.  **Content:** The sequences contain digits (0-9). Zeros appear frequently, often padding the sequences. Non-zero digits appear in contiguous blocks within the examples.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core group of non-zero numbers (and potentially adjacent zeros that are part of the main 'block') appears to be shifted to the right within the sequence. The amount of shift seems consistent across examples.
5.  **Shift Amount:** Let's quantify the shift.
    *   Example 1: `1 1 7 5` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 2: `9 4 3 3` starts at index 2 in the input and index 5 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 3: `2 5 ... 6 6` starts at index 0 in the input and index 3 in the output. Shift = 3.
    *   Example 4: `3 1 6 7` starts at index 5 in the input and index 8 in the output. Shift = 3.
    The shift appears to be consistently 3 positions to the right.
6.  **Padding:** When the sequence is shifted right, the newly opened positions at the beginning (left side) of the sequence are filled with zeros. Elements shifted off the right end are discarded (though in these examples, the shifted block never reaches the end).

**YAML Facts:**

**General Assessment:**

The initial code (`code_00.py`) failed on all examples, consistently outputting only `'0'`. The analysis reveals that the code incorrectly processed the input `numpy.ndarray`. It treated the `1xN` input array as a multi-dimensional list instead of extracting the single row containing the sequence of integers. The `shift_right` function, designed for a 1D list, received a list containing one list (e.g., `[[1, 1, 7, ...]]`). The length calculation (`n = len(sequence)`) resulted in `n=1`, causing the shifting loop `range(n - amount)` (i.e., `range(1-3)`) to be empty. Consequently, the function returned the initialized `[0]*1` list, which was formatted as the string `'0'`.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the `transform` function to correctly extract the 1D sequence from the input `numpy.ndarray` (assuming it's always `1xN`) before passing it to the `shift_right` function.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the input/output sequence lengths for each example.

```
The metrics confirm that all input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12. The simulated NumPy input shape is `(1, 12)`. This reinforces the assessment that the code needs to handle the `1xN` input correctly by extracting the first row.
