```python
import numpy as np

"""
Right-shift a sequence of integers, represented as a single row in a NumPy array, 
by a fixed amount (3), padding the start with zeros. The result is returned as a 
space-separated string.

1. Receive the input as a `numpy.ndarray` (expected shape `1xN`).
2. Extract the first row (index 0) from the input `numpy.ndarray` to obtain the sequence as a list of integers.
3. Define the fixed shift amount as 3.
4. Get the length (`L`) of the extracted integer list.
5. Create a new output list of length `L`, initialized with zeros.
6. Iterate through the extracted input list from index `i = 0` up to (but not including) index `L - shift_amount`.
7. For each element at index `i` in the input list, copy its value to index `i + shift_amount` in the new output list.
8. Convert each integer in the resulting output list into its string representation.
9. Join these string representations with single spaces to form the final output string.
10. Return the generated output string.
