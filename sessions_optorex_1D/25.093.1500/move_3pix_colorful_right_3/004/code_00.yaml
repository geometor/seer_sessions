task_description: Right-shift a sequence of integers, represented as a single row in a NumPy array, by a fixed amount (3), padding the start with zeros.
input_object:
  type: numpy_array
  shape: (1, N) # Observed N=12 in examples
  description: A 2D NumPy array with one row representing a sequence of integers.
output_object:
  type: string
  description: A space-separated string representing the transformed sequence of integers.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    source: First row of the input_object
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - name: length
        value: N (observed N=12)
        description: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - name: content
        description: Contains integers, including zeros used for padding and potentially a block of primary digits.
actions:
  - action: extract_row
    target: input_object
    parameters:
      - name: row_index
        value: 0
    result: sequence (list_of_integers)
  - action: shift_right
    target: sequence
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        value: 3
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence elements to the right.
    result:
      - description: A new sequence of the same length is created.
      - description: Elements from the input sequence at index `i` move to output index `i + 3` (for `i` from 0 to `length - 1 - amount`).
      - description: The first 'amount' (3) positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
      - description: Elements shifted beyond the original sequence length are implicitly discarded as the copy stops early.
  - action: format_to_string
    target: shifted_sequence (list_of_integers)
    result: output_object (string)
    description: Convert the list of integers to a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_object (1xN numpy_array)
    output: output_object (string)
    rule: Extract the first row from the input array to get the sequence. Shift this sequence 3 positions to the right, padding the first 3 positions with zeros. Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.
