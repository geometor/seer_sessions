**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all training and testing examples. This indicates that the `transform` function, which was designed to accept a string (`input_str`) based on the visual format of the examples, is actually being called with a NumPy array object in the testing environment.

The core logic derived previously (shifting the sequence elements 3 positions to the right and padding with zeros) appears visually correct based on the input/output pairs. However, the type mismatch prevents the execution and validation of this logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array as input instead of a string.
2.  **Remove String Parsing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` function call within `transform`, as the input is already in a numerical array format.
3.  **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify that the `shift_right` function works correctly with a list derived from the input NumPy array (or modify it to work directly with NumPy arrays if more efficient).
4.  **Maintain Output Formatting:** Keep the `format_output` function to convert the final processed list or array back into the required space-separated string format.
5.  **Re-evaluate Logic (if necessary):** Once the type error is resolved, re-evaluate the core shifting logic if the tests still fail.

**Metrics**

*   **Error Consistency:** 100% of examples (7/7 train, 1/1 test reported) failed with the identical `TypeError`.
*   **Input Type:** Inferred input type in the execution environment is `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistent length of 12 observed in all input/output examples.
*   **Shift Amount:** Visually inferred shift amount is 3 positions to the right.

*(No code execution is needed to gather these specific metrics, as they are derived directly from the error messages and the initial problem description.)*

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Right-shift a sequence of integers provided as a NumPy array by a fixed amount (3) and return as a space-separated string.
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - name: dtype
        value: int (inferred from examples)
      - name: length
        value: 12 (observed in examples)
        description: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - name: content
        description: Contains integers, including zeros used for padding and a block of primary digits.
  - object: output_sequence
    type: string
    properties:
      - name: format
        value: space-separated integers
      - name: length
        value: Approximately 2 * sequence_length - 1 (due to spaces)
        description: The string representation of the processed integer sequence.
actions:
  - action: convert_to_list # Added step due to input type change
    target: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    result: list_of_integers
  - action: shift_right
    target: list_of_integers
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        value: 3
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence elements to the right.
    result:
      - description: Elements from input index `i` move to output index `i + 3`.
      - description: The first 'amount' (3) positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
      - description: Elements shifted beyond the original sequence length are discarded.
      - description: Returns a new list_of_integers.
  - action: format_as_string # Modified step (was format_output)
    target: list_of_integers (result of shift_right)
    result: output_sequence (string)
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (string)
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the input_sequence (NumPy array), converting it to a list, shifting its elements 3 positions to the right (padding the start with zeros), and formatting the result as a space-separated string. The effective numerical sequence length remains constant (12).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a standard Python list of integers.
3.  Define the shift amount as 3.
4.  Get the length of the integer list.
5.  Create a new output list of the same length, initialized with zeros.
6.  Iterate through the input list from index 0 up to (but not including) index `length - shift_amount`. For each element at index `i` in the input list, copy its value to index `i + shift_amount` in the output list.
7.  Convert the integers in the resulting output list into strings.
8.  Join the string representations of the integers with single spaces to form the final output string.
9.  Return the generated output string.
