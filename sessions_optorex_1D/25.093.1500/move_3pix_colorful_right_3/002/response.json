            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all training and testing examples. This indicates that the `transform` function, which was designed to accept a string (`input_str`) based on the visual format of the examples, is actually being called with a NumPy array object in the testing environment.\n\nThe core logic derived previously (shifting the sequence elements 3 positions to the right and padding with zeros) appears visually correct based on the input/output pairs. However, the type mismatch prevents the execution and validation of this logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array as input instead of a string.\n2.  **Remove String Parsing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` function call within `transform`, as the input is already in a numerical array format.\n3.  **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify that the `shift_right` function works correctly with a list derived from the input NumPy array (or modify it to work directly with NumPy arrays if more efficient).\n4.  **Maintain Output Formatting:** Keep the `format_output` function to convert the final processed list or array back into the required space-separated string format.\n5.  **Re-evaluate Logic (if necessary):** Once the type error is resolved, re-evaluate the core shifting logic if the tests still fail.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Error Consistency:** 100% of examples (7/7 train, 1/1 test reported) failed with the identical `TypeError`.\n*   **Input Type:** Inferred input type in the execution environment is `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistent length of 12 observed in all input/output examples.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Visually inferred shift amount is 3 positions to the right.\n\n*(No code execution is needed to gather these specific metrics, as they are derived directly from the error messages and the initial problem description.)*\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
