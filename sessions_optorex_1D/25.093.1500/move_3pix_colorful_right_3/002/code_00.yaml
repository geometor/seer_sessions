task_description: Right-shift a sequence of integers provided as a NumPy array by a fixed amount (3) and return as a space-separated string.
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - name: dtype
        value: int (inferred from examples)
      - name: length
        value: 12 (observed in examples)
        description: The number of integers in the sequence.
      - name: content
        description: Contains integers, including zeros used for padding and a block of primary digits.
  - object: output_sequence
    type: string
    properties:
      - name: format
        value: space-separated integers
      - name: length
        value: Approximately 2 * sequence_length - 1 (due to spaces)
        description: The string representation of the processed integer sequence.
actions:
  - action: convert_to_list # Added step due to input type change
    target: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    result: list_of_integers
  - action: shift_right
    target: list_of_integers
    parameters:
      - name: amount
        value: 3
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence elements to the right.
    result:
      - description: Elements from input index `i` move to output index `i + 3`.
      - description: The first 'amount' (3) positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
      - description: Elements shifted beyond the original sequence length are discarded.
      - description: Returns a new list_of_integers.
  - action: format_as_string # Modified step (was format_output)
    target: list_of_integers (result of shift_right)
    result: output_sequence (string)
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (string)
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the input_sequence (NumPy array), converting it to a list, shifting its elements 3 positions to the right (padding the start with zeros), and formatting the result as a space-separated string. The effective numerical sequence length remains constant (12).
