task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray
      - dtype: int
      - length: constant (12 in examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - object: non_zero_element
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0
      - property: first_occurrence_index
        description: The index of the first element in the sequence that is not zero.
  - object: zero_element
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - action: find_first_non_zero_index
    input: input_array (numpy.ndarray)
    output: index (int) or indicator_of_absence (e.g., -1 or None)
    description: Scan the input array from left to right to find the index of the first element with a value greater than zero.
  - action: construct_output_array
    input:
      - input_array (numpy.ndarray)
      - first_non_zero_index (int)
      - original_length (int)
    output: output_array (numpy.ndarray)
    description: Create a new array by concatenating the slice of the input array before the first non-zero index, an array of three zeros, and the slice of the input array from the first non-zero index onwards.
  - action: truncate
    input:
      - array_to_truncate (numpy.ndarray)
      - target_length (int)
    output: truncated_array (numpy.ndarray)
    description: Take only the first 'target_length' elements of the input array.
  - relationship: relative_order
    description: The relative order of the original sequence elements is preserved during the transformation, except for the insertion of new zeros and the truncation.
  - edge_case: all_zeros_input
    condition: No non-zero element is found in the input array.
    output: The output array is identical to the input array.
