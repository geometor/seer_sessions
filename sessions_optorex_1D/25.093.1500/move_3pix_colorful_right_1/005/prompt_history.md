Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input sequence of integers into an output sequence of the same length. Both input and output sequences consist of single-digit integers separated by spaces. The core operation appears to involve locating the first non-zero element in the input sequence and shifting the sequence elements based on its position. Specifically, it looks like three zero ('0') elements are inserted into the sequence immediately before the first non-zero element found, and the sequence is then truncated from the end to maintain its original length. If the input sequence consists entirely of zeros, it remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Scan the input sequence from the beginning (left) to find the index of the first element that is not zero.
4.  If no non-zero element is found (i.e., the sequence consists entirely of zeros), the output is the same as the input sequence.
5.  If a non-zero element is found at index `i`:
    a.  Create a new sequence by taking the elements of the input sequence from the start up to (but not including) index `i`.
    b.  Append three zero ('0') elements to this new sequence.
    c.  Append the remaining elements of the original input sequence, starting from index `i` to the end.
    d.  Truncate the resulting sequence by keeping only the first `L` elements, where `L` is the original length determined in step 2.
6.  Format the final sequence as a space-separated string for the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error messages (`all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions...`) clearly indicate that the initial assumption of a 1D sequence (or a simple list of integers from a string) was incorrect in the context of the execution environment. The environment appears to be treating the input as a 2D NumPy array, likely a single row (1xN grid), while the code attempted to concatenate it with a 1D array `[0, 0, 0]`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-interpret the input as a 1xN NumPy array (specifically 1x12 based on examples).
2.  Adjust the logic to operate on the elements within this single row.
3.  Ensure that the insertion of zeros and the concatenation process maintain the 2D structure (1xM) before the final truncation restores the original 1xN shape.
4.  Verify this revised logic against all provided examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze `train_1` assuming a 1x12 input grid.

output_grid=[[0 0 0 0 5 6 5 6 3 4 8 2]]
output_grid.shape=(1, 12)

```
The metrics confirm the 1x12 shape and validate the transformation logic: find the first non-zero element's column index (`first_non_zero_idx=1`), insert three zeros before that column, concatenate, and truncate back to the original number of columns (12), maintaining the 1-row structure.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid, which is a 2D NumPy array with a single row and `N` columns (shape `(1, N)`).
2.  Determine the number of columns, `N`, from the input grid's shape.
3.  Extract the single row from the input grid.
4.  Scan this row from the first column (index 0) to the last to find the column index `i` of the first element that is not zero.
5.  If no non-zero element is found (i.e., the row consists entirely of zeros), the output is the original input grid.
6.  If a non-zero element is found at column index `i`:
    a.  Create a new 1D sequence by taking the elements of the row from the start up to (but not including) column index `i`.
    b.  Append three zero ('0') elements to this sequence.
    c.  Append the remaining elements of the original row, starting from column index `i` to the end.
    d.  Truncate the resulting sequence by keeping only the first `N` elements.
    e.  Reshape this truncated 1D sequence back into a 2D NumPy array with shape `(1, N)`.
7.  Output the final `(1, N)` grid.
