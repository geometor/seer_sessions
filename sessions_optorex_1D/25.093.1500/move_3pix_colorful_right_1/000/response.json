Both input and output sequences consist of single-digit integers separated by spaces. The core operation appears to involve locating the first non-zero element in the input sequence and shifting the sequence elements based on its position. Specifically, it looks like three zero ('0') elements are inserted into the sequence immediately before the first non-zero element found, and the sequence is then truncated from the end to maintain its original length. If the input sequence consists entirely of zeros, it remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
