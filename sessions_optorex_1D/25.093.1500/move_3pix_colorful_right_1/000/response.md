Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input sequence of integers into an output sequence of the same length. Both input and output sequences consist of single-digit integers separated by spaces. The core operation appears to involve locating the first non-zero element in the input sequence and shifting the sequence elements based on its position. Specifically, it looks like three zero ('0') elements are inserted into the sequence immediately before the first non-zero element found, and the sequence is then truncated from the end to maintain its original length. If the input sequence consists entirely of zeros, it remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: constant (12 in examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - object: non_zero_element
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0
      - property: first_occurrence_index
        description: The index of the first element in the sequence that is not zero.
  - object: zero_element
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - action: find_first_non_zero
    description: Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the index of the first element with a value greater than zero.
  - action: insert_zeros
    properties:
      - count: 3
      - position: Immediately before the index found by 'find_first_non_zero'.
    description: Insert three zero elements into the sequence at the specified position.
  - action: truncate
    properties:
      - length: original length of the input sequence
    description: Remove elements from the end of the modified sequence until it matches the original input length.
  - relationship: relative_order
    description: The relative order of the original sequence elements is preserved during the transformation, except for the insertion of new zeros and the truncation.
  - edge_case: all_zeros_input
    description: If the input sequence contains only zero elements, the output sequence is identical to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Scan the input sequence from the beginning (left) to find the index of the first element that is not zero.
4.  If no non-zero element is found (i.e., the sequence consists entirely of zeros), the output is the same as the input sequence.
5.  If a non-zero element is found at index `i`:
    a.  Create a new sequence by taking the elements of the input sequence from the start up to (but not including) index `i`.
    b.  Append three zero ('0') elements to this new sequence.
    c.  Append the remaining elements of the original input sequence, starting from index `i` to the end.
    d.  Truncate the resulting sequence by keeping only the first `L` elements, where `L` is the original length determined in step 2.
6.  Format the final sequence as a space-separated string for the output.
