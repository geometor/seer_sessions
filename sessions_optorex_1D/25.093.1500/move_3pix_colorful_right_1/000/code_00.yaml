task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: constant (12 in examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - object: non_zero_element
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0
      - property: first_occurrence_index
        description: The index of the first element in the sequence that is not zero.
  - object: zero_element
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - action: find_first_non_zero
    description: Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the index of the first element with a value greater than zero.
  - action: insert_zeros
    properties:
      - count: 3
      - position: Immediately before the index found by 'find_first_non_zero'.
    description: Insert three zero elements into the sequence at the specified position.
  - action: truncate
    properties:
      - length: original length of the input sequence
    description: Remove elements from the end of the modified sequence until it matches the original input length.
  - relationship: relative_order
    description: The relative order of the original sequence elements is preserved during the transformation, except for the insertion of new zeros and the truncation.
  - edge_case: all_zeros_input
    description: If the input sequence contains only zero elements, the output sequence is identical to the input.
