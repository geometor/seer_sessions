task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D NumPy array
      - shape: (1, N) # Specifically (1, 12) in examples
      - elements: integers (0-9 observed)
  - object: row
    properties:
      - description: The single row of the input grid.
      - index: 0
  - object: non_zero_element
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0
      - property: first_occurrence_column_index
        description: The column index of the first element in the row that is not zero.
  - object: zero_element
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - action: find_first_non_zero_column
    description: Scan the grid's single row from left to right (column index 0 upwards) to find the column index of the first element with a value greater than zero.
  - action: insert_zeros_in_row
    properties:
      - count: 3
      - position: Immediately before the column index found by 'find_first_non_zero_column'.
    description: Construct a new row by inserting three zero elements into the original row at the specified column position.
  - action: truncate_row
    properties:
      - length: original number of columns (N)
    description: Remove elements from the end of the modified row until it matches the original number of columns.
  - action: reshape_output
    description: Ensure the final output is a 2D NumPy array with the original shape (1, N).
  - relationship: relative_order
    description: The relative order of the original row elements is preserved during the transformation, except for the insertion of new zeros and the truncation.
  - edge_case: all_zeros_input
    description: If the input grid's row contains only zero elements, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
