Task: Transform sequence of integers based on non-zero count.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array).
  Properties:
    - Length: L (appears fixed at 12 in examples).
    - Elements: Integers (non-negative).
    - Contains_Zeros: True/False based on presence of 0.
    - Non_Zero_Count: N (Count of elements > 0).

Output:
  Type: Sequence of binary integers (0 or 1) (e.g., list or NumPy array).
  Properties:
    - Length: L (same as input).
    - Structure: Consists of (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.

Relationship:
  - The number of '1's in the output sequence is equal to the 'Non_Zero_Count' (N) of the input sequence.
  - The number of '0's in the output sequence is equal to the 'Length' (L) of the input sequence minus the 'Non_Zero_Count' (N).
  - The '1's always appear at the end of the output sequence.
  - The '0's always appear at the beginning of the output sequence.

Action:
  1. Receive the input sequence of integers.
  2. Count the number of non-zero integers (N) in the input sequence.
  3. Determine the total length (L) of the input sequence.
  4. Construct the output sequence by creating (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.
  5. Return the constructed output sequence.
