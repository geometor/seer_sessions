The length of the sequence appears constant across examples (12 integers). The integers themselves can range from 0 upwards.\n*   **Output:** A string containing space-separated binary integers (0s and 1s). The length is the same as the input sequence.\n*   **Transformation:** The output sequence seems to be determined by the count of non-zero elements in the input sequence. Specifically, the output sequence consists of a number of leading zeros followed by a number of trailing ones. The number of trailing ones corresponds exactly to the count of non-zero integers in the input sequence. The number of leading zeros is the total length of the sequence minus the count of non-zero integers.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
