The core transformation logic, which involves counting non-zero elements and constructing an output array with leading zeros and trailing ones based on this count, appears consistent across all training examples when visually inspected.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Adjust the understanding of the input type from string to a sequence/array of integers.\n2.  Verify the transformation logic (non-zero count determines the number of trailing ones) against all examples using code execution for accuracy.\n3.  Update the YAML documentation and natural language program to reflect the correct input type and the confirmed transformation rule.\n4.  The code itself will need modification in the coder phase to handle the sequence/array input directly, removing the string parsing steps.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the length and non-zero count for each training example to confirm the pattern.\n\n"
