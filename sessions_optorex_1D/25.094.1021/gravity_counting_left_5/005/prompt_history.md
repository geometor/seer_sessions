**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers into another sequence of the same length.
*   **Input:** A string containing space-separated integers. The length of the sequence appears constant across examples (12 integers). The integers themselves can range from 0 upwards.
*   **Output:** A string containing space-separated binary integers (0s and 1s). The length is the same as the input sequence.
*   **Transformation:** The output sequence seems to be determined by the count of non-zero elements in the input sequence. Specifically, the output sequence consists of a number of leading zeros followed by a number of trailing ones. The number of trailing ones corresponds exactly to the count of non-zero integers in the input sequence. The number of leading zeros is the total length of the sequence minus the count of non-zero integers.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Transform sequence of integers based on non-zero count.

Input:
  Type: List of integers (represented as space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Length: L (appears fixed at 12 in examples).
    - Elements: Integers (non-negative).
    - Contains_Zeros: True/False based on presence of 0.
    - Non_Zero_Count: N (Count of elements > 0).

Output:
  Type: List of binary integers (0 or 1) (represented as space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Length: L (same as input).
    - Structure: Consists of (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.

Relationship:
  - The number of '1's in the output list is equal to the 'Non_Zero_Count' (N) of the input list.
  - The number of '0's in the output list is equal to the 'Length' (L) of the input list minus the 'Non_Zero_Count' (N).
  - The '1's always appear at the end of the output list.
  - The '0's always appear at the beginning of the output list.

Action:
  1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
  2. Count the number of non-zero integers (N) in the input list.
  3. Determine the total length (L) of the input list.
  4. Construct the output list by creating (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.
  5. Format the output list as a space-separated string.

5.  Create a new list.
6.  Append `L - N` zeros to the new list.
7.  Append `N` ones to the new list.
8.  Convert the new list back into a string of space-separated integers to form the output.

*code_execution:*
```python
**General Assessment:**

The provided code (`code_01.py`) failed with a "negative dimensions are not allowed" error across all examples. This error typically occurs in NumPy when trying to create an array (using `np.zeros` or `np.ones`) with a negative size. This suggests that either the calculation of `num_zeros` (`total_length - non_zero_count`) or `non_zero_count` itself resulted in a negative number during execution.

However, manually checking the logic against the examples reveals it *should* work:
*   Count non-zero integers (N) in the input list.
*   Get the total length (L).
*   The output has (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.

This logic does not inherently produce negative counts or lengths. The discrepancy likely arises from how the `transform` function in `code_01.py` handles its input. It expects a sequence of integers (`input_sequence`), but the execution environment probably passed the raw input *string*. This type mismatch would lead to incorrect calculations:
*   `len(input_sequence)` would calculate the length of the *string* (including spaces).
*   `_count_non_zeros(input_sequence)` would likely return 1 (treating the non-empty string as a single non-zero element in a 0-dimensional array), not the count of non-zero *numbers*.
*   This mismatch leads to incorrect `num_zeros` and `non_zero_count` values being passed to `np.zeros` and `np.ones`, potentially causing the error if `len(string) - 1` somehow resulted in an unexpected state, although it's still hard to see how it becomes negative directly from this logic.

The most robust strategy is to revert to the interpretation used in the initial code block (`code_00.py`) which correctly handled string input and output, and whose logic aligns with the observed input-output transformation. The core transformation rule itself seems correct based on the examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the counts (Length L, Non-Zero Count N) and expected output structure (L-N zeros, N ones) for each training example.

**Metric Analysis:**
The metrics confirm that for all training examples, the output sequence perfectly matches the structure derived from the initial hypothesis:
1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Determine the list length (L).
3.  Count the non-zero integers (N).
4.  The output consists of (L - N) zeros followed by N ones.
5.  Format the output as a space-separated string.

The errors encountered previously were almost certainly due to the code expecting a list/array input while receiving a string, or attempting to return an array instead of a string. The core transformation logic is validated by the examples.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Transform sequence of integers based on non-zero count.

InputObject:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers (e.g., "0 3 0 8 0 1 4 0 1 0 0 0")
  Represents: A sequence of integers.

OutputObject:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated binary integers (0s and 1s) (e.g., "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1")
  Represents: A binary sequence derived from the input.

IntermediateRepresentation:
  Type: List of Integers
  DerivedFrom: InputObject by parsing the string.
  Properties:
    - Length: L (number of integers in the sequence)
    - NonZeroCount: N (count of integers in the sequence > 0)
    - ZeroCount: Z (count of integers in the sequence == 0; Z = L - N)

TransformationRule:
  Action: GenerateOutputSequence
  InputProperties: L, N, Z from IntermediateRepresentation
  OutputStructure: A sequence containing Z zeros followed by N ones.
  FinalOutput: Format the generated sequence as a space-separated string (OutputObject).

Examples_Summary:
  - Consistent input length L=12 across all provided examples.
  - Output length always equals input length L.
  - Number of '1's in output always equals N (NonZeroCount).
  - Number of '0's in output always equals Z (ZeroCount = L - N).
  - '0's always precede '1's in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing space-separated integers.
2.  Split the input string by spaces and convert each part into an integer, forming a list of integers.
3.  Calculate the total number of integers in the list (let this be `L`).
4.  Count how many integers in the list are *not* equal to zero (let this count be `N`).
5.  Calculate the number of zeros in the list (let this be `Z`), which is `L - N`.
6.  Create a new list for the output.
7.  Append `Z` zeros to the new list.
8.  Append `N` ones to the new list.
9.  Convert each number in the new list back to its string representation.
10. Join the string representations with spaces in between to form the final output string.
11. Return the final output string.
