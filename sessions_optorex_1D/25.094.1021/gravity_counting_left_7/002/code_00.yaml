objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    # type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray # Updated type understanding
    type: Sequence[int]
    description: A sequence (likely NumPy array or list) of single-digit integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    # type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray # Output type might also be array
    type: Sequence[int]
    description: A sequence of binary digits (0 or 1) with the same length as the input sequence.
  - name: zero_digit
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The specific digit whose occurrences are counted in the input.
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    type: int
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    type: int
  - object: input_sequence
    name: zero_count
    type: int
    description: The total number of times the digit 0 appears in the input sequence.
relationships:
  - type: equality
    between: [input_sequence.length, output_sequence.length]
    description: The input and output sequences have the same number of elements.
  - type: dependency
    description: The value of each element in the output_sequence depends on its index and the zero_count derived from the input_sequence.
actions:
  - name: count_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: zero_count
    description: Iterate through the input sequence and count occurrences of the digit 0.
  - name: generate_output
    input: [input_sequence.length, zero_count]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create the output sequence where elements with index less than zero_count are 0, and elements with index greater than or equal to zero_count are 1.
