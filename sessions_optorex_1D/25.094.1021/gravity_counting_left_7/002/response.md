## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a string of space-separated digits (`input_str: str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the function is actually receiving a NumPy array as input.

The core logic identified in the previous phase (counting the occurrences of '0' in the input and generating an output sequence with that many leading zeros followed by ones) appears to be correct based on a manual check against all provided training examples.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:
1.  Update the understanding of the input data type from `string` to `NumPy array` (or potentially a `list` of integers, which NumPy arrays often behave like in simple iteration).
2.  Modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to correctly handle this input type, primarily by removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).

## Metrics

| Example | Input Sequence           | Input Length | Zero Count | Expected Output          | Logic Match |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :----------- | :--------- | :----------------------- | :---------- |
| train_1 | `[7 1 4 2 0 5 8 4 5 4 0 5]` | 12           | 2          | `[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_2 | `[7 7 3 0 3 9 4 0 7 5 0 1]` | 12           | 3          | `[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_3 | `[0 9 0 8 0 4 5 0 0 2 0 2]` | 12           | 6          | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_4 | `[0 7 2 4 0 9 3 0 1 6 0 0]` | 12           | 5          | `[0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_5 | `[2 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 8 0 9]` | 12           | 7          | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_6 | `[7 0 1 0 0 8 0 8 6 0 7 4]` | 12           | 5          | `[0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |
| train_7 | `[8 0 1 2 5 0 0 0 2 5 8 0]` | 12           | 5          | `[0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` | Yes         |

**Observation:** The core transformation logic holds true for all examples. The number of leading zeros in the output always matches the total count of zeros in the input.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (as a list or NumPy array).
2.  Count the total number of times the digit '0' appears in the input sequence. Store this count (let's call it `zero_count`).
3.  Determine the length of the input sequence (let's call it `length`).
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same `length`.
5.  Populate the first `zero_count` elements of the output sequence with '0'.
6.  Populate the remaining elements (from index `zero_count` to `length - 1`) of the output sequence with '1'.
7.  Return the generated output sequence.
