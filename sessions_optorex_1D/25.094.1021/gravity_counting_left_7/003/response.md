"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of single-digit integers 
into a binary sequence (list or NumPy array) of the same length.
The output sequence consists of a block of zeros followed by a block of ones.
The number of zeros in the output sequence is equal to the total count of 
the integer 0 in the input sequence. The remaining positions are filled with ones.
