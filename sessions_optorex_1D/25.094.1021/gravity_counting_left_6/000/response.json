The output sequence always starts with zero or more 0s and is followed by one or more 1s, with no interleaving (e.g., `000111`). The crucial observation is that the position where the output switches from 0 to 1 seems directly related to the number of zeros present in the input sequence. Specifically, the number of initial zeros in the output sequence equals the total count of zeros in the input sequence.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
