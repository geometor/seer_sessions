*   **Perception:** The input is a sequence of 12 single-digit integers. The output is also a sequence of 12 integers, but constrained to only 0s and 1s. The output sequence always starts with zero or more 0s and is followed by one or more 1s, with no interleaving (e.g., `000111`). The crucial observation is that the position where the output switches from 0 to 1 seems directly related to the number of zeros present in the input sequence. Specifically, the number of initial zeros in the output sequence equals the total count of zeros in the input sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Sequence Transformation
    Input:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Element Range: 0-9
      Name: input_sequence
    Output:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Element Range: 0-1
      Structure: A sequence of N zeros followed by (12-N) ones.
      Name: output_sequence
    Transformation:
      Action: Count occurrences of a specific value (0) in the input_sequence.
      Parameter: Value to count is 0.
      Result: An integer count, N.
      Action: Construct the output_sequence based on N.
      Rule:
        - The first N elements of output_sequence are 0.
        - The subsequent (12-N) elements of output_sequence are 1.
    Relationship:
      - The number of leading zeros in the output_sequence is equal to the total count of zeros in the input_sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Count how many times the integer 0 appears in the input sequence. Store this count as `zero_count`.
    3.  Generate an output sequence of 12 integers.
    4.  Set the first `zero_count` elements of the output sequence to 0.
    5.  Set the remaining elements (from index `zero_count` to 11) of the output sequence to 1.
    6.  Return the generated output sequence.
