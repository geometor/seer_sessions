Task: Sequence Transformation
Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 integers
  Element Range: 0-9
  Name: input_str
Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 integers
  Element Range: 0-1
  Structure: A sequence of N zeros followed by (12-N) ones, where N is derived from the input.
  Name: output_str
Transformation:
  Action: Parse input_str into a list of integers (input_sequence).
  Action: Count occurrences of the integer 0 in the input_sequence.
  Parameter: Value to count = 0.
  Result: An integer count, N (zero_count).
  Action: Construct the output sequence.
  Rule:
    - Create a list containing N zeros.
    - Create a list containing (12-N) ones.
    - Concatenate these two lists to form the output_sequence_list.
  Action: Format the output_sequence_list into output_str.
  Rule: Join elements of output_sequence_list with spaces.
Relationship:
  - The number of leading zeros in the output_str (and output_sequence_list) is equal to the total count of zeros found in the input_str (input_sequence).
Constraint:
  - Both input and output sequences always have a length of 12.
