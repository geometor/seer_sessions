*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of 12 integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of 12 integers, consisting only of 0s and 1s.
    *   The transformation seems to involve counting the non-zero elements in the input sequence.
    *   The number of '1's in the output sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input sequence.
    *   The '1's in the output sequence are grouped together at the end of the sequence.
    *   The starting position of the block of '1's in the output depends on the count of non-zero elements in the input. Specifically, if there are `N` non-zero elements in the input, the '1's start at index `12 - N`.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on the count of non-zero elements.
    input_features:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list[int]
        length: 12
        description: A sequence of 12 integers.
        properties:
          - non_zero_count: The number of elements in the sequence that are not equal to 0.
    output_features:
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list[int]
        length: 12
        description: A sequence of 12 integers, containing only 0s and 1s.
        properties:
          - ones_count: The number of 1s in the sequence.
          - ones_start_index: The index where the sequence of 1s begins.
          - composition: Contains `ones_start_index` zeros followed by `ones_count` ones.
    transformation_rules:
      - rule: Calculate the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence. Let this be N.
      - rule: The output_sequence will contain N ones.
      - rule: The output_sequence will have 12 - N zeros at the beginning.
      - rule: The N ones will start at index 12 - N and continue to the end of the sequence.
    relationships:
      - output_sequence.ones_count == input_sequence.non_zero_count
      - output_sequence.ones_start_index == 12 - input_sequence.non_zero_count
      - output_sequence consists of (12 - N) zeros followed by N ones, where N is input_sequence.non_zero_count.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Count how many elements in the input sequence are not zero. Store this count as `N`.
    3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 elements, initially all set to 0.
    4.  Determine the starting index for placing the '1's: `start_index = 12 - N`.
    5.  Fill the output sequence with '1's from the `start_index` up to the end of the sequence (index 11). There will be exactly `N` ones placed.
    6.  Return the generated output sequence.
