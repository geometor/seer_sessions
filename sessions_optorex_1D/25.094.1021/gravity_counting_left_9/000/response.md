Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Each input is a string containing 12 single digits separated by spaces. The digits range from 0 to 9.
*   **Output:** Each output is also a string containing 12 single digits separated by spaces. However, the output digits are exclusively '0' or '1'.
*   **Structure:** Both input and output maintain a fixed length of 12 elements (digits). The output structure consists of a sequence of '0's followed by a sequence of '1's.
*   **Relationship:** The number of '0's and '1's in the output seems related to the count of zero and non-zero digits in the corresponding input. Specifically, the count of '0's at the beginning of the output matches the total count of '0' digits in the input. Consequently, the count of '1's at the end of the output matches the total count of non-zero digits in the input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 space-separated digits.
2.  Count the total number of '0' digits present in the input sequence. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Count the total number of non-zero digits (digits '1' through '9') present in the input sequence. Let this count be `M`.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first creating a sequence of `N` '0' digits, followed by a sequence of `M` '1' digits.
5.  Format the constructed output sequence as a string with digits separated by spaces.
