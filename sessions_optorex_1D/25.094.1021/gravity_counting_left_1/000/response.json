The output sequence consists solely of 0s and 1s. The transformation appears to depend on the count of non-zero elements within the input sequence. Specifically, the number of trailing 1s in the output sequence corresponds directly to the total number of non-zero integers found in the input sequence. The preceding elements in the output sequence are all 0s.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
