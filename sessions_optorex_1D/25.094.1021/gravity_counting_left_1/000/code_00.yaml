Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-9
  Structure: Linear sequence

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-1
  Structure: Linear sequence, composed of a prefix of 0s followed by a suffix of 1s

Transformation:
  Action: Count non-zero elements in the input sequence.
  Relationship: The count of non-zero elements determines the length of the suffix of 1s in the output sequence.
  Process:
    - Identify all elements in the input sequence that are not equal to 0.
    - Calculate the total count (`k`) of these non-zero elements.
    - Construct the output sequence.
    - Set the first `12 - k` elements of the output sequence to 0.
    - Set the last `k` elements of the output sequence to 1.

Examples:
  - Example 1: Input has 6 non-zero elements -> Output has 6 trailing 1s (starts at index 6).
  - Example 2: Input has 5 non-zero elements -> Output has 5 trailing 1s (starts at index 7).
  - Example 3: Input has 3 non-zero elements -> Output has 3 trailing 1s (starts at index 9).
