"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on the count of non-zero elements.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Count the number of non-zero integers in the input sequence. Let this count be 'k'.
2. Create an output sequence of 12 integers.
3. The first '12 - k' elements of the output sequence are set to 0.
4. The last 'k' elements of the output sequence are set to 1.
