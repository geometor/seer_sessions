Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence of Integers (potentially represented as string, list, or numpy array)
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-9
  Structure: Conceptually a linear sequence of 12 integers. Actual representation might vary (e.g., string, list, 1D numpy array, potentially nested array like 2D numpy array with one row).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-1
  Structure: Linear sequence composed of a prefix of 0s followed by a suffix of 1s.

Transformation:
  Preprocessing:
    - Action: Ensure the input is converted into a flat list of 12 individual integers, regardless of original format (string, list, numpy array, nested array).
  Core Logic:
    - Action: Count the number of elements in the flattened input list that are not equal to 0. Let this count be `k`.
  Output Generation:
    - Action: Construct the output list of length 12.
    - Rule: The list consists of `12 - k` zeros followed by `k` ones.
    - Process:
      - Initialize a list of 12 zeros.
      - If `k > 0`, replace the last `k` elements of the list with ones.

Examples (Verified Logic):
  - Input Non-Zeros: 6 -> Output: 6 leading zeros, 6 trailing ones.
  - Input Non-Zeros: 5 -> Output: 7 leading zeros, 5 trailing ones.
  - Input Non-Zeros: 3 -> Output: 9 leading zeros, 3 trailing ones.
  - Input Non-Zeros: 9 -> Output: 3 leading zeros, 9 trailing ones.

Potential Issue Source (based on errors):
  - The execution environment might pass input in a format (e.g., multi-dimensional numpy array) that causes standard iteration and comparison (`element != 0`) to fail with an ambiguity error if not correctly flattened/handled first.
