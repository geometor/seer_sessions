**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers into another sequence of 12 integers. The input integers range from 0 to 9. The output sequence consists solely of 0s and 1s. The transformation appears to depend on the count of non-zero elements within the input sequence. Specifically, the number of trailing 1s in the output sequence corresponds directly to the total number of non-zero integers found in the input sequence. The preceding elements in the output sequence are all 0s.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-9
  Structure: Linear sequence

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: 12
  ElementRange: 0-1
  Structure: Linear sequence, composed of a prefix of 0s followed by a suffix of 1s

Transformation:
  Action: Count non-zero elements in the input sequence.
  Relationship: The count of non-zero elements determines the length of the suffix of 1s in the output sequence.
  Process:
    - Identify all elements in the input sequence that are not equal to 0.
    - Calculate the total count (`k`) of these non-zero elements.
    - Construct the output sequence.
    - Set the first `12 - k` elements of the output sequence to 0.
    - Set the last `k` elements of the output sequence to 1.

Examples:
  - Example 1: Input has 6 non-zero elements -> Output has 6 trailing 1s (starts at index 6).
  - Example 2: Input has 5 non-zero elements -> Output has 5 trailing 1s (starts at index 7).
  - Example 3: Input has 3 non-zero elements -> Output has 3 trailing 1s (starts at index 9).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Count how many integers in the input sequence are not zero. Let this count be `k`.
3.  Create a new sequence of 12 integers, initially all set to 0.
4.  If `k` is greater than 0, change the last `k` integers in the new sequence to 1.
5.  Output the resulting sequence.
```python
import math

"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on the count of non-zero elements.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Count the number of non-zero integers in the input sequence. Let this count be 'k'.
2. Create an output sequence of 12 integers.
3. The first '12 - k' elements of the output sequence are set to 0.
4. The last 'k' elements of the output sequence are set to 1.
