*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of digits based on the positions of a specific non-zero digit. The input and output are strings of space-separated integers. The core operation is filling a segment of the sequence.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Each input sequence contains zeros and occurrences of a single non-zero digit (e.g., only 7s, only 1s, only 6s).
    *   The output sequence is derived by identifying the first and last occurrences of this non-zero digit in the input.
    *   The segment of the sequence between the first and last occurrence (inclusive) is filled entirely with that non-zero digit.
    *   Elements outside this segment (before the first occurrence and after the last occurrence) retain their original values (which are always 0 in the examples).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - item: sequence
        properties:
          - type: 1D list of integers
          - representation: space-separated string
          - contains: zeros and potentially one type of non-zero digit
      - item: non_zero_digit
        properties:
          - value: integer > 0
          - occurrences: potentially multiple in the sequence
        relationships:
          - defines the fill value
          - its first and last positions define the fill boundaries
      - item: segment
        properties:
          - defined_by: first and last index of the non_zero_digit
          - range: inclusive of start and end indices
        action:
          - fill: set all elements within the segment to the non_zero_digit value
    transformation:
      type: fill_segment
      input: input_sequence
      output: modified_sequence
      steps:
        - identify the unique non-zero digit in the input_sequence
        - find the index of the first occurrence of this digit
        - find the index of the last occurrence of this digit
        - fill the segment from the first index to the last index (inclusive) with this digit
        - keep elements outside the segment unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
    2.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value (`fill_value`) present in the list.
    3.  Find the index of the first occurrence (`start_index`) of `fill_value` in the list.
    4.  Find the index of the last occurrence (`end_index`) of `fill_value` in the list.
    5.  Create the output list by iterating through the indices of the input list:
        *   For indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive), set the corresponding element in the output list to `fill_value`.
        *   For indices outside this range, copy the element from the input list to the output list.
    6.  Format the output list back into a space-separated string of digits.
