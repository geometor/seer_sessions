The input and output are strings of space-separated integers. The core operation is filling a segment of the sequence.\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   Each input sequence contains zeros and occurrences of a single non-zero digit (e.g., only 7s, only 1s, only 6s).\n    *   The output sequence is derived by identifying the first and last occurrences of this non-zero digit in the input.\n    *   The segment of the sequence between the first and last occurrence (inclusive) is filled entirely with that non-zero digit.\n    *   Elements outside this segment (before the first occurrence and after the last occurrence) retain their original values (which are always 0 in the examples).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
