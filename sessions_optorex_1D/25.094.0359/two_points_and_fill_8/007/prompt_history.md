*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly two instances of a single non-zero digit, with all other elements being zero.
    *   The non-zero digit from the input is the same as the non-zero digit used in the output.
    *   The output sequence essentially "fills" the gap between the first and last occurrence of the non-zero digit found in the input, including the positions of the original non-zero digits.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value present in the input sequence; let this value be `d`.
    2.  Find the index of the first occurrence of `d` in the input sequence; let this be `start_index`.
    3.  Find the index of the last occurrence of `d` in the input sequence; let this be `end_index`.
    4.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
    5.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the value in the new sequence at that index to `d`.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: could not broadcast input array from shape (12,) into shape (1,)
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The core logic identified previously (finding the first and last non-zero element and filling the space between them with that element's value) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.
    *   The error `could not broadcast input array from shape (12,) into shape (1,)` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly suggests the issue lies not in the core transformation logic itself, but in how the data (likely NumPy arrays) is being handled, specifically regarding its dimensions.
    *   The ARC framework typically uses 2D grids (NumPy arrays). Even though the examples visually resemble 1D sequences, they are likely represented as 1xN or Nx1 arrays. The previous code assumed a strictly 1D array (`(N,)`), while the error indicates a mismatch, probably receiving a 2D array (`(1, N)` or `(N, 1)`) and attempting operations incompatible with that shape (like assigning a scalar `non_zero_digit` to a slice that doesn't resolve to a single element or a compatible shape).
    *   **Strategy:** The primary strategy is to modify the data handling to explicitly work with 2D arrays, assuming a `(1, N)` shape based on the string representation. This involves:
        1.  Ensuring input parsing results in a 2D array. (This might be handled by the environment, but the code should anticipate it).
        2.  Adjusting `np.where` to correctly extract column indices from the tuple it returns for 2D arrays.
        3.  Modifying the array slicing for the fill operation to target the correct row and column range (e.g., `output_grid[0, start_index : end_index + 1]`).
        4.  Ensuring the final output string formatting correctly flattens the 2D array back into the required space-separated string.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   All 7 training examples failed with the same broadcasting error.
    *   The test example also failed with the same error.
    *   This consistency points to a systematic shape/dimension handling issue rather than a logic error specific to certain inputs.
    *   Let's verify the indices and values for `train_1` assuming a `(1, 12)` grid:

            - value: The axis along which the non-zero elements appear and are filled (likely axis 1 for (1, N) grids)
      - start_index:
          type: integer
          properties:
            - value: index along the primary_axis of the first occurrence of the non_zero_digit in the input_grid
      - end_index:
          type: integer
          properties:
            - value: index along the primary_axis of the last occurrence of the non_zero_digit in the input_grid
    actions:
      - identify_shape: determine the shape of the input_grid (e.g., (1, N))
      - find_non_zero_coords: find the coordinates (row, col) of all non-zero elements
      - identify_digit_and_indices: 
          - determine the unique non_zero_digit
          - determine the primary_axis (the one where indices differ)
          - find the minimum (start_index) and maximum (end_index) index along the primary_axis
          - determine the fixed_index on the other axis (e.g., row index 0 if primary_axis is 1)
      - create_output: generate an initial output_grid filled with zeros, matching the input_grid shape
      - fill_segment: populate the output_grid with the non_zero_digit along the primary_axis from start_index to end_index (inclusive), at the fixed_index of the other axis.
      - format_output: flatten the output_grid and convert it to a space-separated string.
    relationships:
      - The non_zero_digit in the output_grid is identical to the non_zero_digit in the input_grid.
      - The segment of non_zero_digits in the output_grid spans the range defined by the start_index and end_index along the primary_axis, located at the fixed_index of the other axis.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 2D NumPy integer grid (assume shape `(1, N)` based on examples).
    2.  Find the coordinates `(row, col)` of all non-zero elements in the input grid.
    3.  If no non-zero elements are found, create an output grid of the same shape filled with zeros and proceed to step 8.
    4.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value (`d`) from the non-zero elements.
    5.  Identify the primary axis along which the non-zero elements are spread (this will be axis 1, the column axis, for a `(1, N)` grid). Determine the fixed index on the other axis (axis 0, the row index, which will be 0).
    6.  Find the minimum (`start_index`) and maximum (`end_index`) indices along the primary axis (column indices) from the coordinates found in step 2.
    7.  Create a new 2D NumPy integer grid (`output_grid`) of the same shape as the input grid, initially filled with zeros.
    8.  Set the elements in the `output_grid` at the `fixed_index` row (row 0) and columns from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) to the value `d`.
    9.  Flatten the `output_grid` into a 1D sequence.
    10. Convert the elements of the flattened sequence to strings and join them with single spaces to create the output string.
    11. Return the resulting string.
