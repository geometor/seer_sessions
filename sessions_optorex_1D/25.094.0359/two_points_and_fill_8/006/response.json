            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The core logic identified previously (finding the first and last non-zero element and filling the space between them with that element's value) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.\n    *   The error `could not broadcast input array from shape (12,) into shape (1,)` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly suggests the issue lies not in the core transformation logic itself, but in how the data (likely NumPy arrays) is being handled, specifically regarding its dimensions.\n    *   The ARC framework typically uses 2D grids (NumPy arrays). Even though the examples visually resemble 1D sequences, they are likely represented as 1xN or Nx1 arrays. The previous code assumed a strictly 1D array (`(N,)`), while the error indicates a mismatch, probably receiving a 2D array (`(1, N)` or `(N, 1)`) and attempting operations incompatible with that shape (like assigning a scalar `non_zero_digit` to a slice that doesn't resolve to a single element or a compatible shape).\n    *   **Strategy:** The primary strategy is to modify the data handling to explicitly work with 2D arrays, assuming a `(1, N)` shape based on the string representation. This involves:\n        1.  Ensuring input parsing results in a 2D array. (This might be handled by the environment, but the code should anticipate it).\n        2.  Adjusting `np.where` to correctly extract column indices from the tuple it returns for 2D arrays.\n        3.  Modifying the array slicing for the fill operation to target the correct row and column range (e.g., `output_grid[0, start_index : end_index + 1]`).\n        4.  Ensuring the final output string formatting correctly flattens the 2D array back into the required space-separated string.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   All 7 training examples failed with the same broadcasting error.\n    *   The test example also failed with the same error.\n    *   This consistency points to a systematic shape/dimension handling issue rather than a logic error specific to certain inputs.\n    *   Let's verify the indices and values for `train_1` assuming a `(1, 12)` grid:\n    "
