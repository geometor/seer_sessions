"""
Transforms an input sequence (list of integers) based on the following rule:
1. Create the output sequence as an initial copy of the input sequence.
2. Identify all unique non-zero integer values present in the input sequence.
3. For each unique non-zero value found:
   a. Scan the *input* sequence to find the index of the *first* position where this value occurs.
   b. Scan the *input* sequence to find the index of the *last* position where this value occurs.
   c. Modify the *output* sequence: For all positions from the first index found in step (a) up to and including the last index found in step (b), set the element at that position to the current unique non-zero value.
4. Return the fully modified output sequence.
