Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of numbers. The input sequence contains mostly zeros, with one or more instances of a specific non-zero digit appearing at different positions. The output sequence modifies the input by "filling in" the zeros that lie between the first and last occurrence of each unique non-zero digit with that same digit. If a non-zero digit appears only once, or multiple times consecutively, the sequence remains unchanged in that region unless affected by the filling operation of another digit. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9 based on examples)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: integers (derived from input)
  - name: non_zero_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: > 0
      - occurrences: one or more times in the input_sequence
  - name: index
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0 to length-1
      - represents: position within a sequence

relationships:
  - type: derived_from
    subject: output_sequence
    object: input_sequence
  - type: determines_fill_range
    subject: [first_occurrence_index, last_occurrence_index] # for a specific non_zero_value
    object: segment_of_output_sequence
  - type: determines_fill_value
    subject: non_zero_value
    object: elements_within_fill_range

actions:
  - name: identify_unique_non_zero_values
    input: input_sequence
    output: set_of_non_zero_values
  - name: find_indices_of_value
    input: [input_sequence, non_zero_value]
    output: list_of_indices
  - name: determine_min_max_indices
    input: list_of_indices
    output: [min_index, max_index]
  - name: fill_range_in_sequence
    input: [sequence_to_modify, min_index, max_index, fill_value]
    output: modified_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the output sequence being an identical copy of the input sequence.
2.  Find all unique non-zero integer values present in the input sequence.
3.  For each unique non-zero value identified:
    a.  Find the index of the first occurrence and the index of the last occurrence of this value in the input sequence.
    b.  Modify the output sequence by setting every element from the first occurrence index up to and including the last occurrence index to this non-zero value.
4.  After processing all unique non-zero values, the resulting modified sequence is the final output.
