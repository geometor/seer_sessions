The input sequence contains mostly zeros, with one or more instances of a specific non-zero digit appearing at different positions. The output sequence modifies the input by \"filling in\" the zeros that lie between the first and last occurrence of each unique non-zero digit with that same digit. If a non-zero digit appears only once, or multiple times consecutively, the sequence remains unchanged in that region unless affected by the filling operation of another digit. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
