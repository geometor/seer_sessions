objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: list
    contains: integers (0-9)
    assumptions:
      - Flat (one-dimensional) list of standard Python integers.
  - name: output_list
    type: list
    contains: integers (0-9)
    derivation: Either a copy of input_list or a modified copy.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value > 0
      - count_in_list: The number of times it appears in input_list.
      - indices_in_list: A list of indices where it appears.
      - first_occurrence_index: The smallest index in indices_in_list.
  - name: target_digit_candidate
    type: non_zero_digit
    condition: count_in_list == 2
  - name: selected_target_digit
    type: target_digit_candidate
    selection_criteria: The candidate with the minimum first_occurrence_index among all candidates. Is None if no candidates exist.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Elements located strictly between the two indices of the selected_target_digit.
  - type: conditional
    description: The transformation action depends on the existence of a selected_target_digit.

actions:
  - name: analyze_input
    input: input_list
    output: map of each non_zero_digit to its indices_in_list and first_occurrence_index.
  - name: find_target_candidates
    input: result of analyze_input
    output: list of non_zero_digits where count_in_list == 2.
  - name: select_target_digit
    input: list of target_digit_candidates, map of first_occurrence_indices
    output: the selected_target_digit (or None) and its indices.
    logic: Choose the candidate with the minimum first_occurrence_index.
  - name: fill_gap
    input: input_list, selected_target_digit, indices_of_target
    output: modified_list
    condition: selected_target_digit is not None.
    logic: Create a copy of input_list. Iterate from index `idx1 + 1` to `idx2` (exclusive), setting element value to selected_target_digit.
  - name: return_output
    input: result of fill_gap or original input_list
    output: final output_list
    logic: Return the modified list if fill_gap occurred, otherwise return a copy of the original input_list.

error_observed:
  - type: ValueError
  - message: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()"
  - likely_cause: Input data being passed as a NumPy array (or similar) instead of a standard Python list, causing issues in boolean comparisons (e.g., `if value != 0:`).

goal:
  - Transform input_list to output_list according to the specified conditional gap-filling rule, ensuring robustness against potential input type variations if possible.
