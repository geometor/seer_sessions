            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code implements the logic derived from the initial examples: find a non-zero digit appearing exactly twice and fill the gap between its occurrences. The logic correctly handles all provided training examples when traced manually.\n\nHowever, the code consistently fails during execution with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error typically arises when a NumPy array (or similar array-like structure) is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if array:`).\n\nGiven that the Python code itself does not explicitly use NumPy or perform operations that should yield this error on standard Python lists of integers, the most likely causes are:\n\n1.  **Environment/Test Harness:** The testing environment might be passing the input data as NumPy arrays instead of Python lists. The code assumes `List[int]`.\n2.  **Input Parsing:** Although the examples show space-separated integers, the actual parsing mechanism used by the test harness might produce an unexpected data structure (e.g., an array of string digits, or a multi-dimensional array if line breaks were misinterpreted).\n3.  **Hidden Dependency:** An imported library (like `collections`) might behave unexpectedly under specific conditions or interact poorly with the environment's data types, although this is highly unlikely for standard libraries.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Assume Correct Input Type:** Proceed with the assumption that the input *should* be a flat Python list of integers (`List[int]`) as implied by the examples and standard practice.\n2.  **Refine Logic Description:** Reiterate the transformation logic clearly, emphasizing the selection criteria (exactly two occurrences, earliest first appearance) based on the manual trace of examples.\n3.  **Document Assumptions:** Explicitly state the assumption about the input data type (`List[int]`) in the documentation.\n4.  **Isolate Failure Point (for Coder):** Note the specific error message and its likely cause (implicit boolean evaluation of an array) as crucial information for the Coder phase. The Coder should ensure the input is definitely a `List[int]` at the start of the function or handle potential NumPy array inputs gracefully (e.g., by converting `input_list.tolist()` if it's a NumPy array, or by ensuring comparisons like `value != 0` handle potential NumPy bool types correctly if direct conversion isn't desired).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on manual analysis, the core logic appears sound for all examples. The failure is likely related to type handling or the execution environment.\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a single line of space-separated integers, parsed into `List[int]`.\n*   **Output Format:** `List[int]`.\n*   **Key Operation:** Identify non-zero digits, count occurrences, find indices.\n*   **Condition:** Transformation occurs *only* if a non-zero digit appears exactly twice.\n*   **Selection:** If multiple digits appear twice, the one whose *first* occurrence has the lowest index is chosen.\n*   **Action:** Fill elements *between* the two occurrences (exclusive) with the chosen digit's value.\n*   **Failure Mode:** Consistent `ValueError` related to boolean ambiguity of arrays, suggesting the `transform` function receives an array-like object instead of a standard list, or an element comparison unexpectedly involves arrays.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
