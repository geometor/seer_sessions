            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified from the error messages (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") is that the input data provided to the `transform` function is not a simple 1D list of integers as initially assumed. Instead, it appears to be structured as a nested list (e.g., `[[0, 0, ..., 8]]`) or, more likely given the error source, a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, ..., 8]])`). The original code attempted to iterate and compare elements assuming a 1D structure, leading to comparisons on entire arrays/lists instead of individual numbers.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Use `tool_code` to inspect the input format definitively.\n2.  **Adapt Access Logic:** Modify the code to correctly access the single row within the nested structure (e.g., `input_sequence[0]`) before applying the core transformation logic.\n3.  **Refine Program:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the nested data structure and the need to operate on the inner sequence.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution in the thought process:\n*   The input can be represented either as a `list` containing a single inner `list` (e.g., `[[0, 0, ..., 8]]`) or as a `numpy.ndarray` with shape `(1, N)` (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, ..., 8]])`).\n*   Direct iteration over such structures (`for val in sequence:`) yields the inner list/row array.\n*   Direct comparison of the inner list/row array (`val != 0`) causes the ambiguity error for NumPy arrays.\n*   The core logic needs to be applied to the *elements* of the inner sequence, accessed via `sequence[0][i]` (for lists) or `sequence[0, i]` (for NumPy arrays).\n*   The helper functions `find_first_nonzero_index` and `find_last_nonzero_index`, as well as the main loop in `transform`, must operate on this inner sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Receive the input grid, which contains a single row of digits (potentially nested within another structure like a list or a 2D NumPy array).\n2.  Extract the actual sequence of digits from this single row. Let this be the `inner_sequence`.\n3.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`first_idx`) and the index of the last non-zero digit (`last_idx`) within the `inner_sequence`.\n4.  If no non-zero digits are found in the `inner_sequence`, or if `first_idx` is the same as `last_idx`, return the original input grid structure unchanged.\n5.  Create a new sequence (the `output_sequence`) as a copy of the `inner_sequence`.\n6.  Initialize a variable, `fill_value`, with the value of the digit at `first_idx` in the `inner_sequence`.\n7.  Iterate through the indices of the `inner_sequence` from `first_idx` up to `last_idx` (inclusive). Let the current index be `i`.\n8.  Inside the loop, examine the digit at index `i` in the *`inner_sequence`*. If this digit is non-zero, update `fill_value` to this digit's value.\n9.  Still inside the loop, examine the digit at index `i` in the *`output_sequence`*. If this digit is currently 0, change its value in the `output_sequence` to the current `fill_value`.\n10. After the loop finishes, reconstruct the output grid by placing the modified `output_sequence` back into the same type of structure as the original input grid (e.g., wrap it in a list `[output_sequence]` or convert it to a 2D NumPy array `np.array([output_sequence])`).\n11. Return the reconstructed output grid."
