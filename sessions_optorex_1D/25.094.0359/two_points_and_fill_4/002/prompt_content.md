"""
Transforms a sequence of digits by filling the zeros between the first and last non-zero digits. 
The fill value propagates from left to right, starting with the value of the first non-zero digit, 
and updating whenever a new non-zero digit is encountered in the input sequence within that range.
Zeros outside the range defined by the first and last non-zero digits remain unchanged.
