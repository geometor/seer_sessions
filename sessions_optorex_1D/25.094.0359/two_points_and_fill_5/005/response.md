"""
Transforms an input list of integers based on the rule:
1. Find the single non-zero integer value (V) present in the input list.
2. Locate the indices of the first (start_index) and second (end_index) occurrences of V.
3. Create an output list, initially a copy of the input list.
4. Fill the elements in the output list from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with the value V.
5. Return the modified output list.
