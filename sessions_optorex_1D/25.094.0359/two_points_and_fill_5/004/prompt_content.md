"""
Transforms an input list or 1D NumPy array of integers based on the following rule:
1. Find the single non-zero integer value (V) present in the input sequence.
2. Locate the indices of the first (start_index) and second (end_index) occurrences of V.
3. Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
4. Fill the elements in the output sequence from start_index to end_index (inclusive) with the value V.
5. Return the modified sequence (as a list).
