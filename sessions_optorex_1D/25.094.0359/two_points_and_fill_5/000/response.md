*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are one-dimensional lists (or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each input list contains exactly two instances of the same non-zero digit, with all other elements being zero.
    *   The output list is derived from the input list by modifying the elements *between* (and including) the positions of the two non-zero digits.
    *   The modification involves changing all elements within this identified range to the value of the non-zero digit.
    *   Elements outside this range remain unchanged from the input.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: array_transformation
    input_element_type: integer (single digit)
    output_element_type: integer (single digit)
    input_structure:
      type: list
      properties:
        - contains exactly two identical non-zero digits (let's call this 'fill_value')
        - all other elements are zero
    output_structure:
      type: list
      derivation: based on input list
    transformation_logic:
      action: fill_range
      parameters:
        - fill_value: the non-zero digit found in the input
        - start_index: the index of the first occurrence of fill_value in the input
        - end_index: the index of the second occurrence of fill_value in the input
      steps:
        - identify the non-zero digit (fill_value) in the input list
        - find the indices of the first and second occurrences of fill_value
        - create the output list, initially identical to the input list
        - modify the output list by setting all elements from start_index to end_index (inclusive) to the fill_value
    invariants:
      - list length remains constant between input and output
      - elements outside the range [start_index, end_index] remain unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input list to find the single non-zero integer value present; let this value be `V`.
    2.  Locate the index of the first occurrence of `V` in the input list; let this be `start_index`.
    3.  Locate the index of the second occurrence of `V` in the input list; let this be `end_index`.
    4.  Initialize the output list as a copy of the input list.
    5.  Iterate through the output list from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the corresponding element's value to `V`.
    6.  The resulting list is the final output.
