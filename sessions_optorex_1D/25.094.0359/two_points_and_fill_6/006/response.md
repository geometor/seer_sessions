**General Assessment and Strategy:**

Based on the provided training examples and the execution results of the previous code attempt, the core transformation rule appears to be: "For each non-zero digit present in the input sequence, if it appears more than once, fill all the elements strictly *between* its first and last occurrence with that digit."

The previous code attempt failed on examples where such filling was necessary (train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7), outputting the original input instead of the filled sequence. However, the Python code snippet provided *seems* logically correct according to the derived rule. The discrepancy likely lies either in the exact code that was executed for the test report or a misunderstanding in reporting, rather than a flaw in the rule itself derived from the examples.

The strategy remains to refine the description of this rule, ensuring clarity on:
1.  Operating on a copy of the input.
2.  Iterating through unique non-zero values found in the *original* input.
3.  Finding the *first* and *last* index of each such value in the *original* input.
4.  Filling the *copy* only if the last index is strictly greater than the first index + 1 (i.e., there's a gap).
5.  The range of filling is exclusive of the boundary indices themselves (`first_index + 1` up to `last_index - 1`).

**Metrics and Analysis:**

The following analysis uses the provided inputs, expected outputs, and the reported code outputs to highlight where the transformation rule applies and where the previous code failed.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill the sequence segment between the first and last occurrence of each non-zero digit with that digit's value.

data_structures:
  - name: sequence
    type: 1D list or array of integers
    properties:
      - elements: Single digits (0-9)
      - length: Fixed for a given task instance (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - role: Represents the state before and after transformation.

elements:
  - name: background_value
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: Represents empty or unchanged space. Does not trigger filling.

  - name: marker_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value_range: 1-9 (non-zero digits)
      - role: Defines segments to potentially fill. Its value is used for filling.
      - occurrences: Can appear zero, one, or multiple times in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_markers
    input: input_sequence
    output: set of unique marker_values present
    description: Find all unique non-zero digits in the input.

  - name: find_marker_indices
    input: input_sequence, marker_value (N)
    output: list of indices where N appears
    description: Locate all positions of a specific marker value N within the original input sequence.

  - name: determine_fill_boundaries
    input: list of indices
    output: first_index, last_index (or null if < 2 indices)
    condition: Requires the marker value to appear at least twice (list length >= 2).
    description: Find the minimum (first) and maximum (last) index from the list of occurrences.

  - name: check_fill_condition
    input: first_index, last_index
    output: boolean (true if gap exists, false otherwise)
    condition: last_index > first_index + 1
    description: Determines if there is at least one element strictly between the first and last indices.

  - name: apply_fill
    input: output_sequence (initially a copy of input), first_index, last_index, marker_value (N)
    output: modified_output_sequence
    condition: check_fill_condition must be true.
    description: Modify the output_sequence by setting elements at indices from first_index + 1 up to (but not including) last_index to the value N.

process_flow:
  - step: Create a mutable copy of the input sequence (this will be the output sequence).
  - step: Perform identify_markers on the input sequence.
  - step: For each unique marker_value (N) found:
      - Perform find_marker_indices for N using the *original* input sequence.
      - Perform determine_fill_boundaries using the found indices.
      - If boundaries (first_index, last_index) are determined (i.e., N appeared at least twice):
          - Perform check_fill_condition using first_index and last_index.
          - If the fill condition is true (a gap exists):
              - Perform apply_fill on the *output* sequence using N, first_index, and last_index.
  - step: Return the final modified output sequence.

invariants:
  - Sequence length remains constant.
  - Values 0 remain 0 unless overwritten by a fill operation.
  - Original positions of marker values that define the boundaries (first and last occurrences) remain unchanged in the output.
  - Only the elements *strictly between* the first and last occurrence of a marker value can be changed.
  - If a marker value appears only once, it causes no changes to the sequence.
  - If a marker value appears multiple times but without any elements between its first and last occurrence (e.g., `...5 5...`), it causes no changes.

validation_notes:
  - Analysis confirms the rule: filling occurs only when a non-zero digit `N` appears multiple times and `last_index > first_index + 1`.
  - The execution results provided show the code failed to perform the `apply_fill` action when required (e.g., `code_fill_performed` is `false` when `fill_indices` is non-empty and `expected_fill_correct` is `true` in examples 2, 3, 6, 7). This points to an issue in the previous execution/code, not the rule derived from visually comparing inputs and outputs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Prepare Output**: Create an exact, modifiable copy of the input sequence. This copy will store the results of the transformation.
2.  **Find Unique Markers**: Identify all the distinct non-zero integer values present in the *original* input sequence.
3.  **Iterate Through Markers**: Process each unique non-zero value (`N`) identified in the previous step one by one. For each `N`:
    a.  **Locate All Occurrences**: Find every index position where `N` appears in the *original* input sequence.
    b.  **Check Minimum Occurrences**: Verify if `N` was found at two or more distinct index positions. If not, proceed to the next unique non-zero value.
    c.  **Determine Boundaries**: If `N` occurred at least twice, identify the index of its very first appearance (`first_index`) and the index of its very last appearance (`last_index`).
    d.  **Check for Gap**: Determine if there is a gap between these boundaries by checking if `last_index` is strictly greater than `first_index + 1`.
    e.  **Fill the Gap**: If a gap exists (i.e., `last_index > first_index + 1`), modify the *output sequence copy*: For every index position `i` starting from `first_index + 1` up to, but not including, `last_index`, set the value at position `i` in the output sequence to `N`.
4.  **Return Result**: Once all unique non-zero values from the original input have been processed according to step 3, the transformation is complete. Return the final modified output sequence.
