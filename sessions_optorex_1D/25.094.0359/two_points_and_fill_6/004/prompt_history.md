Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are one-dimensional sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. The length of the sequence remains constant from input to output (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Values:** The number '0' appears to act as a background or empty space. Non-zero digits (1, 5, 6, 8, 9 in the examples) represent significant markers or objects within the sequence.
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves modifying the sequence based on the positions of identical non-zero numbers. Specifically, it seems to fill the gaps between occurrences of the same non-zero number.
4.  **Core Operation:** The primary action is "filling". If a non-zero number `N` appears at least twice in the input, the elements between its first and last appearance are changed to `N` in the output.
5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   If a non-zero number appears only once, no filling occurs for that number.
    *   If identical non-zero numbers are adjacent, no filling occurs between them (as there are no elements *between* them).
    *   If the input contains only zeros, the output is identical.
    *   The filling operation uses the value of the non-zero number that defines the boundary.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill gaps between the first and last occurrence of each non-zero digit.

elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - values: single digits (0-9)

  - name: background_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: Represents empty space or background.

  - name: marker_element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: non-zero digit (1-9)
      - role: Represents significant points or objects.
      - relationship: Can appear multiple times.

actions:
  - name: find_occurrences
    input: sequence, marker_element_value (N)
    output: list of indices where N appears
    description: Identify all positions of a specific non-zero digit N.

  - name: find_boundaries
    input: list of indices
    output: min_index, max_index
    description: Determine the first (minimum) and last (maximum) index from a list of occurrences. Requires at least two occurrences.

  - name: fill_range
    input: sequence, min_index, max_index, marker_element_value (N)
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Modify the sequence by setting all elements at indices strictly between min_index and max_index to the value N.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: identical marker_elements
    property: separation distance (number of elements between them)
    relevance: Determines if filling occurs (distance > 0) and the range to be filled.

process_flow:
  - step: Initialize output sequence as a copy of the input.
  - step: Identify unique non-zero marker values (N) present in the input.
  - step: For each unique N:
      - Perform find_occurrences for N.
      - If more than one occurrence exists:
          - Perform find_boundaries.
          - Perform fill_range on the output sequence using the boundaries and N.
  - step: Return the final modified output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of numbers. Create a copy of this sequence which will become the output sequence.
2.  Find all the unique non-zero numbers present in the input sequence.
3.  For each unique non-zero number identified (let's call it `N`):
    a.  Find all the positions (indices) where `N` occurs in the original input sequence.
    b.  Check if `N` occurs more than once.
    c.  If `N` occurs more than once:
        i.  Determine the index of the first occurrence (`first_index`).
        ii. Determine the index of the last occurrence (`last_index`).
        iii. Iterate through all the positions in the *output* sequence starting from the position immediately after `first_index` up to (but not including) the position `last_index`.
        iv. Change the number at each of these positions in the *output* sequence to `N`.
4.  After checking and potentially performing the fill operation for all unique non-zero numbers, the final modified output sequence is the result.
