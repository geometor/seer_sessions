Prepare Output: Create an exact, modifiable copy of the input sequence. \n   This copy will store the results of the transformation.\n2. Find Unique Markers: Identify all the distinct non-zero integer values \n   present in the *original* input sequence.\n3. Iterate Through Markers: Process each unique non-zero value (N) identified \n   in the previous step one by one. For each N:\n    a. Locate All Occurrences: Find every index position where N appears in \n       the *original* input sequence.\n    b. Check Minimum Occurrences: Verify if N was found at two or more distinct \n       index positions. If not, proceed to the next unique non-zero value.\n    c. Determine Boundaries: If N occurred at least twice, identify the index \n       of its very first appearance (first_index) and the index of its very \n       last appearance (last_index).\n    d. Check for Gap: Determine if there is a gap between these boundaries by \n       checking if last_index is strictly greater than first_index + 1.\n    e. Fill the Gap: If a gap exists (i.e., last_index > first_index + 1), \n       modify the *output sequence copy*: For every index position i starting \n       from first_index + 1 up to, but not including, last_index, set the \n       value at position i in the output sequence to N.\n4. Return Result: Once all unique non-zero values from the original input \n   have been processed according to step 3, the transformation is complete. \n   Return the final modified output sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Helper function to find indices (could use np.where directly, but encapsulates logic)\ndef find_indices(arr, value):\n    \"\"\"Finds all indices of a specific value in a NumPy array.\"\"\"\n    return np.where(arr == value)[0]\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    # 1.
