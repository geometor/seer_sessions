task_description: Fill gaps between the first and last occurrence of each non-zero digit.

elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - values: single digits (0-9)

  - name: background_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: Represents empty space or background.

  - name: marker_element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: non-zero digit (1-9)
      - role: Represents significant points or objects.
      - relationship: Can appear multiple times.

actions:
  - name: find_occurrences
    input: sequence, marker_element_value (N)
    output: list of indices where N appears
    description: Identify all positions of a specific non-zero digit N.

  - name: find_boundaries
    input: list of indices
    output: min_index, max_index
    description: Determine the first (minimum) and last (maximum) index from a list of occurrences. Requires at least two occurrences.

  - name: fill_range
    input: sequence, min_index, max_index, marker_element_value (N)
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Modify the sequence by setting all elements at indices strictly between min_index and max_index to the value N.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: identical marker_elements
    property: separation distance (number of elements between them)
    relevance: Determines if filling occurs (distance > 0) and the range to be filled.

process_flow:
  - step: Initialize output sequence as a copy of the input.
  - step: Identify unique non-zero marker values (N) present in the input.
  - step: For each unique N:
      - Perform find_occurrences for N.
      - If more than one occurrence exists:
          - Perform find_boundaries.
          - Perform fill_range on the output sequence using the boundaries and N.
  - step: Return the final modified output sequence.
