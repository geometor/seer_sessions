            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are one-dimensional sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. The length of the sequence remains constant from input to output (12 elements in all examples).\n2.  **Key Values:** The number '0' appears to act as a background or empty space. Non-zero digits (1, 5, 6, 8, 9 in the examples) represent significant markers or objects within the sequence.\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves modifying the sequence based on the positions of identical non-zero numbers. Specifically, it seems to fill the gaps between occurrences of the same non-zero number.\n4.  **Core Operation:** The primary action is \"filling\". If a non-zero number `N` appears at least twice in the input, the elements between its first and last appearance are changed to `N` in the output.\n5.  **Edge Cases:**\n    *   If a non-zero number appears only once, no filling occurs for that number.\n    *   If identical non-zero numbers are adjacent, no filling occurs between them (as there are no elements *between* them).\n    *   If the input contains only zeros, the output is identical.\n    *   The filling operation uses the value of the non-zero number that defines the boundary.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
