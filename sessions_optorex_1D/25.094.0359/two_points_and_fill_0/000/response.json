Each input sequence contains exactly two identical non-zero integers, with all other elements being zero. The transformation rule involves filling the segment of the sequence between these two non-zero integers (inclusive) with the same non-zero integer value. Elements outside this segment remain unchanged (typically zero).\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"
