## Perception of Task Elements

The task operates on sequences of integers. Each input sequence contains exactly two identical non-zero integers, with all other elements being zero. The transformation rule involves filling the segment of the sequence between these two non-zero integers (inclusive) with the same non-zero integer value. Elements outside this segment remain unchanged (typically zero).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value present in the input sequence.
3.  Find the index of the first occurrence of this non-zero value (`start_index`).
4.  Find the index of the second (and last) occurrence of this non-zero value (`end_index`).
5.  Create a new sequence which is initially an identical copy of the input sequence.
6.  Iterate through the indices from `start_index` to `end_index`, inclusive.
7.  For each index within this range, set the corresponding element in the new sequence to the identified non-zero value.
8.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
