"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or 1D NumPy array) of integers by:
1. Identifying the unique non-zero digit ('marker_digit') present in the sequence.
2. Finding the index of the first ('start_index') and last ('end_index') occurrences of the 'marker_digit'.
3. Creating a new sequence where the segment from 'start_index' to 'end_index' (inclusive) is filled with the 'marker_digit'.
4. Elements outside this segment remain unchanged.
5. Returning the modified sequence, preserving the input type (list or NumPy array) if possible.
