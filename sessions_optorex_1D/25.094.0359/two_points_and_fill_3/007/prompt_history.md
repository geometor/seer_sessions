*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are sequences of single digits, separated by spaces.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly two identical non-zero digits, with all other digits being '0'.
    *   The output sequence modifies the input by changing some of the '0' digits to the non-zero digit present in the input.
    *   The transformation seems to involve "filling" the gap between the two occurrences of the non-zero digit.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function, designed to take a string input (`input_str: str`), is being called with a NumPy array during the testing phase. The core logic derived from the initial examples appears sound, but the function signature and input handling need modification to work with NumPy arrays or lists of integers directly, rather than space-separated strings. The strategy is to adapt the function to accept the correct input type, removing the string parsing step and ensuring the output format matches expectations (likely a NumPy array or list in this context).

*   **Metrics:**
    The fundamental metrics for each example remain the same, but the input format is now understood to be a sequence of integers (list or array).

    *   **train_1:** Input `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]`, Non-zero: 7, Indices: (2, 8), Output: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   **train_2:** Input `[0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Non-zero: 4, Indices: (2, 4), Output: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   **train_3:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`, Non-zero: 3, Indices: (6, 9), Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`
    *   **train_4:** Input `[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Non-zero: 2, Indices: (1, 4), Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   **train_5:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]`, Non-zero: 7, Indices: (8, 11), Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`
    *   **train_6:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Non-zero: 8, Indices: (3, 6), Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
