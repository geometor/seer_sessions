*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are sequences of single digits, separated by spaces.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly two identical non-zero digits, with all other digits being '0'.
    *   The output sequence modifies the input by changing some of the '0' digits to the non-zero digit present in the input.
    *   The transformation seems to involve "filling" the gap between the two occurrences of the non-zero digit.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Fill the segment between two identical non-zero digits.
    elements:
      - object: sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of digits
          - contains_zeros: true
          - contains_non_zeros: true, exactly two identical non-zero digits
      - object: digit
        properties:
          - value: integer (0-9)
          - position: index within the sequence
          - role: zero or non_zero_marker
    relationships:
      - type: positional
        between: non_zero_digits
        details: Identify the first and last occurrence index of the non-zero digit.
      - type: spatial
        between: digits within the sequence
        details: The segment includes the first non-zero digit, the last non-zero digit, and all digits (zeros) between them.
    actions:
      - name: identify_marker_digit
        input: input sequence
        output: the non-zero digit value
      - name: find_indices
        input: input sequence, marker_digit
        output: index of the first occurrence, index of the last occurrence
      - name: fill_segment
        input: input sequence, marker_digit, first_index, last_index
        output: modified sequence
        details: Iterate from the first index to the last index (inclusive). Change the digit at each position within this range to the marker_digit. Digits outside this range remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the non-zero digit present in the input sequence. Let this digit be `d`.
    2.  Find the index (position) of the first occurrence of `d` in the input sequence. Let this be `start_index`.
    3.  Find the index (position) of the last occurrence of `d` in the input sequence. Let this be `end_index`.
    4.  Create the output sequence by copying the input sequence.
    5.  Iterate through the sequence positions from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
    6.  For each position in this range, set the digit in the output sequence to `d`.
    7.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
