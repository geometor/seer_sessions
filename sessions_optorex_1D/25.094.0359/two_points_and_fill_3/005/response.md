"""
Transforms an input string of space-separated digits by:
1. Parsing the string into a sequence of integers.
2. Identifying the unique non-zero digit ('marker_digit') present in the sequence.
3. Finding the index of the first ('start_index') and last ('end_index') occurrences of the 'marker_digit'.
4. Creating a new sequence where the segment from 'start_index' to 'end_index' (inclusive) is filled with the 'marker_digit'.
5. Elements outside this segment remain unchanged.
6. Converting the modified sequence back into a space-separated string.
