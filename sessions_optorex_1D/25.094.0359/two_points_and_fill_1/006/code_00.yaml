task_elements:
  - object: input_array
    type: List[int] or np.ndarray (1D)
    description: A sequence of integers, containing predominantly zeros and exactly two instances of a single non-zero integer.
  - object: output_array
    type: List[int] or np.ndarray (1D)
    description: The transformed sequence, derived from input_array. It has the same length as the input_array.
  - property: fill_value
    type: int
    description: The unique non-zero integer present exactly twice in the input_array.
    value_determination: Find the first non-zero element in the input_array.
  - property: first_occurrence_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the first appearance of the fill_value in the input_array.
    value_determination: Find the smallest index `i` such that `input_array[i] == fill_value`.
  - property: second_occurrence_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the second (and last) appearance of the fill_value in the input_array.
    value_determination: Find the largest index `j` such that `input_array[j] == fill_value`.
  - relationship: boundary_markers
    description: The fill_value occurs exactly twice, marking the boundaries for the fill operation.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Modify a copy of the input_array by replacing elements located strictly between the first and second occurrences of the fill_value.
    target_object: output_array (initialized as a copy of input_array)
    condition: Affects only elements at indices `k` such that `first_occurrence_index < k < second_occurrence_index`.
    value_used: The fill_value identified earlier.
    outcome: Elements within the specified range are set to the fill_value; elements outside this range (including the markers at the first and second indices) remain unchanged.
