task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    type: List[int]  # Adjusted type based on error analysis
    description: A list of integers, containing mostly zeros and exactly two instances of a single non-zero integer.
  - object: output_list
    type: List[int]
    description: A list representing the transformed state of the input list.
  - property: fill_value
    type: int
    description: The single non-zero integer present in the input_list.
    value_determination: Find the first non-zero element in the input_list.
  - property: first_occurrence_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the first appearance of the fill_value in the input_list.
  - property: last_occurrence_index # Renamed for clarity, as it's the last/second instance
    type: int
    description: The index of the second (and last) appearance of the fill_value in the input_list.
  - relationship: containment
    description: The fill_value is contained within the input_list exactly twice.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Replace elements in the list between the first_occurrence_index and the last_occurrence_index.
    target_object: output_list (initially a copy of input_list)
    condition: Affects only elements whose index `i` satisfies `first_occurrence_index < i < last_occurrence_index`.
    value_used: fill_value
