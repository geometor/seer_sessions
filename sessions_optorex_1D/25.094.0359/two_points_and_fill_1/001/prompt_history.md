## Perception

The input is a string representing a list of single-digit integers separated by spaces. The list primarily consists of zeros, with exactly two instances of a non-zero integer (let's call this the 'fill value'). The output is also a string representing a list of integers of the same length. The transformation fills the zeros located *between* the two occurrences of the fill value in the input list with that same fill value. The original positions of the fill value and any zeros outside this range remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    type: List[int]
    description: A list derived from the input string, containing mostly zeros and exactly two instances of a single non-zero integer.
  - object: output_list
    type: List[int]
    description: A list derived from the output string, representing the transformed state of the input list.
  - property: fill_value
    type: int
    description: The single non-zero integer present in the input_list.
    value_determination: Find the first non-zero element in the input_list.
  - property: first_occurrence_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the first appearance of the fill_value in the input_list.
  - property: second_occurrence_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the second appearance of the fill_value in the input_list.
  - relationship: containment
    description: The fill_value is contained within the input_list exactly twice.
  - action: fill_segment
    description: Replace elements in the list between the first_occurrence_index and the second_occurrence_index.
    target_object: output_list (initially a copy of input_list)
    condition: Affects only elements whose index `i` satisfies `first_occurrence_index < i < second_occurrence_index`.
    value_used: fill_value
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identify the non-zero integer (`fill_value`) present in the list.
3.  Find the index of the first occurrence (`idx1`) of the `fill_value`.
4.  Find the index of the second occurrence (`idx2`) of the `fill_value`.
5.  Create a copy of the input list to serve as the initial output list.
6.  Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx1 + 1` up to (but not including) `idx2`.
7.  For each index `i` in this range, set the element at index `i` in the output list to the `fill_value`.
8.  Format the modified list back into a space-separated string for the final output.
