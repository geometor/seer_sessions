The list primarily consists of zeros, with exactly two instances of a non-zero integer (let's call this the 'fill value'). The output is also a string representing a list of integers of the same length. The transformation fills the zeros located *between* the two occurrences of the fill value in the input list with that same fill value. The original positions of the fill value and any zeros outside this range remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
