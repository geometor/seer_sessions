Let's call this the 'dominant digit' (`X`).\n    *   The transformation seems to involve rearranging or correcting the sequence based on this dominant digit `X`.\n    *   In some cases (train\\_1, train\\_5), the input sequence is identical to the output sequence. These specific sequences follow the pattern `0 0 0 0 X X X 0 X X 0 X`.\n    *   In other cases, the input sequence deviates from this pattern, and the output sequence is always transformed *into* this pattern: `0 0 0 0 X X X 0 X X 0 X`, using the dominant digit `X` identified from the input.\n    *   The dominant digit `X` consistently appears at index 4 of the input sequence.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
