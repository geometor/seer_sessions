objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or NumPy array of integers
      - length: 12
      - structure: Typically starts with [0, 0, 0, 0], followed by a mix of 0s and a dominant non-zero digit (X).
      - dominant_digit_index: 4
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or NumPy array of integers
      - length: 12
      - structure: Always follows the pattern [0, 0, 0, 0, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]
  - name: dominant_digit (X)
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: Determined from input_sequence[4]
  - name: target_pattern
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (template)
      - structure: [0, 0, 0, 0, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]
      - relationship: The output_sequence always matches this pattern instantiated with the dominant_digit.
actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_digit
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [dominant_digit]
    description: Extract the integer value at index 4 of the input sequence/array.
  - name: construct_target_sequence
    inputs: [dominant_digit]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    description: Create a new 12-element sequence/array following the target_pattern using the identified dominant_digit.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by first identifying the dominant_digit (X) at input_sequence[4] and then constructing the target_pattern sequence/array using that digit X.
