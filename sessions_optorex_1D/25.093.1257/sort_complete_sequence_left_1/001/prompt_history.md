Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single digits, separated by spaces.
2.  **Structure:** Each sequence can be divided into two parts:
    *   A prefix of the first four digits, which is consistently `0 0 0 0` in both input and output across all examples.
    *   A suffix of the last eight digits, where the transformation occurs.
3.  **Suffix Content:** The input suffix consists of zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (e.g., `1` in train_1, `8` in train_2, `7` in train_3, etc.). Let's call this the "key digit".
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation acts solely on the suffix. The specific pattern of zeros and the key digit in the *input* suffix seems irrelevant to the structure of the *output* suffix. The output suffix appears to be a *fixed* pattern determined only by the *value* of the key digit from the input.
5.  **Output Suffix Pattern:** Observing the outputs, the last eight digits consistently follow a pattern where the key digit (`X`) and zero (`0`) are placed in fixed positions: `X X X 0 X X 0 X`.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  length: 12
  element_type: digit
  structure:
    - prefix:
        length: 4
        value: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - suffix:
        length: 8
        contains:
          - 0
          - non_zero_digit (let's call it X, appears 1 or more times)
        constraint: Only one unique non_zero_digit X exists in the suffix.

Output:
  type: sequence
  length: 12
  element_type: digit
  structure:
    - prefix:
        length: 4
        value: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - suffix:
        length: 8
        pattern: [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X] # Where X is the non_zero_digit from the input suffix.

Transformation:
  - preserves: The first 4 digits (prefix).
  - identifies: The unique non-zero digit (X) present in the last 8 digits (suffix) of the input.
  - generates: A new suffix of 8 digits using the identified non-zero digit (X) and zeros, following the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X].
  - concatenates: The preserved prefix and the newly generated suffix.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the unique non-zero digit (`X`) present within the last 8 digits of the input sequence. (Assume there is always exactly one such unique non-zero digit if the suffix is not all zeros).
3.  Construct the output sequence:
    a.  Start with the prefix `0 0 0 0`.
    b.  Append a new sequence of 8 digits generated by placing the identified digit `X` and the digit `0` according to the fixed pattern: `X X X 0 X X 0 X`.
4.  Return the complete 12-digit output sequence.
