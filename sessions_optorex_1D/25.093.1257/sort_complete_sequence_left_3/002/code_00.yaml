Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence/Array
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 12
  Structure:
    - Segment_1 (Indices 0-3): Always contains [0, 0, 0, 0].
    - Segment_2 (Indices 4-11): Contains exactly one unique non-zero integer (denoted as X) and two zeros. The arrangement of X and 0 varies across examples.

Output:
  Type: Sequence/Array
  Element_Type: Integer
  Length: 12
  Structure:
    - Segment_1 (Indices 0-3): Always contains [0, 0, 0, 0].
    - Segment_2 (Indices 4-11): Always follows the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X], where X is the non-zero integer identified from the input's Segment_2.

Relationships:
  - Segment_1_Mapping: Input Segment_1 maps directly to Output Segment_1.
  - Value_Identification: The unique non-zero integer X in Input Segment_2 determines the value used in the pattern for Output Segment_2.
  - Pattern_Application: Input Segment_2 is replaced by a fixed pattern structure in Output Segment_2, populated using the identified value X.

Action:
  - Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of 12 integers).
  - Identify the unique non-zero integer (X) within the input sequence elements from index 4 to 11.
  - Construct a new sequence for indices 4 to 11 based on the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X].
  - Form the final output sequence by combining the first four elements of the input (which are [0, 0, 0, 0]) with the newly constructed pattern sequence.
  - Return the complete 12-element output sequence.
