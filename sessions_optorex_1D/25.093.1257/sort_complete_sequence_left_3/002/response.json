            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a space-separated string, was actually provided with a NumPy array during testing. The core transformation logic (identifying the non-zero digit `X` and applying the fixed pattern `X X X 0 X X 0 X` to the last 8 elements) appears consistent with the examples when mentally simulated.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the understanding of the input format. Instead of assuming a string input that requires parsing, we should assume the input is already provided as a sequence-like object (like a list or NumPy array) containing integers. The natural language program and facts will be updated to reflect this, removing the string parsing step and focusing on direct manipulation of the sequence elements.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements.\n*   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 elements.\n*   **First 4 Elements:** Always `[0, 0, 0, 0]` in both input and output.\n*   **Last 8 Elements (Input):** Always contain exactly one unique non-zero digit (let's call it `X`) and two `0`s. The positions vary.\n    *   `train_1`: X=8\n    *   `train_2`: X=5\n    *   `train_3`: X=4\n    *   `train_4`: X=1\n    *   `train_5`: X=7\n    *   `train_6`: X=7\n    *   `train_7`: X=2\n*   **Last 8 Elements (Output):** Always follow the fixed pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`, using the `X` identified from the input's last 8 elements.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The transformation preserves the first 4 zeros, identifies the non-zero digit `X` from elements 4-11 of the input, and replaces elements 4-11 with the fixed pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`.\n*   **Error Cause:** The code failed because it expected `input_str.split()`, assuming `input_str` was a string, but received a NumPy array instead. The underlying logic of the transformation, however, seems correct.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
