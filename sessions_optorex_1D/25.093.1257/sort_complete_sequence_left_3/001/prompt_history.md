Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single digits separated by spaces.
*   **Digit Values:** The digits observed are primarily 0 and one other non-zero digit (e.g., 8, 5, 4, 1, 7, 2).
*   **Sequence Pattern (Input):** The first four digits are consistently `0 0 0 0`. The remaining eight digits (indices 4 to 11) contain a mix of the non-zero digit (let's call it `X`) and zeros. By counting, it seems there are always six occurrences of `X` and two occurrences of `0` in this latter part. The arrangement of `X`s and `0`s varies across different inputs.
*   **Sequence Pattern (Output):** The first four digits are also consistently `0 0 0 0`. The remaining eight digits seem to follow a *fixed* pattern relative to the non-zero digit `X`: `X X X 0 X X 0 X`.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation happens in the last eight digits. The specific arrangement of `X`s and `0`s in the input's last eight positions is disregarded, and replaced by a canonical pattern `X X X 0 X X 0 X` in the output, using the same non-zero digit `X` found in the input. Examples `train_3` and `train_4` are instances where the input already matches this target pattern, resulting in no change. Examples `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_5`, `train_6`, and `train_7` show different input patterns converging to this target output pattern.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Digit
  Structure:
    - Initial_Segment:
        Indices: 0-3
        Content: Always [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Variable_Segment:
        Indices: 4-11
        Content: Contains exactly one non-zero digit (X) repeated 6 times and the digit 0 repeated 2 times. The arrangement varies.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Digit
  Structure:
    - Initial_Segment:
        Indices: 0-3
        Content: Always [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Fixed_Pattern_Segment:
        Indices: 4-11
        Content: Follows the pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X], where X is the non-zero digit identified from the input's Variable_Segment.

Relationships:
  - Identity: The first four elements of the input sequence map directly to the first four elements of the output sequence.
  - Value_Preservation: The non-zero digit 'X' present in the input's Variable_Segment is the same non-zero digit used in the output's Fixed_Pattern_Segment.
  - Pattern_Normalization: The arrangement of 'X' and '0' in the input's Variable_Segment is transformed into a fixed, canonical pattern in the output's Fixed_Pattern_Segment.

Action:
  - Identify the unique non-zero digit (X) within the input sequence elements from index 4 to 11.
  - Construct a new sequence for indices 4 to 11 based on the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X].
  - Combine the initial [0, 0, 0, 0] segment with the newly constructed pattern segment to form the final output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the unique non-zero digit, `X`, present within the subsequence from the 5th digit to the 12th digit (indices 4 to 11).
3.  Construct a target subsequence using this digit `X`, following the specific pattern: `X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X`.
4.  Create the final output sequence by taking the first four digits of the input (which are `0, 0, 0, 0`) and appending the target subsequence constructed in step 3.
5.  Return the complete 12-digit output sequence.
