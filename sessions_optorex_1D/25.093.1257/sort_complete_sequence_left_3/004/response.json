            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided execution results consistently show the error \"Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements.\" This indicates a mismatch between the expected input format of the `transform` function (a list or NumPy array of 12 integers, as defined in the function signature and internal checks) and the actual format being passed during testing (likely the raw input string).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept the input string directly, parse it into a list of integers internally, and then proceed with the previously identified transformation logic. The core logic of identifying the non-zero digit and applying the fixed pattern `X X X 0 X X 0 X` appears sound based on the initial examples, but failed due to the input type mismatch.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Format:** The consistent error across all examples confirms the function was receiving input whose `len()` was not 12. Given the raw input examples are strings like `\"0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 0 8 8 8\"`, which have lengths greater than 12 (e.g., 23 characters including spaces), it's highly probable the function received the string directly.\n*   **Error Consistency:** The same error occurred for every training and test example, indicating the input format issue is universal for this task's evaluation setup.\n*   **Core Logic Status:** The underlying transformation logic (identifying `X` and applying the pattern) was never actually executed or tested due to the premature failure on the length check. Therefore, its correctness remains assumed based on the initial analysis, pending successful execution after fixing the input handling.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
