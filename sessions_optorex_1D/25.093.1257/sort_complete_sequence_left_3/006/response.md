**General Assessment and Strategy**

The execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was implemented expecting a string input (as suggested by the format of the examples initially provided), but the testing environment is providing the input as a NumPy array.

The core logic derived previously (identifying the non-zero digit 'X' in indices 4-11 and applying the fixed pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`) appears consistent with the examples. The failure is purely at the input interface level.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function signature to accept a NumPy array (or a more general sequence type like `Union[List[int], np.ndarray]`).
2.  Remove the string parsing step (`parse_input_string`).
3.  Adapt the non-zero digit finding logic (`find_unique_non_zero`) to work directly on the NumPy array slice.
4.  Ensure the output generation constructs the final sequence correctly.
5.  Modify the output formatting step (`format_output_list`) to accept the resulting list or array and convert it back to the required space-separated string format, as indicated by the original example outputs.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input_Object:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Shape: (12,)
  Element_Type: Integer (Digit)
  Properties:
    - Length: Always 12
    - Initial_Segment:
        Indices: 0-3
        Content: Always [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Variable_Segment:
        Indices: 4-11
        Content: Contains exactly one unique non-zero digit (X) and exactly two zeros (0).
        Constraint: The non-zero digit X appears 6 times. The arrangement varies.

Output_Object:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated digits
  Properties:
    - Length: Represents 12 digits.
    - Structure:
      - Prefix: "0 0 0 0"
      - Suffix_Pattern: Corresponds to the sequence [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X], joined by spaces, where X is the non-zero digit identified from the input's Variable_Segment.

Relationships:
  - Identity: The first four elements ([0, 0, 0, 0]) of the input NumPy array correspond to the first four "0"s in the output string.
  - Value_Extraction: The unique non-zero digit 'X' within the input array's elements at indices 4 through 11 is extracted.
  - Pattern_Substitution: The subarray from index 4 to 11 in the input is disregarded in terms of its specific arrangement. It is replaced conceptually by the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X] during the construction of the output string.

Action:
  - Accept a 12-element NumPy array of integers as input.
  - Identify the unique non-zero digit (X) within the slice `input_array[4:12]`.
  - Construct a new list representing the target sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`.
  - Convert the elements of this target list to strings.
  - Join the string elements with spaces to form the final output string.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive a 12-element NumPy array of integers as input.
2.  Isolate the subarray consisting of elements from index 4 up to (but not including) index 12.
3.  Iterate through this subarray to find the first non-zero integer; this is the target digit `X`. (Based on the examples, there's only one unique non-zero digit in this segment).
4.  Construct a new 12-element list following this structure: `[0, 0, 0, 0, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`, using the identified digit `X`.
5.  Convert each integer in the newly constructed list into its string representation.
6.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces.
7.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
