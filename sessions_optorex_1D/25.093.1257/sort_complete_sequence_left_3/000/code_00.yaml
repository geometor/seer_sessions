Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Digit
  Structure:
    - Initial_Segment:
        Indices: 0-3
        Content: Always [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Variable_Segment:
        Indices: 4-11
        Content: Contains exactly one non-zero digit (X) repeated 6 times and the digit 0 repeated 2 times. The arrangement varies.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Digit
  Structure:
    - Initial_Segment:
        Indices: 0-3
        Content: Always [0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Fixed_Pattern_Segment:
        Indices: 4-11
        Content: Follows the pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X], where X is the non-zero digit identified from the input's Variable_Segment.

Relationships:
  - Identity: The first four elements of the input sequence map directly to the first four elements of the output sequence.
  - Value_Preservation: The non-zero digit 'X' present in the input's Variable_Segment is the same non-zero digit used in the output's Fixed_Pattern_Segment.
  - Pattern_Normalization: The arrangement of 'X' and '0' in the input's Variable_Segment is transformed into a fixed, canonical pattern in the output's Fixed_Pattern_Segment.

Action:
  - Identify the unique non-zero digit (X) within the input sequence elements from index 4 to 11.
  - Construct a new sequence for indices 4 to 11 based on the fixed pattern [X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X].
  - Combine the initial [0, 0, 0, 0] segment with the newly constructed pattern segment to form the final output sequence.
