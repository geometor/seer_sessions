The remaining eight digits (indices 4 to 11) contain a mix of the non-zero digit (let's call it `X`) and zeros. By counting, it seems there are always six occurrences of `X` and two occurrences of `0` in this latter part. The arrangement of `X`s and `0`s varies across different inputs.\n*   **Sequence Pattern (Output):** The first four digits are also consistently `0 0 0 0`. The remaining eight digits seem to follow a *fixed* pattern relative to the non-zero digit `X`: `X X X 0 X X 0 X`.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation happens in the last eight digits. The specific arrangement of `X`s and `0`s in the input's last eight positions is disregarded, and replaced by a canonical pattern `X X X 0 X X 0 X` in the output, using the same non-zero digit `X` found in the input. Examples `train_3` and `train_4` are instances where the input already matches this target pattern, resulting in no change. Examples `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_5`, `train_6`, and `train_7` show different input patterns converging to this target output pattern.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
