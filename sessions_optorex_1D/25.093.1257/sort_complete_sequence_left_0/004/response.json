            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: preserve the initial `[0, 0, 0, 0]` prefix, identify the first non-zero digit (X) in the input, and replace the remaining 8 digits with the fixed pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`. The manual check against all training examples confirms this logic holds.\n\n    The error messages (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`) stem from the NumPy implementation (`code_00.py`). This error occurs when trying to use a boolean condition on a multi-element NumPy array where a single True/False value is expected. This likely happened within the `find_significant_digit_np` function during the comparison `if digit != 0:`. This suggests that either the input `input_array` was not consistently a 1D array as expected, or the iteration `for digit in input_array:` yielded array slices instead of individual elements in the testing environment's context, or the test harness called the function incorrectly.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  **Validate Input Type/Structure:** The core transformation logic appears correct. The primary focus should be on ensuring the code robustly handles the input data, assuming it might be passed differently than anticipated (e.g., ensuring it's treated as a flat list or 1D array of individual integers before element-wise comparison).\n    2.  **Refine Implementation:** Modify the `find_significant_digit` function to guarantee element-wise comparison, potentially by explicitly iterating over indices or ensuring the input is flattened if necessary.\n    3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** Keep the natural language program and YAML facts largely the same, as the underlying transformation rule seems sound. Clarify input/output types (sequence of integers).\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    *   All input and output examples consist of exactly 12 integers.\n    *   The first 4 integers are always `0` in both input and output.\n    *   The transformation only affects the integers from index 4 to 11 (the suffix).\n    *   The input suffix contains zeros and multiple instances of a single non-zero digit ('significant digit').\n    *   The output suffix always follows the pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]`, where X is the first non-zero digit encountered in the *input* sequence.\n    *   The code failed execution on all examples due to a consistent NumPy error related to boolean ambiguity, indicating an implementation issue rather than a logic flaw. No successful output metrics can be gathered from the failed run.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
