            "text": "*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**\n    *   The core transformation logic identified previously seems correct and consistent across all training examples: identify the first non-zero digit (X) in the input sequence and replace the last 8 digits (suffix) with the fixed pattern `X X X 0 X X 0 X`, while keeping the first 4 zeros (prefix).\n    *   The Python code execution failed universally with a `ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (8,) into shape (0,12)`. This strongly indicates an issue with NumPy array dimensions during the assignment step (`output_array[4:] = output_suffix`). The most likely cause is that the `input_array` passed to the `transform` function is not a 1D array of shape `(12,)` as assumed, but rather a 2D array, possibly of shape `(1, 12)`. If `input_array` has shape `(1, 12)`, then `output_array = np.zeros_like(input_array)` also gets shape `(1, 12)`. The slice `output_array[4:]` attempts to select rows starting from index 4, which don't exist, resulting in an empty slice with shape `(0, 12)`, hence the broadcast error when trying to assign the shape `(8,)` suffix.\n    *   **Strategy:** The plan is to refine the understanding of the input data format (potentially a 2D array) and update the natural language program and conceptual implementation steps to explicitly handle this potential shape mismatch, likely by flattening the input array within the transformation function before processing. The underlying transformation rule itself does not need revision based on the examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Number of Examples:** 7 training examples provided.\n    *   **Input Format:** String of 12 space-separated single-digit integers.\n    *   **Output Format:** String of 12 space-separated single-digit integers.\n    *   **Sequence Length:** 12 digits for both input and output in all examples.\n    *   **Prefix:** Constant `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 0-3 in all inputs and outputs.\n    *   **Suffix Length:** 8 digits (indices 4-11).\n    *   **Significant Digit (X):** The first non-zero digit in the input determines the non-zero values in the output suffix. Values observed: 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 1.\n    *   **Output Suffix Pattern:** Consistent pattern `[X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0, X]` applied to indices 4-11 in all outputs.\n    *   **Execution Result:** 100% failure rate on the training set with the same broadcasting error.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
