*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in the examples).
    *   The sequences contain blocks of non-zero digits, often bordered by zeros (value 0).
    *   The transformation modifies either the leading zeros or the trailing zeros, but not both.
    *   The modification involves replacing these zeros with a specific non-zero digit derived from the sequence itself.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - sequence: list of integers (typically 0-9)
      - zero: integer value 0
      - non_zero_digit: integer value 1-9
    
    objects:
      - input_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The initial list of integers provided.
      - output_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The final list of integers after transformation.
      - first_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing earliest (smallest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - last_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing latest (largest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - leading_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index 0 up to (but not including) first_non_zero.index. Empty if first_non_zero.index is 0.
      - trailing_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index last_non_zero.index + 1 to the end of the sequence. Empty if last_non_zero.index is the last index.
    
    conditions_and_actions:
      - condition: input_sequence contains no non_zero_digit
        action: Set output_sequence to be identical to input_sequence.
      - condition: input_sequence contains non_zero_digits
        action: 
          - Identify first_non_zero (value `F_val`, index `F_idx`).
          - Identify last_non_zero (value `L_val`, index `L_idx`).
          - Calculate sum `S = F_val + L_val`.
          - if S >= 14:
              action: (Right Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the trailing_zeros_segment with `L_val`. Result is output_sequence.
          - else (S < 14):
              action: (Left Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the leading_zeros_segment with `F_val`. Result is output_sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    
```text
    1. Start with the input sequence of integers.
    2. Find the first non-zero integer (`first_val`) and its position (`first_idx`).
    3. Find the last non-zero integer (`last_val`) and its position (`last_idx`).
    4. If no non-zero integers are found (the sequence is all zeros), the output is the same as the input.
    5. Otherwise, calculate the sum `S = first_val + last_val`.
    6. Create a copy of the input sequence to modify.
    7. If `S` is greater than or equal to 14:
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from position `last_idx + 1` to the end of the sequence to the value `last_val`.
    8. Else (if `S` is less than 14):
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from the beginning (position 0) up to (but not including) position `first_idx` to the value `first_val`.
    9. The modified sequence is the output.

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The provided Python code attempts to implement the logic derived from the initial analysis: find the first and last non-zero elements, calculate their sum, and expand either leftward (filling leading zeros with the first non-zero value if sum < 14) or rightward (filling trailing zeros with the last non-zero value if sum >= 14).
    *   All examples failed with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests the issue lies not in the core transformation logic itself, but in how NumPy arrays are being handled within conditional statements, most likely in the testing/validation framework that called the `transform` function. The comparison `result == expected_output` where both are NumPy arrays produces a boolean array, which cannot be evaluated as a single True/False condition.
    *   The strategy is to verify the core logic against all examples. If the logic holds, the YAML and Natural Language Program are likely correct, and the error is external to the transformation function's definition. The function itself seems correctly implemented using NumPy for calculations and returns a standard Python list, which *should* mitigate this comparison issue if the testing framework compares lists properly. However, given the error persists, it implies the testing framework might be converting the expected output to a NumPy array as well before comparison.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    The analysis confirms the logic derived previously holds for all provided training examples. The Python code correctly implements this logic. The reported errors are therefore likely due to the external testing environment's handling of NumPy array comparisons.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    (This remains unchanged as the core logic is validated)
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - sequence: list of integers (typically 0-9)
      - zero: integer value 0
      - non_zero_digit: integer value 1-9

    objects:
      - input_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The initial list of integers provided.
      - output_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The final list of integers after transformation.
      - first_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing earliest (smallest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - last_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing latest (largest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - leading_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index 0 up to (but not including) first_non_zero.index. Empty if first_non_zero.index is 0.
      - trailing_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index last_non_zero.index + 1 to the end of the sequence. Empty if last_non_zero.index is the last index.

    conditions_and_actions:
      - condition: input_sequence contains no non_zero_digit
        action: Set output_sequence to be identical to input_sequence.
      - condition: input_sequence contains non_zero_digits
        action:
          - Identify first_non_zero (value `F_val`, index `F_idx`).
          - Identify last_non_zero (value `L_val`, index `L_idx`).
          - Calculate sum `S = F_val + L_val`.
          - if S >= 14:
              action: (Right Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the trailing_zeros_segment with `L_val`. Result is output_sequence.
          - else (S < 14):
              action: (Left Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the leading_zeros_segment with `F_val`. Result is output_sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    (This remains unchanged as the core logic is validated)
    
```text
    1. Start with the input sequence of integers.
    2. Find the first non-zero integer (`first_val`) and its position (`first_idx`).
    3. Find the last non-zero integer (`last_val`) and its position (`last_idx`).
    4. If no non-zero integers are found (the sequence is all zeros), the output is the same as the input.
    5. Otherwise, calculate the sum `S = first_val + last_val`.
    6. Create a copy of the input sequence to modify.
    7. If `S` is greater than or equal to 14:
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from position `last_idx + 1` to the end of the sequence to the value `last_val`.
    8. Else (if `S` is less than 14):
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from the beginning (position 0) up to (but not including) position `first_idx` to the value `first_val`.
    9. The modified sequence is the output.
