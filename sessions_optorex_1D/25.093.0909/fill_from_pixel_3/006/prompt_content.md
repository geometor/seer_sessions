"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of integers based on its first and last non-zero elements.

1.  Examine the input sequence of integers.
2.  Find the value and index of the first non-zero integer (`first_val`, `first_idx`).
3.  Find the value and index of the last non-zero integer (`last_val`, `last_idx`).
4.  If no non-zero integers are found (i.e., the sequence contains only zeros), the output is an identical copy of the input sequence.
5.  If non-zero integers exist:
    a. Calculate the sum `S = first_val + last_val`.
    b. Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
    c. If `S` is greater than or equal to 14:
        i. Iterate through the copied sequence from the index immediately after the last non-zero integer (`last_idx + 1`) to the end of the sequence.
        ii. Set the value of each element in this range to `last_val`.
    d. Else (if `S` is less than 14):
        i. Iterate through the copied sequence from the beginning (index 0) up to, but not including, the index of the first non-zero integer (`first_idx`).
        ii. Set the value of each element in this range to `first_val`.
    e. The modified copy is the output sequence.
