            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic based on the first example. The logic involves finding the first and last non-zero elements in a sequence, summing their values, and then conditionally replacing either leading or trailing zeros based on whether this sum is less than 14 or greater than/equal to 14. Testing against all training examples confirms this logic holds true for all provided cases.\n\n    The errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") during the execution phase point towards an implementation issue, likely related to how NumPy handles array operations or how the input data is structured when passed to the function in the testing environment (e.g., perhaps a list containing a single list `[[...]]` instead of a flat list `[...]`). This is an issue for the Coder phase to resolve by ensuring the code correctly handles the input data type.\n\n    The strategy moving forward is to maintain the validated natural language program and YAML facts, as the underlying logic appears sound. The focus remains on accurately describing the transformation rule.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Manual verification against all 7 training examples confirms the proposed logic:\n    *   Find the first non-zero element (`first_val`, `first_idx`).\n    *   Find the last non-zero element (`last_val`, `last_idx`).\n    *   Calculate `S = first_val + last_val`.\n    *   If `S >= 14`, replace elements from `last_idx + 1` to the end with `last_val`.\n    *   If `S < 14`, replace elements from index 0 to `first_idx - 1` with `first_val`.\n\n    | Example | Input                     | First (Val, Idx) | Last (Val, Idx) | Sum | Condition | Action           | Expected Output           | Matches? |\n    | :------ | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :-------------- | :-- | :-------- | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :------- |\n    | train_1 | `[0 0 3 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | (3, 2)           | (8, 5)          | 11  | S < 14    | Fill Left (3)    | `[3 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes      |\n    | train_2 | `[0 2 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]` | (2, 1)           | (4, 6)          | 6   | S < 14    | Fill Left (2)    | `[2 2 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes      |\n    | train_3 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0]` | (5, 6)           | (6, 9)          | 11  | S < 14    | Fill Left (5)    | `[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 0 0]` | Yes      |\n    | train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 0 0 0]` | (5, 4)           | (7, 8)          | 12  | S < 14    | Fill Left (5)    | `[5 5 5 5 5 7 7 7 7 0 0 0]` | Yes      |\n    | train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 8 0 0]` | (7, 5)           | (8, 9)          | 15  | S >= 14   | Fill Right (8)   | `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 8 8 8]` | Yes      |\n    | train_6 | `[0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]` | (2, 1)           | (3, 7)          | 5   | S < 14    | Fill Left (2)    | `[2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]` | Yes      |\n    | train_7 | `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 9 0 0 0 0]` | (5, 1)           | (9, 7)          | 14  | S >= 14   | Fill Right (9)   | `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9 9]` | Yes      |\n\n    The logic holds for all cases.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
