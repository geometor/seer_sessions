*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in the examples).
    *   The sequences contain blocks of non-zero digits, often bordered by zeros (value 0).
    *   The transformation modifies either the leading zeros or the trailing zeros, but not both.
    *   The modification involves replacing these zeros with a specific non-zero digit derived from the sequence itself.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - sequence: list of integers (typically 0-9)
      - zero: integer value 0
      - non_zero_digit: integer value 1-9
    
    objects:
      - input_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The initial list of integers provided.
      - output_sequence:
          type: sequence
          description: The final list of integers after transformation.
      - first_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing earliest (smallest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - last_non_zero:
          type: object
          properties:
            value: non_zero_digit
            index: integer (position in sequence)
          relation: The non-zero digit appearing latest (largest index) in the input_sequence. Null if sequence contains only zeros.
      - leading_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index 0 up to (but not including) first_non_zero.index. Empty if first_non_zero.index is 0.
      - trailing_zeros_segment:
          type: sequence_segment
          relation: The subsequence from index last_non_zero.index + 1 to the end of the sequence. Empty if last_non_zero.index is the last index.
    
    conditions_and_actions:
      - condition: input_sequence contains no non_zero_digit
        action: Set output_sequence to be identical to input_sequence.
      - condition: input_sequence contains non_zero_digits
        action: 
          - Identify first_non_zero (value `F_val`, index `F_idx`).
          - Identify last_non_zero (value `L_val`, index `L_idx`).
          - Calculate sum `S = F_val + L_val`.
          - if S >= 14:
              action: (Right Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the trailing_zeros_segment with `L_val`. Result is output_sequence.
          - else (S < 14):
              action: (Left Expansion) Modify a copy of input_sequence by replacing elements in the leading_zeros_segment with `F_val`. Result is output_sequence.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    
```text
    1. Start with the input sequence of integers.
    2. Find the first non-zero integer (`first_val`) and its position (`first_idx`).
    3. Find the last non-zero integer (`last_val`) and its position (`last_idx`).
    4. If no non-zero integers are found (the sequence is all zeros), the output is the same as the input.
    5. Otherwise, calculate the sum `S = first_val + last_val`.
    6. Create a copy of the input sequence to modify.
    7. If `S` is greater than or equal to 14:
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from position `last_idx + 1` to the end of the sequence to the value `last_val`.
    8. Else (if `S` is less than 14):
        a. Change all elements in the copied sequence from the beginning (position 0) up to (but not including) position `first_idx` to the value `first_val`.
    9. The modified sequence is the output.
