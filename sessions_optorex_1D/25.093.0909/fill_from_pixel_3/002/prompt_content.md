Find the first and last non-zero integers in the input sequence. If the sequence contains only zeros, return it unchanged. Otherwise, calculate the sum of the first and last non-zero integers. If the sum is 14 or greater, replace all trailing zeros (after the last non-zero integer) with the value of the last non-zero integer. If the sum is less than 14, replace all leading zeros (before the first non-zero integer) with the value of the first non-zero integer.
