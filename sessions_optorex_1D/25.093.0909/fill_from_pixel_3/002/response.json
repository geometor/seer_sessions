            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic based on the sum of the first and last non-zero elements. The comparison between the predicted outputs based on this logic and the actual outputs for all training examples shows a perfect match. However, the provided code failed during execution with a consistent error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This error indicates that the `transform` function was likely called with a NumPy array (or a similar array-like structure) as input, not a standard Python list. The comparison operations (like `val != 0`) in the helper functions (`find_first_non_zero`, `find_last_non_zero`) result in boolean arrays when applied to NumPy arrays, which cannot be evaluated directly in a standard `if` statement.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Input Type:** Update the understanding and documentation (YAML, NL Program) to specify that the input is likely an array (e.g., NumPy array) rather than just a list.\n2.  **Adapt Implementation:** The coder phase will need to modify the Python function to handle NumPy arrays correctly. This involves using NumPy functions for finding non-zero elements and their indices (e.g., `np.nonzero`), accessing elements, and performing assignments. The core logical steps (find first/last non-zero, calculate sum, determine left/right expansion, apply expansion) remain the same.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe logical flow was simulated against each training example, confirming the rule derived previously is consistent with all provided data.\n\n*   **train_1:** `first=3`, `last=8`, `sum=11` (< 14) -> Left expand with 3. Matches output.\n*   **train_2:** `first=2`, `last=4`, `sum=6` (< 14) -> Left expand with 2. Matches output.\n*   **train_3:** `first=5`, `last=6`, `sum=11` (< 14) -> Left expand with 5. Matches output.\n*   **train_4:** `first=5`, `last=7`, `sum=12` (< 14) -> Left expand with 5. Matches output.\n*   **train_5:** `first=7`, `last=8`, `sum=15` (>= 14) -> Right expand with 8. Matches output.\n*   **train_6:** `first=2`, `last=3`, `sum=5` (< 14) -> Left expand with 2. Matches output.\n*   **train_7:** `first=5`, `last=9`, `sum=14` (>= 14) -> Right expand with 9. Matches output.\n\nThe core logic holds. The implementation needs adjustment for the data type.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
