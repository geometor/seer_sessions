Objects:
  - Sequence: A 1D list or array of single-digit integers.
    Properties:
      - Length (N)
      - Elements: Digits (0-9)
  - Boundaries:
    Properties:
      - FirstNonZeroValue (F): Value of the first non-zero digit.
      - FirstNonZeroIndex (Fi): Index of the first non-zero digit.
      - LastNonZeroValue (L): Value of the last non-zero digit.
      - LastNonZeroIndex (Li): Index of the last non-zero digit.
  - ZeroRegions:
    Properties:
      - LeadingZerosCount (LZ): Number of zeros before Fi (equal to Fi).
      - TrailingZerosCount (TZ): Number of zeros after Li (equal to N - 1 - Li).

Relationships:
  - Comparison1: Between F and L (F > L or F <= L).
  - Comparison2: Between LZ and TZ (LZ >= TZ or LZ < TZ).

Actions:
  - IdentifyBoundaries: Find F, Fi, L, Li. Handle the case of all zeros.
  - CalculateZeroCounts: Determine LZ and TZ.
  - ConditionalFill: Based on Comparison1 and Comparison2, decide whether to fill leading zeros or trailing zeros.
    - FillLeading: Replace elements from index 0 to Fi-1 with F.
    - FillTrailing: Replace elements from index Li+1 to N-1 with L.
  - FlattenInput: (Assumption) Ensure the input sequence is treated as 1D.
