            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\n1.  **Error Analysis:** The traceback indicates a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, specifically within the conditional `if first_nz_val > last_nz_val:` or subsequent comparisons, was attempting to evaluate the truthiness of a NumPy array rather than a scalar boolean. This typically occurs if `first_nz_val` or `last_nz_val` are arrays themselves. Given the input examples appear 1D, this likely means the input was passed to the function as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of a 1D array. Extracting an element by index from a 2D array can yield a 1D array slice.\n2.  **Resolution Strategy:** The immediate fix for the error is to ensure the input array is treated as 1D within the `transform` function. Adding `input_arr = input_arr.flatten()` after the `np.array()` conversion should resolve the ambiguity error.\n3.  **Logic Refinement:** The transformation logic implemented in `code_00.py` correctly solves 4 out of the 7 training examples (train_2, train_3, train_5, train_7) but fails on 3 (train_1, train_4, train_6). This indicates the underlying logic captures part of the pattern but misses some conditions or exceptions. The core idea involves finding the first (F) and last (L) non-zero elements and the counts of leading (LZ) and trailing (TZ) zeros, then deciding whether to fill leading zeros with F or trailing zeros with L based on comparisons between F/L and LZ/TZ. The specific combination of conditions needs refinement, but the `code_00.py` logic represents the best hypothesis derived so far.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered for each training example using `tool_code`:\n\n"
