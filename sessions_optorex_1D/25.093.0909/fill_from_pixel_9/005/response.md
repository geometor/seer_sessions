```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of digits by identifying singular non-zero elements and
spreading their value into adjacent zeros. A non-zero element is singular if
its immediate neighbors (if they exist) have different values. The spreading
occurs outwards from the singular element, replacing zeros in a copy of the
sequence, until a non-zero element (from the original sequence) or the
sequence boundary is reached. Non-singular non-zero elements and original
zeros not affected by spreading remain unchanged.
