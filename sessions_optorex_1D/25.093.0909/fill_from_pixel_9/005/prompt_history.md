Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, always of length 12 in the provided examples. The core transformation involves changing some, but not all, of the zero ('0') elements in the input sequence to non-zero digits. The non-zero digits present in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence at their original positions. The key action seems to be the "spreading" or "filling" of certain non-zero digits into adjacent zero digits. Notably, this spreading only seems to originate from non-zero digits that appear as a block of length one (i.e., a single instance of that digit surrounded by different digits or zeros/boundaries). Non-zero digits that are part of a longer contiguous block of the same digit do not spread. The spreading stops when it encounters another non-zero digit or the boundary of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: fill_zeros

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right (index `i` from 0 to length-1).
3.  For each element at index `i`, check if it represents a "singular non-zero block". This condition is met if:
    *   The element `input[i]` is not zero.
    *   AND ( `i` is 0 OR `input[i-1]` is not equal to `input[i]` )
    *   AND ( `i` is the last index OR `input[i+1]` is not equal to `input[i]` )
4.  If the element at index `i` meets the criteria for a singular non-zero block with value `V = input[i]`:
    a.  **Spread Left:** Check the element to the left (`input[i-1]`). If `i > 0` and `input[i-1]` is 0, then iterate backwards from index `j = i-1` towards the beginning of the sequence: as long as `j >= 0` and `input[j]` is 0, set `output[j] = V`. Stop if a non-zero element is encountered or the beginning of the sequence is reached.
    b.  **Spread Right:** Check the element to the right (`input[i+1]`). If `i < length-1` and `input[i+1]` is 0, then iterate forwards from index `k = i+1` towards the end of the sequence: as long as `k < length` and `input[k]` is 0, set `output[k] = V`. Stop if a non-zero element is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.
5.  After checking all elements in the input sequence, the modified output sequence contains the final result.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training and test examples with a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the execution environment is passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, rather than standard Python lists. The Python code, specifically in conditional checks (like `if sequence[index - 1] != current_val` or `while input_sequence[j] == 0`), is attempting to evaluate a NumPy comparison, which can result in a boolean array, leading to the ambiguity error when used in a context expecting a single boolean (like `if` or `while`).

The underlying transformation logic, however, appears correct based on a manual walkthrough of all provided training examples. The rule involves identifying non-zero digits that are "singular" (not adjacent to the same digit) and spreading their value into adjacent zeros until a non-zero digit or boundary is hit. Digits that are part of a contiguous block of the same non-zero value do not spread.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the input type assumption using `tool_code`.
2.  Refine the Natural Language Program to be precise about using the *original* input for checks and the *copy* for modifications.
3.  Update the YAML facts.
4.  Advise the coder phase to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting them to Python lists at the function's start or ensuring all operations are NumPy-compatible in a way that returns single booleans where expected.

```
**Findings from Metrics:**
The `tool_code` execution confirms that parsing the input string results in a NumPy array. While direct element comparison (`array[i] == value`) returns a single NumPy boolean (`numpy.bool_`), which usually works fine in conditionals, the error persists in the execution environment. This suggests either a subtle interaction not replicated here or that the safest approach is explicit conversion to a standard Python list within the function to avoid any NumPy-specific boolean array issues. The transformation logic itself appears sound across all examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (which might be a NumPy array). Create a deep copy of this input sequence to serve as the initial state of the output sequence. Let `N` be the length of the sequences.
2.  Iterate through the *original* input sequence using an index `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
3.  For each element `current_val = input_sequence[i]` at index `i`:
    a.  Check if `current_val` is non-zero.
    b.  If it is non-zero, determine if it is "singular". An element is singular if:
        i.  It is at the start of the sequence (`i == 0`) OR the element to its left (`input_sequence[i-1]`) has a different value.
        ii. AND it is at the end of the sequence (`i == N-1`) OR the element to its right (`input_sequence[i+1]`) has a different value.
    c.  If the element at index `i` is determined to be singular and non-zero:
        i.  **Spread Left:** Starting from `j = i - 1`, move leftwards (`j >= 0`). As long as the element in the *original* input sequence at index `j` (`input_sequence[j]`) is 0, update the *output* sequence at that index: `output_sequence[j] = current_val`. Stop spreading left if `j` goes out of bounds or `input_sequence[j]` is not 0.
        ii. **Spread Right:** Starting from `k = i + 1`, move rightwards (`k < N`). As long as the element in the *original* input sequence at index `k` (`input_sequence[k]`) is 0, update the *output* sequence at that index: `output_sequence[k] = current_val`. Stop spreading right if `k` goes out of bounds or `input_sequence[k]` is not 0.
4.  After iterating through all elements of the original input sequence and applying any necessary spreading modifications to the output sequence, return the final output sequence (ensuring it's a standard Python list if required by the environment).
