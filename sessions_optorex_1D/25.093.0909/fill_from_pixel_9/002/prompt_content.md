"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rule:
Identify non-zero digits that appear singularly (i.e., not adjacent to the same digit).
For each such singular non-zero digit, "spread" its value into adjacent zero ('0') elements
both to the left and to the right. The spreading continues until it encounters another
non-zero digit or the boundary of the sequence. The original non-zero digits, including
those that were part of longer blocks and those that were singular, retain their original
positions and values in the output. Only the zero elements adjacent to singular non-zero
elements are potentially modified.
