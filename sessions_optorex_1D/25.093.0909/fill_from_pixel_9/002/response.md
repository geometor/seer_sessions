**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to implement the logic derived from the initial analysis: identify singular non-zero digits and spread their value into adjacent zeros. However, the code fails across all examples with a "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" error. This error typically arises when boolean operations are performed on NumPy arrays in contexts expecting a single True/False value. Given that the provided code uses standard Python lists and integer comparisons, this strongly suggests that the testing environment might be passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, or there's an interaction within the test harness causing this type mismatch.

The core transformation logic (singular non-zero elements spread into adjacent original zeros) appears consistent with all training examples when analyzed manually. Therefore, the strategy is:

1.  Assume the core logic is correct but needs to be clearly documented.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise about the conditions for identifying singular elements and the rules for spreading.
3.  Acknowledge the runtime error likely originates from the execution environment's data types (potential NumPy array usage) rather than a fundamental flaw in the list-based transformation logic itself. The focus remains on accurately describing the *intended* transformation.

**Metrics and Analysis of Examples**

Due to the execution error, runtime metrics cannot be gathered. The analysis focuses on applying the intended logic manually to each example:

*   **Train 1:** `Input: [0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0]`, `Output: [7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0]`
    *   `7` at index 1 is singular (neighbors `0` and `1`). Spreads left into index 0 (original value `0`).
    *   `1`s at indices 2, 3, 4 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
*   **Train 2:** `Input: [0, ..., 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`, `Output: [8, ..., 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   `8` at index 5 is singular (neighbors `0` and `4`). Spreads left into indices 0-4 (original values `0`).
    *   `4`s at indices 6, 7, 8 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
*   **Train 3:** `Input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0, ..., 0]`, `Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, ..., 7]`
    *   `5`s at indices 2-5 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
    *   `7` at index 6 is singular (neighbors `5` and `0`). Spreads right into indices 7-11 (original values `0`).
*   **Train 4:** `Input: [0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 8, 0, 0]`, `Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 8, 8, 8]`
    *   `1`s at indices 3-8 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
    *   `8` at index 9 is singular (neighbors `1` and `0`). Spreads right into indices 10-11 (original values `0`).
*   **Train 5:** `Input: [0, ..., 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 0, ..., 0]`, `Output: [7, ..., 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 0, ..., 0]`
    *   `7` at index 4 is singular (neighbors `0` and `4`). Spreads left into indices 0-3 (original values `0`).
    *   `4`s at indices 5, 6, 7 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
*   **Train 6:** `Input: [0, ..., 0, 7, ..., 7, 8, 0]`, `Output: [0, ..., 0, 7, ..., 7, 8, 8]`
    *   `7`s at indices 5-9 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.
    *   `8` at index 10 is singular (neighbors `7` and `0`). Spreads right into index 11 (original value `0`).
*   **Train 7:** `Input: [0, 3, 9, ..., 9, 0, ..., 0]`, `Output: [3, 3, 9, ..., 9, 0, ..., 0]`
    *   `3` at index 1 is singular (neighbors `0` and `9`). Spreads left into index 0 (original value `0`).
    *   `9`s at indices 2-7 are part of a block, not singular. No spreading.

This manual application confirms the "singular non-zero spread" logic holds for all provided training examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the `output_sequence` as an exact copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  Examine each element `V` at index `i` in the original `input_sequence`.
3.  Check if the element `V` is a "singular non-zero element":
    *   `V` must not be `0`.
    *   The element to the left (at index `i-1`) must either not exist (i.e., `i` is 0) or have a value different from `V`.
    *   The element to the right (at index `i+1`) must either not exist (i.e., `i` is the last index) or have a value different from `V`.
4.  If `V` at index `i` is identified as a singular non-zero element:
    a.  **Spread Left:** Look leftwards from index `j = i-1`. While `j` is a valid index (`j >= 0`) and the element in the original `input_sequence` at index `j` is `0`, update the `output_sequence` at index `j` to `V`, and decrement `j`. Stop this leftward spread as soon as a non-zero element is encountered in the `input_sequence` or the beginning of the sequence is reached.
    b.  **Spread Right:** Look rightwards from index `k = i+1`. While `k` is a valid index (`k < length`) and the element in the original `input_sequence` at index `k` is `0`, update the `output_sequence` at index `k` to `V`, and increment `k`. Stop this rightward spread as soon as a non-zero element is encountered in the `input_sequence` or the end of the sequence is reached.
5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for all elements in the `input_sequence`. (Note: The spreading actions modify the `output_sequence`, but the checks for singular elements and for propagation limits are always based on the original `input_sequence`).
6.  Return the final `output_sequence`.
