For each such singular non-zero digit, \"spread\"\nits value into adjacent zero ('0') elements in the sequence, both to the left and to the right.\nThe spreading from a singular digit continues outwards until it encounters another non-zero digit\n(from the original input sequence) or the boundary of the sequence. The original positions and\nvalues of all non-zero digits from the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence.\nZeros that are not adjacent to a singular non-zero digit, or are blocked by another non-zero\ndigit, remain zero. The process considers the original input sequence for identifying singular\ndigits and determining where spreading stops.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef is_singular(sequence, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the element at the given index in the sequence is a singular non-zero element.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input list of integers.\n        index: The index of the element to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the element is singular and non-zero, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(sequence)\n    current_val = sequence[index]\n\n    # Must be non-zero\n    if current_val == 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check left neighbor (or boundary)\n    is_singular_left = (index == 0 or sequence[index - 1] != current_val)\n\n    # Check right neighbor (or boundary)\n    is_singular_right = (index == n - 1 or sequence[index + 1] != current_val)\n\n    return is_singular_left and is_singular_right\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_sequence: A list of integers representing the input sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the transformed output sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a list, not a numpy array to avoid potential type issues\n    # seen in testing environments.
