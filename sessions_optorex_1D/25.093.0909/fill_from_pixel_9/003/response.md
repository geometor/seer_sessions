"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rule:
Identify non-zero digits in the input sequence that appear singularly, meaning their immediate
neighbors (if they exist) are different digits. For each such singular non-zero digit, "spread"
its value into adjacent zero ('0') elements in the sequence, both to the left and to the right.
The spreading from a singular digit continues outwards until it encounters another non-zero digit
(from the original input sequence) or the boundary of the sequence. The original positions and
values of all non-zero digits from the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence.
Zeros that are not adjacent to a singular non-zero digit, or are blocked by another non-zero
digit, remain zero. The process considers the original input sequence for identifying singular
digits and determining where spreading stops.
