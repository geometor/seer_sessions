**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempted to implement the transformation rule by identifying "singular" non-zero digits and spreading their values into adjacent zeros. However, the execution results show that the code failed on all training examples, consistently returning the original input sequence without any modification. This indicates a critical failure in the code's ability to either identify the singular elements correctly or to perform the spreading operation as intended.

The core logic described in the previous Natural Language Program (identifying non-zero elements not adjacent to the same digit and spreading their value into neighboring zeros until a non-zero digit or boundary is met) appears consistent with the input/output pairs. The failure is likely within the implementation details (e.g., conditional logic evaluation, loop execution, data handling) rather than the high-level understanding of the task.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the metrics reported in the failure analysis (Pixels Off, Match, Palette Correct, Count Correct) based on the provided inputs, expected outputs, and the actual (failed) transformed outputs.
2.  **Refine YAML:** Update the YAML facts to be more precise, particularly regarding the definition of a "singular" element and the conditions under which spreading occurs and stops.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the NLP to be exceptionally clear about the process, emphasizing:
    *   The creation of a copy of the input sequence for modification.
    *   The identification criteria for "singular" non-zero elements based *only* on the original input sequence.
    *   The process of spreading left and right from these singular elements.
    *   The condition that spreading only overwrites elements that were *originally* zero.
    *   The conditions for stopping the spread (encountering an *original* non-zero element or a sequence boundary).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers (0-9)
    description: The original sequence provided as input. Used for checks.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (0-9)
    description: The sequence being modified, initialized as a copy of input_sequence.
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: The digit (0-9)
      - index: The position (0-based) within the sequence.
  - name: singular_non_zero_element
    type: element
    description: An element in the input_sequence that meets specific criteria.
    properties:
      - value: Must be non-zero.
      - index: Its position in the sequence.
    constraints:
      - Is the first element OR the element at index-1 has a different value.
      - AND Is the last element OR the element at index+1 has a different value.
  - name: original_zero_element
    type: element
    description: An element in the input_sequence whose value is 0.

actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create a separate copy of the input_sequence to serve as the initial output_sequence.
  - name: identify_singular_elements

    output: list of indices corresponding to singular_non_zero_elements.
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence to find all elements meeting the singular_non_zero_element criteria.
  - name: spread_value
    input:
      - index_of_singular: The index of a singular_non_zero_element.
      - input_sequence: The original sequence (for checking neighbours).
      - output_sequence: The sequence to be modified.
    description: For a given singular element, modify adjacent original_zero_elements in the output_sequence.
    steps:
      - Get the value (V) of the singular element from input_sequence.
      - **Spread Left:** Starting from index_of_singular - 1, move leftwards. If the element at the current index `j` in input_sequence is 0, set output_sequence[j] = V. Continue until index < 0 or input_sequence[j] is non-zero.
      - **Spread Right:** Starting from index_of_singular + 1, move rightwards. If the element at the current index `k` in input_sequence is 0, set output_sequence[k] = V. Continue until index >= sequence_length or input_sequence[k] is non-zero.

  - type: boundary

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new sequence, `output_sequence`, which is an identical copy of the `input_sequence`. All subsequent modifications will be made to `output_sequence`. The original `input_sequence` will only be used for reference checks.
2.  Iterate through each element of the original `input_sequence` using its index `i` (from 0 to length-1).
3.  For each element `input_sequence[i]`, determine if it is a "singular non-zero element". An element is singular if:
    a.  Its value (`input_sequence[i]`) is not 0.
    b.  AND EITHER `i` is 0 (it's the first element) OR the value of the preceding element (`input_sequence[i-1]`) is different from `input_sequence[i]`.
    c.  AND EITHER `i` is the last index of the sequence OR the value of the following element (`input_sequence[i+1]`) is different from `input_sequence[i]`.
4.  If the element at index `i` is identified as a singular non-zero element with value `V = input_sequence[i]`:
    a.  **Spread Left:** Initialize a check index `j = i - 1`. While `j` is a valid index (greater than or equal to 0) AND the element in the *original* sequence at this index (`input_sequence[j]`) is 0:
        i.  Set the value in the `output_sequence` at index `j` to `V` (`output_sequence[j] = V`).
        ii. Decrement `j` by 1 to check the next element to the left.
    b.  **Spread Right:** Initialize a check index `k = i + 1`. While `k` is a valid index (less than the sequence length) AND the element in the *original* sequence at this index (`input_sequence[k]`) is 0:
        i.  Set the value in the `output_sequence` at index `k` to `V` (`output_sequence[k] = V`).
        ii. Increment `k` by 1 to check the next element to the right.
5.  After iterating through all elements of the `input_sequence` and performing the spreading actions for all identified singular non-zero elements, the `output_sequence` contains the final transformed result. Return `output_sequence`.
