A non-zero element is considered 'singular' if its immediate neighbors\n(if they exist within the sequence boundaries) have different values. The spreading\noccurs outwards (left and right) from the position of the singular element,\nreplacing only those elements that were originally zero in the input sequence.\nThe spread stops in a given direction when it encounters either a non-zero element\n(from the original input sequence) or the boundary of the sequence. Elements\nthat were not originally zero, or zeros that were not reached by spreading from a\nsingular element, remain unchanged in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nimport numpy as np # Import numpy as input might be numpy array\n\ndef is_singular(sequence, index, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the element at the given index in the sequence is a singular non-zero element.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input list or 1D array of integers (original sequence).\n        index: The index of the element to check.\n        n: The length of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the element is non-zero and singular, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_val = sequence[index]\n\n    # Must be non-zero to be considered for spreading\n    if current_val == 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check left neighbor condition:\n    # True if it's the first element (index 0) OR the element to the left is different.\n    left_neighbor_different = (index == 0 or sequence[index - 1] != current_val)\n\n    # Check right neighbor condition:\n    # True if it's the last element (index n-1) OR the element to the right is different.\n    right_neighbor_different = (index == n - 1 or sequence[index + 1] != current_val)\n\n    # Must satisfy both conditions to be singular\n    return left_neighbor_different and right_neighbor_different\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the spreading transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_sequence: A list or 1D numpy array of integers representing the input sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the transformed output sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Ensure input is consistently a standard Python list for processing.\n    # This guards against potential numpy-specific behavior or errors.\n    if isinstance(input_sequence, np.ndarray):\n        original_list = input_sequence.tolist() # Convert numpy array to list\n    else:\n        # Assume it's already list-like (e.g., list, tuple) and ensure it's a mutable list\n        original_list = list(input_sequence)\n\n    # Create a deep copy of the list.
