            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training and test examples with a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the execution environment is passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, rather than standard Python lists. The Python code, specifically in conditional checks (like `if sequence[index - 1] != current_val` or `while input_sequence[j] == 0`), is attempting to evaluate a NumPy comparison, which can result in a boolean array, leading to the ambiguity error when used in a context expecting a single boolean (like `if` or `while`).\n\nThe underlying transformation logic, however, appears correct based on a manual walkthrough of all provided training examples. The rule involves identifying non-zero digits that are \"singular\" (not adjacent to the same digit) and spreading their value into adjacent zeros until a non-zero digit or boundary is hit. Digits that are part of a contiguous block of the same non-zero value do not spread.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Confirm the input type assumption using `tool_code`.\n2.  Refine the Natural Language Program to be precise about using the *original* input for checks and the *copy* for modifications.\n3.  Update the YAML facts.\n4.  Advise the coder phase to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting them to Python lists at the function's start or ensuring all operations are NumPy-compatible in a way that returns single booleans where expected.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
