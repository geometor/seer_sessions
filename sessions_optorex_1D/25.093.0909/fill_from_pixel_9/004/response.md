**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training and test examples with a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the execution environment is passing NumPy arrays to the `transform` function, rather than standard Python lists. The Python code, specifically in conditional checks (like `if sequence[index - 1] != current_val` or `while input_sequence[j] == 0`), is attempting to evaluate a NumPy comparison, which can result in a boolean array, leading to the ambiguity error when used in a context expecting a single boolean (like `if` or `while`).

The underlying transformation logic, however, appears correct based on a manual walkthrough of all provided training examples. The rule involves identifying non-zero digits that are "singular" (not adjacent to the same digit) and spreading their value into adjacent zeros until a non-zero digit or boundary is hit. Digits that are part of a contiguous block of the same non-zero value do not spread.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the input type assumption using `tool_code`.
2.  Refine the Natural Language Program to be precise about using the *original* input for checks and the *copy* for modifications.
3.  Update the YAML facts.
4.  Advise the coder phase to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting them to Python lists at the function's start or ensuring all operations are NumPy-compatible in a way that returns single booleans where expected.

**Metrics Gathering**

``` python
import numpy as np

# Simulating the input structure based on the error message
# Assuming the input string is parsed into a numpy array
input_str_1 = "0 7 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
input_array_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_str_1.split()])

input_str_2 = "0 0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 0 0 0"
input_array_2 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_str_2.split()])

print(f"Example 1 Type: {type(input_array_1)}")
print(f"Example 1 Shape: {input_array_1.shape}")
print(f"Example 1 Data: {input_array_1}")

# Test a comparison that might cause the error
index = 1
current_val = input_array_1[index]
is_left_different = (input_array_1[index - 1] != current_val) # This returns a single boolean (np.bool_)
is_right_different = (input_array_1[index + 1] != current_val) # This returns a single boolean (np.bool_)

print(f"\nSimulating check for index {index} in Example 1:")
print(f"Value: {current_val}")
print(f"Left different check result: {is_left_different} (Type: {type(is_left_different)})")
print(f"Right different check result: {is_right_different} (Type: {type(is_right_different)})")

# Test the while loop condition
j = 0
while_condition = (input_array_1[j] == 0) # This should also return np.bool_
print(f"\nSimulating while loop check for index {j} in Example 1:")
print(f"Condition (input_array_1[j] == 0): {while_condition} (Type: {type(while_condition)})")

# It seems direct element access and comparison works as expected.
# Perhaps the error occurs if slicing or a different operation is implicitly used
# or if the test environment has a nuance not captured here.
# However, the most robust fix is often explicit type conversion.

```
**Findings from Metrics:**
The `tool_code` execution confirms that parsing the input string results in a NumPy array. While direct element comparison (`array[i] == value`) returns a single NumPy boolean (`numpy.bool_`), which usually works fine in conditionals, the error persists in the execution environment. This suggests either a subtle interaction not replicated here or that the safest approach is explicit conversion to a standard Python list within the function to avoid any NumPy-specific boolean array issues. The transformation logic itself appears sound across all examples.

      It stops in each direction upon encountering a non-zero element (in the original input_sequence)
      or the sequence boundary.

  - type: source_target_modification
    description: The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence; checks for spreading use the original input_sequence state, while modifications apply to the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (which might be a NumPy array). Create a deep copy of this input sequence to serve as the initial state of the output sequence. Let `N` be the length of the sequences.
2.  Iterate through the *original* input sequence using an index `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
3.  For each element `current_val = input_sequence[i]` at index `i`:
    a.  Check if `current_val` is non-zero.
    b.  If it is non-zero, determine if it is "singular". An element is singular if:
        i.  It is at the start of the sequence (`i == 0`) OR the element to its left (`input_sequence[i-1]`) has a different value.
        ii. AND it is at the end of the sequence (`i == N-1`) OR the element to its right (`input_sequence[i+1]`) has a different value.
    c.  If the element at index `i` is determined to be singular and non-zero:
        i.  **Spread Left:** Starting from `j = i - 1`, move leftwards (`j >= 0`). As long as the element in the *original* input sequence at index `j` (`input_sequence[j]`) is 0, update the *output* sequence at that index: `output_sequence[j] = current_val`. Stop spreading left if `j` goes out of bounds or `input_sequence[j]` is not 0.
        ii. **Spread Right:** Starting from `k = i + 1`, move rightwards (`k < N`). As long as the element in the *original* input sequence at index `k` (`input_sequence[k]`) is 0, update the *output* sequence at that index: `output_sequence[k] = current_val`. Stop spreading right if `k` goes out of bounds or `input_sequence[k]` is not 0.
4.  After iterating through all elements of the original input sequence and applying any necessary spreading modifications to the output sequence, return the final output sequence (ensuring it's a standard Python list if required by the environment).
