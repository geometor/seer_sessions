The core transformation involves changing some, but not all, of the zero ('0') elements in the input sequence to non-zero digits. The non-zero digits present in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence at their original positions. The key action seems to be the \"spreading\" or \"filling\" of certain non-zero digits into adjacent zero digits. Notably, this spreading only seems to originate from non-zero digits that appear as a block of length one (i.e., a single instance of that digit surrounded by different digits or zeros/boundaries). Non-zero digits that are part of a longer contiguous block of the same digit do not spread. The spreading stops when it encounters another non-zero digit or the boundary of the sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If `i > 0` and `input[i-1]` is 0, then iterate backwards from index `j = i-1` towards the beginning of the sequence: as long as `j >= 0` and `input[j]` is 0, set `output[j] = V`.

Stop if a non-zero element is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.\n5.  After checking all elements in the input sequence, the modified output sequence contains the final result."
