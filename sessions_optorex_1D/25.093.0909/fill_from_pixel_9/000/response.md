Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers, always of length 12 in the provided examples. The core transformation involves changing some, but not all, of the zero ('0') elements in the input sequence to non-zero digits. The non-zero digits present in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence at their original positions. The key action seems to be the "spreading" or "filling" of certain non-zero digits into adjacent zero digits. Notably, this spreading only seems to originate from non-zero digits that appear as a block of length one (i.e., a single instance of that digit surrounded by different digits or zeros/boundaries). Non-zero digits that are part of a longer contiguous block of the same digit do not spread. The spreading stops when it encounters another non-zero digit or the boundary of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (fixed in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: position in the sequence (0-11)
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    properties:
      - value: the digit repeated in the block (can be 0 or non-zero)
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - start_index: index of the first element
      - end_index: index of the last element
  - name: singular_non_zero_block
    type: block
    constraints:
      - value != 0
      - length == 1
  - name: zero_block
    type: block
    constraints:
      - value == 0

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Segment the input sequence into contiguous blocks of identical digits.
  - name: identify_singular_non_zero_blocks
    description: Find all blocks identified in the previous step that have a non-zero value and a length of 1.
  - name: identify_adjacent_zero_blocks
    description: For each singular non_zero block, find any immediately adjacent zero blocks (left or right).
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Modify the sequence by replacing the zeros in the adjacent zero blocks with the value of the corresponding singular non_zero block. The filling extends outwards from the singular block until a non-zero digit or the sequence boundary is encountered.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Relationship between elements or blocks based on their indices in the sequence (e.g., element at index i is adjacent to elements at i-1 and i+1).
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Checks if a block or element is at the start (index 0) or end (index 11) of the sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right (index `i` from 0 to length-1).
3.  For each element at index `i`, check if it represents a "singular non-zero block". This condition is met if:
    *   The element `input[i]` is not zero.
    *   AND ( `i` is 0 OR `input[i-1]` is not equal to `input[i]` )
    *   AND ( `i` is the last index OR `input[i+1]` is not equal to `input[i]` )
4.  If the element at index `i` meets the criteria for a singular non-zero block with value `V = input[i]`:
    a.  **Spread Left:** Check the element to the left (`input[i-1]`). If `i > 0` and `input[i-1]` is 0, then iterate backwards from index `j = i-1` towards the beginning of the sequence: as long as `j >= 0` and `input[j]` is 0, set `output[j] = V`. Stop if a non-zero element is encountered or the beginning of the sequence is reached.
    b.  **Spread Right:** Check the element to the right (`input[i+1]`). If `i < length-1` and `input[i+1]` is 0, then iterate forwards from index `k = i+1` towards the end of the sequence: as long as `k < length` and `input[k]` is 0, set `output[k] = V`. Stop if a non-zero element is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.
5.  After checking all elements in the input sequence, the modified output sequence contains the final result.
