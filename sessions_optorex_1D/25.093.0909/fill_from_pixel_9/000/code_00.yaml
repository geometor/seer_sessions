objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (fixed in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: position in the sequence (0-11)
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    properties:
      - value: the digit repeated in the block (can be 0 or non-zero)
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - start_index: index of the first element
      - end_index: index of the last element
  - name: singular_non_zero_block
    type: block
    constraints:
      - value != 0
      - length == 1
  - name: zero_block
    type: block
    constraints:
      - value == 0

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Segment the input sequence into contiguous blocks of identical digits.
  - name: identify_singular_non_zero_blocks
    description: Find all blocks identified in the previous step that have a non-zero value and a length of 1.
  - name: identify_adjacent_zero_blocks
    description: For each singular non_zero block, find any immediately adjacent zero blocks (left or right).
  - name: fill_zeros
    description: Modify the sequence by replacing the zeros in the adjacent zero blocks with the value of the corresponding singular non_zero block. The filling extends outwards from the singular block until a non-zero digit or the sequence boundary is encountered.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Relationship between elements or blocks based on their indices in the sequence (e.g., element at index i is adjacent to elements at i-1 and i+1).
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Checks if a block or element is at the start (index 0) or end (index 11) of the sequence.
