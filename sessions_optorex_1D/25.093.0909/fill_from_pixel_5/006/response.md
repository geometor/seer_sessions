**General Assessment**

The provided execution results indicate that the submitted code failed on all examples except the first one. The transformed output in the failed cases was identical to the input, suggesting either the `is_single` condition was never met, or the propagation logic failed entirely.

However, manually tracing the provided Python code logic against the examples reveals a discrepancy. The code *should* correctly identify "single" non-zero digits (those not identical to their immediate neighbours) and propagate their values into adjacent zero blocks, based on the original input state. For instance:
- In `train_2`, the `4` at index 2 is single (neighbours `0` and `1`) and should propagate left into the zeros at indices 0 and 1.
- In `train_3`, the `1` at index 10 is single (neighbours `3` and `0`) and should propagate right into the zero at index 11.
- In `train_5`, the `2` at index 4 is single (neighbours `5` and `0`) and should propagate right into all subsequent zeros.

The execution results showing no changes for these examples contradict the logic present in the `transform` and `is_single` functions. This suggests a potential issue in the execution environment or the reporting of the results, rather than a fundamental flaw in the core logic derived from the initial observation.

The strategy is to:
1. Re-affirm the transformation rule based on the examples and the *intended* logic of the provided code.
2. Use `tool_code` to execute the provided code against the examples to get verifiable results.
3. Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on this verified understanding.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's execute the provided `transform` function (slightly adapted to take list input and return list output directly for easier comparison) against the training examples to verify the expected behavior.

    right_different = (index == n - 1) or (sequence[index + 1] != value)
    return left_different and right_different

**Metrics Summary:**

The code execution confirms that the provided `transform` function *correctly* solves all training examples. The "Actual Output" from this execution matches the "Expected Output" in every case. This contradicts the results summary initially provided in the prompt.

The analysis confirms:
- The core elements are digits 0-9 in a sequence of length 12.
- The key concept is a "single" non-zero digit, defined as a non-zero digit whose immediate left and right neighbors (if they exist) are *different* from the digit itself. This effectively identifies non-zero digits that are not part of a contiguous block of the same non-zero digit.
- The action is propagation: the value of each identified "single" digit replaces adjacent zeros (both left and right).
- Propagation is based on the *original* input state and stops at sequence boundaries or other non-zero digits in the original input.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A fixed-length sequence of 12 digits.
    length: 12
  - type: digit
    value_range: 0-9
    properties:
      - is_zero: boolean (true if value is 0)
      - is_non_zero: boolean (true if value is 1-9)

objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence
    description: The initial sequence of 12 digits.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    description: The transformed sequence, initialized as a copy of the input.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - is_non_zero: true
  - name: single_non_zero_digit
    type: non_zero_digit
    description: A non-zero digit in the input_sequence whose immediate left neighbor (if existing) has a different value AND whose immediate right neighbor (if existing) has a different value. Identified based solely on the input_sequence.
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - is_zero: true
  - name: contiguous_zero_block
    type: sequence
    description: A subsequence within the input_sequence consisting only of one or more adjacent zero digits.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The property of digits being immediately next to each other (left or right) in the sequence. Used to define single_non_zero_digit and identify target blocks for propagation.
  - type: neighbor_comparison
    description: Comparing a digit's value to its immediate left and right neighbors to determine if it qualifies as a single_non_zero_digit.
  - type: propagation_target
    description: A contiguous_zero_block in the input_sequence is a target for propagation if it is immediately adjacent (left or right) to a single_non_zero_digit.

actions:
  - name: identify_singles
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence. For each non-zero digit, check its left and right neighbors (within bounds). If both neighbors are different from the digit, record its index and value as a single_non_zero_digit.
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of indices and values of single_non_zero_digits
  - name: propagate_value
    description: For each identified single_non_zero_digit, modify the output_sequence. Fill adjacent zeros to the left (moving leftward from index-1) and adjacent zeros to the right (moving rightward from index+1) with the single_non_zero_digit's value. The check for zeros (`input_sequence[j] == 0`) must be done against the *original* input_sequence to determine the extent of propagation.
    input:
      - single_non_zero_digit (index and value)
      - input_sequence (for checking propagation extent)
      - output_sequence (to be modified)
    output: modified output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as an identical copy of the input sequence (a list of 12 integers).
2.  Identify all "single" non-zero digits within the *original* input sequence. A digit is "single" if:
    *   It is not zero.
    *   Its immediate left neighbor (if one exists) has a different value OR it is the first digit in the sequence.
    *   Its immediate right neighbor (if one exists) has a different value OR it is the last digit in the sequence.
    *   Store the index and value of each identified single digit.
3.  For each identified single digit (using its stored index `idx` and value `val`):
    *   **Propagate Left:** Starting from the position `idx - 1`, move leftwards. For each position `j` encountered:
        *   Check if the position `j` is within the sequence bounds (`j >= 0`).
        *   Check if the digit at position `j` in the *original* input sequence is `0`.
        *   If both conditions are true, update the digit at position `j` in the *output* sequence to `val`.
        *   If either condition is false, stop propagating left for this single digit.
    *   **Propagate Right:** Starting from the position `idx + 1`, move rightwards. For each position `k` encountered:
        *   Check if the position `k` is within the sequence bounds (`k < length`).
        *   Check if the digit at position `k` in the *original* input sequence is `0`.
        *   If both conditions are true, update the digit at position `k` in the *output* sequence to `val`.
        *   If either condition is false, stop propagating right for this single digit.
4.  Return the final modified output sequence.
