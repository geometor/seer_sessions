            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code implements a transformation rule based on identifying \"single\" non-zero digits and propagating their values into adjacent zeros. The core logic seems correct, as verified by manually checking against the examples and confirmed by the metrics gathered using `tool_code`.\n\nHowever, the code failed execution in the test environment with a \"boolean ambiguity\" error, consistently across all examples. This error strongly suggests an issue with data types, likely stemming from the test harness passing NumPy arrays instead of standard Python lists, or perhaps nested lists/arrays, to the `transform` function. Standard Python logical operators (`and`, `or`) and conditional statements (`if`, `while`) expect single boolean values, not boolean arrays, which can result from comparisons involving NumPy arrays.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to robustly handle potential input variations (like NumPy arrays) by explicitly converting the input sequence into a flat list of integers at the beginning.\n2.  **Code Clarity:** Refactor slightly for clarity, potentially integrating the `is_single` logic directly into the main loop if it simplifies understanding.\n3.  **Validation:** Ensure the core logic (identifying singles based on the *original* input and propagating into zeros) remains unchanged, as it correctly explains the transformations in the training examples.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding, emphasizing the definition of a \"single\" digit and the propagation mechanism based on the original input state.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing each training example using the logic derived from the task description:\n\n"
