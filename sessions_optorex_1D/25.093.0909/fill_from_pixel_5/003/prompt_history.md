*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on sequences of 12 digits.
    *   The core elements are digits, specifically distinguishing between zero (`0`) and non-zero digits (1-9).
    *   The transformation involves changing some zero digits to non-zero values based on their neighbors.
    *   Positional adjacency is crucial.
    *   Contiguous blocks of identical digits (both zeros and non-zeros) play a role. Specifically, whether a non-zero digit is part of a repeating block or stands alone seems important.

*   **YAML Facts:**

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format in the previous code (a space-separated string) and the actual input format used during testing (likely a NumPy array or a similar list-like structure that doesn't have a `.split()` method).
    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding "single" non-zero digits and propagating their value into adjacent zero blocks) appears largely consistent with the examples when reviewed manually. A "single" non-zero digit is one that isn't part of a contiguous block of the same digit. Its value then "fills" any immediately neighboring sequences of zeros.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Correct the input handling in the transformation logic to work with list-like structures (specifically NumPy arrays, as is common in this environment) instead of strings.
        2.  Verify and refine the definition of a "single" non-zero digit.
        3.  Verify and refine the propagation rule, ensuring it correctly identifies adjacent zero blocks and fills them without overextending.
        4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the corrected understanding and input format.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Start with the input sequence of 12 integers. Create a copy of this sequence, which will become the output sequence.
    2.  Identify all "single" non-zero digits within the *original* input sequence. A non-zero digit at a specific position is considered "single" if its value differs from the value of its immediate left neighbor (or if it's the first digit) AND its value differs from the value of its immediate right neighbor (or if it's the last digit). Record the index and value of each identified single digit.
    3.  For each identified single non-zero digit (using its original index and value from step 2):
        a.  **Propagate Left:** Look at the position immediately to the left of the single digit's index in the *original* input sequence. If this position exists (i.e., the index is greater than 0) and contains a zero, start replacing zeros in the *output* sequence. Replace the zero at this adjacent position with the single digit's value. Continue moving left, replacing consecutive zeros found in the *original* input sequence with the single digit's value in the *output* sequence, until you encounter a non-zero digit in the original input or reach the beginning of the sequence.
        b.  **Propagate Right:** Look at the position immediately to the right of the single digit's index in the *original* input sequence. If this position exists (i.e., the index is less than 11) and contains a zero, start replacing zeros in the *output* sequence. Replace the zero at this adjacent position with the single digit's value. Continue moving right, replacing consecutive zeros found in the *original* input sequence with the single digit's value in the *output* sequence, until you encounter a non-zero digit in the original input or reach the end of the sequence.
    4.  After processing all identified single digits, the modified output sequence is the final result.
