*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on sequences of 12 digits.
    *   The core elements are digits, specifically distinguishing between zero (`0`) and non-zero digits (1-9).
    *   The transformation involves changing some zero digits to non-zero values based on their neighbors.
    *   Positional adjacency is crucial.
    *   Contiguous blocks of identical digits (both zeros and non-zeros) play a role. Specifically, whether a non-zero digit is part of a repeating block or stands alone seems important.

*   **YAML Facts:**

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code implements a transformation rule based on identifying "single" non-zero digits and propagating their values into adjacent zeros. The core logic seems correct, as verified by manually checking against the examples and confirmed by the metrics gathered using `tool_code`.

However, the code failed execution in the test environment with a "boolean ambiguity" error, consistently across all examples. This error strongly suggests an issue with data types, likely stemming from the test harness passing NumPy arrays instead of standard Python lists, or perhaps nested lists/arrays, to the `transform` function. Standard Python logical operators (`and`, `or`) and conditional statements (`if`, `while`) expect single boolean values, not boolean arrays, which can result from comparisons involving NumPy arrays.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Type Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to robustly handle potential input variations (like NumPy arrays) by explicitly converting the input sequence into a flat list of integers at the beginning.
2.  **Code Clarity:** Refactor slightly for clarity, potentially integrating the `is_single` logic directly into the main loop if it simplifies understanding.
3.  **Validation:** Ensure the core logic (identifying singles based on the *original* input and propagating into zeros) remains unchanged, as it correctly explains the transformations in the training examples.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding, emphasizing the definition of a "single" digit and the propagation mechanism based on the original input state.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered by analyzing each training example using the logic derived from the task description:

Output:  2 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

Example 2:
Input:   0 0 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
Singles: [{'index': 2, 'value': 4}]
Left Prop (by index): {2: [0, 1]}
Right Prop (by index): {}
Output:  4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

Example 3:
Input:   0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 0
Singles: [{'index': 10, 'value': 1}]
Left Prop (by index): {}
Right Prop (by index): {10: [11]}
Output:  0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 1

Example 4:
Input:   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 0
Singles: [{'index': 10, 'value': 3}]
Left Prop (by index): {}
Right Prop (by index): {10: [11]}
Output:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 3

Example 5:
Input:   0 5 5 5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Singles: [{'index': 4, 'value': 2}]
Left Prop (by index): {}
Right Prop (by index): {4: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}
Output:  0 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

Example 6:
Input:   0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0
Singles: [{'index': 1, 'value': 1}]
Left Prop (by index): {1: [0]}
Right Prop (by index): {}
Output:  1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0

Example 7:
Input:   0 0 2 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
Singles: [{'index': 2, 'value': 2}]
Left Prop (by index): {2: [0, 1]}

Output:  2 2 2 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
```


These metrics confirm that the transformation rule involves identifying non-zero digits that are *not* part of a contiguous block of the same digit ("single" digits) and then filling adjacent blocks of zeros with the value of that single digit. The identification and propagation are based on the state of the *original* input sequence.

    input: input_sequence, list of single_non_zero_digits
    output: final output_sequence
    description: Initialize the output_sequence from the input_sequence. Then, for each identified single_non_zero_digit, perform the propagate_value action, updating the output_sequence. The checks for propagation targets (zeros) are always based on the original input_sequence.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input sequence (a list of 12 digits). Create a mutable copy of this sequence, which will become the output sequence.
2.  **Identify "Single" Digits:** Examine the *original* input sequence to find all non-zero digits that are "single". A digit is "single" if it is non-zero AND:
    *   It is at the beginning of the sequence (index 0) and the digit at index 1 has a different value, OR
    *   It is at the end of the sequence (index 11) and the digit at index 10 has a different value, OR
    *   It is in the middle, and *both* the digit to its immediate left and the digit to its immediate right have different values from it.
    Record the value and index of each single digit found.
3.  **Propagate Values:** For *each* single digit identified in step 2:
    *   **Propagate Left:** Starting from the index immediately to the left of the single digit's index, move leftwards. As long as you are within the sequence bounds (index >= 0) and the digit at the current index in the *original* input sequence is 0, change the digit at that same index in the *output* sequence to the value of the single digit. Stop propagating left when you encounter a non-zero digit in the original input or reach the beginning of the sequence.
    *   **Propagate Right:** Starting from the index immediately to the right of the single digit's index, move rightwards. As long as you are within the sequence bounds (index < 12) and the digit at the current index in the *original* input sequence is 0, change the digit at that same index in the *output* sequence to the value of the single digit. Stop propagating right when you encounter a non-zero digit in the original input or reach the end of the sequence.
4.  **Final Output:** After performing the propagation for all identified single digits, the modified output sequence is the final result.
