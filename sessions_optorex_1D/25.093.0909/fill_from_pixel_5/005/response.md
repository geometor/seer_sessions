"""
Identifies "single" non-zero digits in an input sequence (list or array of 12 integers) 
and propagates their value into adjacent blocks of zeros based on the original input state.

A non-zero digit is considered "single" if its immediate left and right neighbors 
(if they exist within the sequence bounds) have different values from it in the 
original input sequence. It's essentially a non-zero digit not part of a 
contiguous block of the same non-zero digit.

The value of each identified single digit (based on the original input) replaces 
the zeros in the contiguous block(s) of zeros immediately to its left and/or 
right in an output sequence. Propagation stops when a non-zero digit (in the 
original input) or the boundary of the sequence is encountered.

    Checks if the digit at the given index in the sequence is a 'single' non-zero digit.

    A digit is 'single' if it's non-zero and its immediate neighbors (if they exist)
