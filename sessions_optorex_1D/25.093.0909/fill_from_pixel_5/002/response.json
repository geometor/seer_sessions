            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format in the previous code (a space-separated string) and the actual input format used during testing (likely a NumPy array or a similar list-like structure that doesn't have a `.split()` method).\n    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (finding \"single\" non-zero digits and propagating their value into adjacent zero blocks) appears largely consistent with the examples when reviewed manually. A \"single\" non-zero digit is one that isn't part of a contiguous block of the same digit. Its value then \"fills\" any immediately neighboring sequences of zeros.\n    *   The strategy is to:\n        1.  Correct the input handling in the transformation logic to work with list-like structures (specifically NumPy arrays, as is common in this environment) instead of strings.\n        2.  Verify and refine the definition of a \"single\" non-zero digit.\n        3.  Verify and refine the propagation rule, ensuring it correctly identifies adjacent zero blocks and fills them without overextending.\n        4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the corrected understanding and input format.\n\n*   **Metrics and Example Analysis:**\n    *   The core task involves sequences of 12 digits.\n    *   The transformation modifies sequences containing zeros adjacent to certain non-zero digits.\n    *   **train_1:** Input `[2 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[2 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. `2` is a single non-zero digit, but it's not adjacent to any zeros. `9`s form a block. No changes occur.\n    *   **train_2:** Input `[0 0 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0]`. Output `[4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0]`. `4` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to zeros at indices 0, 1. These zeros are replaced by `4`. `1`s form a block.\n    *   **train_3:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 0]`. Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 1]`. `1` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to a zero at index 11. This zero is replaced by `1`. `3`s form a block.\n    *   **train_4:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 0]`. Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 3]`. `3` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to a zero at index 11. This zero is replaced by `3`. `6`s form a block.\n    *   **train_5:** Input `[0 5 5 5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[0 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]`. `2` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to zeros at indices 5-11. These zeros are replaced by `2`. `5`s form a block.\n    *   **train_6:** Input `[0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]`. `1` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to a zero at index 0. This zero is replaced by `1`. `8`s form a block.\n    *   **train_7:** Input `[0 0 2 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`. Output `[2 2 2 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`. `2` is a single non-zero digit. It is adjacent to zeros at indices 0, 1. These zeros are replaced by `2`. `8`s form a block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
