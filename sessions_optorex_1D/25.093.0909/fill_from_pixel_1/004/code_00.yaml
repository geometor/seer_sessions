task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D NumPy array (matrix) of integers
      - contains: digits (0-9)
      - structure: Composed of one or more rows, each of length 12 (based on examples)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D NumPy array (matrix) of integers
      - dimensions: Same as input_grid
      - derivation: Result of applying a transformation rule row-by-row to the input_grid
  - object: grid_row (applies to each row independently)
    properties:
      - type: 1D sequence (NumPy array slice) of 12 integers
  - object: leading_zeros (within a row)
    properties:
      - location: start of the row
      - value: 0
      - count: number of zeros before the first non-zero digit in the row
  - object: trailing_zeros (within a row)
    properties:
      - location: end of the row
      - value: 0
      - count: number of zeros after the last non-zero digit in the row
  - object: first_non_zero (within a row)
    properties:
      - value: the digit value of the first non-zero element in the row
      - index: the column position of the first non-zero element in the row
  - object: last_non_zero (within a row)
    properties:
      - value: the digit value of the last non-zero element in the row
      - index: the column position of the last non-zero element in the row
relationships:
  - type: comparison (within each row)
    between: count of leading_zeros
    and: count of trailing_zeros
actions:
  - action: process_grid
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: output_grid
    steps: Iterate through each row of the input_grid and apply 'transform_row'.
  - action: transform_row
    inputs: grid_row
    outputs: modified_grid_row
    steps:
      - identify_boundaries (for the row)
      - conditional_fill (for the row)
  - action: identify_boundaries (for a row)
    inputs: grid_row
    outputs:
      - first_non_zero (value and index)
      - last_non_zero (value and index)
      - count of leading_zeros
      - count of trailing_zeros
    condition: If the row contains only zeros, skip filling actions.
  - action: conditional_fill (for a row)
    condition: count of leading_zeros <= count of trailing_zeros
    operation_if_true: left_fill (for the row)
    operation_if_false: right_fill (for the row)
  - action: left_fill (for a row)
    description: Replace all leading zeros in the row with the value of the row's first_non_zero digit.
    modifies: grid_row (leading_zeros part)
  - action: right_fill (for a row)
    description: Replace all trailing zeros in the row with the value of the row's last_non_zero digit.
    modifies: grid_row (trailing_zeros part)
