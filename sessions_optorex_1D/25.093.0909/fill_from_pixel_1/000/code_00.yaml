task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: digits (0-9)
  - object: leading_zeros
    properties:
      - location: start of the sequence
      - value: 0
      - count: number of zeros before the first non-zero digit
  - object: trailing_zeros
    properties:
      - location: end of the sequence
      - value: 0
      - count: number of zeros after the last non-zero digit
  - object: first_non_zero
    properties:
      - value: the digit value of the first non-zero element
      - index: the position of the first non-zero element
  - object: last_non_zero
    properties:
      - value: the digit value of the last non-zero element
      - index: the position of the last non-zero element
relationships:
  - type: comparison
    between: count of leading_zeros
    and: count of trailing_zeros
actions:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    inputs: sequence
    outputs:
      - first_non_zero (value and index)
      - last_non_zero (value and index)
      - count of leading_zeros
      - count of trailing_zeros
  - action: conditional_fill
    condition: count of leading_zeros <= count of trailing_zeros
    operation_if_true: left_fill
    operation_if_false: right_fill
  - action: left_fill
    description: Replace all leading zeros in the sequence with the value of the first_non_zero digit.
    modifies: sequence (leading_zeros part)
  - action: right_fill
    description: Replace all trailing zeros in the sequence with the value of the last_non_zero digit.
    modifies: sequence (trailing_zeros part)
