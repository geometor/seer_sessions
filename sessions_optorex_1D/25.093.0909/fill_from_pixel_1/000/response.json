The core operation seems to be propagating a non-zero digit into adjacent blocks of zeros at either the beginning or the end of the sequence. The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Input Sequence:** A list of 12 integers.\n2.  **Output Sequence:** A modified list of 12 integers.\n3.  **Zero Blocks:** Contiguous sequences of zeros at the start (leading zeros) and end (trailing zeros) of the input sequence.\n4.  **Non-Zero Boundaries:** The first non-zero digit encountered when reading from left to right, and the last non-zero digit encountered.\n5.  **Propagation Rule:** A decision mechanism determines whether the first non-zero digit propagates leftwards into the leading zeros, or the last non-zero digit propagates rightwards into the trailing zeros. This decision appears to depend on the relative lengths of the leading and trailing zero blocks.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
