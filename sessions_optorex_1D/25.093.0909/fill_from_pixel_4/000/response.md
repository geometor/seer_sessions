Okay, analyzing the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Elements:** The sequences contain blocks of zeros (`0 0 ...`) and runs of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `3 3 3`, `5 5 5 5`).
3.  **Key Interaction:** The transformation seems triggered by the adjacency of a *single* non-zero digit (let's call it the "neighbor") next to a *run* of *different* non-zero digits.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The "neighbor" digit expands, replacing adjacent zeros.
5.  **Directionality:** The expansion happens away from the run (if the neighbor is to the right of the run, it expands rightward into zeros; if it's to the left, it expands leftward).
6.  **Expansion Length:** The final length of the contiguous block formed by the expanded neighbor digit seems determined by the digit value of the adjacent *run*, and potentially the relative position (left/right).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  OutputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Run:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of identical, non-zero digits.
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (X): The digit making up the run.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the run.
          - EndIndex: Position of the last digit in the run.
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A single non-zero digit immediately adjacent (left or right) to a Run.
        Constraint: Neighbor.DigitValue (Y) != Run.DigitValue (X)
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (Y): The digit value of the neighbor.
          - PositionIndex: The index of the neighbor digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0').
        Location: Adjacent to the Neighbor, on the side opposite the Run.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces elements within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock
        Direction: Determined by the relative position of Neighbor and Run (away from the Run).
        Outcome: The contiguous block containing the original Neighbor digit and the replaced zeros forms a new run of the Neighbor digit (Y).
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The final length of the expanded Neighbor block (TargetLength) depends on the Run.DigitValue (X) and the relative position of the Neighbor.
    - Specifics:
      - If Neighbor is RIGHT of Run (Run... Neighbor Zero...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 2, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
      - If Neighbor is LEFT of Run (...Zero Neighbor Run...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 8, TargetLength = 2
    - Constraint: Expansion stops if the ZeroBlock ends before TargetLength is reached.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Find the first (or only) instance of a valid Run-Neighbor pair in the input sequence.
    - Apply the Expansion action based on the RuleForExpansionLength.
    - Output the resulting sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate a non-zero digit (the `Neighbor`) positioned immediately adjacent to a run of identical non-zero digits (the `Run`), ensuring the `Neighbor` digit's value is different from the `Run` digit's value.
2.  Identify the value of the `Run` digit (`X`) and the value of the `Neighbor` digit (`Y`).
3.  Determine the relative position: is the `Neighbor` to the left or right of the `Run`?
4.  Determine the target length (`TargetLength`) for the final block of `Neighbor` digits based on the `Run` digit (`X`) and the relative position:
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **right** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=2, 4 if `X`=3, or 4 if `X`=5.
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **left** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=3, 4 if `X`=5, or 2 if `X`=8.
5.  Identify the sequence of zeros directly adjacent to the `Neighbor` on the side *
