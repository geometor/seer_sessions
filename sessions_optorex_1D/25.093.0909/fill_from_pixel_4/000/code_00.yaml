Observations:
  InputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  OutputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Run:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of identical, non-zero digits.
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (X): The digit making up the run.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the run.
          - EndIndex: Position of the last digit in the run.
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A single non-zero digit immediately adjacent (left or right) to a Run.
        Constraint: Neighbor.DigitValue (Y) != Run.DigitValue (X)
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (Y): The digit value of the neighbor.
          - PositionIndex: The index of the neighbor digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0').
        Location: Adjacent to the Neighbor, on the side opposite the Run.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces elements within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock
        Direction: Determined by the relative position of Neighbor and Run (away from the Run).
        Outcome: The contiguous block containing the original Neighbor digit and the replaced zeros forms a new run of the Neighbor digit (Y).
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The final length of the expanded Neighbor block (TargetLength) depends on the Run.DigitValue (X) and the relative position of the Neighbor.
    - Specifics:
      - If Neighbor is RIGHT of Run (Run... Neighbor Zero...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 2, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
      - If Neighbor is LEFT of Run (...Zero Neighbor Run...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 8, TargetLength = 2
    - Constraint: Expansion stops if the ZeroBlock ends before TargetLength is reached.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Find the first (or only) instance of a valid Run-Neighbor pair in the input sequence.
    - Apply the Expansion action based on the RuleForExpansionLength.
    - Output the resulting sequence.
