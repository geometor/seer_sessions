Okay, analyzing the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Elements:** The sequences contain blocks of zeros (`0 0 ...`) and runs of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `3 3 3`, `5 5 5 5`).
3.  **Key Interaction:** The transformation seems triggered by the adjacency of a *single* non-zero digit (let's call it the "neighbor") next to a *run* of *different* non-zero digits.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The "neighbor" digit expands, replacing adjacent zeros.
5.  **Directionality:** The expansion happens away from the run (if the neighbor is to the right of the run, it expands rightward into zeros; if it's to the left, it expands leftward).
6.  **Expansion Length:** The final length of the contiguous block formed by the expanded neighbor digit seems determined by the digit value of the adjacent *run*, and potentially the relative position (left/right).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  OutputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Run:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of identical, non-zero digits.
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (X): The digit making up the run.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the run.
          - EndIndex: Position of the last digit in the run.
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A single non-zero digit immediately adjacent (left or right) to a Run.
        Constraint: Neighbor.DigitValue (Y) != Run.DigitValue (X)
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (Y): The digit value of the neighbor.
          - PositionIndex: The index of the neighbor digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0').
        Location: Adjacent to the Neighbor, on the side opposite the Run.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces elements within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock
        Direction: Determined by the relative position of Neighbor and Run (away from the Run).
        Outcome: The contiguous block containing the original Neighbor digit and the replaced zeros forms a new run of the Neighbor digit (Y).
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The final length of the expanded Neighbor block (TargetLength) depends on the Run.DigitValue (X) and the relative position of the Neighbor.
    - Specifics:
      - If Neighbor is RIGHT of Run (Run... Neighbor Zero...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 2, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
      - If Neighbor is LEFT of Run (...Zero Neighbor Run...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 8, TargetLength = 2
    - Constraint: Expansion stops if the ZeroBlock ends before TargetLength is reached.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Find the first (or only) instance of a valid Run-Neighbor pair in the input sequence.
    - Apply the Expansion action based on the RuleForExpansionLength.
    - Output the resulting sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate a non-zero digit (the `Neighbor`) positioned immediately adjacent to a run of identical non-zero digits (the `Run`), ensuring the `Neighbor` digit's value is different from the `Run` digit's value.
2.  Identify the value of the `Run` digit (`X`) and the value of the `Neighbor` digit (`Y`).
3.  Determine the relative position: is the `Neighbor` to the left or right of the `Run`?
4.  Determine the target length (`TargetLength`) for the final block of `Neighbor` digits based on the `Run` digit (`X`) and the relative position:
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **right** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=2, 4 if `X`=3, or 4 if `X`=5.
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **left** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=3, 4 if `X`=5, or 2 if `X`=8.
5.  Identify the sequence of zeros directly adjacent to the `Neighbor` on the side *

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: a "neighbor" digit expanding into adjacent zeros, with the expansion length determined by the value of the adjacent "run" digit and the relative position. The failure of the first code attempt, indicated by `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`, likely stemmed from unexpected input data types or structures within the testing environment, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic itself. The error often arises when operations expect a single number but receive an array-like object (e.g., from NumPy).

The strategy involved:
1.  **Re-simulating the logic:** Manually tracing the steps for each example confirmed the pattern rules hold.
2.  **Refining the Code:** Simplifying the pattern detection (`find_pattern`) and adding explicit type casting (`int()`) to handle potential type inconsistencies (like NumPy integers vs. standard Python integers) during comparisons or indexing.
3.  **Verification:** Using `tool_code` to execute the refined code (`transform_v2`) against all training examples. The successful execution confirmed the logic and suggested the implementation issues were likely resolved.

## Metrics and Verification

The refined code (`transform_v2`) was executed against all training examples. The results show that the code now correctly produces the expected output for all provided training cases without errors.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  OutputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output.
  KeyObjects:
    - DigitSequence:
        Description: The sequence of integers derived from the input string.
    - Pattern:
        Description: A specific configuration of three adjacent digits (A, B, C) within the sequence.
        Index: Refers to the index 'i' of the middle digit 'B'.
        Types:
          - RunNeighborZero: A=RunDigit, B=NeighborDigit, C=0. Conditions: A!=0, B!=0, A!=B.
          - ZeroNeighborRun: A=0, B=NeighborDigit, C=RunDigit. Conditions: B!=0, C!=0, B!=C.
    - NeighborDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit 'B' in a found Pattern.
        Properties:
          - Value (Y): The integer value of the digit.
          - Index: The position of the digit in the sequence.
          - PositionRelativeToRun: 'left' (if ZeroNeighborRun) or 'right' (if RunNeighborZero).
    - RunDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit adjacent to the NeighborDigit in a found Pattern (either 'A' in RunNeighborZero or 'C' in ZeroNeighborRun).
        Properties:
          - Value (X): The integer value of the digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0') adjacent to the NeighborDigit, on the side opposite the RunDigit.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The NeighborDigit's value replaces digits within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: NeighborDigit Value (Y).
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock (starting from the zero identified in the Pattern).
        Direction: Away from the RunDigit ('left' if PositionRelativeToRun='left', 'right' if PositionRelativeToRun='right').
        TerminationCondition: Expansion stops when either the TargetLength is reached, a non-zero digit is encountered in the ZeroBlock, or the sequence boundary is hit.
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The total length (TargetLength) of the final contiguous block of NeighborDigits (including the original NeighborDigit). Depends on RunDigit.Value (X) and NeighborDigit.PositionRelativeToRun.
    - Specifics:
      - Position='right': TargetLength = 3 if X=2; 4 if X=3; 4 if X=5.
      - Position='left': TargetLength = 3 if X=3; 4 if X=5; 2 if X=8.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Parse the input string into a sequence of integers.
    - Find the first occurrence of either a RunNeighborZero or ZeroNeighborRun pattern.
    - If a pattern is found:
        - Determine the NeighborDigit, RunDigit, PositionRelativeToRun, and calculate the TargetLength using the RuleForExpansionLength.
        - Create a copy of the original sequence.
        - Apply the Expansion action to the copied sequence.
        - Format the modified sequence back into a space-separated string.
    - If no pattern is found, return the original sequence formatted as a space-separated string.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list, examining triplets of adjacent digits at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` (let's call them `A`, `B`, `C`) for `i` from 1 to length-2.
3.  Identify the first triplet that matches one of these patterns:
    *   **Pattern 1 (Run-Neighbor-Zero):** `A` is non-zero, `B` (the Neighbor) is non-zero, `C` is zero, and `A` is not equal to `B`. Record `NeighborValue=B`, `NeighborIndex=i`, `RunValue=A`, and `Position='right'`.
    *   **Pattern 2 (Zero-Neighbor-Run):** `A` is zero, `B` (the Neighbor) is non-zero, `C` (the Run) is non-zero, and `B` is not equal to `C`. Record `NeighborValue=B`, `NeighborIndex=i`, `RunValue=C`, and `Position='left'`.
4.  If a pattern is found:
    *   Determine the required `TargetLength` for the final block of `NeighborValue` digits based on the `RunValue` and `Position`:
        *   If `Position` is 'right': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=2, 4 if `RunValue`=3, 4 if `RunValue`=5.
        *   If `Position` is 'left': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=3, 4 if `RunValue`=5, 2 if `RunValue`=8.
    *   Create a copy of the integer list to store the output.
    *   If `Position` is 'right': Starting from `NeighborIndex + 1`, replace zeros in the output list with `NeighborValue`, continuing rightwards until the total count of `NeighborValue` digits (including the one at `NeighborIndex`) reaches `TargetLength` or a non-zero digit or the end of the list is encountered.
    *   If `Position` is 'left': Starting from `NeighborIndex - 1`, replace zeros in the output list with `NeighborValue`, continuing leftwards (decrementing index) until the total count of `NeighborValue` digits (including the one at `NeighborIndex`) reaches `TargetLength` or a non-zero digit or the beginning of the list is encountered.
    *   Convert the modified list back to a space-separated string.
5.  If no pattern is found, convert the original list back to a space-separated string.
6.  Return the resulting string.
