            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous attempt failed due to a `TypeError` related to input processing. The `transform` function was designed to handle either a space-separated string or a list of integers, but the error indicates the input format provided by the execution environment did not match these expectations, or the handling logic was flawed. Specifically, attempting to cast `int` on elements already potentially being integers in the `else` clause `[int(x) for x in input_grid]` could cause issues if `input_grid` is passed as a list of ints. The `except` block's attempt to recover might not have covered the exact type passed.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying the Run-Neighbor-Zero or Zero-Neighbor-Run pattern and expanding the neighbor based on the run's value and position) appears sound based on the initial analysis of the examples. The error is purely technical regarding input handling.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Simplify the input handling in the `transform` function to assume the input `input_grid` is consistently provided as a list of integers, as this is common in competitive programming / task environments. Remove the string parsing and complex type checking.\n2.  Verify the core logic (pattern finding, target length calculation, expansion) remains unchanged as it correctly described the transformation observed in the examples.\n3.  Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the input type (list of integers) but maintain the core transformation description.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nSince the previous code failed to execute on any example due to the input type error, no runtime metrics could be gathered. The assessment below is based on re-analyzing the examples with the intended logic:\n\n| Example | Input                                   | Output                                  | Pattern Found | Neighbor Val | Neighbor Idx | Run Val | Position | Target Length | Expected Output Match |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :------ | :------- | :------------ | :-------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,0,0,0]`             | `[0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,1,1]`             | R-N-Z         | 1            | 8            | 3       | right    | 4             | Yes                   |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,2,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[2,2,2,2,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Z-N-R         | 2            | 3            | 5       | left     | 4             | Yes                   |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Z-N-R         | 9            | 2            | 3       | left     | 3             | Yes                   |\n| train_4 | `[0,7,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[7,7,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Z-N-R         | 7            | 1            | 8       | left     | 2             | Yes                   |\n| train_5 | `[0,6,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[6,6,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Z-N-R         | 6            | 1            | 8       | left     | 2             | Yes                   |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,3,0,0]`             | `[0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3]`             | R-N-Z         | 3            | 9            | 2       | right    | 3             | Yes                   |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,0,0,0]`             | `[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,7,7,7]`             | R-N-Z         | 7            | 8            | 5       | right    | 4             | Yes                   |\n\n*   **R-N-Z**: Run-Neighbor-Zero pattern\n*   **Z-N-R**: Zero-Neighbor-Run pattern\n\nThe analysis confirms the previously derived logic correctly handles all training examples once the input is assumed to be a list of integers.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
