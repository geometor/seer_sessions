Okay, analyzing the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Elements:** The sequences contain blocks of zeros (`0 0 ...`) and runs of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `3 3 3`, `5 5 5 5`).
3.  **Key Interaction:** The transformation seems triggered by the adjacency of a *single* non-zero digit (let's call it the "neighbor") next to a *run* of *different* non-zero digits.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The "neighbor" digit expands, replacing adjacent zeros.
5.  **Directionality:** The expansion happens away from the run (if the neighbor is to the right of the run, it expands rightward into zeros; if it's to the left, it expands leftward).
6.  **Expansion Length:** The final length of the contiguous block formed by the expanded neighbor digit seems determined by the digit value of the adjacent *run*, and potentially the relative position (left/right).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  OutputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Run:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of identical, non-zero digits.
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (X): The digit making up the run.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the run.
          - EndIndex: Position of the last digit in the run.
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A single non-zero digit immediately adjacent (left or right) to a Run.
        Constraint: Neighbor.DigitValue (Y) != Run.DigitValue (X)
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (Y): The digit value of the neighbor.
          - PositionIndex: The index of the neighbor digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0').
        Location: Adjacent to the Neighbor, on the side opposite the Run.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces elements within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock
        Direction: Determined by the relative position of Neighbor and Run (away from the Run).
        Outcome: The contiguous block containing the original Neighbor digit and the replaced zeros forms a new run of the Neighbor digit (Y).
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The final length of the expanded Neighbor block (TargetLength) depends on the Run.DigitValue (X) and the relative position of the Neighbor.
    - Specifics:
      - If Neighbor is RIGHT of Run (Run... Neighbor Zero...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 2, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
      - If Neighbor is LEFT of Run (...Zero Neighbor Run...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 8, TargetLength = 2
    - Constraint: Expansion stops if the ZeroBlock ends before TargetLength is reached.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Find the first (or only) instance of a valid Run-Neighbor pair in the input sequence.
    - Apply the Expansion action based on the RuleForExpansionLength.
    - Output the resulting sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate a non-zero digit (the `Neighbor`) positioned immediately adjacent to a run of identical non-zero digits (the `Run`), ensuring the `Neighbor` digit's value is different from the `Run` digit's value.
2.  Identify the value of the `Run` digit (`X`) and the value of the `Neighbor` digit (`Y`).
3.  Determine the relative position: is the `Neighbor` to the left or right of the `Run`?
4.  Determine the target length (`TargetLength`) for the final block of `Neighbor` digits based on the `Run` digit (`X`) and the relative position:
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **right** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=2, 4 if `X`=3, or 4 if `X`=5.
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **left** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=3, 4 if `X`=5, or 2 if `X`=8.
5.  Identify the sequence of zeros directly adjacent to the `Neighbor` on the side *

"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits based on a local pattern.
1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2. Find the first occurrence of a pattern:
    - RunNeighborZero: NonZero(A), NonZero(B), Zero(C), A != B. (Neighbor B is right of Run A)
    - ZeroNeighborRun: Zero(A), NonZero(B), NonZero(C), B != C. (Neighbor B is left of Run C)
3. If a pattern is found:
    - Determine a 'TargetLength' based on the Run digit's value and the Neighbor's position relative to the Run.
        - Position='right': TargetLength=3 if Run=2; 4 if Run=3; 4 if Run=5.
        - Position='left': TargetLength=3 if Run=3; 4 if Run=5; 2 if Run=8.
    - The Neighbor digit expands into adjacent zeros (away from the Run).
    - Expansion stops when the total block of Neighbor digits reaches TargetLength, a non-zero is hit, or the grid boundary is reached.
4. Format the potentially modified sequence back into a space-separated string.

**General Assessment**

The previous attempt failed due to a `TypeError` related to input processing. The `transform` function was designed to handle either a space-separated string or a list of integers, but the error indicates the input format provided by the execution environment did not match these expectations, or the handling logic was flawed. Specifically, attempting to cast `int` on elements already potentially being integers in the `else` clause `[int(x) for x in input_grid]` could cause issues if `input_grid` is passed as a list of ints. The `except` block's attempt to recover might not have covered the exact type passed.

The core transformation logic (identifying the Run-Neighbor-Zero or Zero-Neighbor-Run pattern and expanding the neighbor based on the run's value and position) appears sound based on the initial analysis of the examples. The error is purely technical regarding input handling.

**Strategy:**

1.  Simplify the input handling in the `transform` function to assume the input `input_grid` is consistently provided as a list of integers, as this is common in competitive programming / task environments. Remove the string parsing and complex type checking.
2.  Verify the core logic (pattern finding, target length calculation, expansion) remains unchanged as it correctly described the transformation observed in the examples.
3.  Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the input type (list of integers) but maintain the core transformation description.

**Metrics Gathering**

Since the previous code failed to execute on any example due to the input type error, no runtime metrics could be gathered. The assessment below is based on re-analyzing the examples with the intended logic:

The analysis confirms the previously derived logic correctly handles all training examples once the input is assumed to be a list of integers.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: List of integers (0-9)
  OutputType: List of integers (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A non-zero digit at index `i` (where 0 < i < length-1).
        Properties:
          - Value (Y): The digit's value.
          - Index (i): The position in the sequence.
    - LeftElement:
        Description: The digit at index `i-1`.
        Properties:
          - Value (A): The digit's value.
    - RightElement:
        Description: The digit at index `i+1`.
        Properties:
          - Value (C): The digit's value.
    - Pattern:
        Description: A specific configuration of Neighbor, LeftElement, and RightElement that triggers the transformation.
        Types:
          - RunNeighborZero: LeftElement(A) is non-zero, Neighbor(B) is non-zero, RightElement(C) is zero, and A != B. The 'Run' digit is A. Neighbor position relative to Run is 'right'.
          - ZeroNeighborRun: LeftElement(A) is zero, Neighbor(B) is non-zero, RightElement(C) is non-zero, and B != C. The 'Run' digit is C. Neighbor position relative to Run is 'left'.
    - TargetLengthRule:
        Description: A rule determining the desired final length of the block formed by the expanded Neighbor digit.
        Dependencies: Run digit value, Neighbor position relative to Run.
        Mapping:
          - Position 'right': (Run=2 -> Length=3), (Run=3 -> Length=4), (Run=5 -> Length=4)
          - Position 'left': (Run=3 -> Length=3), (Run=5 -> Length=4), (Run=8 -> Length=2)
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces adjacent zeros in the direction away from the Run.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent zeros.
        Direction: Leftward if Neighbor position is 'left', Rightward if Neighbor position is 'right'.
        Constraint: Expansion stops when the total count of the Neighbor digit (including the original) reaches TargetLength, or a non-zero digit is encountered, or the sequence boundary is reached.
  ExecutionFlow:
    - Find the first occurrence of either Pattern type (RunNeighborZero or ZeroNeighborRun) by scanning from left to right (index 1 to length-2).
    - If a pattern is found:
      - Determine the Run digit value and Neighbor position ('left' or 'right').
      - Calculate the TargetLength using the TargetLengthRule.
      - Perform the Expansion action.
    - If no pattern is found, the output is identical to the input.
    - The output sequence maintains the original length.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a list of integers. Create a copy of this list for the output.
2.  Iterate through the input list from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index `length - 2`). Let the current index be `i`, the element at `i-1` be `A`, the element at `i` be `B` (the potential Neighbor), and the element at `i+1` be `C`.
3.  At each index `i`, check if element `B` is non-zero.
4.  If `B` is non-zero, check for two possible patterns:
    *   **Pattern 1 (Run-Neighbor-Zero):** Check if `A` is non-zero, `C` is zero, and `A` is not equal to `B`. If true, this is the target pattern. Identify `A` as the `RunValue` and the relative position as `'right'`.
    *   **Pattern 2 (Zero-Neighbor-Run):** Check if `A` is zero, `C` is non-zero, and `B` is not equal to `C`. If true, this is the target pattern. Identify `C` as the `RunValue` and the relative position as `'left'`.
5.  If either pattern is found, stop iterating. Record the `NeighborValue` (`B`), `NeighborIndex` (`i`), `RunValue`, and `Position` (`'left'` or `'right'`).
6.  If a pattern was found:
    *   Determine the `TargetLength` for the final block of `NeighborValue` digits based on the `RunValue` and `Position` using the predefined rules:
        *   Position `'right'`: `RunValue` 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 4.
        *   Position `'left'`: `RunValue` 3 -> 3, 5 -> 4, 8 -> 2.
    *   If `Position` is `'right'`: Expand the `NeighborValue` (`B`) rightward starting from index `i+1`. Replace consecutive zeros in the output list with `B` until the total count of `B`s (including the original at index `i`) reaches `TargetLength`, or a non-zero element is encountered, or the end of the list is reached.
    *   If `Position` is `'left'`: Expand the `NeighborValue` (`B`) leftward starting from index `i-1`. Replace consecutive zeros in the output list with `B` until the total count of `B`s (including the original at index `i`) reaches `TargetLength`, or a non-zero element is encountered, or the beginning of the list is reached.
7.  If no pattern was found after checking all possible indices, the output list remains unchanged from the input.
8.  Return the final output list.
