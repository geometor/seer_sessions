Okay, analyzing the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits (0-9).
2.  **Core Elements:** The sequences contain blocks of zeros (`0 0 ...`) and runs of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `3 3 3`, `5 5 5 5`).
3.  **Key Interaction:** The transformation seems triggered by the adjacency of a *single* non-zero digit (let's call it the "neighbor") next to a *run* of *different* non-zero digits.
4.  **Transformation Action:** The "neighbor" digit expands, replacing adjacent zeros.
5.  **Directionality:** The expansion happens away from the run (if the neighbor is to the right of the run, it expands rightward into zeros; if it's to the left, it expands leftward).
6.  **Expansion Length:** The final length of the contiguous block formed by the expanded neighbor digit seems determined by the digit value of the adjacent *run*, and potentially the relative position (left/right).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  OutputType: Sequence of digits (0-9)
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output
  KeyObjects:
    - Run:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of identical, non-zero digits.
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (X): The digit making up the run.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the run.
          - EndIndex: Position of the last digit in the run.
    - Neighbor:
        Description: A single non-zero digit immediately adjacent (left or right) to a Run.
        Constraint: Neighbor.DigitValue (Y) != Run.DigitValue (X)
        Properties:
          - DigitValue (Y): The digit value of the neighbor.
          - PositionIndex: The index of the neighbor digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0').
        Location: Adjacent to the Neighbor, on the side opposite the Run.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The Neighbor digit replaces elements within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: Neighbor digit (Y)
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock
        Direction: Determined by the relative position of Neighbor and Run (away from the Run).
        Outcome: The contiguous block containing the original Neighbor digit and the replaced zeros forms a new run of the Neighbor digit (Y).
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The final length of the expanded Neighbor block (TargetLength) depends on the Run.DigitValue (X) and the relative position of the Neighbor.
    - Specifics:
      - If Neighbor is RIGHT of Run (Run... Neighbor Zero...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 2, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
      - If Neighbor is LEFT of Run (...Zero Neighbor Run...):
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 3, TargetLength = 3
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 5, TargetLength = 4
          - If Run.DigitValue (X) = 8, TargetLength = 2
    - Constraint: Expansion stops if the ZeroBlock ends before TargetLength is reached.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Find the first (or only) instance of a valid Run-Neighbor pair in the input sequence.
    - Apply the Expansion action based on the RuleForExpansionLength.
    - Output the resulting sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input sequence to locate a non-zero digit (the `Neighbor`) positioned immediately adjacent to a run of identical non-zero digits (the `Run`), ensuring the `Neighbor` digit's value is different from the `Run` digit's value.
2.  Identify the value of the `Run` digit (`X`) and the value of the `Neighbor` digit (`Y`).
3.  Determine the relative position: is the `Neighbor` to the left or right of the `Run`?
4.  Determine the target length (`TargetLength`) for the final block of `Neighbor` digits based on the `Run` digit (`X`) and the relative position:
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **right** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=2, 4 if `X`=3, or 4 if `X`=5.
    *   If the `Neighbor` is to the **left** of the `Run`: `TargetLength` is 3 if `X`=3, 4 if `X`=5, or 2 if `X`=8.
5.  Identify the sequence of zeros directly adjacent to the `Neighbor` on the side *

Transforms an input sequence (list of integers) based on a local pattern.
1. Scan the input list to find the first occurrence of a specific three-element pattern centered at index `i` (where 0 < i < length-1). Let the elements be A (at i-1), B (at i, the 'Neighbor'), and C (at i+1).
2. The patterns are:
    - RunNeighborZero: A is non-zero, B is non-zero, C is zero, and A != B. The 'Run' value is A, and the Neighbor's position relative to the Run is 'right'.
    - ZeroNeighborRun: A is zero, B is non-zero, C is non-zero, and B != C. The 'Run' value is C, and the Neighbor's position relative to the Run is 'left'.
3. If a pattern is found:
    - Determine a 'TargetLength' for the final contiguous block of the Neighbor digit (B) based on the Run value and the Neighbor's relative position ('left'/'right'). The specific rules are:
        - Position 'right': (Run=2 -> Length=3), (Run=3 -> Length=4), (Run=5 -> Length=4)
        - Position 'left': (Run=3 -> Length=3), (Run=5 -> Length=4), (Run=8 -> Length=2)
    - The Neighbor digit (B) expands into adjacent zeros in the direction *away* from the Run (rightward for 'right' position, leftward for 'left' position).
    - Expansion modifies a copy of the input list. It replaces zeros with the Neighbor digit until the total count of the Neighbor digit in the expanding block (including the original Neighbor at index `i`) reaches the TargetLength, or a non-zero digit is encountered, or the list boundary is reached.

Okay, analyzing the feedback and planning the refinement.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The feedback indicates that the previously generated code failed on all examples with an error message `Error: Input must be a list of integers.` This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data was passed to or handled by the `transform` function in the test environment. The function likely expected a `list` of integers, but received a `string`.

The strategy is:
1.  **Acknowledge Input Format:** Explicitly define the input as a string of space-separated digits that must be parsed into a list of integers as the first step.
2.  **Validate Core Logic:** Since the error prevented the core transformation logic from executing, re-evaluate the pattern detection and expansion rules based on the original examples. The simulation run in the thought process confirmed the logic derived previously matches all examples when the input string is correctly parsed.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to include the input parsing step and ensure the transformation description remains accurate and clear. The output format should also be specified (list of integers).

## Metrics Gathering

The errors reported were input type errors, preventing the execution of the transformation logic. Therefore, metrics related to the transformation itself (pattern found, target length, expansion results) cannot be derived from the provided error report.

However, simulating the core logic (assuming correct input parsing) against the training examples shows:

```
The simulation confirms the core transformation logic correctly handles all training examples once the input string is parsed. The pattern detection, target length calculation, and expansion rules appear valid for these examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits (0-9).
  InitialProcessing: Must be parsed into a list of integers.

Output:
  Type: List of integers.
  RelationToInput: Same length as the input list. Represents the transformed state.

CoreObjects:
  - Grid:
      Description: The list of integers derived from the input string.
  - Pattern:
      Description: A specific three-element sequence within the Grid that triggers the transformation. Identified by scanning the Grid.
      LocationConstraint: Must occur at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` where `0 < i < length-1`.
      Types:
        - RunNeighborZero:
            Condition: Grid[i-1] != 0 (Run), Grid[i] != 0 (Neighbor), Grid[i+1] == 0 (Zero), AND Grid[i-1] != Grid[i].
            Properties:
              RunValue: Grid[i-1]
              NeighborValue: Grid[i]
              NeighborIndex: i
              RelativePosition: 'right' (Neighbor is right of Run)
        - ZeroNeighborRun:
            Condition: Grid[i-1] == 0 (Zero), Grid[i] != 0 (Neighbor), Grid[i+1] != 0 (Run), AND Grid[i] != Grid[i+1].
            Properties:
              RunValue: Grid[i+1]
              NeighborValue: Grid[i]
              NeighborIndex: i
              RelativePosition: 'left' (Neighbor is left of Run)
  - TargetLength:
      Description: The desired final length of the contiguous block formed by the NeighborValue after expansion.
      Determination: Based on the RunValue and RelativePosition found in the Pattern.
      Rules:
        - Position 'right': (Run=2 -> Length=3), (Run=3 -> Length=4), (Run=5 -> Length=4)
        - Position 'left': (Run=3 -> Length=3), (Run=5 -> Length=4), (Run=8 -> Length=2)

TransformationAction:
  - Name: Expansion
  - Trigger: Detection of the *first* valid Pattern in the Grid.
  - Actor: The NeighborValue from the detected Pattern.
  - Target: Contiguous sequence of zeros adjacent to the NeighborValue, located *away* from the RunValue element of the Pattern.
  - Direction:
      - Rightward (increasing index) if RelativePosition is 'right'.
      - Leftward (decreasing index) if RelativePosition is 'left'.
  - Process:
      1. Create a copy of the initial Grid (OutputGrid).
      2. Replace zeros in the target direction within OutputGrid with the NeighborValue.
      3. Count the expanding block size (including the original Neighbor).
      4. Stop expansion when:
         - The block size reaches TargetLength.
         - A non-zero element is encountered in the expansion direction.
         - The boundary of the Grid is reached.
  - Result: The modified OutputGrid. If no pattern is found, the OutputGrid remains identical to the initial Grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Convert the input string of space-separated digits into a list of integers (the `Grid`). Initialize an `OutputGrid` as a copy of the `Grid`.
2.  **Find Pattern:** Scan the `Grid` from the second element (`index=1`) up to the second-to-last element (`index=length-2`). At each `index i`, examine the triplet `(Grid[i-1], Grid[i], Grid[i+1])`.
3.  **Identify Trigger:** Look for the *first* occurrence of one of these patterns:
    *   **RunNeighborZero:** `Grid[i-1]` (Run) is non-zero, `Grid[i]` (Neighbor) is non-zero, `Grid[i+1]` is zero, and `Run != Neighbor`. Record `RunValue = Grid[i-1]`, `NeighborValue = Grid[i]`, `NeighborIndex = i`, and `Position = 'right'`.
    *   **ZeroNeighborRun:** `Grid[i-1]` is zero, `Grid[i]` (Neighbor) is non-zero, `Grid[i+1]` (Run) is non-zero, and `Neighbor != Run`. Record `RunValue = Grid[i+1]`, `NeighborValue = Grid[i]`, `NeighborIndex = i`, and `Position = 'left'`.
4.  **Determine Target Length:** If a pattern is found, calculate the `TargetLength` based on the recorded `RunValue` and `Position`:
    *   If `Position` is 'right': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=2, 4 if `RunValue`=3, or 4 if `RunValue`=5.
    *   If `Position` is 'left': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=3, 4 if `RunValue`=5, or 2 if `RunValue`=8.
    *   If no specific rule applies, set `TargetLength` to 0 or handle as an invalid state (though current examples cover all identified patterns).
5.  **Perform Expansion:** If a pattern was found and `TargetLength > 0`:
    *   Initialize `CurrentBlockLength = 1` (for the original `NeighborValue` at `NeighborIndex`).
    *   If `Position` is 'right': Iterate `k` from `NeighborIndex + 1` towards the end of the `Grid`. If `Grid[k]` is 0 and `CurrentBlockLength < TargetLength`, change `OutputGrid[k]` to `NeighborValue` and increment `CurrentBlockLength`. Stop if `Grid[k]` is non-zero or `CurrentBlockLength` reaches `TargetLength` or the end of the grid is reached.
    *   If `Position` is 'left': Iterate `k` from `NeighborIndex - 1` towards the start of the `Grid` (decrementing `k`). If `Grid[k]` is 0 and `CurrentBlockLength < TargetLength`, change `OutputGrid[k]` to `NeighborValue` and increment `CurrentBlockLength`. Stop if `Grid[k]` is non-zero or `CurrentBlockLength` reaches `TargetLength` or the start of the grid is reached.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the `OutputGrid` (which is either the modified grid or the original if no pattern was found/applied).
