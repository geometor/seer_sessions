Observations:
  InputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  OutputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output.
  KeyObjects:
    - DigitSequence:
        Description: The sequence of integers derived from the input string.
    - Pattern:
        Description: A specific configuration of three adjacent digits (A, B, C) within the sequence.
        Index: Refers to the index 'i' of the middle digit 'B'.
        Types:
          - RunNeighborZero: A=RunDigit, B=NeighborDigit, C=0. Conditions: A!=0, B!=0, A!=B.
          - ZeroNeighborRun: A=0, B=NeighborDigit, C=RunDigit. Conditions: B!=0, C!=0, B!=C.
    - NeighborDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit 'B' in a found Pattern.
        Properties:
          - Value (Y): The integer value of the digit.
          - Index: The position of the digit in the sequence.
          - PositionRelativeToRun: 'left' (if ZeroNeighborRun) or 'right' (if RunNeighborZero).
    - RunDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit adjacent to the NeighborDigit in a found Pattern (either 'A' in RunNeighborZero or 'C' in ZeroNeighborRun).
        Properties:
          - Value (X): The integer value of the digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0') adjacent to the NeighborDigit, on the side opposite the RunDigit.
  PrimaryAction:
    - Expansion:
        Description: The NeighborDigit's value replaces digits within the adjacent ZeroBlock.
        Actor: NeighborDigit Value (Y).
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock (starting from the zero identified in the Pattern).
        Direction: Away from the RunDigit ('left' if PositionRelativeToRun='left', 'right' if PositionRelativeToRun='right').
        TerminationCondition: Expansion stops when either the TargetLength is reached, a non-zero digit is encountered in the ZeroBlock, or the sequence boundary is hit.
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The total length (TargetLength) of the final contiguous block of NeighborDigits (including the original NeighborDigit). Depends on RunDigit.Value (X) and NeighborDigit.PositionRelativeToRun.
    - Specifics:
      - Position='right': TargetLength = 3 if X=2; 4 if X=3; 4 if X=5.
      - Position='left': TargetLength = 3 if X=3; 4 if X=5; 2 if X=8.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Parse the input string into a sequence of integers.
    - Find the first occurrence of either a RunNeighborZero or ZeroNeighborRun pattern.
    - If a pattern is found:
        - Determine the NeighborDigit, RunDigit, PositionRelativeToRun, and calculate the TargetLength using the RuleForExpansionLength.
        - Create a copy of the original sequence.
        - Apply the Expansion action to the copied sequence.
        - Format the modified sequence back into a space-separated string.
    - If no pattern is found, return the original sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
