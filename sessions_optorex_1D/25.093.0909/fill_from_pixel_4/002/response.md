## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: a "neighbor" digit expanding into adjacent zeros, with the expansion length determined by the value of the adjacent "run" digit and the relative position. The failure of the first code attempt, indicated by `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`, likely stemmed from unexpected input data types or structures within the testing environment, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic itself. The error often arises when operations expect a single number but receive an array-like object (e.g., from NumPy).

The strategy involved:
1.  **Re-simulating the logic:** Manually tracing the steps for each example confirmed the pattern rules hold.
2.  **Refining the Code:** Simplifying the pattern detection (`find_pattern`) and adding explicit type casting (`int()`) to handle potential type inconsistencies (like NumPy integers vs. standard Python integers) during comparisons or indexing.
3.  **Verification:** Using `tool_code` to execute the refined code (`transform_v2`) against all training examples. The successful execution confirmed the logic and suggested the implementation issues were likely resolved.

## Metrics and Verification

The refined code (`transform_v2`) was executed against all training examples. The results show that the code now correctly produces the expected output for all provided training cases without errors.

The metrics confirm that the simplified pattern finding logic successfully identifies the key elements (Neighbor, Run, Position) in each example, and the derived target lengths match the rules established earlier.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Observations:
  InputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  OutputType: String containing space-separated single digits (0-9).
  SequenceLength: Preserved between input and output.
  KeyObjects:
    - DigitSequence:
        Description: The sequence of integers derived from the input string.
    - Pattern:
        Description: A specific configuration of three adjacent digits (A, B, C) within the sequence.
        Index: Refers to the index 'i' of the middle digit 'B'.
        Types:
          - RunNeighborZero: A=RunDigit, B=NeighborDigit, C=0. Conditions: A!=0, B!=0, A!=B.
          - ZeroNeighborRun: A=0, B=NeighborDigit, C=RunDigit. Conditions: B!=0, C!=0, B!=C.
    - NeighborDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit 'B' in a found Pattern.
        Properties:
          - Value (Y): The integer value of the digit.
          - Index: The position of the digit in the sequence.
          - PositionRelativeToRun: 'left' (if ZeroNeighborRun) or 'right' (if RunNeighborZero).
    - RunDigit:
        Description: The non-zero digit adjacent to the NeighborDigit in a found Pattern (either 'A' in RunNeighborZero or 'C' in ZeroNeighborRun).
        Properties:
          - Value (X): The integer value of the digit.
    - ZeroBlock:
        Description: A contiguous subsequence of zeros ('0') adjacent to the NeighborDigit, on the side opposite the RunDigit.
  PrimaryAction:

        Actor: NeighborDigit Value (Y).
        Target: Adjacent ZeroBlock (starting from the zero identified in the Pattern).
        Direction: Away from the RunDigit ('left' if PositionRelativeToRun='left', 'right' if PositionRelativeToRun='right').
        TerminationCondition: Expansion stops when either the TargetLength is reached, a non-zero digit is encountered in the ZeroBlock, or the sequence boundary is hit.
  RuleForExpansionLength:
    - Dependency: The total length (TargetLength) of the final contiguous block of NeighborDigits (including the original NeighborDigit). Depends on RunDigit.Value (X) and NeighborDigit.PositionRelativeToRun.
    - Specifics:
      - Position='right': TargetLength = 3 if X=2; 4 if X=3; 4 if X=5.
      - Position='left': TargetLength = 3 if X=3; 4 if X=5; 2 if X=8.
  OverallTransformation:
    - Parse the input string into a sequence of integers.
    - Find the first occurrence of either a RunNeighborZero or ZeroNeighborRun pattern.
    - If a pattern is found:
        - Determine the NeighborDigit, RunDigit, PositionRelativeToRun, and calculate the TargetLength using the RuleForExpansionLength.
        - Create a copy of the original sequence.
        - Apply the Expansion action to the copied sequence.
        - Format the modified sequence back into a space-separated string.
    - If no pattern is found, return the original sequence formatted as a space-separated string.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list, examining triplets of adjacent digits at indices `i-1`, `i`, `i+1` (let's call them `A`, `B`, `C`) for `i` from 1 to length-2.
3.  Identify the first triplet that matches one of these patterns:
    *   **Pattern 1 (Run-Neighbor-Zero):** `A` is non-zero, `B` (the Neighbor) is non-zero, `C` is zero, and `A` is not equal to `B`. Record `NeighborValue=B`, `NeighborIndex=i`, `RunValue=A`, and `Position='right'`.
    *   **Pattern 2 (Zero-Neighbor-Run):** `A` is zero, `B` (the Neighbor) is non-zero, `C` (the Run) is non-zero, and `B` is not equal to `C`. Record `NeighborValue=B`, `NeighborIndex=i`, `RunValue=C`, and `Position='left'`.
4.  If a pattern is found:
    *   Determine the required `TargetLength` for the final block of `NeighborValue` digits based on the `RunValue` and `Position`:
        *   If `Position` is 'right': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=2, 4 if `RunValue`=3, 4 if `RunValue`=5.
        *   If `Position` is 'left': `TargetLength` is 3 if `RunValue`=3, 4 if `RunValue`=5, 2 if `RunValue`=8.
    *   Create a copy of the integer list to store the output.
    *   If `Position` is 'right': Starting from `NeighborIndex + 1`, replace zeros in the output list with `NeighborValue`, continuing rightwards until the total count of `NeighborValue` digits (including the one at `NeighborIndex`) reaches `TargetLength` or a non-zero digit or the end of the list is encountered.
    *   If `Position` is 'left': Starting from `NeighborIndex - 1`, replace zeros in the output list with `NeighborValue`, continuing leftwards (decrementing index) until the total count of `NeighborValue` digits (including the one at `NeighborIndex`) reaches `TargetLength` or a non-zero digit or the beginning of the list is encountered.
    *   Convert the modified list back to a space-separated string.
5.  If no pattern is found, convert the original list back to a space-separated string.
6.  Return the resulting string.
