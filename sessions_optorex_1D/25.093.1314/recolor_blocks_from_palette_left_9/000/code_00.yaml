objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers from 0 to 9
  - name: target_number
    properties:
      - value: 5
  - name: groups_of_fives
    properties:
      - type: list_of_lists
      - description: Each inner list contains the indices of consecutive '5's in the input sequence.
  - name: replacement_values
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - source: The last 'k' elements of the input sequence, where 'k' is the count of groups_of_fives.
      - order: Preserved from the input sequence.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input_string
    output: sequence (list_of_integers)
  - name: identify_groups
    input: sequence
    output: groups_of_fives
    description: Finds consecutive sequences of the target_number (5) in the input sequence.
  - name: determine_replacement_count
    input: groups_of_fives
    output: k (integer count of groups)
  - name: extract_replacement_values
    input: sequence, k
    output: replacement_values (list_of_integers)
    description: Takes the last 'k' elements from the sequence.
  - name: replace_groups
    input: sequence, groups_of_fives, replacement_values
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Iterates through groups_of_fives and replacement_values simultaneously. For the i-th group, replaces all elements at the indices specified by the group with the i-th replacement value.
  - name: format_output
    input: modified_sequence
    output: output_string
    description: Converts the list of integers back to a space-separated string.

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    source: groups_of_fives
    target: replacement_values
    description: The i-th group of '5's corresponds to the i-th replacement value.
  - type: dependency
    source: replacement_values_count (k)
    target: groups_of_fives_count
    description: The number of replacement values needed is equal to the number of groups of consecutive '5's found.
  - type: location
    source: replacement_values
    target: sequence
    description: Replacement values are located at the end of the input sequence.
