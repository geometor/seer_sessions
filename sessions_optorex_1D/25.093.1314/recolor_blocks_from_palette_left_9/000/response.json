Other numbers (0-4, 6-9) often remain unchanged unless they are part of the replacement mechanism.\n3.  **Replacement Values**: The last few numbers in the input sequence act as replacement values for the '5's.\n4.  **Grouping**: The '5's appear in consecutive groups (e.g., `5 5`, `5 5 5`).\n5.  **Mapping**: There's a clear mapping between the groups of '5's and the replacement values taken from the end of the input sequence. The first group of '5's is replaced by the first replacement value, the second group by the second replacement value, and so on.\n6.  **Number of Replacements**: The number of replacement values used corresponds exactly to the number of distinct groups of consecutive '5's found in the input sequence (excluding the tail end used for replacements).\n7.  **Replacement Application**: Within a group of consecutive '5's, all '5's are replaced by the *same* corresponding replacement value.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
