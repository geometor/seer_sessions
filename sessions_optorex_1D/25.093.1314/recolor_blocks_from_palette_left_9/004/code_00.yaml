objects:
  - name: input_string
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: 12 space-separated integers (0-9)
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: 12
      - source: Derived from input_string
  - name: target_number
    properties:
      - value: 5
  - name: groups_of_fives
    properties:
      - type: list_of_lists_of_indices
      - description: Each inner list contains the zero-based indices of a consecutive sequence of '5's in the input_sequence.
      - order: Groups are ordered by their starting index.
  - name: group_count
    properties:
      - type: integer (k)
      - value: The total number of groups_of_fives found.
  - name: replacement_values
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - source: The last 'k' elements of the input_sequence.
      - count: Equal to group_count (k).
      - order: Preserved from the input_sequence.
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: 12
      - state: Initially a copy of input_sequence, then modified.
  - name: output_string
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: 12 space-separated integers
      - source: Derived from output_sequence

actions:
  - name: parse_string_to_sequence
    input: input_string
    output: input_sequence
  - name: find_consecutive_target_groups
    input: input_sequence, target_number (5)
    output: groups_of_fives
  - name: count_groups
    input: groups_of_fives
    output: group_count (k)
  - name: extract_replacement_values
    input: input_sequence, group_count (k)
    output: replacement_values
    precondition: k >= 0. If k > 0, requires len(input_sequence) >= k.
  - name: initialize_output_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence (as a copy)
  - name: replace_target_groups
    input: output_sequence, groups_of_fives, replacement_values
    output: modified output_sequence
    description: Iterates from i=0 to k-1. For each i, replaces elements in output_sequence at indices specified by the i-th group in groups_of_fives with the i-th value from replacement_values.
  - name: format_sequence_to_string
    input: output_sequence
    output: output_string

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    source: i-th group in groups_of_fives
    target: i-th value in replacement_values
    description: The elements of the i-th group are replaced by the i-th replacement value.
  - type: dependency
    source: count of replacement_values needed
    target: group_count (k)
    description: The number of values to extract from the end of the input sequence is determined by the number of consecutive groups of '5's found.
