"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 space-separated integers based on the following rule:
1. Parses the input string into a list of 12 integers.
2. Identifies all distinct groups of consecutive '5's in the sequence.
3. Counts the number of such groups found ('k').
4. If k is 0, returns the original input string.
5. If k > 0, extracts the last 'k' integers from the input sequence as replacement values, maintaining their order.
6. Creates a copy of the input sequence.
7. For each identified group of '5's (in order of appearance from left to right), replaces all '5's within that group in the copied sequence with the corresponding replacement value (also in order from left to right as extracted).
8. Formats the modified sequence back into a space-separated string and returns it.
