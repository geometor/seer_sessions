"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on the following rule:
1.  Identifies all distinct groups of consecutive '5's within the input array (`input_grid`).
2.  Counts the total number of identified groups (`k`).
3.  If `k` is 0, returns the original `input_grid` unchanged.
4.  If `k` is greater than 0:
    a.  Extracts the last `k` elements from the `input_grid`; these are the `replacement_values`.
    b.  Creates a copy of the `input_grid` to serve as the `output_grid`.
    c.  Iterates through the identified groups (in order of appearance) and the `replacement_values` simultaneously.
    d.  For the i-th group, replaces all elements in the `output_grid` at the indices specified in the group with the i-th `replacement_value`.
    e.  Returns the modified `output_grid`.
