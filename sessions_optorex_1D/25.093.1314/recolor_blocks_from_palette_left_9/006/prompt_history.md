Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output consist of a sequence of 12 space-separated integers.
2.  **Target Number**: The number '5' appears frequently in the inputs and seems to be the primary target for transformation. Other numbers (0-4, 6-9) often remain unchanged unless they are part of the replacement mechanism.
3.  **Replacement Values**: The last few numbers in the input sequence act as replacement values for the '5's.
4.  **Grouping**: The '5's appear in consecutive groups (e.g., `5 5`, `5 5 5`).
5.  **Mapping**: There's a clear mapping between the groups of '5's and the replacement values taken from the end of the input sequence. The first group of '5's is replaced by the first replacement value, the second group by the second replacement value, and so on.
6.  **Number of Replacements**: The number of replacement values used corresponds exactly to the number of distinct groups of consecutive '5's found in the input sequence (excluding the tail end used for replacements).
7.  **Replacement Application**: Within a group of consecutive '5's, all '5's are replaced by the *same* corresponding replacement value.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse** the input string into a list of 12 integers.
2.  **Identify** all groups of consecutive '5's within the list. Record the starting and ending index for each group. Let `k` be the total number of such groups found.
3.  **Extract** the last `k` integers from the input list; these are the `replacement_values`, maintaining their original order.
4.  **Create** a copy of the original input list to serve as the output list.
5.  **Iterate** through the identified groups of '5's and the `replacement_values` simultaneously. For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`:
    *   Take the `i`-th group of '5's (identified in step 2).
    *   Take the `i`-th `replacement_value` (from step 3).
    *   In the output list, **replace** all the integers corresponding to the indices of this `i`-th group with the `i`-th `replacement_value`.
6.  **Format** the modified output list back into a space-separated string.
