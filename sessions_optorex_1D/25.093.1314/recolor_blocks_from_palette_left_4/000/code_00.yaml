# YAML representation of observed facts

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      properties:
        - DataPart: indices 0-8
        - ControlPart: indices 9-11
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
  - DataDigit:
      type: int
      location: InputSequence.DataPart
      possible_values: [0, 5] # Based on examples
  - ControlDigit:
      type: int
      location: InputSequence.ControlPart
  - TargetDigitValue:
      value: 5
  - InvariantDigitValue:
      value: 0 # Based on examples in DataPart
  - GroupOfFives:
      type: List[Tuple[int, int]] # List of (start_index, end_index) for contiguous 5s in DataPart
  - ReplacementValues:
      type: List[int]
      source: InputSequence.ControlPart
      constraints:
        - derived from ControlPart in order (index 9, 10, 11)
        - filtered to exclude 0

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate contiguous groups of TargetDigitValue (5) within the DataPart of InputSequence.
  - Filter: Create the ReplacementValues list by taking ControlDigits from ControlPart in order, excluding any 0s.
  - Map: Associate the k-th GroupOfFives with the k-th value in ReplacementValues.
  - Replace: For each digit in the DataPart:
      - If the digit is part of the k-th GroupOfFives, replace it with the k-th value from ReplacementValues.
      - If the digit is an InvariantDigitValue (0), keep it as is.
  - Copy: Copy the ControlPart of InputSequence directly to the corresponding positions (9-11) in OutputSequence.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence.
  - The transformation primarily affects the DataPart based on values in the ControlPart.
  - The number of groups of 5s replaced is limited by the number of non-zero values in the ControlPart.
  - The order of replacement follows the order of GroupOfFives and the order of non-zero ReplacementValues.
