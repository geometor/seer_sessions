The replacement values are derived from the control section.\n6.  **Replacement Values:** The digits in the control section (input indices 9, 10, 11) serve as potential replacement values.\n7.  **Filtering Replacements:** It appears that '0' values within the control section are *not* used as replacement values. Only the non-zero control digits are used, maintaining their original relative order.\n8.  **Applying Replacements:** The identified contiguous groups of '5's in the data section are replaced sequentially using the filtered, non-zero replacement values from the control section. The first group of '5's uses the first available non-zero replacement value, the second group uses the second, and so on.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
