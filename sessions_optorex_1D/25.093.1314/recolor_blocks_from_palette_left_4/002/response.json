            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed to receive a string input (which it would then `.split()`) but was actually passed a NumPy array during testing. The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program and YAML facts appears consistent with the examples when manually checked.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the input handling of the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers.\n2.  Verify that the refined code passes all provided training examples.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the confirmed input type and transformation steps accurately.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe previous code failed before processing any data due to the input type mismatch. Therefore, no metrics could be gathered from its execution. A manual review of the examples against the intended logic confirms:\n\n*   **Input Structure:** All inputs are sequences of 12 integers.\n*   **Output Structure:** All outputs are sequences of 12 integers.\n*   **Control Digits:** The last 3 digits (indices 9-11) of the input are consistently copied to the same positions in the output.\n*   **Target Digit:** The digit '5' in the first 9 positions is the target for replacement.\n*   **Invariant Digits:** Digits other than '5' (specifically '0' in the examples) in the first 9 positions remain unchanged.\n*   **Replacement Source:** The non-zero digits among the last 3 input digits, taken in their original order, serve as replacement values.\n*   **Replacement Logic:** Contiguous blocks of '5's in the first 9 positions are replaced sequentially by the available non-zero control digits. The first block gets the first non-zero control digit, the second block gets the second, and so on. If there are more blocks of '5's than non-zero control digits, the later blocks remain unchanged (as seen if we hypothetically had more 5s than replacements). If there are more non-zero control digits than blocks of '5's, the excess control digits are not used for replacement.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
