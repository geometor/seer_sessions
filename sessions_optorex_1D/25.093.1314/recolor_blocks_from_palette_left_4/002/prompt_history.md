Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Data and Control Sections:** The input sequence can be conceptually divided into two parts:
    *   A "data" section consisting of the first 9 digits (indices 0-8).
    *   A "control" section consisting of the last 3 digits (indices 9-11).
3.  **Target Digit:** The digit '5' in the data section is the primary target for transformation.
4.  **Invariant Digits:**
    *   Digits other than '5' (specifically '0' in the examples) within the data section remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The control section digits (last 3) are copied directly to the corresponding positions in the output.
5.  **Replacement Mechanism:** The transformation involves replacing contiguous groups of '5's in the data section. The replacement values are derived from the control section.
6.  **Replacement Values:** The digits in the control section (input indices 9, 10, 11) serve as potential replacement values.
7.  **Filtering Replacements:** It appears that '0' values within the control section are *not* used as replacement values. Only the non-zero control digits are used, maintaining their original relative order.
8.  **Applying Replacements:** The identified contiguous groups of '5's in the data section are replaced sequentially using the filtered, non-zero replacement values from the control section. The first group of '5's uses the first available non-zero replacement value, the second group uses the second, and so on.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# YAML representation of observed facts

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      properties:
        - DataPart: indices 0-8
        - ControlPart: indices 9-11
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
  - DataDigit:
      type: int
      location: InputSequence.DataPart
      possible_values: [0, 5] # Based on examples
  - ControlDigit:
      type: int
      location: InputSequence.ControlPart
  - TargetDigitValue:
      value: 5
  - InvariantDigitValue:
      value: 0 # Based on examples in DataPart
  - GroupOfFives:
      type: List[Tuple[int, int]] # List of (start_index, end_index) for contiguous 5s in DataPart
  - ReplacementValues:
      type: List[int]
      source: InputSequence.ControlPart
      constraints:
        - derived from ControlPart in order (index 9, 10, 11)
        - filtered to exclude 0

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate contiguous groups of TargetDigitValue (5) within the DataPart of InputSequence.
  - Filter: Create the ReplacementValues list by taking ControlDigits from ControlPart in order, excluding any 0s.
  - Map: Associate the k-th GroupOfFives with the k-th value in ReplacementValues.
  - Replace: For each digit in the DataPart:
      - If the digit is part of the k-th GroupOfFives, replace it with the k-th value from ReplacementValues.
      - If the digit is an InvariantDigitValue (0), keep it as is.
  - Copy: Copy the ControlPart of InputSequence directly to the corresponding positions (9-11) in OutputSequence.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence.
  - The transformation primarily affects the DataPart based on values in the ControlPart.
  - The number of groups of 5s replaced is limited by the number of non-zero values in the ControlPart.
  - The order of replacement follows the order of GroupOfFives and the order of non-zero ReplacementValues.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Identify the three control digits from the input sequence at indices 9, 10, and 11.
3.  Create an ordered list of non-zero replacement values from these three control digits.
4.  Initialize an index `replacement_idx` to 0, pointing to the first value in the non-zero replacement list.
5.  Iterate through the first 9 digits (indices 0 to 8) of the input sequence.
6.  If a digit '5' is encountered:
    a.  Check if it's the start of a new contiguous group of '5's (i.e., it's the first '5' or the previous digit was not '5').
    b.  If it is the start of a new group *and* there are still unused replacement values (`replacement_idx` is within the bounds of the non-zero replacement list):
        i.  Get the current replacement value using `replacement_idx`.
        ii. Increment `replacement_idx`.
    c.  If the current digit '5' belongs to a group that has an assigned replacement value (determined in step 6.b), change the corresponding digit in the *output* sequence to this replacement value.
7.  If a digit other than '5' (e.g., '0') is encountered in the first 9 positions, leave the corresponding digit in the output sequence unchanged (it was already copied in step 1).
8.  The digits at indices 9, 10, and 11 in the output sequence remain as they were copied from the input in step 1.
9.  Return the modified output sequence.
```python
import re # Used for potential pattern finding if needed, though direct iteration seems simpler here.

"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 digits based on the following rules:
1. The input sequence is treated as two parts: data (first 9 digits) and control (last 3 digits).
2. The control digits (indices 9, 10, 11) provide potential replacement values.
3. Only non-zero control digits are used as replacement values, maintaining their relative order.
4. Contiguous groups of the digit '5' in the data part are identified.
5. Each identified group of '5's is replaced sequentially by the next available non-zero replacement value.
6. Digits other than '5' in the data part remain unchanged.
7. The control digits (indices 9, 10, 11) in the output are identical to those in the input.
