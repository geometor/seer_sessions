"""
Parses an input string of 12 space-separated integers. Replaces contiguous blocks 
of the digit '5' in the first 10 elements based on the values of the last two 
elements (at indices 10 and 11). If one block of '5's exists, its elements are 
replaced with the value at index 11. If two blocks exist, the first block's elements 
are replaced with the value at index 10, and the second block's elements are 
replaced with the value at index 11. Elements other than '5' in the first 10 
positions, and the elements at indices 10 and 11, remain unchanged. Returns the 
transformed list of 12 integers.
