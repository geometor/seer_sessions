**General Assessment:**

The primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the assumed input format (a list or array of 12 integers) and the actual format being processed by the execution environment (likely interpreting the entire input string as a single element or a nested structure incorrectly). The core logic identified in the previous phase – identifying blocks of '5's in the first 10 positions and replacing them based on the values at indices 10 and 11 – appears sound based on visual inspection of the examples, but it couldn't be verified due to the input format error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input processing: Ensure the input string is parsed into a list of 12 integers before applying the transformation logic.
2.  Verify the block identification and replacement logic against each example using code execution.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on this verified understanding.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze each training example to confirm the block structure and control values. We'll parse the input string into a list of integers first.

    """Parses the input string and analyzes blocks of '5's."""
    try:

        sequence = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]

        if len(sequence) != 12:
            return f"Error: Input sequence length is {len(sequence)}, expected 12."

        # Extract control values
        val1 = sequence[10]
        val2 = sequence[11]

        # Find blocks of '5's in the first 10 elements

**Metrics Summary:**

*   **train_1:** 2 blocks ([1, 3), [7, 9)), val1=1, val2=9. Expected: block1 -> 1, block2 -> 9. Output: `0 1 1 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 1 9` (Matches)
*   **train_2:** 2 blocks ([2, 4), [6, 8)), val1=1, val2=3. Expected: block1 -> 1, block2 -> 3. Output: `0 0 1 1 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 3` (Matches)
*   **train_3:** 2 blocks ([1, 4), [5, 8)), val1=5, val2=4. Expected: block1 -> 5, block2 -> 4. Output: `0 5 5 5 0 4 4 4 0 0 5 4` (Matches)
*   **train_4:** 2 blocks ([0, 2), [6, 8)), val1=9, val2=3. Expected: block1 -> 9, block2 -> 3. Output: `9 9 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 9 3` (Matches)
*   **train_5:** 2 blocks ([1, 3), [5, 7)), val1=4, val2=7. Expected: block1 -> 4, block2 -> 7. Output: `0 4 4 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 4 7` (Matches)
*   **train_6:** 2 blocks ([3, 5), [7, 9)), val1=1, val2=2. Expected: block1 -> 1, block2 -> 2. Output: `0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 1 2` (Matches)
*   **train_7:** 1 block ([0, 2)), val1=0, val2=1. Expected: block1 -> 1. Output: `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1` (Matches)

The analysis confirms the logic: two blocks mean the first block uses `val1` and the second uses `val2` for replacement; one block means it uses `val2`.

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence.
  - Elements at indices 10 and 11 remain unchanged from input_sequence to output_sequence.
  - Elements != 5 at indices 0-9 in input_sequence remain unchanged in output_sequence.
  - Elements == 5 at indices 0-9 in input_sequence are replaced based on block membership and control values.
actions:
  - Parse the input_string into input_sequence (a list of 12 integers).
  - Initialize output_sequence as a copy of input_sequence.
  - Extract control_value_1 from input_sequence[10].
  - Extract control_value_2 from input_sequence[11].
  - Identify contiguous blocks of '5's in input_sequence[0:10]. Store start and end (exclusive) indices for each block.
  - Count the number of identified blocks.
  - If one block exists (start_idx, end_idx), replace elements in output_sequence from start_idx to end_idx-1 with control_value_2.
  - If two blocks exist (block1=(start1, end1), block2=(start2, end2)), replace elements in output_sequence from start1 to end1-1 with control_value_1, and replace elements from start2 to end2-1 with control_value_2.
  - Return the final output_sequence.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers, called `input_sequence`.
3.  Create a copy of `input_sequence` called `output_sequence`.
4.  Get the first control value, `val1`, from `input_sequence` at index 10.
5.  Get the second control value, `val2`, from `input_sequence` at index 11.
6.  Find all contiguous blocks of the digit '5' within the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of `input_sequence`. Record the starting index and the ending index (exclusive) for each block found.
7.  Count the number of blocks found.
8.  If exactly one block was found (let its indices be `start` to `end`):
    *   Iterate from index `start` up to (but not including) index `end`.
    *   For each index `i` in this range, set `output_sequence[i]` to `val2`.
9.  If exactly two blocks were found (let the first be `start1` to `end1`, and the second be `start2` to `end2`):
    *   Iterate from index `start1` up to (but not including) index `end1`.
    *   For each index `i` in this range, set `output_sequence[i]` to `val1`.
    *   Iterate from index `start2` up to (but not including) index `end2`.
    *   For each index `j` in this range, set `output_sequence[j]` to `val2`.
10. Return the `output_sequence`.
