Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Digits:** The digit '5' in the input appears to be the primary target for transformation. The digits '0' seem to remain unchanged in the first 10 positions.
3.  **Control Values:** The last two digits of the input sequence (at indices 10 and 11) seem to act as control values dictating the replacement for the '5's. Let's call them `val1 = input[10]` and `val2 = input[11]`.
4.  **Positional Significance:** The transformation of '5's depends on their position within the sequence, specifically whether they form contiguous blocks.
5.  **Block Structure:** The '5's occur in contiguous blocks within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9). Examples show cases with one or two such blocks.
6.  **Transformation Rule:** The replacement value for a block of '5's depends on whether it's the first or second block encountered (reading left-to-right) and the control values (`val1`, `val2`).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of the digit '5' in the first 10 elements of a 12-element integer sequence based on the values of the last two elements.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
  - type: integer
    value: 5
    role: target_digit
    description: The digit within the first 10 elements that undergoes transformation.
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_1
    source: input[10]
    description: The 11th element, used as the replacement value for the first block of '5's (if two blocks exist).
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_2
    source: input[11]
    description: The 12th element, used as the replacement value for the second block of '5's (if two blocks exist) or the only block (if one block exists).
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence consisting only of the target_digit ('5') within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9).
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - Elements at indices 10 and 11 remain unchanged from input to output.
  - Elements != 5 at indices 0-9 remain unchanged.
  - Elements == 5 at indices 0-9 are replaced based on block membership and control values.
actions:
  - Identify contiguous blocks of '5's in input[0:10].
  - Count the number of identified blocks.
  - If one block exists, replace all '5's in that block with control_value_2.
  - If two blocks exist, replace all '5's in the first block (lower indices) with control_value_1 and all '5's in the second block (higher indices) with control_value_2.
  - Copy unchanged elements to the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Extract the first control value, `val1`, from the input sequence at index 10.
3.  Extract the second control value, `val2`, from the input sequence at index 11.
4.  Scan the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks composed entirely of the digit '5'. Store the start and end indices of each found block.
5.  Determine the number of '5'-blocks found.
6.  If one '5'-block was found, iterate through the indices covered by this block and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
7.  If two '5'-blocks were found, iterate through the indices covered by the first block (the one with the lower starting index) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val1`. Then, iterate through the indices covered by the second block (the one with the higher starting index) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
