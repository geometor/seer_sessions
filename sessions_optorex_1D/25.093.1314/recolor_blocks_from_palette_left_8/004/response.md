**General Assessment:**

The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was expecting a string input (which it would then `split`) but received a NumPy array instead. This is a simple input type mismatch. The underlying logic for identifying blocks of '5's and replacing them based on the control values at indices 10 and 11 seems consistent across the examples when simulated manually.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`). The core logic for finding blocks and applying replacements should remain the same.

**Gather Metrics:**

We will use the `find_five_blocks` helper function (assuming it works correctly with list/array input) to analyze each training example.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Re-define the block finding logic for direct list/array input
def find_five_blocks(sequence):
    blocks = []
    in_block = False
    start_index = -1
    # Iterate through the first 10 elements
    for i in range(10):
        if sequence[i] == 5 and not in_block:
            in_block = True
            start_index = i
        elif sequence[i] != 5 and in_block:
            in_block = False
            blocks.append((start_index, i))
            start_index = -1
    if in_block:
        blocks.append((start_index, 10))
    return blocks

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of the digit '5' in the first 10 elements of a 12-element integer sequence (provided as a list or NumPy array) based on the values of the last two elements.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
    format: list or numpy.ndarray # Corrected format
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
    format: list or numpy.ndarray
  - type: integer
    value: 5
    role: target_digit
    description: The digit within the first 10 elements that undergoes transformation.
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_1
    source: input[10]
    description: The 11th element (index 10), used as the replacement value for the first block of '5's if exactly two blocks exist.
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_2
    source: input[11]
    description: The 12th element (index 11), used as the replacement value for the second block of '5's (if two blocks exist) or the only block (if one block exists).
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence consisting only of the target_digit ('5') within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9).
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - Elements at indices 10 and 11 remain unchanged from input to output.
  - Elements != 5 at indices 0-9 remain unchanged.
  - Elements == 5 at indices 0-9 are replaced based on block membership and control values.
actions:
  - Receive the input sequence (list or NumPy array of 12 integers).
  - Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
  - Extract the first control value, `val1`, from the input sequence at index 10.
  - Extract the second control value, `val2`, from the input sequence at index 11.
  - Scan the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks composed entirely of the digit '5'. Store the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indices of each found block.
  - Count the number of '5'-blocks found.
  - If exactly one '5'-block was found, iterate through the indices covered by this block (from start to end-1) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
  - If exactly two '5'-blocks were found, iterate through the indices covered by the first block (lower indices) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val1`. Then, iterate through the indices covered by the second block (higher indices) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
  - If zero or more than two blocks are found, make no changes to the '5's (based on observed examples).
  - Return the modified output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence, which will become the output sequence.
3.  Identify the first control value, `val1`, as the element at index 10 of the input sequence.
4.  Identify the second control value, `val2`, as the element at index 11 of the input sequence.
5.  Find all contiguous blocks of the integer `5` occurring within the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the input sequence. Record the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) index for each block found.
6.  Count the total number of `5`-blocks identified.
7.  If the count is exactly 1:
    *   For the single identified block, replace every element within its index range in the output sequence with `val2`.
8.  If the count is exactly 2:
    *   For the first block (the one starting at a lower index), replace every element within its index range in the output sequence with `val1`.
    *   For the second block (the one starting at a higher index), replace every element within its index range in the output sequence with `val2`.
9.  (Implicitly) If the count is 0 or greater than 2, the `5`s remain unchanged as per the initial copy. Elements at indices 10 and 11, and non-`5` elements at indices 0-9, also remain unchanged from the initial copy.
10. Return the modified output sequence.
