task_description: Replace contiguous blocks of the digit '5' in the first 10 elements of a 12-element integer sequence (provided as a list or NumPy array) based on the values of the last two elements.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
    format: list or numpy.ndarray # Corrected format
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    length: 12
    dtype: integer
    format: list or numpy.ndarray
  - type: integer
    value: 5
    role: target_digit
    description: The digit within the first 10 elements that undergoes transformation.
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_1
    source: input[10]
    description: The 11th element (index 10), used as the replacement value for the first block of '5's if exactly two blocks exist.
  - type: integer
    role: control_value_2
    source: input[11]
    description: The 12th element (index 11), used as the replacement value for the second block of '5's (if two blocks exist) or the only block (if one block exists).
  - type: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence consisting only of the target_digit ('5') within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9).
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - Elements at indices 10 and 11 remain unchanged from input to output.
  - Elements != 5 at indices 0-9 remain unchanged.
  - Elements == 5 at indices 0-9 are replaced based on block membership and control values.
actions:
  - Receive the input sequence (list or NumPy array of 12 integers).
  - Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
  - Extract the first control value, `val1`, from the input sequence at index 10.
  - Extract the second control value, `val2`, from the input sequence at index 11.
  - Scan the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks composed entirely of the digit '5'. Store the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indices of each found block.
  - Count the number of '5'-blocks found.
  - If exactly one '5'-block was found, iterate through the indices covered by this block (from start to end-1) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
  - If exactly two '5'-blocks were found, iterate through the indices covered by the first block (lower indices) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val1`. Then, iterate through the indices covered by the second block (higher indices) and update the corresponding elements in the output sequence to `val2`.
  - If zero or more than two blocks are found, make no changes to the '5's (based on observed examples).
  - Return the modified output sequence.
