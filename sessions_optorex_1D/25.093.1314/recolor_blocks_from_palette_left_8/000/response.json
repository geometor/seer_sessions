The digits '0' seem to remain unchanged in the first 10 positions.\n3.  **Control Values:** The last two digits of the input sequence (at indices 10 and 11) seem to act as control values dictating the replacement for the '5's. Let's call them `val1 = input[10]` and `val2 = input[11]`.\n4.  **Positional Significance:** The transformation of '5's depends on their position within the sequence, specifically whether they form contiguous blocks.\n5.  **Block Structure:** The '5's occur in contiguous blocks within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9). Examples show cases with one or two such blocks.\n6.  **Transformation Rule:** The replacement value for a block of '5's depends on whether it's the first or second block encountered (reading left-to-right) and the control values (`val1`, `val2`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
