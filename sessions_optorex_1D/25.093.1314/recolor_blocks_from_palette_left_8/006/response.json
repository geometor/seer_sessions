            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message \"Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements\" occurred across all examples because the `transform` function was designed to accept a list or NumPy array, but it appears the raw input string (e.g., `\"0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 1 9\"`) was passed directly during testing. The function's internal logic for finding and replacing blocks of '5's was never reached due to this initial type mismatch and failed length check after an incorrect split attempt or direct length check on the string.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to first parse the input string into a list of 12 integers before applying the existing transformation logic. The core logic identified previously (finding blocks of '5's in the first 10 elements and replacing them based on the count and values at indices 10 and 11) seems correct based on the examples and should work once the input is correctly parsed.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the code failed during the input validation step for all examples due to the type mismatch, detailed metrics on the transformation logic itself cannot be gathered from the failed execution. However, based on manual re-evaluation of the logic against the examples (assuming correct parsing):\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a string of 12 space-separated integers.\n*   **Parsing Requirement:** The string must be split and converted into a list of 12 integers.\n*   **Block Finding:** The `find_five_blocks` logic correctly identifies the start and end indices of contiguous '5' blocks within the first 10 elements.\n    *   Example 1: Blocks `(1, 3)` and `(7, 9)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 2: Blocks `(2, 4)` and `(6, 8)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 3: Blocks `(1, 4)` and `(5, 8)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 4: Blocks `(0, 2)` and `(6, 8)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 5: Blocks `(1, 3)` and `(5, 7)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 6: Blocks `(3, 5)` and `(7, 9)` - Count: 2\n    *   Example 7: Block `(0, 2)` - Count: 1\n*   **Replacement Logic:**\n    *   If 1 block: Replace with `input[11]`. (Verified in Example 7)\n    *   If 2 blocks: Replace first block with `input[10]`, second block with `input[11]`. (Verified in Examples 1-6)\n*   **Expected Output Match:** The logic, when applied to correctly parsed input, produces the expected output for all provided training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
