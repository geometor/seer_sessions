**General Assessment:**

The error message "Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements" occurred across all examples because the `transform` function was designed to accept a list or NumPy array, but it appears the raw input string (e.g., `"0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 1 9"`) was passed directly during testing. The function's internal logic for finding and replacing blocks of '5's was never reached due to this initial type mismatch and failed length check after an incorrect split attempt or direct length check on the string.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to first parse the input string into a list of 12 integers before applying the existing transformation logic. The core logic identified previously (finding blocks of '5's in the first 10 elements and replacing them based on the count and values at indices 10 and 11) seems correct based on the examples and should work once the input is correctly parsed.

**Metrics:**

Since the code failed during the input validation step for all examples due to the type mismatch, detailed metrics on the transformation logic itself cannot be gathered from the failed execution. However, based on manual re-evaluation of the logic against the examples (assuming correct parsing):

*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a string of 12 space-separated integers.
*   **Parsing Requirement:** The string must be split and converted into a list of 12 integers.
*   **Block Finding:** The `find_five_blocks` logic correctly identifies the start and end indices of contiguous '5' blocks within the first 10 elements.
    *   Example 1: Blocks `(1, 3)` and `(7, 9)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 2: Blocks `(2, 4)` and `(6, 8)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 3: Blocks `(1, 4)` and `(5, 8)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 4: Blocks `(0, 2)` and `(6, 8)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 5: Blocks `(1, 3)` and `(5, 7)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 6: Blocks `(3, 5)` and `(7, 9)` - Count: 2
    *   Example 7: Block `(0, 2)` - Count: 1
*   **Replacement Logic:**
    *   If 1 block: Replace with `input[11]`. (Verified in Example 7)
    *   If 2 blocks: Replace first block with `input[10]`, second block with `input[11]`. (Verified in Examples 1-6)
*   **Expected Output Match:** The logic, when applied to correctly parsed input, produces the expected output for all provided training examples.

relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the primary_input sequence.
  - Elements at indices 10 and 11 remain unchanged from primary_input to output.
  - Elements != 5 at indices 0-9 remain unchanged.
  - Elements == 5 at indices 0-9 are replaced based on block membership and control values.
actions:
  - Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers (primary_input).
  - Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the primary_input sequence.
  - Extract control_value_1 from primary_input[10].
  - Extract control_value_2 from primary_input[11].
  - Identify contiguous blocks of '5's in primary_input[0:10].
  - Count the number of identified blocks.
  - If one block exists, replace all '5's in that block within the output sequence with control_value_2.
  - If two blocks exist, replace all '5's in the first block (lower indices) within the output sequence with control_value_1, and all '5's in the second block (higher indices) with control_value_2.
  - Return the modified output sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string: Split it by spaces and convert each part into an integer, creating a list of 12 integers. Let this be the `input_list`.
3.  Initialize an `output_list` as a direct copy of the `input_list`.
4.  Extract the first control value, `val1`, from `input_list` at index 10.
5.  Extract the second control value, `val2`, from `input_list` at index 11.
6.  Scan the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the `input_list` to identify all contiguous blocks composed entirely of the digit '5'. Record the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indices for each block found.
7.  Count the total number of '5'-blocks found.
8.  If exactly one '5'-block was found: Iterate through the indices covered by this block (from its start index up to, but not including, its end index) and update the corresponding elements in the `output_list` to `val2`.
9.  If exactly two '5'-blocks were found:
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by the first block (the one with the lower start index) and update the corresponding elements in the `output_list` to `val1`.
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by the second block (the one with the higher start index) and update the corresponding elements in the `output_list` to `val2`.
10. If zero or more than two '5'-blocks were found, make no changes based on the block-replacement rules (though this case is not present in the examples).
11. Return the final `output_list`.
