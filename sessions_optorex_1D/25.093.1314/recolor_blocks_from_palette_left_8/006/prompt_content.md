"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers. 
It identifies contiguous blocks of the digit '5' within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9). 
If exactly one block is found, all '5's in that block are replaced with the value 
from the input sequence at index 11. If exactly two blocks are found, the '5's in 
the first block (lower indices) are replaced with the value from index 10, and 
the '5's in the second block (higher indices) are replaced with the value from index 11. 
Elements other than '5' in the first 10 positions, and the elements at indices 10 and 11, 
remain unchanged. The function returns the modified sequence as a list.
