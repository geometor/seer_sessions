# Re-reading the examples and description...
# Example 1: input: 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5 -> output: 0 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5.  My code would replace the second block (5 5 5 at index 5) with 5. This doesn't match.
# Example 5: input: 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 7 -> output: 0 5 5 5 0 7 7 7 0 0 5 7. My code would replace the first block (5 5 5 at index 1) with 5. This doesn't match.
# Example 7: input: 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 3 8 -> output: 3 3 3 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 3 8. My code replaces correctly here.

# Ah, I see the discrepancy. My initial interpretation was slightly off.
# The NL program:
# 5a. Take the first block identified (the one with the smallest starting index). Replace every element within this first block in the output sequence with val1.
# 6a. Take the second block identified (the one with the second smallest starting index). Replace every element within this second block in the output sequence with val2.
# This is what the code does. Let's re-check the examples against this logic.

# train_1: input: 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5
#   val1=8, val2=5
#   Blocks of 5: (1, 4), (5, 8)
#   Replace block (1, 4) with 8 -> 0 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5
#   Replace block (5, 8) with 5 -> 0 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5
#   Output: 0 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5.  This *matches* the desired output `0 8 8 8 0 5 5 5 0 0 8 5`. Okay, my previous re-read was confused.

# train_2: input: 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 3 5
#   val1=3, val2=5
#   Blocks of 5: (2, 4), (6, 8)

It seems the initial code implementation was correct according to the NL program and the examples provided. The confusion was during my manual re-checking. The code should work as intended.
