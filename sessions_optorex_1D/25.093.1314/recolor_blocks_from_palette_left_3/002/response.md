*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The primary issue reported is a `syntax error` during the execution attempt. This prevented the evaluation of the transformation logic against the training and test sets.
    *   A manual re-analysis of all 7 training examples confirms that the logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented (conceptually) in the previous Python code accurately maps the input to the output for all provided cases.
    *   The transformation involves identifying up to two contiguous blocks of the integer `5` within the first 10 elements of the input sequence and replacing them sequentially with the values found at indices 10 and 11 of the input sequence.
    *   The strategy is to refine the natural language program and YAML facts for maximum clarity and ensure the next phase (coder) provides syntactically correct code implementing this confirmed logic.

*   **Metrics from Analysis:**
    *   Number of training examples provided: 7
    *   Input sequence length: 12 integers
    *   Output sequence length: 12 integers
    *   Target value for replacement: 5
    *   Indices sourcing replacement values: 10 (for 1st block), 11 (for 2nd block)
    *   Index range for replacement action: 0 through 9 (first 10 elements)
    *   Number of blocks replaced: Maximum of 2 (the first two found chronologically).
    *   Consistency: The rule appears consistent across all 7 examples. No contradictions were found during manual verification.

*   **YAML Facts:**

        inputs: 
          - input_sequence

      - name: replace_block_elements
        inputs:
          - sequence_to_modify
          - block_indices (start, end)
          - replacement_value
        outputs:
          - modified_sequence
        description: Replaces elements within the specified index range [start, end) of the sequence with the replacement_value.
    relationships:
      - The elements at indices 10 and 11 of the input_sequence are used as replacement values and remain unchanged in the output_sequence.
      - Replacements are confined to the segment of the sequence from index 0 up to (but not including) index 10.
      - The first block identified by `find_contiguous_blocks` is replaced using `replacement_value_1`.
      - The second block identified by `find_contiguous_blocks` (if it exists) is replaced using `replacement_value_2`.
      - If fewer than two blocks are found, only the existing blocks are replaced (0 or 1 replacements occur).
      - Elements within the modification range that are not part of the first two blocks of `target_value` remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept an input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the working output sequence.
    3.  Identify the first replacement value (`val1`) from the element at index 10 of the input sequence.
    4.  Identify the second replacement value (`val2`) from the element at index 11 of the input sequence.
    5.  Scan the output sequence from index 0 up to (but not including) index 10 to find all contiguous blocks consisting solely of the integer `5`. Record the start and end (exclusive) indices for each block found, maintaining the order in which they appear.
    6.  If one or more blocks were found:
        a.  Select the first block found (the one with the lowest start index).
        b.  Replace all elements within this first block's index range in the output sequence with `val1`.
    7.  If two or more blocks were found:
        a.  Select the second block found (the one with the second lowest start index).
        b.  Replace all elements within this second block's index range in the output sequence with `val2`.
    8.  Return the modified output sequence.
