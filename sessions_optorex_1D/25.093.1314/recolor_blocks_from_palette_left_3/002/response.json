            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The primary issue reported is a `syntax error` during the execution attempt. This prevented the evaluation of the transformation logic against the training and test sets.\n    *   A manual re-analysis of all 7 training examples confirms that the logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented (conceptually) in the previous Python code accurately maps the input to the output for all provided cases.\n    *   The transformation involves identifying up to two contiguous blocks of the integer `5` within the first 10 elements of the input sequence and replacing them sequentially with the values found at indices 10 and 11 of the input sequence.\n    *   The strategy is to refine the natural language program and YAML facts for maximum clarity and ensure the next phase (coder) provides syntactically correct code implementing this confirmed logic.\n\n*   **Metrics from Analysis:**\n    *   Number of training examples provided: 7\n    *   Input sequence length: 12 integers\n    *   Output sequence length: 12 integers\n    *   Target value for replacement: 5\n    *   Indices sourcing replacement values: 10 (for 1st block), 11 (for 2nd block)\n    *   Index range for replacement action: 0 through 9 (first 10 elements)\n    *   Number of blocks replaced: Maximum of 2 (the first two found chronologically).\n    *   Consistency: The rule appears consistent across all 7 examples. No contradictions were found during manual verification.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
