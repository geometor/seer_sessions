"""
Transforms an input sequence (list) of 12 integers. It identifies the first two 
contiguous blocks of the integer '5' within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9). 
The first block found is replaced element-wise by the value at index 10 of the 
input sequence. The second block found (if any) is replaced element-wise by the 
value at index 11 of the input sequence. Elements outside these blocks or outside 
the first 10 indices remain unchanged, including the values at indices 10 and 11.

    Finds contiguous blocks of the target value within the specified length of the sequence.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a block and contains
        the (start_index, end_index_exclusive) of the block. Blocks are ordered
