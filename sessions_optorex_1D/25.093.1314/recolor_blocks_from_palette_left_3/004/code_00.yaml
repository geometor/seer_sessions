task_description: >
  Transforms a sequence of 12 integers by replacing the first two contiguous 
  blocks of the target value '5' found within the first 10 elements. 
  The replacement values are taken from the last two elements of the sequence.
input_elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    length: 12
    description: The source sequence containing numbers, potentially including the target value and the replacement values.
output_elements:
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    length: 12
    description: >
      The transformed sequence. It is a copy of the input_sequence, modified 
      by replacing elements within identified target blocks.
constants:
  - name: target_value
    value: 5
    description: The integer value whose contiguous blocks are sought for replacement.
  - name: sequence_length
    value: 12
    description: The required length of the input and output sequences.
  - name: modification_range_length
    value: 10
    description: >
      The number of elements from the start of the sequence (indices 0-9) 
      within which blocks are identified and replaced.
  - name: replacement_value_1_index
    value: 10
    description: The index in the input_sequence holding the value used for the first block replacement.
  - name: replacement_value_2_index
    value: 11
    description: The index in the input_sequence holding the value used for the second block replacement.
derived_values:
  - name: replacement_value_1
    source: input_sequence[replacement_value_1_index]
    description: The actual value used to replace elements in the first identified block.
  - name: replacement_value_2
    source: input_sequence[replacement_value_2_index]
    description: The actual value used to replace elements in the second identified block.
actions:
  - name: find_contiguous_target_blocks
    input: 
      - sequence (first modification_range_length elements)
      - target_value
    output: 
      - list_of_blocks: A list containing tuples `(start_index, end_index_exclusive)` for each found block, ordered by start_index.
    description: >
      Scans the initial part of the sequence (up to modification_range_length) 
      and identifies the start and end indices of all contiguous runs of the target_value.
  - name: replace_elements_in_block
    input:
      - sequence (mutable copy)
      - block_indices (start_index, end_index_exclusive)
      - replacement_value
    output: 
      - modified_sequence
    description: >
      Iterates from the block's start_index up to (but not including) the 
      end_index_exclusive and sets each element in the sequence to the replacement_value.
relationships:
  - The transformation operates on a copy of the input sequence.
  - Replacements only occur within the first `modification_range_length` elements.
  - Elements at indices `replacement_value_1_index` and `replacement_value_2_index` are used *as* replacement values but are *not* modified themselves in the output sequence.
  - If zero blocks are found, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
  - If one block is found, only `replacement_value_1` is used for replacement.
  - If two or more blocks are found, the first block (by start index) is replaced using `replacement_value_1`, and the second block (by start index) is replaced using `replacement_value_2`. Subsequent blocks (third, fourth, etc.) are not modified.
