Let's call them `val1` and `val2`, respectively.\n    *   The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of the target value (`5`) within the first 10 elements.\n    *   The *first* such block found is replaced using `val1`.\n    *   The *second* such block found is replaced using `val2`.\n    *   If only one block of `5`s exists, it is treated as the first block and replaced with `val1`.\n    *   If no blocks of `5`s exist, or if only one block exists and a second replacement is attempted, no further changes occur for that specific replacement step.\n    *   The last two elements of the sequence remain unchanged in the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
