*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 12 integers.
    *   The core operation involves identifying and replacing specific values within the sequence.
    *   The value `5` appears to be the target value for replacement within the initial part of the sequence (first 10 elements).
    *   The last two elements of the input sequence (at index 10 and 11) act as replacement values. Let's call them `val1` and `val2`, respectively.
    *   The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of the target value (`5`) within the first 10 elements.
    *   The *first* such block found is replaced using `val1`.
    *   The *second* such block found is replaced using `val2`.
    *   If only one block of `5`s exists, it is treated as the first block and replaced with `val1`.
    *   If no blocks of `5`s exist, or if only one block exists and a second replacement is attempted, no further changes occur for that specific replacement step.
    *   The last two elements of the sequence remain unchanged in the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Replace blocks of a specific target value within a sequence using values derived from the end of the sequence.
    input_elements:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list of integers
        length: 12
        properties: Contains numbers, potentially including blocks of the target value and the replacement values.
    output_elements:
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list of integers
        length: 12
        properties: Derived from input_sequence by replacing target blocks.
    constants:
      - name: target_value
        value: 5
        description: The integer value to be replaced in blocks.
      - name: sequence_prefix_length
        value: 10
        description: The length of the initial part of the sequence where replacements occur.
    derived_values:
      - name: replacement_value_1
        source: input_sequence[10]
        description: The value used to replace the first block of target_value.
      - name: replacement_value_2
        source: input_sequence[11]
        description: The value used to replace the second block of target_value.
    actions:
      - name: identify_blocks
        input: input_sequence (first 10 elements), target_value
        output: List of start and end indices for contiguous blocks of target_value.
        description: Finds consecutive occurrences of the target_value.
      - name: replace_block
        input: sequence, block_indices, replacement_value
        output: modified_sequence
        description: Replaces the elements within the specified block indices with the replacement_value.
    relationships:
      - The last two elements of the input_sequence determine the replacement values.
      - Replacements only happen within the first 10 elements of the input_sequence.
      - The first identified block of target_value is replaced by replacement_value_1.
      - The second identified block of target_value is replaced by replacement_value_2.
      - Elements not part of the identified blocks or outside the first 10 positions remain unchanged relative to the input (unless they were part of a block that got replaced).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the two replacement values: `val1` is the element at index 10, and `val2` is the element at index 11.
    3.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
    4.  Scan the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the sequence to find contiguous blocks where all elements are equal to `5`. Keep track of the start and end indices of these blocks.
    5.  If at least one block of `5`s is found:
        a.  Take the first block identified (the one with the smallest starting index).
        b.  Replace every element within this first block in the output sequence with `val1`.
    6.  If at least two blocks of `5`s are found:
        a.  Take the second block identified (the one with the second smallest starting index).
        b.  Replace every element within this second block in the output sequence with `val2`.
    7.  Return the modified output sequence.
