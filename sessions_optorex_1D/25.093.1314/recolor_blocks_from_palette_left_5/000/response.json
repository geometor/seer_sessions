Let's call the value at index 10 `R1` and the value at index 11 `R2`.\n*   **Structure:** The transformation focuses on contiguous blocks (or groups) of the number '5' within the first 10 elements of the sequence.\n*   **Action:** The core action is replacing these blocks of '5's with either `R1` or `R2` based on specific rules. Other numbers, including the control values `R1` and `R2` themselves, remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
