Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.
*   **Key Value:** The integer '5' appears to be the primary target for modification within the main part of the sequence.
*   **Control Values:** The last two integers in the input sequence (at indices 10 and 11) seem to act as control values or replacement sources. Let's call the value at index 10 `R1` and the value at index 11 `R2`.
*   **Structure:** The transformation focuses on contiguous blocks (or groups) of the number '5' within the first 10 elements of the sequence.
*   **Action:** The core action is replacing these blocks of '5's with either `R1` or `R2` based on specific rules. Other numbers, including the control values `R1` and `R2` themselves, remain unchanged in their positions.

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: copy_unmodified
    description: "Elements in the input sequence that are not part of the identified blocks of 5s (within indices 0-9), and elements at indices 10 and 11, are copied directly to the output sequence."
relationships:
  - "The replacement values R1 and R2 are determined by the last two elements of the input."
  - "The specific replacement logic (using R1 or R2) depends on the number and order of the blocks of 5s found in the first 10 elements."
  - "The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by selectively applying replacements to blocks of 5s."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence; this will become the output sequence.
2.  Identify the first replacement value (`R1`) as the element at index 10 of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the second replacement value (`R2`) as the element at index 11 of the input sequence.
4.  Scan the input sequence from index 0 up to (but not including) index 10 to locate all contiguous blocks consisting solely of the number '5'. Record the start and end indices for each block found.
5.  Count how many such blocks were found.
6.  If exactly one block of '5's was found, iterate through the indices of that block (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) and update the value at each corresponding index in the output sequence to `R2`.
7.  If exactly two blocks of '5's were found:
    a.  Iterate through the indices of the *first* block found and update the value at each corresponding index in the output sequence to `R1`.
    b.  Iterate through the indices of the *second* block found and update the value at each corresponding index in the output sequence to `R2`.
8.  Leave all other elements in the output sequence (those not part of the identified blocks of '5's, and the elements at indices 10 and 11) unchanged from their original values in the input sequence.
9.  Return the final output sequence.
