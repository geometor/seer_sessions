    description: "Find all contiguous blocks of the target_value (5) within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9) of the input sequence."

    description: "Count the number of blocks identified."

  - name: replace_double_block
    condition: "count_blocks == 2"
    description: "Replace all elements within the first identified block with replacement_value_1 (R1) and all elements within the second identified block with replacement_value_2 (R2) in the output sequence."
  - name: copy_unmodified
    description: "Elements in the input sequence that are not part of the identified blocks of 5s (within indices 0-9), and elements at indices 10 and 11, are copied directly to the output sequence."
relationships:
  - "The replacement values R1 and R2 are determined by the last two elements of the input."
  - "The specific replacement logic (using R1 or R2) depends on the number and order of the blocks of 5s found in the first 10 elements."
  - "The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by selectively applying replacements to blocks of 5s."
