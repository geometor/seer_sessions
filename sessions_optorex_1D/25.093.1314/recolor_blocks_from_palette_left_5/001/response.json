Find all contiguous blocks of the number 5 within the first 10 elements (indices 0-9) of the input sequence.\n3. If exactly one block of 5s is found, replace all the 5s within that block with the value R2.\n4. If exactly two blocks of 5s are found, replace all the 5s in the first block with R1 and all the 5s in the second block with R2.\n5.
