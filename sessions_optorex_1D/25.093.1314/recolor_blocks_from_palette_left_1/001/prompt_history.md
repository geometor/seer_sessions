*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The transformation primarily affects a subset of the digits in the input sequence, leaving others (like zeros) unchanged.
    *   The last few digits of the input sequence play a special role, acting as parameters or replacement values for the transformation.
    *   The core operation involves identifying a specific "target" digit within the main part of the sequence and replacing its occurrences based on the trailing parameter digits.
    *   The target digit appears to be the most frequent non-zero digit in the sequence, excluding the trailing parameters.
    *   Occurrences of the target digit are grouped into "blocks" separated by zeros.
    *   The replacement uses the trailing parameter digits sequentially, one for each block of the target digit.

        output: output_sequence (concatenation)
    relationships:
      - The number of parameter_digits is equal to the number of target_digit_blocks (k).
      - Zeros in the main_sequence act as separators for target_digit_blocks and remain unchanged in the output.
      - The final output sequence is formed by concatenating the transformed_main_sequence and the original parameter_digits.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
    2.  Define a procedure to identify the target digit: Find the most frequent non-zero digit within a given sequence segment. If there are no non-zero digits, there is no target. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the smallest digit.
    3.  Define a procedure to count blocks: Given a sequence segment and a target digit, count how many groups of consecutive target digits exist, where groups are separated by one or more zeros. Let this count be `k`.
    4.  *Initial Guess & Refinement for k:* Temporarily assume a likely number of parameter digits (e.g., 2 or 3 based on examples) or iterate. A more robust approach: Identify a potential target digit based on the whole sequence first (excluding maybe the last 2 or 3). Then count its blocks in the sequence excluding the potential parameters corresponding to that block count. Confirm consistency. (Alternative: The coder phase might implement this iteratively or by first calculating the target and blocks on a tentative main sequence). The most direct way based on observations:
        a.  Assume a maximum possible `k` (e.g., length/2 or a smaller constant like 5).
        b.  Iterate `k` downwards from the maximum guess.
        c.  For a given `k`, define the potential `main_sequence` (input excluding last `k` digits) and `parameter_digits` (last `k` digits).
        d.  Identify the `target_digit` in the `main_sequence`.
        e.  Count the `blocks` of the `target_digit` in the `main_sequence`.
        f.  If the `count of blocks` equals `k`, then this `k` is correct. Stop iterating.
    5.  Once `k` is determined, finalize the `main_sequence` (input digits up to index `length - k - 1`) and the `parameter_digits` (input digits from index `length - k` to the end).
    6.  Identify the `target_digit` within the final `main_sequence`.
    7.  Create a new list for the transformed main sequence, initially empty.
    8.  Initialize a block counter `block_index` to 0.
    9.  Initialize a flag `currently_in_target_block` to false.
    10. Iterate through the `main_sequence` digit by digit:
        a.  If the current digit is the `target_digit`:
            i.  If `currently_in_target_block` is false, increment `block_index` by 1 and set `currently_in_target_block` to true.
            ii. Append the `parameter_digits[block_index - 1]` to the transformed sequence.
        b.  If the current digit is 0:
            i.  Set `currently_in_target_block` to false.
            ii. Append 0 to the transformed sequence.
        c.  If the current digit is non-zero but not the `target_digit`:
            i.  Set `currently_in_target_block` to false. (This ensures only zeros truly separate blocks of the target digit).
            ii. Append the current digit unchanged to the transformed sequence.
    11. Concatenate the `transformed_main_sequence` list and the `parameter_digits` list.
    12. Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the final output.
