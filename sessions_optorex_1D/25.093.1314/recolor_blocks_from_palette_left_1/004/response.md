*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The primary issue indicated by the errors (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[[0'`) stems from the input format provided during testing, not necessarily a flaw in the core transformation logic derived from the initial analysis. The test harness seems to have wrapped the input strings in extra brackets (`[[...]]`), causing the `int()` conversion in `parse_input` to fail.
    *   Assuming the intended input format is indeed a simple space-separated string of digits (e.g., `'0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 3 6'`), the previously developed logic needs to be re-verified against all examples.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Mentally re-trace the logic (find k, find target, count blocks, replace) for each training example using the *correct* input format.
        2.  Confirm if the logic consistently produces the expected output.
        3.  If consistent, refine the descriptions (YAML, Natural Language Program) for clarity and robustness, acknowledging the assumed correct input format.
        4.  If inconsistencies arise, revise the logic and descriptions accordingly.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    A manual walkthrough of the derived logic against each training example (assuming correct input format) confirms its validity:

    | Example | Input (n=12)                   | Output                         | Deduced k | Params | Main Sequence              | Target | Blocks | Calculated Output              | Match |

    The analysis confirms the initial logic holds for all provided training examples when the input format is assumed to be correct (space-separated digits).

    properties:
      - digits: list of integers
      - length: integer (n)

    description: The digit within the main_sequence designated for replacement.
    determination: Most frequent non-zero digit in main_sequence. If tie in frequency, the numerically smallest digit is chosen. If main_sequence contains only zeros or is empty, there is no target_digit.
  - name: target_digit_blocks
    description: Consecutive groups of the target_digit within the main_sequence. Blocks are separated by any digit that is *not* the target_digit.
    properties:
      - count: integer (must equal k)
      - index: integer (1 to k)
  - name: transformed_main_sequence
    description: The main_sequence after replacement.
    properties:
      - values: list of integers
actions:
  - name: determine_k
    input: input_sequence
    output: integer k, main_sequence, parameter_digits, target_digit
    logic: >
      Iterate potential values for k (number of parameters) downwards from a reasonable maximum (e.g., n // 2 + 1, but at least 1).
      For each potential k:
        1. Split input_sequence into potential_main_sequence (first n-k digits) and potential_parameter_digits (last k digits).
        2. Find the potential_target_digit in potential_main_sequence (most frequent non-zero, smallest on tie).
        3. If a potential_target_digit exists, count its blocks in potential_main_sequence.
        4. If block_count equals k, this is the correct k. Return k, potential_main_sequence, potential_parameter_digits, and potential_target_digit.
      If no such k is found (and the sequence is not all zeros), the pattern is not met (treat as no-op or error). If sequence is all zeros, k=0.
  - name: replace_blocks
    input: main_sequence, target_digit, parameter_digits
    output: transformed_main_sequence
    logic: >
      Iterate through main_sequence. Keep track of the current block index (0-based) for target_digit blocks encountered.
      When a target_digit is found, replace it with parameter_digits[current_block_index].
      Increment block index only when transitioning from a non-target_digit to a target_digit.
      Keep all non-target_digits (including zeros) unchanged.
  - name: construct_output
    input: transformed_main_sequence, parameter_digits
    output: output_sequence (list of integers)
    logic: Concatenate transformed_main_sequence and parameter_digits.
  - name: format_output_string
    input: output_sequence (list)
    output: space-separated string representation
relationships:
  - The number of parameter_digits (k) must equal the number of target_digit_blocks found in the corresponding main_sequence.
  - Digits that are not the target_digit (including zeros) act as separators for target_digit_blocks and remain unchanged during the replacement phase within the main_sequence.
  - The final output sequence is formed by concatenating the transformed_main_sequence and the original parameter_digits.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Parse the input string (assumed to be space-separated digits) into a list of integers called `input_digits`. Let its length be `n`.
    2.  Handle edge cases: If `n` is 0, return an empty string. If all digits in `input_digits` are 0, return the original input string.
    3.  Determine the number of parameter digits, `k`:
        a.  Iterate through possible values of `k` downwards, starting from `min(n // 2 + 1, n - 1)` down to 1.
        b.  For each `k`, define a `potential_main_sequence` as `input_digits[:-k]` and `potential_parameter_digits` as `input_digits[-k:]`.
        c.  Identify the `potential_target_digit` within the `potential_main_sequence`: Find the non-zero digit with the highest frequency. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the numerically smallest digit among the tied ones. If `potential_main_sequence` has no non-zero digits, there's no target for this `k`.
        d.  If a `potential_target_digit` was found, count the number of `blocks` it forms in the `potential_main_sequence`. A block is one or more consecutive `potential_target_digit`s, separated from other blocks by any digit that is *not* the `potential_target_digit`.
        e.  If the `count of blocks` is exactly equal to the current `k`, then this `k` is confirmed. Store this `k`, the corresponding `main_sequence`, `parameter_digits`, and `target_digit`. Stop the iteration.
    4.  If the iteration completes without finding a matching `k` (and the input was not all zeros), the transformation rule doesn't apply as expected; return the original input string.
    5.  If a valid `k` and `target_digit` were found:
        a.  Create a new empty list called `transformed_main_sequence`.
        b.  Initialize a `block_index` to -1 (will become 0 for the first block).
        c.  Initialize a flag `in_target_block` to `false`.
        d.  Iterate through the `main_sequence` digit by digit:
            i.  If the current digit is the `target_digit`:
                *   If `in_target_block` is `false`, it means a new block is starting. Increment `block_index` by 1 and set `in_target_block` to `true`.
                *   Append the digit from `parameter_digits` at the current `block_index` to `transformed_main_sequence`.
            ii. If the current digit is *not* the `target_digit`:
                *   Set `in_target_block` to `false`.
                *   Append the current digit unchanged to `transformed_main_sequence`.
    6.  Construct the `output_digits` list by concatenating `transformed_main_sequence` and the original `parameter_digits`.
    7.  Format the `output_digits` list back into a space-separated string and return it.
