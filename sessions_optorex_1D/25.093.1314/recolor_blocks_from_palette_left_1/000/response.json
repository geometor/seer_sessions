Define a procedure to identify the target digit: Find the most frequent non-zero digit within a given sequence segment. If there are no non-zero digits, there is no target. If there's a tie in frequency, choose the smallest digit.\n    3.  Define a procedure to count blocks: Given a sequence segment and a target digit, count how many groups of consecutive target digits exist, where groups are separated by one or more zeros. Let this count be `k`.\n    4.  *Initial Guess & Refinement for k:* Temporarily assume a likely number of parameter digits (e.g., 2 or 3 based on examples) or iterate. A more robust approach: Identify a potential target digit based on the whole sequence first (excluding maybe the last 2 or 3). Then count its blocks in the sequence excluding the potential parameters corresponding to that block count. Confirm consistency. (Alternative: The coder phase might implement this iteratively or by first calculating the target and blocks on a tentative main sequence). The most direct way based on observations:\n        a.  Assume a maximum possible `k` (e.g., length/2 or a smaller constant like 5).\n        b.  Iterate `k` downwards from the maximum guess.\n        c.  For a given `k`, define the potential `main_sequence` (input excluding last `k` digits) and `parameter_digits` (last `k` digits).\n        d.  Identify the `target_digit` in the `main_sequence`.\n        e.  Count the `blocks` of the `target_digit` in the `main_sequence`.\n        f.  If the `count of blocks` equals `k`, then this `k` is correct. Stop iterating.\n    5.  Once `k` is determined, finalize the `main_sequence` (input digits up to index `length - k - 1`) and the `parameter_digits` (input digits from index `length - k` to the end).\n    6.  Identify the `target_digit` within the final `main_sequence`.\n    7.  Create a new list for the transformed main sequence, initially empty.\n    8.  Initialize a block counter `block_index` to 0.\n    9.  Initialize a flag `currently_in_target_block` to false.\n    10. Iterate through the `main_sequence` digit by digit:\n        a.  If the current digit is the `target_digit`:\n            i.  If `currently_in_target_block` is false, increment `block_index` by 1 and set `currently_in_target_block` to true.\n            ii. Append the `parameter_digits[block_index - 1]` to the transformed sequence.\n        b.  If the current digit is 0:\n            i.  Set `currently_in_target_block` to false.\n            ii. Append 0 to the transformed sequence.\n        c.  If the current digit is non-zero but not the `target_digit`:\n            i.  Set `currently_in_target_block` to false. (This ensures only zeros truly separate blocks of the target digit).\n            ii. Append the current digit unchanged to the transformed sequence.\n    11. Concatenate the `transformed_main_sequence` list and the `parameter_digits` list.\n    12. Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the final output."
