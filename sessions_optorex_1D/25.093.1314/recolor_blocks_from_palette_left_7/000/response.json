Observing the frequency of digits in the first 10 positions of the inputs, '5' is consistently the most frequent non-zero digit. This suggests the target digit is determined by frequency analysis.\n5.  **Replacement Values:** The values used for replacement seem to be derived from the control digits and any other non-zero digits present in the main sequence (excluding the target digit itself).\n6.  **Group-Based Replacement:** The replacement doesn't apply uniformly to all target digits. Instead, consecutive occurrences (groups) of the target digit are treated as units. Each group is replaced entirely by a single value from a derived sequence of replacement values.\n7.  **Replacement Sequence:** The sequence of replacement values appears to be constructed from:\n    *   Any non-zero digits in the first 10 positions *other than* the target digit. (In the examples, there's at most one such digit, '9' in train_1). If there are multiple, their order might matter (e.g., sorted or order of appearance). Given only one example, let's assume they form the start of the sequence.\n    *   The 11th digit (first control digit), if it's non-zero.\n    *   The 12th digit (second control digit), if it's non-zero.\n    *   These values are used cyclically for subsequent groups of the target digit.\n8.  **Constants:** Digits in the main sequence that are *not* the target digit, and the two control digits themselves, remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Separate the list into the `main_sequence` (first 10 digits) and the `control_digits` (last 2 digits, `c1` and `c2`).\n3.  Analyze the `main_sequence` to find the `target_digit` (T), which is the non-zero digit appearing most frequently. (Assume a unique most frequent digit exists).\n4.  Identify the set of `other_digits` (O), containing unique non-zero digits from the `main_sequence` that are not equal to T.\n5.  Construct the ordered list of `replacement_values` (R): Start with the sorted list of `other_digits`, then append `c1` if it's not zero, and finally append `c2` if it's not zero.\n6.  Create a copy of the original 12-digit list to serve as the `output_sequence`.\n7.  Initialize a `replacement_index` to 0.\n8.  Iterate through the `main_sequence` using an index `i` from 0 to 9.\n9.  If the digit at `main_sequence[i]` is the `target_digit` (T):\n    a.  This marks the beginning of a potential group of target digits.\n    b.  Select the next replacement value from the `replacement_values` list `R` using the current `replacement_index` (modulo the length of `R`). Store this value as `current_replacement`.\n    c.

Increment index `i`.\n    d.  Increment the `replacement_index`.\n    e.  Decrement index `i` by 1 (to counteract the extra increment from the inner loop and the outer loop's next increment).\n10. If the digit is not the `target_digit`, leave the corresponding digit in `output_sequence` unchanged.\n11. Continue iterating until the end of the `main_sequence` is reached.\n12.
