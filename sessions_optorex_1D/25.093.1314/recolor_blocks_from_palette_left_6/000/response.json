Let's call them `param1` and `param2`, respectively. These parameters are also copied directly to the last two positions of the output.\n    *   The replacement logic depends on how the `5`s are grouped or clustered within the first 10 positions. Specifically, it depends on identifying connected components (or \"blobs\") of adjacent `5`s.\n    *   If there are exactly two distinct components of `5`s, the `5`s in the first component (based on starting index) are replaced by `param1`, and the `5`s in the second component are replaced by `param2`.\n    *   If there is only one component of `5`s, or no `5`s at all, no replacement occurs in the first 10 positions; the original digits (including the `5`s) are retained.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
