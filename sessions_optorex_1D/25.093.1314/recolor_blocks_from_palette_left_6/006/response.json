            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial code failed because it assumed the input was a string, while the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this type mismatch. The core transformation logic, which involves identifying connected components of the digit `5` in the first 10 elements and replacing them based on the last two elements (parameters) only when exactly two components exist, appears sound based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays as input and likely output, removing the string parsing/formatting steps and adjusting the function signature and return type.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Assumed `str`, Actual `numpy.ndarray` (for all 7 training examples).\n    *   **Output Type:** Assumed `str`, Expected `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from input type).\n    *   **Parsing Failure:** 100% (7 out of 7 examples failed due to incorrect input type handling).\n    *   **Logic Validation (Manual):** The underlying logic (component finding and conditional replacement) seems to correctly predict the output for all 7 training examples when the correct input processing is assumed.\n        *   Examples 1-6: Input has two components of `5`s; replacement occurs using `param1` and `param2`. Manual check confirms the outputs match.\n        *   Example 7: Input has one component of `5`s; no replacement occurs. Manual check confirms the output matches.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
