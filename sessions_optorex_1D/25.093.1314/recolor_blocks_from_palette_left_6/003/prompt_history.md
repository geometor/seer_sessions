*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The core task involves selectively replacing occurrences of the digit `5` within the first 10 positions of the sequence.
    *   The digits `0` act as a background or neutral value, remaining unchanged in the output.
    *   The last two digits of the input sequence (at indices 10 and 11) serve as parameters that determine the replacement values. Let's call them `param1` and `param2`, respectively. These parameters are also copied directly to the last two positions of the output.
    *   The replacement logic depends on how the `5`s are grouped or clustered within the first 10 positions. Specifically, it depends on identifying connected components (or "blobs") of adjacent `5`s.
    *   If there are exactly two distinct components of `5`s, the `5`s in the first component (based on starting index) are replaced by `param1`, and the `5`s in the second component are replaced by `param2`.
    *   If there is only one component of `5`s, or no `5`s at all, no replacement occurs in the first 10 positions; the original digits (including the `5`s) are retained.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the first parameter (`param1`) as the integer at index 10 and the second parameter (`param2`) as the integer at index 11.
    3.  Create a working copy of the input list to serve as the initial output list.
    4.  Examine the first 10 elements (indices 0 through 9) of the list. Find all groups of connected `5`s, where connection means being horizontally adjacent (e.g., `5` at index `i` is connected to `5` at index `i+1`). Each such group is a "component".
    5.  Count how many distinct components of `5`s were found.
    6.  If exactly two components were found:
        a.  Identify the component that starts at the lower index (the "first" component).
        b.  Identify the component that starts at the higher index (the "second" component).
        c.  For each index within the first component, change the value in the output list at that index to `param1`.
        d.  For each index within the second component, change the value in the output list at that index to `param2`.
    7.  If the number of components found was not exactly two (i.e., zero or one), do not make any changes to the first 10 elements of the output list (they remain as they were in the input).
    8.  Ensure the last two elements (indices 10 and 11) of the output list are `param1` and `param2` (they should already be, due to copying the input initially).
    9.  Convert the final output list back into a string of space-separated integers.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input format (string) and the actual input format (likely a list or NumPy array) provided during testing. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred because the `_parse_input` function attempted string manipulation on a non-string object. The core transformation logic (identifying components of '5's in the first 10 elements and replacing them with the last two elements if exactly two components exist) appears sound based on a manual re-evaluation of the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to accept the input as a list/array of integers directly, removing the unnecessary string parsing step (`_parse_input`) and adjusting subsequent functions accordingly.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Due to the immediate failure caused by the input type mismatch, the code could not execute the core logic. Therefore, metrics related to component identification or replacement accuracy cannot be gathered from the failed execution. However, a manual review confirms the following structure across all examples:
    *   Input/Output Structure: 12 integers.
    *   Data Segment: First 10 integers (indices 0-9).
    *   Parameters: Last 2 integers (indices 10, 11).
    *   Target Value for Replacement: 5.
    *   Condition for Replacement: Exactly two connected components of 5s in the data segment.
    *   Replacement Rule: First component -> param1 (index 10), Second component -> param2 (index 11).
    *   No Replacement Cases: 0 or 1 component of 5s (Example 7).
