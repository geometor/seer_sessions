            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input format (string) and the actual input format (likely a list or NumPy array) provided during testing. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred because the `_parse_input` function attempted string manipulation on a non-string object. The core transformation logic (identifying components of '5's in the first 10 elements and replacing them with the last two elements if exactly two components exist) appears sound based on a manual re-evaluation of the examples. The strategy is to modify the code to accept the input as a list/array of integers directly, removing the unnecessary string parsing step (`_parse_input`) and adjusting subsequent functions accordingly.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Due to the immediate failure caused by the input type mismatch, the code could not execute the core logic. Therefore, metrics related to component identification or replacement accuracy cannot be gathered from the failed execution. However, a manual review confirms the following structure across all examples:\n    *   Input/Output Structure: 12 integers.\n    *   Data Segment: First 10 integers (indices 0-9).\n    *   Parameters: Last 2 integers (indices 10, 11).\n    *   Target Value for Replacement: 5.\n    *   Condition for Replacement: Exactly two connected components of 5s in the data segment.\n    *   Replacement Rule: First component -> param1 (index 10), Second component -> param2 (index 11).\n    *   No Replacement Cases: 0 or 1 component of 5s (Example 7).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
