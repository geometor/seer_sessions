Parses the input into a list of 12 integers.\n2. Identifies the last two integers (index 10 and 11) as control values (val1, val2).\n3. Focuses on the first 10 integers as the target subsequence.\n4. Finds contiguous groups (runs) of the integer 5 within the target subsequence.\n5. If exactly one group of 5s is found:\n   - Replaces all 5s in that group with val2 (the value at index 11).\n6. If two or more groups of 5s are found:\n   - Replaces all 5s in the first group with val1 (the value at index 10).\n   - Replaces all 5s in the second group with val2 (the value at index 11).\n   (Assumes transformation logic only applies to the first two groups found if more exist).\n7. Integers other than 5 (e.g., 0) in the target subsequence remain unchanged.\n8. Constructs the final output sequence by appending the original control values (val1, val2) to the modified target subsequence.\n\"\"\"\n\n# No specific imports required beyond standard Python capabilities for this task\n\n\ndef find_contiguous_groups(sub_list, target_value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to find the start and end indices of contiguous groups of a target value.\n\n    Args:\n        sub_list: The list (or list slice) to search within.\n        target_value: The integer value to find contiguous groups of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, where each tuple is (start_index, end_index) inclusive.\n        Returns an empty list if no groups are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    groups = []\n    start_index = -1\n    # Iterate through the list with index\n    for i, val in enumerate(sub_list):\n        # Check if the current value matches the target and if we are not already in a group\n        if val == target_value and start_index == -1:\n            # Start of a new group found at current index\n            start_index = i\n        # Check if the current value does *not* match the target and if we *were* in a group\n        elif val != target_value and start_index != -1:\n            # End of the previous group found (ends at the previous index)\n            groups.append((start_index, i - 1))\n            # Reset start_index to indicate we are no longer in a group\n            start_index = -1\n\n    # After the loop, check if we were still in a group when the list ended\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # The group extends to the end of the list\n        groups.append((start_index, len(sub_list) - 1))\n\n    return groups\n\n\ndef transform(input_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
