objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      length: 12
      elements: integer
      structure: Consists of a target subsequence followed by two control values.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      length: 12
      elements: integer
      structure: Consists of a modified target subsequence followed by the original control values.
  - name: target_subsequence
    type: list slice
    source: input_sequence
    indices: 0-9 (first 10 elements)
  - name: control_values
    type: list slice
    source: input_sequence
    indices: 10-11 (last 2 elements)
    elements:
      - name: val1
        index: 10 # The 11th element
      - name: val2
        index: 11 # The 12th element
  - name: target_value
    type: integer
    value: 5
    role: Value to be replaced within the target_subsequence.
  - name: groups_of_target
    type: list of tuples
    description: Stores (start_index, end_index) inclusive for each contiguous block of target_value found within target_subsequence.

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: raw_input (string or list)
    output: input_sequence (list of 12 integers)
    description: Convert the input into a standardized list format. Validate length.
  - name: extract_components
    input: input_sequence
    output: target_subsequence (list copy), val1 (int), val2 (int)
    description: Separate the input into its working parts. Create a mutable copy of the target subsequence.
  - name: identify_groups
    input: target_subsequence, target_value
    output: groups_of_target
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of the target_value (5).
  - name: apply_replacement_logic
    input: target_subsequence (mutable copy), groups_of_target, val1, val2
    output: modified_target_subsequence (list)
    description: >
      Modify the target_subsequence based on the number of groups found:
      If one group exists: Replace all target_values within that group's range with val2.
      If two or more groups exist: Replace target_values in the first group's range with val1, and in the second group's range with val2.
      If no groups exist: Make no changes.
  - name: construct_output
    input: modified_target_subsequence, val1, val2
    output: output_sequence
    description: Concatenate the modified_target_subsequence with the original val1 and val2.

relationships:
  - The first 10 elements of the output_sequence are derived from the target_subsequence by selectively replacing target_values.
  - The last 2 elements of the output_sequence are identical to the control_values from the input_sequence.
  - The replacement value(s) and logic depend on the number of groups_of_target and the specific values of val1 and val2.
  - Elements in the target_subsequence not equal to target_value are preserved in their original positions.
