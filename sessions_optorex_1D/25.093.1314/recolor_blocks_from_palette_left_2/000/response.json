Other values (specifically `0`) remain unchanged in their positions.\n5.  **Replacement Values:** The values from index 10 and index 11 of the input are used to replace the target value (`5`).\n6.  **Grouping:** The replacement seems sensitive to contiguous groups (or \"runs\") of the target value `5`.\n7.  **Conditional Replacement Logic:**\n    *   If there's only one contiguous group of `5`s in the first 10 positions, the replacement value used depends on the input values at index 10 (`val1`) and index 11 (`val2`). If `val1` is non-zero, it's used; otherwise, `val2` is used.\n    *   If there are two contiguous groups of `5`s, the first group is replaced by `val1`, and the second group is replaced by `val2`.\n8.  **Preservation:** The values `0` in the first 10 positions and the values at index 10 and 11 are preserved in the output in their original positions.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
