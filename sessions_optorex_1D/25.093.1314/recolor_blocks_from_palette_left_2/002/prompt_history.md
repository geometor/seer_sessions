Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Positions:** The last two integers in the input sequence (`index 10` and `index 11`) appear to act as parameters or control values for the transformation.
3.  **Target Sequence:** The first 10 integers (`index 0` to `index 9`) constitute the primary sequence being modified.
4.  **Target Value:** The integer `5` seems to be the specific value targeted for replacement within the first 10 positions. Other values (specifically `0`) remain unchanged in their positions.
5.  **Replacement Values:** The values from index 10 and index 11 of the input are used to replace the target value (`5`).
6.  **Grouping:** The replacement seems sensitive to contiguous groups (or "runs") of the target value `5`.
7.  **Conditional Replacement Logic:**
    *   If there's only one contiguous group of `5`s in the first 10 positions, the replacement value used depends on the input values at index 10 (`val1`) and index 11 (`val2`). If `val1` is non-zero, it's used; otherwise, `val2` is used.
    *   If there are two contiguous groups of `5`s, the first group is replaced by `val1`, and the second group is replaced by `val2`.
8.  **Preservation:** The values `0` in the first 10 positions and the values at index 10 and 11 are preserved in the output in their original positions.

**Facts:**

      If one group exists: replace with val1 if val1 != 0, else replace with val2.
      If two groups exist: replace first group with val1, second group with val2.

relationships:
  - The output_sequence depends on the input_sequence.
  - The transformation primarily affects elements in the target_subsequence that match the target_value.
  - The specific replacement values are determined by control_values (val1, val2).
  - The application logic of control_values depends on the number and position of groups_of_target.
  - Elements equal to ignored_value in the target_subsequence remain unchanged.
  - control_values (val1, val2) are preserved in the last two positions of the output_sequence.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the two control values: `val1` is the element at index 10, and `val2` is the element at index 11.
3.  Create a working copy of the first 10 elements of the input sequence.
4.  Scan the working copy to identify the start and end indices of all contiguous groups of the integer `5`. Store these groups.
5.  Count the number of identified groups of `5`s.
6.  If exactly one group was found:
    *   Determine the replacement value: if `val1` is not equal to `0`, use `val1`; otherwise, use `val2`.
    *   Replace all `5`s within that single group in the working copy with the determined replacement value.
7.  If two or more groups were found (examples show only up to two):
    *   Replace all `5`s within the first identified group in the working copy with `val1`.
    *   Replace all `5`s within the second identified group in the working copy with `val2`.
8.  Construct the final output sequence by taking the modified working copy (the first 10 elements) and appending the original `val1` and `val2` to its end.
9.  Return the final output sequence.
