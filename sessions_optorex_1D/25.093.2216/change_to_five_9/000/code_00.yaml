objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of integers derived from the space-separated input string.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of integers derived from the space-separated output string, having the same length as the input sequence.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: Individual element within the input or output sequence.

properties:
  - object: digit
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the digit (0-9).
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence, always equal to the input sequence length.

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    condition:
      - if input digit is 0, output digit is 0.
      - if input digit is not 0, output digit is 5.

relationships:
  - type: element_wise_mapping
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    description: Each digit in the output_sequence corresponds to the digit at the same position in the input_sequence, transformed according to the transform_digit action.
