## Perception of the Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of digits, presented as a space-separated string. The transformation operates on each digit individually, maintaining the original sequence structure and length. The core logic distinguishes between zero and non-zero digits: zero digits remain unchanged, while all non-zero digits are replaced by the digit '5'.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of integers derived from the space-separated input string.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of integers derived from the space-separated output string, having the same length as the input sequence.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: Individual element within the input or output sequence.

properties:
  - object: digit
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the digit (0-9).
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence, always equal to the input sequence length.

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    condition:
      - if input digit is 0, output digit is 0.
      - if input digit is not 0, output digit is 5.

relationships:
  - type: element_wise_mapping
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    description: Each digit in the output_sequence corresponds to the digit at the same position in the input_sequence, transformed according to the transform_digit action.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input string and split it into a sequence of individual digits.
2.  Create a new empty sequence for the output.
3.  Iterate through each digit in the input sequence:
    a.  Check if the current digit is equal to 0.
    b.  If the digit is 0, append 0 to the output sequence.
    c.  If the digit is not 0, append 5 to the output sequence.
4.  Join the digits in the output sequence with spaces to form the final output string.
