## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified in the previous dreamer phase appears correct: map each digit in the input sequence such that 0 remains 0, and any non-zero digit becomes 5. The error messages (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) strongly indicate that the previous code attempt (`code_00.py`) expected a NumPy array as input, but the execution environment likely passed the input in a different format (perhaps the entire list or array was being compared in the `if digit == 0:` condition, rather than individual elements).

The strategy is to revert to the initial understanding that the input is a string of space-separated digits. The function should parse this string, perform the element-wise transformation, and then format the result back into a space-separated string.

## Metrics

The transformation rule (0 -> 0, non-zero -> 5) is consistently applied across all provided training examples.

| Example | Input Sequence                     | Output Sequence                    | Rule Consistency |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| train_1 | `9 0 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 1 7 0`        | `5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0`        | Consistent       |
| train_2 | `5 9 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`        | `5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`        | Consistent       |
| train_3 | `0 0 5 0 0 8 2 0 0 4 3 0`        | `0 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0`        | Consistent       |
| train_4 | `8 6 0 0 7 0 0 0 2 4 7 0`        | `5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0`        | Consistent       |
| train_5 | `9 1 0 8 2 8 4 0 0 1 7 1`        | `5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5`        | Consistent       |
| train_6 | `1 0 2 7 0 0 0 1 0 0 9 9`        | `5 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5`        | Consistent       |
| train_7 | `0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 6 0`        | `0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0`        | Consistent       |

No code execution is needed to verify this, as it's a direct observation of the input/output pairs against the proposed rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a single string containing space-separated digits.
2.  Split the input string into a list of digit strings using the space character as a delimiter.
3.  Create an empty list to store the transformed digits (as integers).
4.  Iterate through the list of digit strings:
    a.  Convert the current digit string to an integer.
    b.  Check if the integer value is 0.
    c.  If it is 0, append the integer 0 to the transformed digits list.
    d.  If it is not 0, append the integer 5 to the transformed digits list.
5.  Convert each integer in the transformed digits list back into its string representation.
6.  Join the list of transformed digit strings using a single space character as a separator to create the final output string.
7.  Return the final output string.
