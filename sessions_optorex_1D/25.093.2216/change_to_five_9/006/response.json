            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was called with a NumPy array as input, whereas the function implementation expected a string. The core transformation logic (mapping non-zero numbers to 5 and keeping zeros) appears consistent across all examples, but the function's input handling needs to be adapted to accept a sequence of numbers directly (like a list or NumPy array) instead of relying on string splitting.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the function signature to accept a sequence of numbers (e.g., `list[int]` or `np.ndarray`) and iterate through this sequence directly, applying the transformation logic, and then formatting the result as a space-separated string.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nBased on the provided examples and the error message:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently provided as a sequence of numerical digits during testing (specifically, `numpy.ndarray`).\n*   **Output Type:** The expected output is consistently a space-separated string of digits.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** In all examples, the rule holds: 0 maps to 0, any digit from 1-9 maps to 5.\n*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the output sequence always matches the length of the input sequence.\n\nLet's confirm the structure and rule consistency.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: `[9 0 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 1 7 0]` (as ndarray)\nOutput: `5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0`\nRule Applied: 9->5, 0->0, 3->5, 0->0, 0->0, 7->5, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 1->5, 7->5, 0->0. Consistent.\n\n**Example 5:**\nInput: `[9 1 0 8 2 8 4 0 0 1 7 1]` (as ndarray)\nOutput: `5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5`\nRule Applied: 9->5, 1->5, 0->0, 8->5, 2->5, 8->5, 4->5, 0->0, 0->0, 1->5, 7->5, 1->5. Consistent.\n\n**Example 7:**\nInput: `[0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 6 0]` (as ndarray)\nOutput: `0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0`\nRule Applied: 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 9->5, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 6->5, 0->0. Consistent.\n\nThe transformation rule is robust across all provided training examples. The primary issue is the mismatch in expected vs. actual input data type in the function implementation.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
