## General Assessment

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was called with a NumPy array as input, whereas the function implementation expected a string. The core transformation logic (mapping non-zero numbers to 5 and keeping zeros) appears consistent across all examples, but the function's input handling needs to be adapted to accept a sequence of numbers directly (like a list or NumPy array) instead of relying on string splitting.

The strategy is to modify the function signature to accept a sequence of numbers (e.g., `list[int]` or `np.ndarray`) and iterate through this sequence directly, applying the transformation logic, and then formatting the result as a space-separated string.

## Metrics Gathering

Based on the provided examples and the error message:

*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently provided as a sequence of numerical digits during testing (specifically, `numpy.ndarray`).
*   **Output Type:** The expected output is consistently a space-separated string of digits.
*   **Transformation Rule:** In all examples, the rule holds: 0 maps to 0, any digit from 1-9 maps to 5.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the output sequence always matches the length of the input sequence.

Let's confirm the structure and rule consistency.

**Example 1:**
Input: `[9 0 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 1 7 0]` (as ndarray)
Output: `5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0`
Rule Applied: 9->5, 0->0, 3->5, 0->0, 0->0, 7->5, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 1->5, 7->5, 0->0. Consistent.

**Example 5:**
Input: `[9 1 0 8 2 8 4 0 0 1 7 1]` (as ndarray)
Output: `5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5`
Rule Applied: 9->5, 1->5, 0->0, 8->5, 2->5, 8->5, 4->5, 0->0, 0->0, 1->5, 7->5, 1->5. Consistent.

**Example 7:**
Input: `[0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 6 0]` (as ndarray)
Output: `0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0`
Rule Applied: 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 9->5, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 0->0, 6->5, 0->0. Consistent.

The transformation rule is robust across all provided training examples. The primary issue is the mismatch in expected vs. actual input data type in the function implementation.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of integers.
2.  Create a new empty sequence to store the transformed integers.
3.  Iterate through each integer (digit) in the input sequence:
    a.  Check if the current integer is equal to 0.
    b.  If the integer is 0, append 0 to the transformed sequence.
    c.  If the integer is not 0, append 5 to the transformed sequence.
4.  Convert each integer in the transformed sequence to its string representation.
5.  Join the resulting strings with a single space character to create the final output string.
6.  Return the final output string.
