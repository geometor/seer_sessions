objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence_of_integers # Updated type based on error context (e.g., list[int], np.ndarray)
    description: A sequence of integers representing the input digits.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of transformed integers (0 or 5).
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: The final space-separated string representation of the output_sequence.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: Individual element within the input or output sequence.

properties:
  - object: digit
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the digit (0-9).
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of digits in the sequence, always equal to the input sequence length.

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    condition:
      - if input digit's value is 0, output digit's value is 0.
      - if input digit's value is not 0, output digit's value is 5.
  - name: format_output
    input: output_sequence (list_of_integers)
    output: output_string (string)
    description: Convert each integer in the output_sequence to its string representation and join them with single spaces.


relationships:
  - type: element_wise_mapping
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    description: Each digit in the output_sequence corresponds to the digit at the same position in the input_sequence, transformed according to the transform_digit action.
