            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: map zero digits to zero and all non-zero digits to five. However, the previous code implementation failed because it assumed the input would be a string, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently indicates this type mismatch across all examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the approach to handle the input as a sequence of numbers (specifically, a NumPy array as indicated by the error) rather than a string that needs parsing. The fundamental logic of the transformation (0 -> 0, non-zero -> 5) remains the same.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples and error messages:\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently identified as `numpy.ndarray` by the execution environment, although presented initially as space-separated strings.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a space-separated string of digits.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Appears consistent across all examples:\n    *   Input `0` maps to Output `0`.\n    *   Input `x` (where `x` is any digit from 1 to 9) maps to Output `5`.\n*   **Sequence Length:** The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.\n*   **Element Mapping:** The transformation is applied element-wise at each position in the sequence.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
