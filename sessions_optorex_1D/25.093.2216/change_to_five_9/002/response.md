## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: map zero digits to zero and all non-zero digits to five. However, the previous code implementation failed because it assumed the input would be a string, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently indicates this type mismatch across all examples.

The strategy is to modify the approach to handle the input as a sequence of numbers (specifically, a NumPy array as indicated by the error) rather than a string that needs parsing. The fundamental logic of the transformation (0 -> 0, non-zero -> 5) remains the same.

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples and error messages:

*   **Input Type:** Consistently identified as `numpy.ndarray` by the execution environment, although presented initially as space-separated strings.
*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a space-separated string of digits.
*   **Transformation Rule:** Appears consistent across all examples:
    *   Input `0` maps to Output `0`.
    *   Input `x` (where `x` is any digit from 1 to 9) maps to Output `5`.
*   **Sequence Length:** The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.
*   **Element Mapping:** The transformation is applied element-wise at each position in the sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (which is expected to be a NumPy array of integers).
2.  Create a new empty list to store the output digits.
3.  Iterate through each integer element in the input sequence:
    a.  Check if the current element is equal to 0.
    b.  If the element is 0, append 0 to the output list.
    c.  If the element is not 0, append 5 to the output list.
4.  Convert each integer in the output list to its string representation.
5.  Join the strings in the output list with spaces to form the final output string.
6.  Return the resulting string.
