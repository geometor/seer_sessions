objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: A sequence of integers provided as a NumPy array (inferred from runtime errors).
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of integers generated by transforming the input sequence.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: Individual numerical element within the input or output sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    name: elements
    description: The individual integer values contained within the array.
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of elements in the sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    description: The number of elements in the sequence, equal to the input sequence length.

actions:
  - name: transform_element
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    condition:
      - if input digit is 0, output digit is 0.
      - if input digit is not 0, output digit is 5.

relationships:
  - type: element_wise_mapping
    source: input_sequence
    target: output_sequence
    description: Each element in the output_sequence corresponds to the element at the same position in the input_sequence, transformed according to the transform_element action.
