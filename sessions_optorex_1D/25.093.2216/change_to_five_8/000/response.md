*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence.
    *   The transformation appears to operate on each digit independently.
    *   Digits '0' in the input remain '0' in the output.
    *   All non-zero digits (1 through 9) in the input are transformed into the digit '5' in the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - input:
          type: sequence
          element_type: integer
          element_range: 0-9
          description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
      - output:
          type: sequence
          element_type: integer
          element_range: 0 or 5
          description: A sequence of single-digit integers derived from the input.
          length_relation: Same as input sequence length.
    transformation:
      type: element-wise mapping
      rules:
        - condition: Input element is 0
          action: Output element is 0
        - condition: Input element is non-zero (1-9)
          action: Output element is 5
      relationship: The element at a specific position in the output depends solely on the element at the same position in the input.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each digit in the input sequence.
    2.  For each digit, check if it is equal to 0.
    3.  If the digit is 0, keep the output digit as 0.
    4.  If the digit is not 0 (i.e., it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9), change the output digit to 5.
    5.  Construct the output sequence using the transformed digits, maintaining the original order.
