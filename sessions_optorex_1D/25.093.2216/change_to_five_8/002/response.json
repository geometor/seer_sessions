            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch. The core transformation logic (mapping 0 to 0 and any non-zero digit to 5) identified visually from the examples appears correct, but the input handling needs modification.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    The primary step is to modify the input handling mechanism in the code. Instead of expecting a string and using `.split()`, the code should directly iterate over the elements of the input NumPy array. The transformation logic applied to each element remains the same.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** The execution results confirm the input type is `numpy.ndarray`, not `str` as previously assumed.\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** The core logic (0 -> 0, non-zero -> 5) remains consistent across all provided `train_` examples when comparing input and output visually. The code's failure was due to implementation error (input handling), not logical error.\n    *   **Code Execution Success Rate:** 0% (7 out of 7 examples failed due to the same type error).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
