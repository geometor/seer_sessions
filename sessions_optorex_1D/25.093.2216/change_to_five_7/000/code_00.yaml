task_description: "Transform a sequence of digits element-wise based on whether each digit is zero or non-zero."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    role: input and output structure
  - name: digit
    type: integer (0-9)
    role: element within the sequence
properties:
  - object: digit
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the digit (0-9).
transformation:
  - name: map_digit
    inputs:
      - digit (from input sequence)
    outputs:
      - digit (for output sequence)
    rule: >
      If the input digit's value is 0, the output digit's value is 0.
      If the input digit's value is non-zero (1-9), the output digit's value is 5.
relationship:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: >
      The digit at index 'i' in the output sequence is the result of applying the
      map_digit transformation to the digit at index 'i' in the input sequence.
    applies_to:
      - input sequence
      - output sequence
