**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The transformation rule appears to be applied independently to each element based on its value. Specifically, the digit '0' seems to be treated differently from all other non-zero digits (1 through 9).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_type: element-wise_transformation
input_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  element_range: 0-9
output_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  element_range: 0 or 5
  length: same_as_input

  type: conditional_mapping
  conditions:
    - condition: input_element_is_zero
      action: output_element_is_zero
    - condition: input_element_is_non_zero
      action: output_element_is_five
relationship:
  input_output: one-to-one_mapping_by_index
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Process the input sequence element by element, from left to right.
2.  For each element in the input sequence:
    a.  If the element's value is 0, the corresponding element in the output sequence is 0.
    b.  If the element's value is not 0 (i.e., it is any digit from 1 to 9), the corresponding element in the output sequence is 5.
3.  Combine the resulting elements to form the final output sequence, maintaining the original order.
