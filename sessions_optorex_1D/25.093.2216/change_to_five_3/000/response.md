**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits, presented as a space-separated string, into another sequence of the same length. The transformation rule appears to be applied independently to each digit in the sequence based on its numerical value. Zeros and fives remain unchanged, while all other non-zero digits are converted to fives.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: string
    description: A string containing single digits separated by spaces.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: string
    description: A string containing single digits separated by spaces, derived from the input.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: An individual numerical digit (0-9) present in the sequences.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of digits in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of digits in the output sequence. Is always equal to the input sequence length.

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    rule: >
      Maps an input digit to an output digit based on its value.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each digit in the input_sequence maps to a digit at the corresponding position in the output_sequence.
  - type: transformation_rule
    applies_to: digit
    conditions:
      - if_value_is: 0
        then_output_is: 0
      - if_value_is: 5
        then_output_is: 5
      - if_value_is_not: [0, 5]
        then_output_is: 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string of space-separated digits.
2.  Process each digit in the input string individually, maintaining its position.
3.  For each digit:
    a. If the digit is '0', the corresponding output digit is '0'.
    b. If the digit is '5', the corresponding output digit is '5'.
    c. If the digit is any other value (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9), the corresponding output digit is '5'.
4.  Construct the output string by joining the transformed digits with spaces.
5.  Return the resulting output string.
