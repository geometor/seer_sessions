**Perception of task elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of single digits, represented as strings separated by spaces. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence. The transformation appears to operate on each digit independently. A clear pattern emerges: the digit '0' in the input remains '0' in the output, while any non-zero digit (1 through 9) in the input is transformed into the digit '5' in the output. The position of each digit within the sequence is preserved during the transformation.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a new, empty output sequence.
3.  Iterate through each digit in the input sequence, one by one, maintaining its position.
4.  For the current digit:
    a.  If the digit is equal to 0, append 0 to the output sequence.
    b.  If the digit is not equal to 0 (i.e., it is between 1 and 9), append 5 to the output sequence.
5.  After processing all digits from the input sequence, return the completed output sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided by the testing environment (a NumPy array). The core transformation logic (mapping 0 to 0 and any non-zero digit to 5) appears consistent with the initial examples, but the function's interface needs correction.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the function signature and internal processing to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is easily convertible from a 1D NumPy array) as input.
2.  Remove the string splitting and parsing steps (`input_str.split(' ')` and `int(d)`).
3.  Apply the transformation logic directly to the elements of the input array/list.
4.  Return the result in the required format, which, based on the output examples, appears to be a similar structure (likely another NumPy array or a list of integers, which the test harness presumably handles for comparison). Assuming the desired output format is also a NumPy array or list of integers matching the input structure.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all failed examples.
*   **Expected Input Type (Code):** `str` (space-separated digits).
*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` in all cases, specifically targeting the `.split()` method which does not exist for NumPy arrays.
*   **Core Logic Status:** The underlying rule (0->0, non-zero->5) is likely correct but wasn't reached due to the input type error.
*   **Output Format:** Based on the desired outputs in the examples, the expected output format is likely a NumPy array or list of integers, mirroring the structure of the (actual) input.
