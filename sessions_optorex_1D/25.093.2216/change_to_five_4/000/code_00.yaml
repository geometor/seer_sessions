objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of single digits (0-9).
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of single digits resulting from the transformation.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: An individual number (0-9) within a sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: digit
    property: value
    value_range: [0, 9]

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    rule: |
      if input_digit is 0, output_digit is 0.
      if input_digit is non-zero (1-9), output_digit is 5.
  - name: process_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    steps: Iterate through each digit in the input_sequence and apply the transform_digit rule to generate the corresponding digit in the output_sequence.

relationships:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: The digit at index 'i' in the output_sequence is determined solely by the digit at index 'i' in the input_sequence.
  - type: length_equality
    description: The length of the output_sequence is equal to the length of the input_sequence.
