The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence. The transformation appears to operate on each digit independently. A clear pattern emerges: the digit '0' in the input remains '0' in the output, while any non-zero digit (1 through 9) in the input is transformed into the digit '5' in the output. The position of each digit within the sequence is preserved during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
