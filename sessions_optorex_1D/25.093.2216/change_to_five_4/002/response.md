**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided by the testing environment (a NumPy array). The core transformation logic (mapping 0 to 0 and any non-zero digit to 5) appears consistent with the initial examples, but the function's interface needs correction.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the function signature and internal processing to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is easily convertible from a 1D NumPy array) as input.
2.  Remove the string splitting and parsing steps (`input_str.split(' ')` and `int(d)`).
3.  Apply the transformation logic directly to the elements of the input array/list.
4.  Return the result in the required format, which, based on the output examples, appears to be a similar structure (likely another NumPy array or a list of integers, which the test harness presumably handles for comparison). Assuming the desired output format is also a NumPy array or list of integers matching the input structure.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all failed examples.
*   **Expected Input Type (Code):** `str` (space-separated digits).
*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` in all cases, specifically targeting the `.split()` method which does not exist for NumPy arrays.
*   **Core Logic Status:** The underlying rule (0->0, non-zero->5) is likely correct but wasn't reached due to the input type error.
*   **Output Format:** Based on the desired outputs in the examples, the expected output format is likely a NumPy array or list of integers, mirroring the structure of the (actual) input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers # Changed from string - could also be numpy_array_of_integers
    description: A sequence (list or array) of single digits (0-9).
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers # Changed from string - could also be numpy_array_of_integers
    description: A sequence (list or array) of single digits resulting from the transformation.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: An individual number (0-9) within a sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: digit
    property: value
    value_range: [0, 9]

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence element)
    output: digit (for output_sequence element)
    rule: |
      if input_digit is 0, output_digit is 0.
      if input_digit is non-zero (1-9), output_digit is 5.
  - name: process_sequence
    input: input_sequence (list or array of integers)
    output: output_sequence (list or array of integers)
    steps: Iterate through each integer element in the input_sequence and apply the transform_digit rule to generate the corresponding integer element in the output_sequence. The output sequence should have the same length and structure as the input.

relationships:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: The integer element at index 'i' in the output_sequence is determined solely by the integer element at index 'i' in the input_sequence.
  - type: length_equality
    description: The length of the output_sequence is equal to the length of the input_sequence.
  - type: type_consistency
    description: The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of integers. # Added relationship
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a list or array of integers.
2.  Create a new, empty list or array to store the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through each integer element in the input sequence, maintaining its position.
4.  For the current integer element:
    a.  If the integer is exactly 0, add the integer 0 to the output sequence.
    b.  If the integer is not 0 (i.e., it is between 1 and 9), add the integer 5 to the output sequence.
5.  After processing all elements from the input sequence, return the completed output sequence (as a list or array of integers with the same dimensions/length as the input).
