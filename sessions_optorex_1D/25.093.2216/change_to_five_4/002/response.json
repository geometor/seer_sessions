            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided by the testing environment (a NumPy array). The core transformation logic (mapping 0 to 0 and any non-zero digit to 5) appears consistent with the initial examples, but the function's interface needs correction.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the function signature and internal processing to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is easily convertible from a 1D NumPy array) as input.\n2.  Remove the string splitting and parsing steps (`input_str.split(' ')` and `int(d)`).\n3.  Apply the transformation logic directly to the elements of the input array/list.\n4.  Return the result in the required format, which, based on the output examples, appears to be a similar structure (likely another NumPy array or a list of integers, which the test harness presumably handles for comparison). Assuming the desired output format is also a NumPy array or list of integers matching the input structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all failed examples.\n*   **Expected Input Type (Code):** `str` (space-separated digits).\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` in all cases, specifically targeting the `.split()` method which does not exist for NumPy arrays.\n*   **Core Logic Status:** The underlying rule (0->0, non-zero->5) is likely correct but wasn't reached due to the input type error.\n*   **Output Format:** Based on the desired outputs in the examples, the expected output format is likely a NumPy array or list of integers, mirroring the structure of the (actual) input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
