**Perception of task elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of single digits, represented as strings separated by spaces. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence. The transformation appears to operate on each digit independently. A clear pattern emerges: the digit '0' in the input remains '0' in the output, while any non-zero digit (1 through 9) in the input is transformed into the digit '5' in the output. The position of each digit within the sequence is preserved during the transformation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of single digits (0-9).
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: A sequence of single digits resulting from the transformation.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: An individual number (0-9) within a sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    value_type: integer
  - object: digit
    property: value
    value_range: [0, 9]

actions:
  - name: transform_digit
    input: digit (from input_sequence)
    output: digit (for output_sequence)
    rule: |
      if input_digit is 0, output_digit is 0.
      if input_digit is non-zero (1-9), output_digit is 5.
  - name: process_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    steps: Iterate through each digit in the input_sequence and apply the transform_digit rule to generate the corresponding digit in the output_sequence.

relationships:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: The digit at index 'i' in the output_sequence is determined solely by the digit at index 'i' in the input_sequence.
  - type: length_equality
    description: The length of the output_sequence is equal to the length of the input_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a new, empty output sequence.
3.  Iterate through each digit in the input sequence, one by one, maintaining its position.
4.  For the current digit:
    a.  If the digit is equal to 0, append 0 to the output sequence.
    b.  If the digit is not equal to 0 (i.e., it is between 1 and 9), append 5 to the output sequence.
5.  After processing all digits from the input sequence, return the completed output sequence.
