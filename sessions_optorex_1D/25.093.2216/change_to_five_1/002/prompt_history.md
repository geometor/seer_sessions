*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are strings representing sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The transformation acts independently on each digit based on its value.
    *   Zero digits ('0') in the input remain '0' in the output.
    *   All non-zero digits (1 through 9) in the input are replaced by the digit '5' in the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_sequence:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of single digits separated by spaces.
      - output_sequence:
          type: string
          description: A sequence of single digits separated by spaces, derived from the input.
      - digit:
          type: character
          description: Represents a single numerical character from '0' to '9'.
    properties:
      - sequence_length:
          description: The number of digits in a sequence. The input and output sequences have the same length.
      - digit_value:
          description: The numerical value of a digit. Key property is whether it's zero or non-zero.
    actions:
      - transformation:
          description: Convert each digit in the input sequence based on a rule.
          rule: If the input digit is '0', the output digit is '0'; otherwise, the output digit is '5'.
    relationships:
      - positional_correspondence:
          description: The digit at position 'i' in the output sequence is derived from the digit at position 'i' in the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Split the input string into a list of individual digit characters.
    2.  Iterate through each digit character in the list.
    3.  For each digit:
        *   If the digit is '0', keep it as '0'.
        *   If the digit is any character other than '0' (i.e., '1' through '9'), replace it with '5'.
    4.  Join the processed list of digit characters back into a single string, separated by spaces.
    5.  Output the resulting string.
