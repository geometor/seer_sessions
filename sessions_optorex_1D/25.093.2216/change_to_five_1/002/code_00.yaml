objects:
  - input_array:
      type: numpy.ndarray
      description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array containing integers.
  - output_array:
      type: numpy.ndarray
      description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array containing integers, derived from the input_array.
  - element:
      type: integer
      description: Represents a single integer value within an array.
properties:
  - array_shape:
      description: The dimensions of the array. Both input and output arrays are 1D and have the same shape (length).
  - element_value:
      description: The numerical value of an element. The key distinction is whether the value is zero or non-zero.
actions:
  - transformation:
      description: Create the output array by modifying each element of the input array based on a rule.
      rule: If an element in the input array is 0, the corresponding element in the output array is 0; otherwise (if the input element is non-zero), the corresponding output element is 5.
relationships:
  - positional_correspondence:
      description: The element at index 'i' in the output array is derived directly from the element at index 'i' in the input array.
