**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits (represented as space-separated strings) into another sequence of the same length. The transformation rule appears to operate independently on each digit in the input sequence based on its value. Specifically, zero digits remain zero, while all non-zero digits are converted to the digit five.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: space-separated single digits
      - length: variable
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: space-separated single digits ('0' or '5')
      - length: same as input_sequence
  - object: digit
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - range: 0-9 (in input)
      - range: 0 or 5 (in output)

relationships:
  - type: element-wise_transformation
    description: Each digit in the output sequence is derived from the digit at the corresponding position in the input sequence.
  - type: value_mapping
    conditions:
      - input_digit: 0
        output_digit: 0
      - input_digit: non-zero (1-9)
        output_digit: 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each digit in the input sequence, preserving its position.
2.  For each input digit:
    *   **Check** if the digit is equal to '0'.
    *   If the digit is '0', the corresponding output digit is '0'.
    *   If the digit is not '0' (i.e., it is any digit from '1' to '9'), the corresponding output digit is '5'.
3.  **Construct** the output sequence by assembling the transformed digits in their original order, separated by spaces.
