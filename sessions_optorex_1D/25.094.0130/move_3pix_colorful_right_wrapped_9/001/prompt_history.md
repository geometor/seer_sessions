*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
    *   All provided examples show input and output sequences of length 12.
    *   The digits themselves within the sequence do not appear to be modified.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the digits within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs consistently shows that the last three elements of the input sequence become the first three elements of the output sequence.
    *   The first nine elements of the input sequence become the last nine elements of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
    *   This rearrangement is equivalent to a circular right shift (or rotation) of the sequence by 3 positions.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements within a sequence of 12 digits.
    input_object:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12
    output_object:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - content: Same elements as input, but rearranged.
    transformation:
      action: segment_move
      parameters:
        - source_segment: Last 3 elements of the input list.
        - destination_position: Beginning of the output list.
        - remaining_segment: First 9 elements of the input list.
        - remaining_destination: Appended after the moved segment.
      alternative_description:
        action: circular_shift_right
        parameters:
          - shift_amount: 3
    relationships:
      - The output list is formed by concatenating the last 3 elements of the input list with the first 9 elements of the input list.
      - The order of elements within the last 3 positions is preserved during the move.
      - The order of elements within the first 9 positions is preserved during the move.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Identify the last 3 digits of the sequence.
    3.  Identify the first 9 digits of the sequence.
    4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 3 digits at the beginning, followed by the identified first 9 digits. Maintain the original relative order within both the 3-digit group and the 9-digit group.
