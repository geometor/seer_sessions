task_description: Rearrange elements within a sequence of 12 digits by performing a circular right shift.
input_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer (single digit)
  properties:
    - length: 12
output_object:
  type: list
  element_type: integer (single digit)
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - content: Same elements as input, but rearranged.
transformation:
  action: circular_shift_right # Equivalent to rotate right
  parameters:
    - shift_amount: 3
  alternative_description: # Segment-based view
    action: segment_move_concat
    parameters:
      - segment_1: Elements at indices 9, 10, 11 (last 3) of the input list.
      - segment_2: Elements at indices 0 through 8 (first 9) of the input list.
      - output_construction: Concatenate segment_1 followed by segment_2.
relationships:
  - The output list contains the exact same elements as the input list, maintaining multiset equality.
  - The relative order of the last 3 elements is preserved; they become the first 3 elements of the output.
  - The relative order of the first 9 elements is preserved; they become the last 9 elements of the output.
