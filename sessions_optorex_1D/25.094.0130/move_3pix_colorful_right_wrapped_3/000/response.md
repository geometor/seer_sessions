Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences of digits, specifically 12 digits long in all examples.
*   The digits themselves seem to be preserved; the transformation is purely about rearranging their order.
*   Comparing inputs and outputs, there's a consistent rearrangement pattern. It appears the sequence is split into parts and then reassembled differently.
*   Specifically, the last three digits of the input sequence consistently appear at the beginning of the output sequence.
*   The first eight digits of the input sequence consistently follow these initial three digits in the output sequence.
*   The ninth digit (at index 8) of the input sequence consistently appears at the very end of the output sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - element_type: digit
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - element_type: digit
      - length: 12
relationships:
  - type: split
    source: input_sequence
    targets: [segment_A, segment_B, segment_C]
    details:
      - segment_A: elements from index 0 to 7
      - segment_B: element at index 8
      - segment_C: elements from index 9 to 11
  - type: concatenation
    sources: [segment_C, segment_A, segment_B]
    target: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence is formed by joining segment_C, segment_A, and segment_B in that specific order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Divide the input sequence into three parts:
    *   The first part consists of the initial 8 digits (indices 0-7).
    *   The second part consists of the single digit at index 8.
    *   The third part consists of the final 3 digits (indices 9-11).
3.  Create the output sequence by arranging these parts in the following order: concatenate the third part, then the first part, and finally the second part.
