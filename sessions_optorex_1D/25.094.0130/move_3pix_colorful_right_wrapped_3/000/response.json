It appears the sequence is split into parts and then reassembled differently.\n*   Specifically, the last three digits of the input sequence consistently appear at the beginning of the output sequence.\n*   The first eight digits of the input sequence consistently follow these initial three digits in the output sequence.\n*   The ninth digit (at index 8) of the input sequence consistently appears at the very end of the output sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
