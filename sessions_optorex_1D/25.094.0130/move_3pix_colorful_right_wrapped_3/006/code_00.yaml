objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: integer # Assumed based on examples, though not explicitly typed
      - shape: (12,)
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: integer # Assumed based on examples
      - shape: (12,)
relationships:
  - type: slicing
    source: input_array
    targets: [segment_A, segment_B, segment_C]
    details:
      - segment_A: elements from index 0 to 7 (input_array[0:8])
      - segment_B: element at index 8 (input_array[8:9] - sliced to maintain array structure)
      - segment_C: elements from index 9 to 11 (input_array[9:12])
  - type: concatenation
    sources: [segment_C, segment_A, segment_B]
    target: output_array
    details: The output array is formed by concatenating segment_C, segment_A, and segment_B in that order using numpy concatenation.
