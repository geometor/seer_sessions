**Perception of the elements:**

The input consists of a sequence of 12 single digits, separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 single digits, separated by spaces. The digits themselves appear to be preserved between input and output, but their order is changed. Comparing the input and output sequences across the examples reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement: the last three digits of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining first nine digits are shifted to the right to follow them. This operation is consistent across all provided training examples.

**Natural language program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 space-separated digits.
2.  Select the last 3 digits from the input sequence.
3.  Select the first 9 digits from the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the selected last 3 digits at the beginning, followed by the selected first 9 digits.
5.  Ensure the digits in the output sequence are separated by spaces.
```python
import collections

"""
Take the input sequence of 12 space-separated digits. Select the last 3 digits and the first 9 digits. Construct the output sequence by placing the selected last 3 digits at the beginning, followed by the selected first 9 digits, ensuring they are space-separated.
