The output is also a sequence of 12 single digits, separated by spaces. The digits themselves appear to be preserved between input and output, but their order is changed. Comparing the input and output sequences across the examples reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement: the last three digits of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining first nine digits are shifted to the right to follow them. This operation is consistent across all provided training examples.\n\n**YAML facts:**\n\n"
