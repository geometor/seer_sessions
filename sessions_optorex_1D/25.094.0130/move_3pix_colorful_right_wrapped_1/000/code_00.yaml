    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - representation: space-separated string
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - representation: space-separated string
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    description: The output sequence is a reordering of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: split_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - split_point: 3 elements from the end
    outputs:
      - first_part: The first (n-3) elements (where n is total length)
      - last_part: The last 3 elements
  - name: concatenate_parts
    inputs:
      - last_part
      - first_part
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the last_part and first_part in that order.
