Both the input and output are presented as space-separated strings of these numbers. All provided examples have an input sequence length of 12 numbers. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence, specifically a cyclic shift. The last few elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining initial elements follow.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
