objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence_of_integers # Corrected type (e.g., list or numpy array)
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence_of_integers # Corrected type
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    description: The output sequence is a cyclic permutation of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: determine_split_point
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - offset_from_end: 3
    outputs:
      - index: The index separating the last 3 elements from the preceding elements (index = length - 3).
  - name: slice_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - split_index: index from previous step
    outputs:
      - first_part: Elements from the beginning up to (but not including) the split_index.
      - last_part: Elements from the split_index to the end.
  - name: concatenate_parts
    inputs:
      - last_part
      - first_part
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the last_part and first_part in that order to form the output sequence.
