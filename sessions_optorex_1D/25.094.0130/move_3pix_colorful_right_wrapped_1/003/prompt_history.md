**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit numbers. Both the input and output are presented as space-separated strings of these numbers. All provided examples have an input sequence length of 12 numbers. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence, specifically a cyclic shift. The last few elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining initial elements follow.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of numbers.
2.  Identify the last 3 numbers in the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining numbers (all numbers except the last 3) in their original order.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 3 numbers at the beginning, followed by the identified remaining numbers.
5.  Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.
```python
import math

"""

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The previous natural language program and code assumed the input was a space-separated string requiring parsing. However, the error clearly indicates the `transform` function receives a NumPy array (or a similar object that behaves like a sequence but isn't a string) directly.

The transformation logic itself—moving the last 3 elements of the sequence to the beginning while preserving the relative order of both segments—appears consistent across all provided training examples when applied to the sequence of numbers directly, rather than a string representation.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the understanding of the input object type from a string to a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) of integers.
2.  Remove the string parsing and formatting steps from the core transformation logic.
3.  Re-validate the "move last 3 elements to the front" rule against all examples using the corrected input type assumption.
4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the input type and the validated transformation rule.

**Metrics Gathering**

Based on visual inspection and the validated transformation rule:
*   All input examples consist of 12 integer elements.
*   All output examples consist of 12 integer elements.
*   The transformation rule involves splitting the input sequence into two parts: the first `n-3` elements and the last `3` elements (where `n=12` in all examples).
*   The output sequence is formed by concatenating the `last 3` elements followed by the `first n-3` elements.
*   This rule consistently maps the input to the output for all 7 training examples.
