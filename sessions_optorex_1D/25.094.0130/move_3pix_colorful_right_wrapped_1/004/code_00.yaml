objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - format: space-separated integers
      - element_count: 12 (consistently in examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - format: space-separated integers
      - element_count: 12 (consistently in examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: integer_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: Internal representation derived from input_string by splitting the string and converting elements to integers.
    properties:
      - length: 12
relationships:
  - type: parsing
    from: input_string
    to: integer_sequence
    description: The input string is parsed into a sequence of integers based on space delimiters.
  - type: transformation (cyclic shift)
    on: integer_sequence
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 3 (number of elements moved from end to start)
    description: The sequence is split into two parts - the first (n-3) elements and the last 3 elements. The output sequence is formed by concatenating the last 3 elements followed by the first (n-3) elements.
  - type: formatting
    from: transformed integer_sequence
    to: output_string
    description: The transformed sequence of integers is formatted back into a space-separated string.
actions:
  - name: parse_string_to_int_list
    input: input_string
    output: integer_sequence
    description: Splits the input string by spaces and converts each part to an integer.
  - name: split_sequence_for_shift
    input: integer_sequence
    parameters:
      - count_from_end: 3
    outputs:
      - initial_segment: The first (length - 3) elements of the sequence.
      - final_segment: The last 3 elements of the sequence.
    description: Divides the sequence based on the last 3 elements.
  - name: concatenate_segments_shifted
    inputs:
      - final_segment
      - initial_segment
    output: transformed_integer_sequence
    description: Joins the final_segment and initial_segment in that specific order.
  - name: format_int_list_to_string
    input: transformed_integer_sequence
    output: output_string
    description: Joins the integers in the list with spaces in between to form the output string.
