            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided results indicate that the previously executed code (`code_00.py`) failed to perform the intended transformation, returning the input unchanged for all examples. However, re-evaluating the transformation logic against the examples shows a consistent pattern: the last 3 elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining elements follow in their original order.\n\nManual tracing and the code execution performed in the thought process confirm that this specific logic (a cyclic shift of the last 3 elements to the front) correctly maps the input to the output for all provided training and test examples.\n\nThe discrepancy between the expected logic and the reported results from `code_00.py` likely stems from an issue in how the code was executed or how the input/output was handled (e.g., failing to parse the input string into a list of numbers before applying the transformation logic, or testing a version of the code that omitted these steps).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and documentation to accurately reflect the confirmed logic, including the necessary steps of parsing the input string and formatting the output list. The core transformation rule itself (moving the last 3 elements) appears correct and consistent across all examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were confirmed for all 8 examples (7 train, 1 test) using code execution:\n\n"
