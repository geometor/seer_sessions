**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit numbers. Both the input and output are presented as space-separated strings of these numbers. All provided examples have an input sequence length of 12 numbers. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence, specifically a cyclic shift. The last few elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining initial elements follow.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - representation: space-separated string
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (based on examples)
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - representation: space-separated string
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    description: The output sequence is a reordering of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: split_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - split_point: 3 elements from the end
    outputs:
      - first_part: The first (n-3) elements (where n is total length)
      - last_part: The last 3 elements
  - name: concatenate_parts
    inputs:
      - last_part
      - first_part
    output: output_sequence
    description: Joins the last_part and first_part in that order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of numbers.
2.  Identify the last 3 numbers in the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining numbers (all numbers except the last 3) in their original order.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 3 numbers at the beginning, followed by the identified remaining numbers.
5.  Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.
```python
