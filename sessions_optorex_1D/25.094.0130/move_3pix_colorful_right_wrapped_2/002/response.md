**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The core transformation logic identified previously (moving the last 3 elements to the front) appears correct and holds true for all provided training examples. The errors encountered during testing (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the testing environment is providing a NumPy array.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input is a NumPy array (or similar sequence type) of integers, not a string.
2.  Adapt the transformation logic to operate directly on this array/sequence using slicing and concatenation appropriate for the data type (e.g., NumPy array slicing and `np.concatenate` or list slicing and addition).
3.  Ensure the output format matches the expected format shown in the examples, which is a space-separated string of digits. This means the final step should convert the transformed array/sequence elements back to strings and join them with spaces.

**Metrics:**

Based on the examples and error messages:
*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements for all training examples.
*   **Input Element Type:** Integers (single digits 0-9).
*   **Output Type (Expected):** Space-separated string.
*   **Output Length (Expected):** 12 elements (digits separated by spaces).
*   **Transformation Consistency:** The rule "move the last 3 elements to the beginning" consistently maps the input to the output across all 7 examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray # Updated type
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers (single digits 0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: string # Expected final format
    properties:
      - format: space-separated digits
      - length: represents 12 digits

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence is formed by rearranging the elements of the input sequence.

actions:
  - name: split_input_array # Updated action description

    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output:
      - first_part: numpy.ndarray containing the first 9 elements
      - last_part: numpy.ndarray containing the last 3 elements
  - name: construct_output_array # Updated action description
    actor: transformation_rule
    input:
      - first_part (numpy.ndarray)
      - last_part (numpy.ndarray)
    output: transformed_array (numpy.ndarray)
    details: Concatenate last_part followed by first_part using array manipulation (e.g., np.concatenate).
  - name: format_output_string # New action for formatting
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: transformed_array (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (string)
    details: Convert each integer element in transformed_array to a string and join them with single spaces.

derived_facts:
  - The count of each distinct digit is identical in both the input_sequence and the logical sequence represented by the output_sequence.
  - The transformation is a cyclic rotation: the last 3 elements are moved to the front.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence (specifically, a NumPy array) of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the sub-sequence containing the last 3 integers.
3.  Identify the sub-sequence containing the first 9 integers.
4.  Create a new sequence by concatenating the last 3 integers followed by the first 9 integers, maintaining their relative orders within each sub-sequence.
5.  Convert each integer in the newly constructed sequence into its string representation.
6.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces.
7.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
