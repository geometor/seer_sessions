**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of numbers (represented as space-separated single digits). Each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence. The key observations are:

1.  **Data Type:** The input and output are sequences of integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is constant across all examples (12 digits). The output sequence always has the same length as the input.
3.  **Element Preservation:** The digits present in the output are exactly the same digits as in the input, including their frequencies. This suggests a rearrangement or reordering operation rather than modification, addition, or deletion of digits.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** By comparing the input and output sequences, a clear pattern emerges: the last three digits of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the sequence to form the output. The relative order of these three digits is maintained, and the relative order of the first nine digits is also maintained. This operation is consistent across all provided examples. It resembles a cyclic shift or rotation applied to the sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single digits (0-9)

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence is formed by rearranging the elements of the input sequence.

actions:
  - name: split_input
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_sequence
    output:
      - first_part: first 9 elements of input_sequence
      - last_part: last 3 elements of input_sequence
  - name: construct_output
    actor: transformation_rule
    input:
      - first_part
      - last_part
    output: output_sequence
    details: Concatenate last_part followed by first_part.

derived_facts:
  - The count of each distinct digit is identical in both the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
  - The transformation is a specific type of cyclic permutation (rotating the last 3 elements to the front).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the last 3 digits of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the first 9 digits of the input sequence.
4.  Create a new sequence by placing the identified last 3 digits at the beginning.
5.  Append the identified first 9 digits to the end of the new sequence, maintaining their original relative order.
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence as the output.
