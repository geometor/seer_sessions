            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (moving the last 3 elements to the front) appears correct and holds true for all provided training examples. The errors encountered during testing (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the testing environment is providing a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input is a NumPy array (or similar sequence type) of integers, not a string.\n2.  Adapt the transformation logic to operate directly on this array/sequence using slicing and concatenation appropriate for the data type (e.g., NumPy array slicing and `np.concatenate` or list slicing and addition).\n3.  Ensure the output format matches the expected format shown in the examples, which is a space-separated string of digits. This means the final step should convert the transformed array/sequence elements back to strings and join them with spaces.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the examples and error messages:\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements for all training examples.\n*   **Input Element Type:** Integers (single digits 0-9).\n*   **Output Type (Expected):** Space-separated string.\n*   **Output Length (Expected):** 12 elements (digits separated by spaces).\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** The rule \"move the last 3 elements to the beginning\" consistently maps the input to the output across all 7 examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
