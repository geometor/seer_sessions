Each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence. The key observations are:\n\n1.  **Data Type:** The input and output are sequences of integers.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is constant across all examples (12 digits). The output sequence always has the same length as the input.\n3.  **Element Preservation:** The digits present in the output are exactly the same digits as in the input, including their frequencies. This suggests a rearrangement or reordering operation rather than modification, addition, or deletion of digits.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** By comparing the input and output sequences, a clear pattern emerges: the last three digits of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the sequence to form the output. The relative order of these three digits is maintained, and the relative order of the first nine digits is also maintained. This operation is consistent across all provided examples. It resembles a cyclic shift or rotation applied to the sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
