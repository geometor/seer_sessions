objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single digits (0-9)

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    details: The output sequence is formed by rearranging the elements of the input sequence.

actions:
  - name: split_input
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_sequence
    output:
      - first_part: first 9 elements of input_sequence
      - last_part: last 3 elements of input_sequence
  - name: construct_output
    actor: transformation_rule
    input:
      - first_part
      - last_part
    output: output_sequence
    details: Concatenate last_part followed by first_part.

derived_facts:
  - The count of each distinct digit is identical in both the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
  - The transformation is a specific type of cyclic permutation (rotating the last 3 elements to the front).
