task_elements:
  - input_sequence:
      type: list or 1D numpy array
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The initial sequence of 12 numbers.
  - output_sequence:
      type: list or 1D numpy array
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The transformed sequence of 12 numbers.
  - transformation:
      type: cyclic_shift
      direction: right
      amount: 3 positions
      description: The operation applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
      details:
        - action: Extract the last 3 elements from the input sequence.
        - action: Extract the first 9 elements from the input sequence.
        - action: Concatenate the extracted last 3 elements followed by the extracted first 9 elements to form the output sequence.
relationship:
  - The output sequence is consistently generated by performing a right cyclic shift of the input sequence by exactly 3 positions.
constraints:
  - The length of the sequence is always 12.
  - Elements are integers.
