**General Assessment**

The provided execution results indicate that the `transform` function used in the testing phase did not correctly implement the intended logic derived from the examples. In all cases, the "Transformed Output" was identical to the "Input", resulting in a `Match: False` and varying `Pixels Off` counts. This suggests the executed code likely returned the input array unmodified, despite the natural language program and the helper function `cyclic_shift_right` describing a right cyclic shift by 3 positions.

The core observation – that the transformation involves moving the last 3 elements to the beginning – appears consistent across all examples when comparing inputs and *expected* outputs. The failure lies purely in the previous code's implementation, not in the understanding of the pattern.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule (right cyclic shift by 3) and ensure the subsequent coding phase implements this rule correctly, specifically by calling the `cyclic_shift_right` function (or equivalent logic) within the main `transform` function and returning the *result* of that shift.

**Metrics Gathering**

The execution results provide the necessary metrics:

*   **Consistency:** All 7 training examples failed the validation (`Match: False`).
*   **Error Type:** The error is consistent across examples – the output is identical to the input.
*   **Magnitude (`Pixels Off`):**
    *   Ex 1: 6 (Indices 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11 should change)
    *   Ex 2: 8 (Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 should change)
    *   Ex 3: 8 (Indices 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 should change)
    *   Ex 4: 2 (Indices 0, 1, 11 should change - note 0s overlap)
    *   Ex 5: 7 (Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 should change - note 0s overlap)
    *   Ex 6: 10 (All indices except 4 and 5 contain different numbers between input/expected output)
    *   Ex 7: 12 (All indices contain different numbers between input/expected output)
    *   The `Pixels Off` count varies because it measures the difference between the *expected* output and the *actual* (incorrect) output (which was the input). It reflects how many positions hold different values when comparing the input directly to the expected shifted output.

These metrics uniformly support the conclusion that the implemented function did not perform *any* transformation, let alone the intended cyclic shift.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - input_sequence:
      type: list or 1D numpy array
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The initial sequence of 12 numbers.
  - output_sequence:
      type: list or 1D numpy array
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The transformed sequence of 12 numbers.
  - transformation:
      type: cyclic_shift
      direction: right
      amount: 3 positions
      description: The operation applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
      details:
        - action: Extract the last 3 elements from the input sequence.
        - action: Extract the first 9 elements from the input sequence.
        - action: Concatenate the extracted last 3 elements followed by the extracted first 9 elements to form the output sequence.
relationship:
  - The output sequence is consistently generated by performing a right cyclic shift of the input sequence by exactly 3 positions.
constraints:
  - The length of the sequence is always 12.
  - Elements are integers.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Identify the last 3 elements of the input sequence (at indices 9, 10, 11).
3.  Identify the first 9 elements of the input sequence (at indices 0 through 8).
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 3 elements at the beginning (indices 0, 1, 2), followed by the identified first 9 elements (filling indices 3 through 11).
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.
