## Perception

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers into another sequence of 12 integers. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the transformation appears to be a cyclic shift (or rotation) of the elements. Specifically, the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining first nine elements of the input sequence are shifted to the right to occupy the positions after the moved elements.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - input_sequence:
      type: list
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The initial sequence of numbers.
  - output_sequence:
      type: list
      length: 12
      element_type: integer
      description: The transformed sequence of numbers.
  - transformation:
      type: cyclic_shift
      description: The operation applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
      details:
        - segment_1:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: last 3 elements (indices 9, 10, 11)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2)
            action: move
        - segment_2:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: first 9 elements (indices 0 through 8)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: last 9 elements (indices 3 through 11)
            action: shift_right
relationship:
  - The output sequence is generated by performing a right cyclic shift of the input sequence by 3 positions. Alternatively, it can be seen as taking the last 3 elements of the input and prepending them to the first 9 elements of the input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Extract the last three elements from the input sequence.
3.  Extract the first nine elements from the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the extracted last three elements followed by the extracted first nine elements.
