  - input_sequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error
      shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array based on examples
      dtype: int
      description: The initial sequence of 12 integers provided as a NumPy array.
  - output_sequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should match input type structure
      shape: (12,)
      dtype: int
      description: The transformed sequence of 12 integers as a NumPy array.
  - transformation:
      type: cyclic_shift
      description: The operation applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
      details:
        - segment_1:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: last 3 elements (indices 9, 10, 11)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2)
            action: move
        - segment_2:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: first 9 elements (indices 0 through 8)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: last 9 elements (indices 3 through 11)
            action: shift_right
relationship:
  - The output sequence is generated by performing a right cyclic shift of the input NumPy array by 3 positions. This involves taking the subarray corresponding to the last 3 elements and prepending it to the subarray corresponding to the first 9 elements.
