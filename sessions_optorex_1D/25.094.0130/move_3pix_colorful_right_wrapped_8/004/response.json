            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code failed on all examples because it expected the input to be a string of space-separated integers. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not a string.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the transformation logic to operate directly on the input NumPy array (or a list representation if more convenient) instead of performing string parsing and formatting. The core perceived logic of performing a right cyclic shift by 3 positions seems correct based on the initial examples and needs to be implemented directly on the array data structure.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe code failed uniformly across all training and test examples at the initial parsing stage due to the input type mismatch. Therefore, no meaningful metrics regarding the correctness of the transformation logic itself can be derived from these results. The key metric is:\n\n*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and 1 test example.\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.\n*   **Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method on a NumPy array object, assuming it was a string.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
