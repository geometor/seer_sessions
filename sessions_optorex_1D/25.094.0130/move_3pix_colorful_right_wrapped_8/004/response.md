## General Assessment

The provided code failed on all examples because it expected the input to be a string of space-separated integers. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not a string.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the transformation logic to operate directly on the input NumPy array (or a list representation if more convenient) instead of performing string parsing and formatting. The core perceived logic of performing a right cyclic shift by 3 positions seems correct based on the initial examples and needs to be implemented directly on the array data structure.

## Metrics

The code failed uniformly across all training and test examples at the initial parsing stage due to the input type mismatch. Therefore, no meaningful metrics regarding the correctness of the transformation logic itself can be derived from these results. The key metric is:

*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and 1 test example.
*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.
*   **Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method on a NumPy array object, assuming it was a string.

task_elements:
  - input_sequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error
      shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array based on examples
      dtype: int
      description: The initial sequence of 12 integers provided as a NumPy array.
  - output_sequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should match input type structure
      shape: (12,)
      dtype: int
      description: The transformed sequence of 12 integers as a NumPy array.
  - transformation:
      type: cyclic_shift
      description: The operation applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
      details:
        - segment_1:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: last 3 elements (indices 9, 10, 11)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2)
            action: move
        - segment_2:
            source: input_sequence
            indices: first 9 elements (indices 0 through 8)
            destination: output_sequence
            indices: last 9 elements (indices 3 through 11)
            action: shift_right
relationship:
  - The output sequence is generated by performing a right cyclic shift of the input NumPy array by 3 positions. This involves taking the subarray corresponding to the last 3 elements and prepending it to the subarray corresponding to the first 9 elements.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional array (or list) containing 12 integers.
2.  Extract the subarray containing the last 3 elements (elements at indices 9, 10, and 11).
3.  Extract the subarray containing the first 9 elements (elements at indices 0 through 8).
4.  Construct the output array by concatenating the extracted subarray of the last 3 elements followed by the extracted subarray of the first 9 elements.
5.  Return the resulting 12-element array.
