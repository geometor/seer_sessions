By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the transformation appears to be a cyclic shift (or rotation) of the elements. Specifically, the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the remaining first nine elements of the input sequence are shifted to the right to occupy the positions after the moved elements.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
