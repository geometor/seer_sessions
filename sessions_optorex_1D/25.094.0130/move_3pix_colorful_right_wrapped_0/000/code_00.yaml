Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Properties:
    - Contains numerical elements
    - Fixed length: 12 elements

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Properties:
    - Contains numerical elements
    - Fixed length: 12 elements
    - Elements are the same as the input sequence but reordered

Transformation:
  Action: Circular Shift (Right Rotation)
  Description: The sequence is shifted circularly to the right.
  Details:
    - The last 3 elements of the input sequence become the first 3 elements of the output sequence.
    - The first 9 elements of the input sequence become the last 9 elements of the output sequence.
    - The relative order within the moved group (last 3) is maintained.
    - The relative order within the remaining group (first 9) is maintained.
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions

Examples_Consistent: Yes, all examples follow the same transformation rule.
