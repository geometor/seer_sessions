The output sequence also contains 12 numerical elements. The core transformation appears to be a reordering of the elements within the sequence. By comparing the input and output sequences, a consistent pattern emerges: the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, and the first nine elements of the input sequence follow them, maintaining their original relative order. This is equivalent to a right circular shift of the sequence by 3 positions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
