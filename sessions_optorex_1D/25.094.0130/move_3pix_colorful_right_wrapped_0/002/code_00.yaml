Task: Array Transformation

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Contains numerical elements (integers)
    - Shape: (12,) (1-dimensional array with 12 elements)

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Contains numerical elements (integers)
    - Shape: (12,) (1-dimensional array with 12 elements)
    - Elements are the same as the input array but reordered

Transformation:
  Action: Circular Shift (Right Rotation)
  Library Function: numpy.roll
  Description: The input array is shifted circularly to the right.
  Details:
    - Shift Amount: 3 positions
    - The last 3 elements of the input array become the first 3 elements of the output array.
    - The first 9 elements of the input array become the last 9 elements of the output array.
    - The relative order within the elements is maintained during the shift.

Examples_Consistent: Yes, all verified examples follow the same transformation rule (np.roll(input, 3)).
Input_Type_Confirmed: Yes, input is consistently numpy.ndarray.
Output_Type_Confirmed: Yes, output is consistently numpy.ndarray.
