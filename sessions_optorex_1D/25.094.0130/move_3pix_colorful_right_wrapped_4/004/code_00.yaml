Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  structure: linear list
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  elements: single digits (0-9) - same elements as input
  structure: linear list derived from input
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  action: circular_shift (right)
  amount: 3 positions
  description: The sequence undergoes a right circular shift by 3 positions.
  details:
    - The last 3 elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence.
    - The first 9 elements of the input sequence follow these initial 3 elements.
Consistency: This transformation rule holds true for all provided training examples.
