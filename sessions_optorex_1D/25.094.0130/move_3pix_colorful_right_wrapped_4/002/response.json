            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic as a right circular shift by 3 positions for the sequence of 12 integers. This logic holds true across all provided training examples.\n\nThe errors encountered during testing (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`) stem from an incorrect assumption about the input format provided to the `transform` function *within the testing environment*. The function was written expecting a space-separated string, but the environment appears to be passing a NumPy array (or a similar list-like structure) directly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nThe resolution involves modifying the `transform` function to accept a list or array-like sequence of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`parse_input`) and string formatting (`format_output`) within the core transformation function. The function should operate directly on the sequence data structure and return the transformed sequence in the same format.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\n*   **Input Format:** The error messages confirm the input type in the execution environment is `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Output Format:** The expected output format is likely also `numpy.ndarray` or a standard Python list, consistent with the input.\n*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output examples consistently contain 12 integer elements.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** Manual verification confirms that the rule \"move the last 3 elements to the beginning\" (a right circular shift by 3) applies correctly to all 7 training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
