**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic as a right circular shift by 3 positions for the sequence of 12 integers. This logic holds true across all provided training examples.

The errors encountered during testing (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`) stem from an incorrect assumption about the input format provided to the `transform` function *within the testing environment*. The function was written expecting a space-separated string, but the environment appears to be passing a NumPy array (or a similar list-like structure) directly.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The resolution involves modifying the `transform` function to accept a list or array-like sequence of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`parse_input`) and string formatting (`format_output`) within the core transformation function. The function should operate directly on the sequence data structure and return the transformed sequence in the same format.

**Metrics and Verification:**

*   **Input Format:** The error messages confirm the input type in the execution environment is `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Output Format:** The expected output format is likely also `numpy.ndarray` or a standard Python list, consistent with the input.
*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output examples consistently contain 12 integer elements.
*   **Transformation Consistency:** Manual verification confirms that the rule "move the last 3 elements to the beginning" (a right circular shift by 3) applies correctly to all 7 training examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence # Specifically, likely a numpy.ndarray based on errors
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
Output:
  type: sequence # Corresponding to the input type (e.g., numpy.ndarray or list)
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  shift_amount: 3
  details: The last 3 elements of the input sequence become the first 3 elements of the output sequence. The first 9 elements of the input sequence become the last 9 elements of the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the sub-sequence containing the last three integers.
3.  Identify the sub-sequence containing the first nine integers.
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the sub-sequence of the last three integers followed by the sub-sequence of the first nine integers.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.
