**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of 12 single-digit integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, and the first nine elements of the input sequence follow them. This suggests a rotational shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  delimiter: space
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  delimiter: space
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  shift_amount: 3
  details: The last 3 elements of the input sequence become the first 3 elements of the output sequence. The first 9 elements of the input sequence become the last 9 elements of the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the last three integers in the input sequence.
3.  Identify the first nine integers in the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the identified last three integers followed by the identified first nine integers.
