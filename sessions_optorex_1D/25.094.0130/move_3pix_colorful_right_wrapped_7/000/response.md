*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same integers as the input sequence, but their order is changed.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement across all examples. The last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, and the first nine elements of the input sequence follow them. This is characteristic of a circular shift or rotation.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input_object:
      type: list
      subtype: integer
      length: 12
      element_range: 0-9
    output_object:
      type: list
      subtype: integer
      length: 12
      element_range: 0-9
    transformation:
      type: rearrangement
      subtype: circular_rotation
      details: The elements of the input list are shifted.
    relationship:
      rule: "The output list is formed by rotating the input list to the right by 3 positions."
      input_slice_1: last 3 elements (indices 9, 10, 11)
      input_slice_2: first 9 elements (indices 0 through 8)
      output_composition: concatenate(input_slice_1, input_slice_2)

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 numbers.
    2.  Identify the last 3 numbers in the sequence.
    3.  Identify the first 9 numbers in the sequence.
    4.  Create the output sequence by placing the identified last 3 numbers at the beginning, followed by the identified first 9 numbers.
    5.  Return the newly created sequence.
