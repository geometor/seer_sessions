*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same integers as the input sequence, but their order is changed.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement across all examples. The last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, and the first nine elements of the input sequence follow them. This is characteristic of a circular shift or rotation.

*   **Facts:**

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation rule as a circular right rotation by 3 positions. However, the provided Python code was designed to operate on space-separated strings, while the execution environment supplied NumPy arrays as input. This type mismatch caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples. The strategy is to adapt the code to handle NumPy arrays directly, using array slicing and concatenation instead of string methods. One of the previously provided code examples already used NumPy correctly; that implementation should be adopted.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example.
    *   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.
    *   **Consistency:** The same error occurred in every case, indicating a consistent input type mismatch (NumPy array provided, string expected by the tested code).
    *   **Transformation Rule Confirmation:** Although execution failed, comparing the input/output pairs visually confirms the "rotate right by 3" rule holds true for all provided examples. The last three elements consistently move to the front.

*   **Facts:**
