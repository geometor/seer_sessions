*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The output sequence contains the exact same integers as the input sequence, but their order is changed.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement across all examples. The last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, and the first nine elements of the input sequence follow them. This is characteristic of a circular shift or rotation.

*   **Facts:**

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This clearly indicates that the input data type provided to the `transform` function is a NumPy array, not a string as initially assumed in the previous code.
    *   The core transformation logic observed (moving the last 3 elements to the beginning) appears consistent across all examples when visually inspecting the numerical sequences.
    *   The strategy for resolution is straightforward: modify the natural language program and subsequent code to handle the input as a NumPy array, using array slicing and concatenation methods appropriate for this data type.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** NumPy array (as indicated by the error).
    *   **Input Length:** 12 elements in all training examples.
    *   **Output Length:** 12 elements in all training examples.
    *   **Element Type:** Single-digit integers (0-9 observed).
    *   **Transformation:** Consistent across all examples - the last 3 elements of the input array become the first 3 elements of the output array, followed by the first 9 elements of the input array. This is equivalent to a right circular rotation by 3 positions.

*   **Facts:**

    1.  Take the input NumPy array of 12 numbers.
    2.  Select the slice containing the last 3 numbers of the input array (elements at indices 9, 10, and 11).
    3.  Select the slice containing the first 9 numbers of the input array (elements at indices 0 through 8).
    4.  Create the output array by concatenating the slice of the last 3 numbers followed by the slice of the first 9 numbers.
    5.  Return the newly created array.
