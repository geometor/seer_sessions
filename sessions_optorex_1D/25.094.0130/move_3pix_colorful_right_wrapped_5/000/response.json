The corresponding output is also a string of 12 digits separated by spaces. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the first nine elements are shifted to the right to accommodate them. This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the specific digits or the presence of zeros. The transformation is a fixed-size circular shift (rotation) to the right.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
