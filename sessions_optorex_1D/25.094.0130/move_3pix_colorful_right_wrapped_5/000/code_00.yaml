task_description: Rearrange elements within a sequence of digits.
input_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
  length: 12
output_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
  length: 12
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  direction: right
  shift_amount: 3
  details: The last 3 elements of the input sequence become the first 3 elements of the output sequence. The first 9 elements of the input sequence become the last 9 elements of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
examples_consistency: All provided examples follow the same transformation rule.
