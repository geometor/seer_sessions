            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided information includes input-output examples, a preliminary analysis identifying a circular right shift, Python code implementing this shift, and execution results. A significant discrepancy exists: the input-output examples consistently demonstrate a circular right shift of 3 positions, but the execution results report that the transformation produced an output identical to the input for all cases.\n\nThis suggests a potential issue in the execution or reporting phase of the provided results, rather than an error in the initial analysis or the Python code's logic. The `transform` function described correctly implements the observed pattern from the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Trust the Examples:** Assume the input-output pairs provided initially are the ground truth for the task's transformation rule.\n2.  **Validate the Rule:** Confirm that the \"circular right shift by 3\" rule consistently explains the transformation for all provided examples (train and test).\n3.  **Report Discrepancy:** Acknowledge the execution results but state that they contradict the examples and the code's intent, likely indicating an error in the testing harness or reporting.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based *only* on the validated transformation rule derived from the examples.\n\n## Metrics and Rule Validation\n\nThe core task appears to be transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Let's verify the \"circular right shift by 3\" hypothesis against all examples. A circular right shift by 3 moves the last 3 elements to the front.\n\n"
