task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 digits using a circular shift.
input_object:
  type: sequence
  subtype: string
  elements: 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
  structure: 1D array or list of strings/integers.
output_object:
  type: sequence
  subtype: string
  elements: 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
  structure: 1D array or list of strings/integers.
transformation:
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 3 positions
  operand: the entire input sequence
  process:
    - Identify the last 3 elements of the input sequence.
    - Identify the first 9 elements of the input sequence.
    - Concatenate the identified last 3 elements followed by the identified first 9 elements to form the output sequence.
properties:
  - conservation: All original digits are preserved in the output.
  - order: The relative order within the last 3 elements is preserved.
  - order: The relative order within the first 9 elements is preserved.
  - size: The length of the sequence remains 12.
consistency_check:
  - rule: The circular right shift by 3 rule consistently matches all provided input/output examples (train and test).
  - execution_results_discrepancy: The provided execution results (showing output identical to input) contradict the examples and are likely erroneous; they are disregarded for rule definition.
