task_description: Rearrange elements within a fixed-size sequence of numbers.
input_object:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  properties:
    shape: (12,)
    dtype: integer
    description: A sequence of 12 integers.
output_object:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  properties:
    shape: (12,)
    dtype: integer
    description: A sequence of 12 integers, rearranged from the input.
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  action: Apply a circular shift to the elements of the input array.
  details:
    - Identify the sequence of the last 3 elements in the input array.
    - Identify the sequence of the first 9 elements in the input array.
    - Construct the output array by concatenating the sequence of the last 3 elements followed by the sequence of the first 9 elements.
  direction: right
  shift_amount: 3
consistency: The transformation rule is consistently applied across all provided examples.
