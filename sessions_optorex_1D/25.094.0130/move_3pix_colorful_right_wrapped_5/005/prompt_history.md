## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 single digits. Each input example consists of a string of 12 digits separated by spaces. The corresponding output is also a string of 12 digits separated by spaces. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the last three elements of the input sequence are moved to the beginning of the output sequence, while the first nine elements are shifted to the right to accommodate them. This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the specific digits or the presence of zeros. The transformation is a fixed-size circular shift (rotation) to the right.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements within a sequence of digits.
input_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
  length: 12
output_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit (represented as strings, separated by spaces)
  length: 12
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  direction: right
  shift_amount: 3
  details: The last 3 elements of the input sequence become the first 3 elements of the output sequence. The first 9 elements of the input sequence become the last 9 elements of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
examples_consistency: All provided examples follow the same transformation rule.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the last 3 digits of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the first 9 digits of the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the identified last 3 digits, followed by the identified first 9 digits, maintaining the internal order within both subsequences.
5.  Format the resulting sequence as a string with digits separated by spaces.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided information includes input-output examples, a preliminary analysis identifying a circular right shift, Python code implementing this shift, and execution results. A significant discrepancy exists: the input-output examples consistently demonstrate a circular right shift of 3 positions, but the execution results report that the transformation produced an output identical to the input for all cases.

This suggests a potential issue in the execution or reporting phase of the provided results, rather than an error in the initial analysis or the Python code's logic. The `transform` function described correctly implements the observed pattern from the examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Trust the Examples:** Assume the input-output pairs provided initially are the ground truth for the task's transformation rule.
2.  **Validate the Rule:** Confirm that the "circular right shift by 3" rule consistently explains the transformation for all provided examples (train and test).
3.  **Report Discrepancy:** Acknowledge the execution results but state that they contradict the examples and the code's intent, likely indicating an error in the testing harness or reporting.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based *only* on the validated transformation rule derived from the examples.

## Metrics and Rule Validation

The core task appears to be transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Let's verify the "circular right shift by 3" hypothesis against all examples. A circular right shift by 3 moves the last 3 elements to the front.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def circular_shift_right(data_str, shift):
    """Performs a circular right shift on a space-separated string sequence."""
    items = data_str.split(' ')
    if len(items) == 0:
        return ""
    shift = shift % len(items) # Ensure shift is within bounds
    shifted_items = items[-shift:] + items[:-shift]
    return ' '.join(shifted_items)

    {"input": "0 8 5 5 8 7 5 7 4 7 0 0", "output": "7 0 0 0 8 5 5 8 7 5 7 4"}  # test_1

print("The execution results provided earlier indicated that the transformation output was identical to the input.")
print("This conflicts with the input/output examples and the validated rule (circular right shift by 3).")
print("The analysis proceeds based on the validated rule derived from the examples.")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Rule Validation: Circular Right Shift by 3
All examples match rule: True

Discrepancy Note:
The execution results provided earlier indicated that the transformation output was identical to the input.
This conflicts with the input/output examples and the validated rule (circular right shift by 3).
The analysis proceeds based on the validated rule derived from the examples.

```
The validation confirms that a circular right shift by 3 consistently transforms the input to the expected output across all provided examples. The execution results showing no change are therefore disregarded as erroneous for the purpose of defining the transformation rule.

```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 digits using a circular shift.
input_object:
  type: sequence
  subtype: string
  elements: 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
  structure: 1D array or list of strings/integers.
output_object:
  type: sequence
  subtype: string
  elements: 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
  structure: 1D array or list of strings/integers.
transformation:
  action: circular_shift
  direction: right
  amount: 3 positions
  operand: the entire input sequence
  process:
    - Identify the last 3 elements of the input sequence.
    - Identify the first 9 elements of the input sequence.
    - Concatenate the identified last 3 elements followed by the identified first 9 elements to form the output sequence.
properties:
  - conservation: All original digits are preserved in the output.
  - order: The relative order within the last 3 elements is preserved.
  - order: The relative order within the first 9 elements is preserved.
  - size: The length of the sequence remains 12.
consistency_check:
  - rule: The circular right shift by 3 rule consistently matches all provided input/output examples (train and test).
  - execution_results_discrepancy: The provided execution results (showing output identical to input) contradict the examples and are likely erroneous; they are disregarded for rule definition.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input, which is a sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Partition the input sequence into two parts:
    *   The "tail": the last 3 digits of the sequence.
    *   The "head": the first 9 digits of the sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the "tail" followed by the "head". The internal order of digits within the original "tail" and "head" parts must be maintained.
4.  Return the constructed sequence, formatted identically to the input (e.g., digits separated by spaces if the input was a string).
