Specifically, the elements from the beginning of the input sequence appear at the end of the output sequence, and the elements from later in the input sequence appear earlier in the output sequence. This pattern strongly indicates a cyclic shift or rotation operation.\n    *   Observing `train_1`: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 6` -> `0 0 0 0 0 6 7 6 0 0 0 0`. The first four elements `0 0 0 0` seem to have moved to the end.\n    *   Observing `train_2`: `3 6 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 6 4 4`. The first four elements `3 6 4 4` have moved to the end.\n    *   This pattern holds across all examples, confirming a left cyclic shift by 4 positions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
