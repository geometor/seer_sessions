Accept the input, which is a grid structure containing one row of 12 integers.
Extract this single row of 12 integers into a list format.
Inspect the first integer (at index 0) in this list.
If the first integer is 0, perform a circular left shift on the list by 4 positions (the first 4 elements wrap around to the end).
If the first integer is non-zero, perform a circular right shift on the list by 8 positions (the last 8 elements wrap around to the beginning).
Take the resulting list after the shift and format it back into the original grid structure (one row, 12 columns).
Return this new grid structure as the output.
