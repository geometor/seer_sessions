"""
Examine the input sequence (represented as a list or grid row) of 12 integers.
Check the value of the integer at the first position (index 0).
If the first integer is equal to 0, perform a circular rotation of the entire sequence 4 positions to the left.
If the first integer is not equal to 0, perform a circular rotation of the entire sequence 8 positions to the right.
The resulting sequence after the rotation is the output.
