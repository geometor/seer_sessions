Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain single digits, predominantly zeros, with a few non-zero digits scattered within.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a circular shift or rotation. The digits themselves are preserved, but their positions change.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the sequence is rotated seems to depend on the input itself. Comparing examples like `train_1` (starts with 0) and `train_2` (starts with 4), the resulting rotation is different.
    *   In `train_1`, `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. This is a left rotation by 4 positions.
    *   In `train_2`, `4 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 7 0`. This is a right rotation by 8 positions.
    *   Checking other examples: `train_4, train_5, train_6, train_7` all start with 0 and undergo a left rotation by 4. `train_3` starts with 9 (non-zero) and undergoes a right rotation by 8.
5.  **Rule Identification:** The condition determining the rotation seems to be the value of the *first* element in the input sequence. If the first element is 0, the sequence is rotated left by 4 positions. If the first element is non-zero, the sequence is rotated right by 8 positions.

**YAML Fact Document:**

Task: Conditional Circular Rotation

    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Single digits (0-9)

  - name: OutputSequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Single digits (0-9), rearranged from InputSequence

Actions:
  - name: CheckFirstElement
    input: InputSequence
    output: Boolean (is_first_element_zero)
    description: Determines if the element at index 0 of the InputSequence is 0.

  - name: RotateLeft
    input: 
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - positions: 4
    output: RotatedSequence (List[int])
    description: Performs a circular left rotation on the sequence by the specified number of positions.

  - name: RotateRight
    input:
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - positions: 8
    output: RotatedSequence (List[int])
    description: Performs a circular right rotation on the sequence by the specified number of positions.

Relationships:
  - condition: If CheckFirstElement(InputSequence) is true (first element is 0)
    action: OutputSequence = RotateLeft(InputSequence, 4)
  - condition: If CheckFirstElement(InputSequence) is false (first element is non-zero)
    action: OutputSequence = RotateRight(InputSequence, 8)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Check the value of the integer at the first position (index 0).
3.  If the first integer is equal to 0, perform a circular rotation of the entire sequence 4 positions to the left.
4.  If the first integer is not equal to 0, perform a circular rotation of the entire sequence 8 positions to the right.
5.  The resulting sequence after the rotation is the output.
