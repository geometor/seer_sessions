            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.\n2.  **Content:** The sequences contain single digits, predominantly zeros, with a few non-zero digits scattered within.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a circular shift or rotation. The digits themselves are preserved, but their positions change.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the sequence is rotated seems to depend on the input itself. Comparing examples like `train_1` (starts with 0) and `train_2` (starts with 4), the resulting rotation is different.\n    *   In `train_1`, `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. This is a left rotation by 4 positions.\n    *   In `train_2`, `4 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 7 0`. This is a right rotation by 8 positions.\n    *   Checking other examples: `train_4, train_5, train_6, train_7` all start with 0 and undergo a left rotation by 4. `train_3` starts with 9 (non-zero) and undergoes a right rotation by 8.\n5.  **Rule Identification:** The condition determining the rotation seems to be the value of the *first* element in the input sequence. If the first element is 0, the sequence is rotated left by 4 positions. If the first element is non-zero, the sequence is rotated right by 8 positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
