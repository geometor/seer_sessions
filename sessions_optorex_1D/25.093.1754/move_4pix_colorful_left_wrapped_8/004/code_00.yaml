task_type: sequence_manipulation
input:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
transformation:
  action: split_and_swap
  split_point: fixed, after the 4th element (index 4)
  segments_definition:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input sequence (indices 0-3).
    - segment_2: The remaining 8 elements of the input sequence (indices 4-11).
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
constraints:
  - Input sequence length must be 12.
  - Element order within each segment must be preserved during the swap.
execution_notes:
  - Previous execution run failed to apply the transformation, resulting in output identical to input.
  - The transformation logic itself has been verified against all examples and is correct.
