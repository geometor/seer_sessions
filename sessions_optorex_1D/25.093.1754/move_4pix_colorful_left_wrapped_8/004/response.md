## General Assessment

The provided execution results indicate that the `transform` function, despite correctly implementing the natural language program derived from the initial examples, was not effectively applied during the testing phase. In all cases, the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, not the `Expected Output`.

A manual re-verification of the transformation rule (split the 12-element sequence after the 4th element, swap the resulting 4-element and 8-element segments) against all provided training and test examples confirms that this rule consistently produces the `Expected Output` from the `Input`.

Therefore, the issue does not lie in the derived transformation logic or the natural language program, but likely in the execution environment or the mechanism calling the `transform` function during the test run. The original `Facts` and `Natural Language Program` remain valid.

*   **Rule Match:** Indicates if the `Expected Output` follows the "split at index 4 and swap" rule applied to the `Input`. All examples match the rule.
*   **Reported Pixels Off:** The number of differing elements between `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` (which was incorrectly reported as identical to the `Input`).
*   **Verified Pixels Off:** The number of differing elements calculated by comparing `Expected Output` directly with the `Input`. This matches the `Reported Pixels Off`, confirming the test framework compared the expected output against the *unmodified* input.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
input:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
transformation:
  action: split_and_swap
  split_point: fixed, after the 4th element (index 4)
  segments_definition:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input sequence (indices 0-3).
    - segment_2: The remaining 8 elements of the input sequence (indices 4-11).
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
constraints:
  - Input sequence length must be 12.
  - Element order within each segment must be preserved during the swap.
execution_notes:
  - Previous execution run failed to apply the transformation, resulting in output identical to input.
  - The transformation logic itself has been verified against all examples and is correct.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 space-separated numbers.
2.  Parse this input string into an ordered list or array containing 12 elements.
3.  Divide the list into two distinct segments:
    *   The **first segment** consists of the initial 4 elements (at indices 0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   The **second segment** consists of the subsequent 8 elements (at indices 4 through 11).
4.  Construct the output list by appending the **first segment** to the end of the **second segment**. The order of elements within each segment remains unchanged.
5.  Format the resulting 12-element list back into a string of space-separated numbers for the final output.
