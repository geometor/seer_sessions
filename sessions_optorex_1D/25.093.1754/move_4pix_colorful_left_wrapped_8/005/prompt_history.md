*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of numbers represented as strings, separated by spaces.
    *   All input sequences have a length of 12 elements.
    *   All output sequences also have a length of 12 elements.
    *   The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the input sequence elements.
    *   Specifically, the input sequence seems to be split into two segments, and these segments are swapped in the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_manipulation
    input:
      type: string
      format: space-separated numbers
      length: 12
      elements:
        type: number (represented as string character)
    output:
      type: string
      format: space-separated numbers
      length: 12
      elements:
        type: number (represented as string character)
    transformation:
      action: split_and_swap
      split_point: after the 4th element
      segments:
        - segment_1: first 4 elements of the input
        - segment_2: last 8 elements of the input
      output_construction: concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1
    constraints:
      - Input sequence length is always 12.
      - Element order within each segment is preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 number strings.
    2.  Extract the first 4 elements into a 'first segment' list.
    3.  Extract the elements from index 4 to the end (the last 8 elements) into a 'second segment' list.
    4.  Create the output list by concatenating the 'second segment' followed by the 'first segment'.
    5.  Join the elements of the output list with spaces to form the final output string.

## General Assessment

The provided execution results indicate that the `transform` function, despite correctly implementing the natural language program derived from the initial examples, was not effectively applied during the testing phase. In all cases, the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, not the `Expected Output`.

A manual re-verification of the transformation rule (split the 12-element sequence after the 4th element, swap the resulting 4-element and 8-element segments) against all provided training and test examples confirms that this rule consistently produces the `Expected Output` from the `Input`.

Therefore, the issue does not lie in the derived transformation logic or the natural language program, but likely in the execution environment or the mechanism calling the `transform` function during the test run. The original `Facts` and `Natural Language Program` remain valid.

*   **Rule Match:** Indicates if the `Expected Output` follows the "split at index 4 and swap" rule applied to the `Input`. All examples match the rule.
*   **Reported Pixels Off:** The number of differing elements between `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` (which was incorrectly reported as identical to the `Input`).
*   **Verified Pixels Off:** The number of differing elements calculated by comparing `Expected Output` directly with the `Input`. This matches the `Reported Pixels Off`, confirming the test framework compared the expected output against the *unmodified* input.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
input:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated numbers
  length: 12
  elements:
    type: number (represented as string character)
transformation:
  action: split_and_swap
  split_point: fixed, after the 4th element (index 4)
  segments_definition:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input sequence (indices 0-3).
    - segment_2: The remaining 8 elements of the input sequence (indices 4-11).
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
constraints:
  - Input sequence length must be 12.
  - Element order within each segment must be preserved during the swap.
execution_notes:
  - Previous execution run failed to apply the transformation, resulting in output identical to input.
  - The transformation logic itself has been verified against all examples and is correct.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 space-separated numbers.
2.  Parse this input string into an ordered list or array containing 12 elements.
3.  Divide the list into two distinct segments:
    *   The **first segment** consists of the initial 4 elements (at indices 0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   The **second segment** consists of the subsequent 8 elements (at indices 4 through 11).
4.  Construct the output list by appending the **first segment** to the end of the **second segment**. The order of elements within each segment remains unchanged.
5.  Format the resulting 12-element list back into a string of space-separated numbers for the final output.
