            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided training examples and error logs confirm the initial hypothesis about the transformation. The input is consistently a string of 12 space-separated numbers. The transformation involves splitting this sequence into two parts: the first 4 elements and the last 8 elements. The output is formed by concatenating the second part (last 8 elements) followed by the first part (first 4 elements). The errors reported previously (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) stemmed from an incorrect implementation attempt (likely using NumPy array methods unsuitable for the string/list manipulation required) rather than a misunderstanding of the core transformation logic. The Python code version using string splitting and list manipulation correctly captured the rule.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent evidence across all examples. The focus should remain on string parsing, list slicing, and list concatenation, as these operations accurately model the required transformation for the given data format. The natural language program and facts should reflect this string/list-based approach.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The `tool_code` analysis verified the following for all 7 training examples:\n    *   Input Type: String\n    *   Input Structure: 12 space-separated numeric characters (strings).\n    *   Output Type: String\n    *   Output Structure: 12 space-separated numeric characters (strings).\n    *   Transformation Consistency: The rule of splitting the input list representation at index 4 (`input[4:] + input[:4]`) correctly produced the output for all examples.\n    *   Element Type: All individual elements obtained after splitting the string are confirmed to be strings.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
