*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided training examples and error logs confirm the initial hypothesis about the transformation. The input is consistently a string of 12 space-separated numbers. The transformation involves splitting this sequence into two parts: the first 4 elements and the last 8 elements. The output is formed by concatenating the second part (last 8 elements) followed by the first part (first 4 elements). The errors reported previously (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) stemmed from an incorrect implementation attempt (likely using NumPy array methods unsuitable for the string/list manipulation required) rather than a misunderstanding of the core transformation logic. The Python code version using string splitting and list manipulation correctly captured the rule.

*   **Strategy for Resolution:**
    The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent evidence across all examples. The focus should remain on string parsing, list slicing, and list concatenation, as these operations accurately model the required transformation for the given data format. The natural language program and facts should reflect this string/list-based approach.

*   **Metrics:**
    The `tool_code` analysis verified the following for all 7 training examples:
    *   Input Type: String
    *   Input Structure: 12 space-separated numeric characters (strings).
    *   Output Type: String
    *   Output Structure: 12 space-separated numeric characters (strings).
    *   Transformation Consistency: The rule of splitting the input list representation at index 4 (`input[4:] + input[:4]`) correctly produced the output for all examples.
    *   Element Type: All individual elements obtained after splitting the string are confirmed to be strings.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_rearrangement
    input:
      type: string
      description: A sequence of 12 single-digit numbers represented as characters, separated by spaces.
      example_element: '1'
      length: 12 elements (when split by space)
      delimiter: space (' ')
    output:
      type: string
      description: A sequence of 12 single-digit numbers represented as characters, separated by spaces, rearranged from the input.
      length: 12 elements (when split by space)
      delimiter: space (' ')
    transformation:
      operation: segment_swap
      description: Splits the input sequence into two segments and swaps their order.
      input_representation: List of strings derived from splitting the input string by spaces.
      split_point: After the 4th element (at index 4 of the list representation).
      segments:
        - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the list (indices 0-3).
        - segment_2: The last 8 elements of the list (indices 4-11).
      output_construction:
        - Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1 to form the output list.
        - Join the elements of the output list using a space delimiter to form the output string.
    constraints:
      - Input string always contains 12 space-separated elements.
      - Elements within each segment maintain their relative order.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input string which contains 12 space-separated number characters.
    2.  Split the input string by the space delimiter to create a list of 12 string elements.
    3.  Isolate the first segment, which consists of the first 4 elements from the list (indices 0 through 3).
    4.  Isolate the second segment, which consists of the remaining 8 elements from the list (indices 4 through 11).
    5.  Create a new list by placing the second segment first, followed by the first segment.
    6.  Join the elements of this new list together into a single string, using a space as the separator between elements.
    7.  Return the resulting string.
