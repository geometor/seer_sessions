objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12
      - dtype: integer # Based on example values
  - name: first_part
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    properties:
      - elements: First 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 0-3)
      - length: 4
  - name: second_part
    type: numpy.ndarray or list
    properties:
      - elements: Last 8 elements of input_sequence (indices 4-11)
      - length: 8
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray or list # Intermediate representation before formatting
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - format: Space-separated integers

actions:
  - name: receive_input
    description: Accepts a NumPy array representing the sequence.
    inputs:
      - numpy.ndarray
    outputs:
      - input_sequence
  - name: split
    description: Divide the input sequence array into two parts based on index.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
    outputs:
      - first_part
      - second_part
    parameters:
      - split_index: 4
  - name: concatenate
    description: Combine the two parts in swapped order.
    inputs:
      - second_part
      - first_part
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the combined sequence array/list into a space-separated string.
    inputs:
      - output_sequence
    outputs:
      - output_string

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is formed by concatenating the second_part followed by the first_part of the input_sequence.
  - The output_string is the string representation of the output_sequence with elements joined by spaces.
