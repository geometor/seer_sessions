The input sequence is transformed into an output sequence of the same length (12 elements). The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be divided into two parts, which are then swapped to form the output sequence. The split point appears constant across all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
