  - name: element
    type: integer
  - name: first_part
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - location: elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 4
      - length: 4
  - name: second_part
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - location: elements from index 4 up to the end (index 11)

actions:
  - name: split
    description: Divide the input sequence into two parts.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - first_part
      - second_part
    parameters:
      - split_index: 4
  - name: swap
    description: Exchange the positions of the two parts.
  - name: join
    description: Concatenate the swapped parts to form the output sequence.
    inputs:
      - second_part
      - first_part
    outputs:
      - output_sequence

relationships:
  - The output sequence is formed by concatenating the second_part followed by the first_part of the input sequence.
