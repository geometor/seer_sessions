"""
Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, 12).
Extract the 1D sequence of 12 integer elements from the first (and only) row of the input array.
Split this 1D sequence into two parts: the `first_part` containing the initial 4 elements (indices 0 through 3) and the `second_part` containing the remaining 8 elements (indices 4 through 11).
Construct a new 1D sequence by concatenating the `second_part` followed by the `first_part`.
Convert the elements of this new sequence into strings.
Join the string elements with single spaces to create the final output string.
