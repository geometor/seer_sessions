**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code consistently failed across all training and test examples with the error `Input array must have shape (12,), but got (1, 12)`. This indicates that the `transform` function received a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a row vector with shape 1x12) instead of the expected 1D array (with shape 12,). The core transformation logic (splitting the sequence at index 4, swapping the two parts, and rejoining them) appears to be consistent with the input/output pairs observed initially. The strategy for resolving the error is to modify the code to correctly handle the input array's shape, likely by selecting the first row (`input_array[0]`) or flattening the array (`input_array.flatten()`) before applying the splitting and concatenation logic.

**Metrics:**

The primary metric gathered from the execution results is the shape of the input NumPy array provided to the `transform` function.

*   **Input Array Shape:** Consistently `(1, 12)` across all examples.
*   **Expected Array Shape (by previous code):** `(12,)`
*   **Result:** `ValueError` due to shape mismatch in all cases.

No further code execution is needed to confirm these metrics, as the error message is explicit and consistent.

    properties:
      - location: elements from index 4 up to the end (index 11)

actions:
  - name: extract_sequence
    description: Extract the 1D sequence of 12 elements from the input 2D array (shape 1x12).
    inputs:
      - input_array
    outputs:
      - sequence
  - name: split
    description: Divide the extracted 1D sequence into two parts.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - first_part
      - second_part
    parameters:
      - split_index: 4
  - name: swap_and_join
    description: Concatenate the second_part followed by the first_part.
    inputs:
      - second_part
      - first_part
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the elements of the output sequence to strings and join them with spaces.
    inputs:
      - output_sequence
    outputs:
      - output_string

relationships:
  - The output string is formed by first extracting the 1D sequence from the 1x12 input array, splitting this sequence at index 4, concatenating the part from index 4 onwards followed by the part from index 0 to 3, and formatting the result as a space-separated string.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, 12).
2.  Extract the 1D sequence of 12 integer elements from the first (and only) row of the input array.
3.  Split this 1D sequence into two parts: the `first_part` containing the initial 4 elements (indices 0 through 3) and the `second_part` containing the remaining 8 elements (indices 4 through 11).
4.  Construct a new 1D sequence by concatenating the `second_part` followed by the `first_part`.
5.  Convert the elements of this new sequence into strings.
6.  Join the string elements with single spaces to create the final output string.
