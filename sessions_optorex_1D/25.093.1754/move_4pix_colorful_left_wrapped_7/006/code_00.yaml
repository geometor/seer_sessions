actions:
  - name: extract_sequence
    description: Extract the 1D sequence of 12 elements from the input 2D array (shape 1x12).
    inputs:
      - input_array
    outputs:
      - sequence
  - name: split
    description: Divide the extracted 1D sequence into two parts.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - first_part
      - second_part
    parameters:
      - split_index: 4
  - name: swap_and_join
    description: Concatenate the second_part followed by the first_part.
    inputs:
      - second_part
      - first_part
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the elements of the output sequence to strings and join them with spaces.
    inputs:
      - output_sequence
    outputs:
      - output_string

relationships:
  - The output string is formed by first extracting the 1D sequence from the 1x12 input array, splitting this sequence at index 4, concatenating the part from index 4 onwards followed by the part from index 0 to 3, and formatting the result as a space-separated string.
