            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided Python code consistently failed across all training and test examples with the error `Input array must have shape (12,), but got (1, 12)`. This indicates that the `transform` function received a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a row vector with shape 1x12) instead of the expected 1D array (with shape 12,). The core transformation logic (splitting the sequence at index 4, swapping the two parts, and rejoining them) appears to be consistent with the input/output pairs observed initially. The strategy for resolving the error is to modify the code to correctly handle the input array's shape, likely by selecting the first row (`input_array[0]`) or flattening the array (`input_array.flatten()`) before applying the splitting and concatenation logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe primary metric gathered from the execution results is the shape of the input NumPy array provided to the `transform` function.\n\n*   **Input Array Shape:** Consistently `(1, 12)` across all examples.\n*   **Expected Array Shape (by previous code):** `(12,)`\n*   **Result:** `ValueError` due to shape mismatch in all cases.\n\nNo further code execution is needed to confirm these metrics, as the error message is explicit and consistent.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
