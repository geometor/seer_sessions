            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code failed consistently across all examples with a `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`. This indicates that the `input_str` variable, expected to be a string, is actually being passed as a bytes object to the `re.findall` function. The underlying transformation logic (splitting the sequence at the 4th element and swapping the two parts) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs, but the code needs modification to handle the byte-string input type mismatch.\n\nThe strategy is to update the code to first decode the input bytes object into a string (assuming a standard encoding like UTF-8) before proceeding with the regular expression parsing and subsequent transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe primary metric gathered is the consistent failure across all examples due to the `TypeError`. This suggests the input type issue is universal for this task's execution environment, rather than being specific to certain inputs. No processing beyond the initial parsing attempt occurred, so metrics comparing expected vs. actual outputs cannot be generated yet.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `bytes` based on the error.\n*   **Error:** `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`.\n*   **Consistency:** Error occurs in 100% of training and test examples provided.\n*   **Transformation Logic Status:** Believed to be correct, but not yet successfully executed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
