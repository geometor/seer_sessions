objects:
  - name: input_data
    type: bytes sequence
    description: Represents the raw input which is likely a sequence of bytes.
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers derived from the input data after decoding and parsing.
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: element
    type: integer
    description: Individual numbers within the sequence.
  - name: first_part
    type: sub-sequence
    description: The first segment of the numerical sequence.
    properties:
      - location: elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 4
      - length: 4
  - name: second_part
    type: sub-sequence
    description: The second segment of the numerical sequence.
    properties:
      - location: elements from index 4 up to the end (index 11)
      - length: 8
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The rearranged sequence of numbers.
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: The final space-separated string representation of the output sequence.

actions:
  - name: decode
    description: Convert the input bytes sequence into a string using UTF-8 encoding.
    inputs:
      - input_data
    outputs:
      - decoded_string
  - name: parse
    description: Extract the sequence of integers from the decoded string.
    inputs:
      - decoded_string
    outputs:
      - sequence
  - name: split
    description: Divide the integer sequence into two parts at a fixed index.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - first_part
      - second_part
    parameters:
      - split_index: 4
  - name: swap_and_join
    description: Concatenate the second part followed by the first part to form the output sequence.
    inputs:
      - second_part
      - first_part
    outputs:
      - output_sequence
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the output integer sequence back into a space-separated string.
    inputs:
      - output_sequence
    outputs:
      - output_string

relationships:
  - The output_string is formed by decoding the input_data, parsing it into a sequence, splitting the sequence, swapping the parts, joining them, and formatting the result as a space-separated string.
