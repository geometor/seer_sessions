## Perception of the Elements

The task involves manipulating a sequence of 12 single digits. Each input is a list of 12 integers. Each output is also a list of 12 integers, representing a rearrangement of the input sequence. The core operation appears to be a division of the input sequence into two segments and then swapping their positions.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 digits by splitting it into two parts and swapping their order.
input_data:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  constraints: Elements are single digits (0-9).
output_data:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  derivation: Rearrangement of the input list.
transformation:
  action: Split and Swap
  split_point: Fixed index 4 (after the 4th element)
  segments:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input list.
    - segment_2: The elements from index 4 to 11 (the last 8 elements) of the input list.
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
relationships:
  - The output list contains exactly the same elements as the input list, but in a different order.
  - The length of the input and output lists is constant (12).
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Divide the sequence into two parts:
    a.  The first part consists of the first 4 digits (indices 0 to 3).
    b.  The second part consists of the remaining 8 digits (indices 4 to 11).
3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the second part followed by the first part.
