            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the sequence of 12 digits after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting segments. However, the execution failed across all examples. The error message, \"Input data must contain exactly 12 elements,\" strongly indicates an issue with how the input was handled *before* or *during* the transformation function call, specifically related to type or structure.\n\nThe provided `transform` function expected a list or NumPy array as input, while the task examples present the input as a space-separated string. When the testing harness likely passed the raw string to the `transform` function, the internal `np.array()` conversion and subsequent shape check (`input_array.shape[0] != 12`) would fail, as converting a string like `\"6 9 5 0 ...\"` to a NumPy array does not result in a 12-element array, leading to the observed error.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to ensure the transformation process includes:\n1.  Parsing the input string into a list (or array) of 12 integers.\n2.  Applying the validated split-and-swap logic to this list/array.\n3.  Formatting the resulting list/array back into a space-separated string for the final output.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nBased on the analysis and `tool_code` execution:\n\n1.  **Input Format:** All provided inputs (`train_1` to `train_7`) are strings containing 12 space-separated single digits.\n2.  **Parsing:** Parsing each input string by splitting on spaces and converting to integers consistently yields a list of 12 integers.\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** The rule \"Split the list of 12 integers after the 4th element (at index 4), creating a first segment of 4 elements and a second segment of 8 elements. Concatenate the second segment followed by the first segment\" correctly transforms the parsed input into the expected output structure for all 7 training examples.\n4.  **Output Format:** The expected outputs are strings of 12 space-separated single digits.\n5.  **Consistency:** The transformation rule is consistent and deterministic across all provided examples.\n\n"
