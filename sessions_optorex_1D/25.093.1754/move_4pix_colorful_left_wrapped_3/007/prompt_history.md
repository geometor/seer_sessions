## Perception of the Elements

The task involves manipulating a sequence of 12 single digits. Each input is a list of 12 integers. Each output is also a list of 12 integers, representing a rearrangement of the input sequence. The core operation appears to be a division of the input sequence into two segments and then swapping their positions.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 digits by splitting it into two parts and swapping their order.
input_data:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  constraints: Elements are single digits (0-9).
output_data:
  type: list
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  derivation: Rearrangement of the input list.
transformation:
  action: Split and Swap
  split_point: Fixed index 4 (after the 4th element)
  segments:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input list.
    - segment_2: The elements from index 4 to 11 (the last 8 elements) of the input list.
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
relationships:
  - The output list contains exactly the same elements as the input list, but in a different order.
  - The length of the input and output lists is constant (12).
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.

    a.  The first part consists of the first 4 digits (indices 0 to 3).
    b.  The second part consists of the remaining 8 digits (indices 4 to 11).
3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the second part followed by the first part.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
## General Assessment

The consistent error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples strongly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving input data as a NumPy array (or potentially a list), not as a space-separated string as the previous code assumed.

The core transformation logic observed visually (splitting the sequence after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting segments) seems correct and consistent across all provided training examples.

The strategy is to modify the understanding of the `transform` function's input signature. It should accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) directly, rather than a string that needs parsing. The core logic of splitting at index 4 and concatenating the second part followed by the first part remains the same.

## Metrics

*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers based on the error message.
*   **Output Format:** Expected to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.
*   **Element Type:** Integers (single digits 0-9).
*   **Transformation Rule:** Split the input sequence into two segments: the first 4 elements (indices 0-3) and the remaining 8 elements (indices 4-11). The output is formed by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment. This rule holds for all 7 training examples.
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all 7 examples, confirming the input type mismatch is systematic.
