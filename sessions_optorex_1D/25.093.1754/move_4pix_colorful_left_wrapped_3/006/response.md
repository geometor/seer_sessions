## General Assessment

The consistent error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples strongly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving input data as a NumPy array (or potentially a list), not as a space-separated string as the previous code assumed.

The core transformation logic observed visually (splitting the sequence after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting segments) seems correct and consistent across all provided training examples.

The strategy is to modify the understanding of the `transform` function's input signature. It should accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) directly, rather than a string that needs parsing. The core logic of splitting at index 4 and concatenating the second part followed by the first part remains the same.

## Metrics

*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers based on the error message.
*   **Output Format:** Expected to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.
*   **Element Type:** Integers (single digits 0-9).
*   **Transformation Rule:** Split the input sequence into two segments: the first 4 elements (indices 0-3) and the remaining 8 elements (indices 4-11). The output is formed by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment. This rule holds for all 7 training examples.
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all 7 examples, confirming the input type mismatch is systematic.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 integers by splitting it into two parts and swapping their order.
input_data:
  type: list or numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  constraints: Elements are single digits (0-9).
output_data:
  type: list or numpy.ndarray # Consistent with input type
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  derivation: Rearrangement of the input sequence.
transformation:
  action: Split and Swap
  input_object: Sequence of 12 integers.
  split_point: Fixed index 4 (splitting the sequence into elements 0-3 and 4-11).
  segments:
    - segment_1: The first 4 elements of the input sequence (indices 0 to 3).
    - segment_2: The last 8 elements of the input sequence (indices 4 to 11).
  output_construction: Concatenate segment_2 followed by segment_1.
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains exactly the same elements as the input sequence, but in a different order.
  - The length of the input and output sequences is constant (12).
  - The transformation rule (split at index 4, swap segments) is consistent across all examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (list or array) containing 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first segment: the elements from the beginning of the sequence up to (but not including) index 4.
3.  Identify the second segment: the elements from index 4 to the end of the sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.
