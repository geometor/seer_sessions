            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe consistent error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples strongly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving input data as a NumPy array (or potentially a list), not as a space-separated string as the previous code assumed.\n\nThe core transformation logic observed visually (splitting the sequence after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting segments) seems correct and consistent across all provided training examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the understanding of the `transform` function's input signature. It should accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) directly, rather than a string that needs parsing. The core logic of splitting at index 4 and concatenating the second part followed by the first part remains the same.\n\n## Metrics\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers based on the error message.\n*   **Output Format:** Expected to be a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.\n*   **Element Type:** Integers (single digits 0-9).\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Split the input sequence into two segments: the first 4 elements (indices 0-3) and the remaining 8 elements (indices 4-11). The output is formed by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment. This rule holds for all 7 training examples.\n*   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all 7 examples, confirming the input type mismatch is systematic.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
