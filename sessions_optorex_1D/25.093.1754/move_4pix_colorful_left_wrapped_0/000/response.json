By comparing the input and output sequences across the examples, a consistent pattern emerges. The input sequence seems to be divided into two subsequences. The first subsequence consists of the first 4 integers, and the second subsequence consists of the remaining 8 integers. The output sequence is formed by placing the second subsequence first, followed by the first subsequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
