**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed on all examples with a `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`. This indicates that the `transform` function received input as bytes (`bytes`) rather than a string (`str`), specifically when `re.findall` was called.

The strategy is to modify the function to first decode the input bytes into a string using a standard encoding (e.g., UTF-8) before applying the regular expression and the core transformation logic. The rest of the logic, which involves splitting the sequence after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting parts, appears correct based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs in the training data. No further code execution is needed at this stage, as the error is a clear type mismatch at the function's entry point.

**Metrics**

All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed with the identical `TypeError`. This confirms the input type issue is consistent across all test cases provided to the previous execution environment. The core transformation logic (splitting at index 4 and swapping blocks) has not yet been validated by execution due to this initial error, but it visually matches the pattern observed in all examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 integers by swapping two fixed-length blocks.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    subtype: integer
    length: 12
    representation: space-separated bytes # Updated: Input is bytes, needs decoding
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    subtype: integer
    length: 12
    representation: space-separated string # Assuming string output is desired/acceptable
transformation:
  preprocessing:
    action: decode
    input: input sequence (bytes)
    parameters:
      encoding: utf-8 # Assumed standard encoding
    output: decoded string sequence
  core_logic:
    action: split
    input: decoded string sequence
    parameters:
      delimiter: space
      split_index: 4 # Split after the 4th element (index 3)
    outputs:
      - name: part1_str
        elements: first 4 number strings
      - name: part2_str
        elements: last 8 number strings
    action: concatenate
    inputs:
      - part2_str
      - part1_str
    parameters:
      delimiter: space
    output: output sequence (string)
relationship:
  string_input = decode(byte_input, 'utf-8')
  numbers = split(string_input, ' ')
  part1 = numbers[0:4]
  part2 = numbers[4:12]
  output_sequence = join(part2 + part1, ' ')
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence as bytes.
2.  Decode the input bytes into a UTF-8 string.
3.  Split the decoded string into a list of individual number strings using spaces as delimiters.
4.  Divide the list of number strings into two parts:
    *   The first part consists of the first 4 number strings.
    *   The second part consists of the remaining 8 number strings (from the 5th to the 12th).
5.  Construct the output list by concatenating the second part followed by the first part.
6.  Join the elements of the resulting list back into a single string, separated by spaces.
7.  Return the final space-separated string.
