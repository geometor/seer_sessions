            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples with a `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`. This indicates that the `transform` function received input as bytes (`bytes`) rather than a string (`str`), specifically when `re.findall` was called.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the function to first decode the input bytes into a string using a standard encoding (e.g., UTF-8) before applying the regular expression and the core transformation logic. The rest of the logic, which involves splitting the sequence after the 4th element and swapping the two resulting parts, appears correct based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs in the training data. No further code execution is needed at this stage, as the error is a clear type mismatch at the function's entry point.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nAll 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed with the identical `TypeError`. This confirms the input type issue is consistent across all test cases provided to the previous execution environment. The core transformation logic (splitting at index 4 and swapping blocks) has not yet been validated by execution due to this initial error, but it visually matches the pattern observed in all examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
