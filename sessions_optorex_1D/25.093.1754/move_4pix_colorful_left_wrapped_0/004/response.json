The core logic identified in the initial perception \u2013 splitting the 12-element sequence after the 4th element and swapping the resulting two blocks (4 elements and 8 elements) \u2013 appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to modify the input handling to accept a sequence of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing or decoding.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nThe code failed before processing the data due to the type mismatch, so no output metrics were generated. Re-examining the input/output pairs confirms the transformation rule:\n\n*   **All examples:** Input is a sequence of 12 integers. Output is a sequence of 12 integers.\n*   **Consistent Pattern:** In every example, the first 4 integers of the input appear as the last 4 integers of the output, and the last 8 integers of the input appear as the first 8 integers of the output.\n*   **Example 1:** `[7, 8, 7, 2]` + `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 2, 7]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 2, 7]` + `[7, 8, 7, 2]`\n*   **Example 2:** `[0, 0, 0, 0]` + `[0, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0]` + `[0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   *(This pattern holds for all 7 training examples)*\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
