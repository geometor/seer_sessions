**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed across all examples with a `TypeError`, indicating that the input provided to the `transform` function was not a string or bytes object as expected, but likely a sequence (list or tuple) of integers directly. The core logic identified in the initial perception – splitting the 12-element sequence after the 4th element and swapping the resulting two blocks (4 elements and 8 elements) – appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to modify the input handling to accept a sequence of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing or decoding.

**Gather Metrics:**

The code failed before processing the data due to the type mismatch, so no output metrics were generated. Re-examining the input/output pairs confirms the transformation rule:

*   **All examples:** Input is a sequence of 12 integers. Output is a sequence of 12 integers.
*   **Consistent Pattern:** In every example, the first 4 integers of the input appear as the last 4 integers of the output, and the last 8 integers of the input appear as the first 8 integers of the output.
*   **Example 1:** `[7, 8, 7, 2]` + `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 2, 7]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 2, 7]` + `[7, 8, 7, 2]`
*   **Example 2:** `[0, 0, 0, 0]` + `[0, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 0, 0]` + `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   *(This pattern holds for all 7 training examples)*

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 integers by swapping two fixed-length blocks.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    subtype: integer
    length: 12
    # representation: Likely a list or tuple of integers based on execution errors
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    subtype: integer
    length: 12
    # representation: Space-separated string expected by the testing framework
transformation:
  action: split
  input: input sequence (assumed list/tuple of integers)
  parameters:
    split_index: 4 # Split after the 4th element (index 3)
  outputs:
    - name: part1
      elements: input[0:4]
    - name: part2
      elements: input[4:12]
  action: concatenate
  inputs:
    - part2
    - part1
  output: intermediate sequence (list/tuple of integers)
  action: format
  input: intermediate sequence
  parameters:
    separator: " "
    element_type: string
  output: final output sequence (space-separated string)
relationship:
  final_output_sequence = format_as_string(concatenate(input[4:12], input[0:4]))
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence (e.g., list or tuple) containing 12 integers.
2.  Divide the input sequence into two parts:
    *   The first part consists of the first 4 integers.
    *   The second part consists of the remaining 8 integers (from the 5th to the 12th integer).
3.  Construct a new sequence by concatenating the second part followed by the first part.
4.  Convert each integer in the new sequence to its string representation.
5.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces, to form the final output string.
