"""
Rearrange a sequence of 12 integers, provided as a space-separated byte string,
by swapping two fixed-length blocks. The input byte sequence is first decoded
into a string. This string is then split into numbers. The sequence is conceptually
divided after the 4th integer. The output sequence is formed by concatenating
the second block (integers 5 through 12) followed by the first block (integers 1
through 4), joined back into a space-separated string.
