            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed universally because it incorrectly assumed the input data type was a string requiring parsing (`.split()`). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the input is actually a NumPy array.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (a left cyclic shift of 4 positions) appears consistent with the input/output examples upon visual inspection and manual verification.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the code to directly handle NumPy arrays (or standard Python lists, as slicing/concatenation works similarly) as input, removing the unnecessary string parsing step. The core logic of slicing the array into two parts (first 4 elements and remaining 8 elements) and concatenating them in reverse order (second part followed by the first part) will be retained.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (as indicated by the error message across all examples).\n*   **Input Sequence Length:** 12 integers (consistent across all examples).\n*   **Output Sequence Length:** 12 integers (consistent across all examples).\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** The transformation rule (left cyclic shift by 4) appears to hold true for all provided training examples based on manual verification:\n    *   `train_1`: Input `[0 0 4 8 | 5 9 2 7 7 9 0 0]` -> Output `[5 9 2 7 7 9 0 0 | 0 0 4 8]` (Correct)\n    *   `train_2`: Input `[1 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 8]` -> Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 9 8 | 1 0 0 0]` (Correct)\n    *   `train_3`: Input `[0 0 0 9 | 8 6 8 7 3 3 0 0]` -> Output `[8 6 8 7 3 3 0 0 | 0 0 0 9]` (Correct)\n    *   And so on for the remaining examples.\n*   **Error Cause:** Incorrect input handling (`.split()` called on a NumPy array).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
