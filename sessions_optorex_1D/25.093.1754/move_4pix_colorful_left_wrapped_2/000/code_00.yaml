Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    count: 12
    role: input
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    count: 12
    role: output
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  subtype: cyclic shift
  properties:
    - direction: left
    - shift_amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by performing a left cyclic shift of 4 positions.
  - The element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12` in the output.
  - Equivalently, the first 4 elements (indices 0-3) of the input are appended to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining elements (indices 4-11).
