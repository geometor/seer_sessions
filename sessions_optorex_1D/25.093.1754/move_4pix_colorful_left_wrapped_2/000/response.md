**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers into another sequence of 12 integers. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges. The elements within the sequence are rearranged, but no elements are added, removed, or changed in value. The rearrangement follows a specific rule: the first 4 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, while the remaining 8 elements are shifted to the beginning, maintaining their relative order. This corresponds to a cyclic shift operation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    count: 12
    role: input
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    count: 12
    role: output
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  subtype: cyclic shift
  properties:
    - direction: left
    - shift_amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by performing a left cyclic shift of 4 positions.
  - The element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12` in the output.
  - Equivalently, the first 4 elements (indices 0-3) of the input are appended to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining elements (indices 4-11).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first 4 elements of the sequence (elements at indices 0, 1, 2, 3).
3.  Identify the remaining 8 elements of the sequence (elements at indices 4 through 11).
4.  Create the output sequence by first placing the block of 8 elements identified in step 3.
5.  Append the block of 4 elements identified in step 2 to the end of the sequence created in step 4.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
