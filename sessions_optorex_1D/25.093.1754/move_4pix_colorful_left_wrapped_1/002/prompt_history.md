*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 integers.
    *   The integers in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, but their order is different.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent rearrangement pattern across all examples.
    *   The input sequence appears to be divided into three equal parts or chunks.
    *   The output sequence is formed by rearranging these chunks.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Rearrange elements of a sequence based on fixed chunk division.
    data_format:
      input: Sequence of 12 integers.
      output: Sequence of 12 integers.
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: List[int]
        length: 12
        properties: Can be logically divided into three equal sub-sequences (chunks).
      - name: chunk_1
        type: List[int]
        length: 4
        source: First 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 0-3).
      - name: chunk_2
        type: List[int]
        length: 4
        source: Middle 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 4-7).
      - name: chunk_3
        type: List[int]
        length: 4
        source: Last 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 8-11).
      - name: output_sequence
        type: List[int]
        length: 12
    actions:
      - name: split
        input: input_sequence
        output: [chunk_1, chunk_2, chunk_3]
        description: Divide the input sequence into three consecutive chunks of 4 elements each.
      - name: concatenate
        input: [chunk_2, chunk_3, chunk_1]
        output: output_sequence
        description: Join the chunks in the specified order (second, third, first) to form the output sequence.
    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is a permutation of the input_sequence.
      - The order of elements within each chunk is preserved.
      - The transformation rule involves rearranging the chunks, not the individual elements within them.
      - The specific rearrangement order is fixed: chunk 2, then chunk 3, then chunk 1.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the input sequence into three consecutive chunks, each containing 4 integers:
        *   Chunk 1: The first 4 integers.
        *   Chunk 2: The next 4 integers (integers 5 through 8).
        *   Chunk 3: The last 4 integers (integers 9 through 12).
    3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the chunks in the following order: Chunk 2, followed by Chunk 3, followed by Chunk 1.
    4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.
