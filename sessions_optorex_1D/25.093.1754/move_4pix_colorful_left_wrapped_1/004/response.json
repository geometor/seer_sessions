This resulted in a 0% success rate (Match: False) for all cases where the expected output differed from the input.\n    *   However, a manual analysis of the input and *expected* output pairs across all examples strongly confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation involves dividing the 12-element sequence into three 4-element chunks and reassembling them in the order: second chunk, third chunk, first chunk.\n    *   The discrepancy suggests either an error in the execution environment/reporting mechanism that ran the tests (causing the identity function to be executed or reported) or a fundamental misunderstanding reflected in the provided results. The Python code provided *before* the results correctly implements the chunk rearrangement logic.\n    *   Therefore, the strategy is to proceed with the natural language program derived from the observed chunk rearrangement (Chunk 2, Chunk 3, Chunk 1), as this accurately describes the relationship between the provided inputs and *expected* outputs. The reported execution results appear anomalous and likely do not reflect the execution of the intended code.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input sequence length: 12 integers for all examples.\n    *   Output sequence length: 12 integers for all examples.\n    *   Chunking strategy: Divide the input sequence into 3 contiguous chunks.\n    *   Chunk size: 4 integers per chunk.\n    *   Input Chunk Indices: Chunk 1 (0-3), Chunk 2 (4-7), Chunk 3 (8-11).\n    *   Output Chunk Order: Chunk 2, Chunk 3, Chunk 1.\n    *   Element Preservation: All elements from the input are present in the output, and their count is preserved.\n    *   Intra-chunk Order Preservation: The relative order of elements within each chunk is maintained.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
