task_description: Rearrange elements of a sequence based on fixed chunk division and reordering.
data_format:
  input: Sequence of 12 integers.
  output: Sequence of 12 integers.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray
    length: 12
    properties: Can be logically divided into three equal sub-sequences (chunks).
  - name: chunk_1
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray
    length: 4
    source: First 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 0-3).
  - name: chunk_2
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray
    length: 4
    source: Middle 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 4-7).
  - name: chunk_3
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray
    length: 4
    source: Last 4 elements of input_sequence (indices 8-11).
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray
    length: 12
actions:
  - name: split
    input: input_sequence
    output: [chunk_1, chunk_2, chunk_3]
    description: Divide the input sequence into three consecutive chunks of 4 elements each.
  - name: concatenate
    input: [chunk_2, chunk_3, chunk_1]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Join the chunks in the specified order (second, third, first) to form the output sequence.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence is a permutation of the input_sequence.
  - The order of elements within each chunk is preserved.
  - The transformation rule involves rearranging the chunks, not the individual elements within them.
  - The specific rearrangement order is fixed: chunk 2, then chunk 3, then chunk 1.
