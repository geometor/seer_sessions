*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of integers.
    *   Each sequence contains 12 integers.
    *   The integers present in the output sequence are exactly the same as those in the input sequence, but their order is changed.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern of rearrangement.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    1.  Accept an input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the sequence into two parts: the first part consists of the first 4 integers, and the second part consists of the integers from the 5th position to the 12th position.
    3.  Create the output sequence by appending the first part to the end of the second part.
    4.  Return the rearranged sequence.

Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided information includes multiple training examples and the results of executing a Python function against them. The execution consistently failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.

**Assessment:**
1.  **Input Type Mismatch:** The primary issue is a mismatch between the assumed input type (string) in the previous code and the actual input type (NumPy array) used during testing. The error messages confirm this.
2.  **Transformation Logic:** The underlying logic of rearranging the sequence by moving the first 4 elements to the end (a cyclic left shift) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The code execution confirms this logic works when applied correctly to NumPy arrays.
3.  **Code Implementation:** The previous Python code used string manipulation functions (`.strip()`, `re.split()`, `.join()`) which are incompatible with NumPy arrays, leading to the errors.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Correct Input Type:** Update the understanding and documentation (YAML, natural language program) to reflect that the input is a NumPy array of integers.
2.  **Adapt Transformation Method:** Revise the transformation description to use NumPy array operations (slicing and concatenation) instead of string methods.
3.  **Validate:** Use code execution (as performed in the thought process) to verify the characteristics of the input (type, shape, dtype) and confirm that the NumPy-based transformation logic correctly reproduces the output for all examples.

**Metrics and Verification**

The following metrics were gathered using code execution:

*   **Input Type:** Consistently `<class 'numpy.ndarray'>` for all 7 training examples.
*   **Input Shape:** Consistently `(12,)` for all 7 training examples.
*   **Input Dtype:** Consistently `int64` (integer type) for all 7 training examples.
*   **Transformation Rule Verification:** Applying the rule "concatenate the slice from index 4 onwards with the slice up to index 4" (`np.concatenate((input_array[4:], input_array[:4]))`) successfully reproduces the target output for all 7 training examples.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a NumPy array of 12 integers.
input_object:
  type: numpy_array
  properties:
    shape: (12,)
    dtype: integer
    elements: digits (0-9 shown in examples)
output_object:
  type: numpy_array
  properties:
    shape: (12,)
    dtype: integer
    elements: same integers as input, rearranged
transformation:
  action: cyclic_shift_left
  details: The first 4 elements of the input array are moved to the end.
  implementation:
    using: numpy
    steps:
      - Slice the input array from index 4 to the end (second part).
      - Slice the input array from the beginning up to index 4 (first part).
      - Concatenate the second part followed by the first part.
  split_point: after the 4th element (index 4)
  segments:
    - segment_1: input_array[:4]
    - segment_2: input_array[4:]
  reordering: concatenate(segment_2, segment_1)
examples_consistency: The transformation rule holds true for all provided examples when applied to NumPy arrays.
input_source_discrepancy: Initial analysis suggested string input, but execution confirms NumPy array input.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept an input NumPy array containing 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first part of the array as the elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 4.
3.  Identify the second part of the array as the elements from index 4 to the end.
4.  Create the output NumPy array by concatenating the second part followed by the first part.
5.  Return the rearranged NumPy array.
