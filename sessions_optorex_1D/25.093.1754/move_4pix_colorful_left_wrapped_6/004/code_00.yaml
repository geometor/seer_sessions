task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 space-separated integers presented as a string.
input_object:
  type: string
  subtype: space-separated integers
  properties:
    format: A single string containing 12 integers separated by spaces.
    elements: Digits (0-9) observed in examples.
    length: Contains exactly 12 numeric tokens.
output_object:
  type: string
  subtype: space-separated integers
  properties:
    format: A single string containing 12 integers separated by spaces.
    elements: Same integers as input, rearranged.
    length: Contains exactly 12 numeric tokens.
transformation:
  action: cyclic_shift_left_string
  details: The first 4 space-separated numbers in the input string are moved to the end of the string, maintaining space separation.
  steps:
    - Split the input string by spaces into a list of number strings.
    - Identify the first 4 elements (segment 1) and the remaining 8 elements (segment 2).
    - Concatenate segment 2 followed by segment 1.
    - Join the resulting list back into a single string with spaces as separators.
  split_point: After the 4th number string.
  segments:
    - segment_1: First 4 number strings.
    - segment_2: Remaining 8 number strings.
  reordering: segment_2 followed by segment_1.
examples_consistency: The transformation rule holds true for all provided examples when applied to the string representation.
input_format_issue: Initial code implementation incorrectly assumed NumPy array input, leading to errors. The input is consistently string-based.
