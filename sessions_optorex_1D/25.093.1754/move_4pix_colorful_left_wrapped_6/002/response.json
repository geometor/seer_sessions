            "text": "*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**\n    *   The core issue identified is a type mismatch. The previous code assumed the input was a string of space-separated numbers based on the visual presentation of the examples. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates the `transform` function receives a NumPy array, not a string.\n    *   The fundamental logic of the transformation (a cyclic left shift of the first 4 elements to the end) appears correct based on visual inspection of all examples.\n    *   The strategy is to modify the implementation to directly handle NumPy arrays. This involves removing string-specific operations (`strip`, `split`, `join`) and using NumPy array slicing and concatenation instead. The underlying algorithm (split at index 4, swap segments) remains the same.\n\n*   **Metrics & Analysis:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples, as evidenced by the error.\n    *   **Input Shape:** Each input is a 1D NumPy array of length 12.\n    *   **Output Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the input type and the nature of the transformation.\n    *   **Transformation Rule:** A cyclic shift to the left by 4 positions. The elements originally at indices 0, 1, 2, 3 are moved to indices 8, 9, 10, 11 respectively. The elements originally at indices 4 through 11 are moved to indices 0 through 7 respectively. This holds true for all 7 training examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
