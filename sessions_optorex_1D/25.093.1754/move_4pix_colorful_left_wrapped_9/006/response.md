**General Assessment**

The provided error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) indicate a problem during the testing or validation phase, specifically when comparing the generated output string with the expected output string. The error suggests that the entire expected output string (e.g., `'0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 7 7 9 6'`) is being incorrectly treated as a single integer literal, causing the `int()` conversion to fail.

A review of all seven training examples confirms that the initially perceived transformation logic holds true for every case: the input sequence of 12 integers is split after the 4th element, and the two resulting subsequences are swapped. The first four elements move to the end, and the last eight elements move to the beginning.

Therefore, the issue does not appear to stem from an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule or a flaw in the natural language program derived from the initial observations. The strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation, document it clearly, and acknowledge that the reported errors likely originate from the external testing mechanism, not the `transform` function's core logic itself.

**Metrics**

The consistency of input and output sequence lengths was verified using code execution.


``` python
import re

# Helper function to parse and get length
def get_length(s):
    # Use regex to find all numbers, handles various spacing
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', s)
    return len(numbers)

# Example data
examples = [
    {"input": "7 7 9 6 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1", "output": "0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 7 7 9 6"},
    {"input": "5 9 2 3 7 5 1 8 8 0 0 0", "output": "7 5 1 8 8 0 0 0 5 9 2 3"},
    {"input": "0 0 0 4 9 9 5 2 6 0 0 0", "output": "9 9 5 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 4"},
    {"input": "0 0 0 0 1 6 9 7 3 3 0 0", "output": "1 6 9 7 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0"},
    {"input": "6 8 3 9 2 5 9 3 5 5 0 0", "output": "2 5 9 3 5 5 0 0 6 8 3 9"},
    {"input": "9 0 4 7 5 1 1 2 1 7 1 6", "output": "5 1 1 2 1 7 1 6 9 0 4 7"},
    {"input": "4 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 9 6 4 1", "output": "0 0 0 0 9 6 4 1 4 5 1 0"},
]

results = {}
consistent_length = 12
all_consistent = True

for i, ex in enumerate(examples, 1):
    input_len = get_length(ex["input"])
    output_len = get_length(ex["output"])
    results[f"Example {i}"] = {"input_len": input_len, "output_len": output_len}
    if input_len != consistent_length or output_len != consistent_length:
        all_consistent = False

print(results)
print(f"\nAll examples have input and output length {consistent_length}: {all_consistent}")
```
```
{'Example 1': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 2': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 3': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 4': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 5': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 6': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}, 'Example 7': {'input_len': 12, 'output_len': 12}}

All examples have input and output length 12: True

```
The results confirm that all input and output sequences consistently contain 12 integer elements.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - representation: space-separated string
      - length: 12 (constant across all examples)
      - elements: single-digit or multi-digit integers
actions:
  - name: parse
    parameters:
      - input_string: the space-separated string representation of the sequence

      - integer_list: a list containing the 12 integers
  - name: split_sequence
    parameters:
      - sequence: the list of 12 integers
      - index: the position *after* which to split (fixed at 4)
    results:
      - first_part: list containing the first 4 integers (indices 0-3)
      - second_part: list containing the remaining 8 integers (indices 4-11)
  - name: concatenate_swapped
    parameters:
      - first_part: the list of the first 4 integers
      - second_part: the list of the last 8 integers

      - output_list: a new list formed by concatenating second_part followed by first_part
  - name: format
    parameters:
      - integer_list: the transformed list of 12 integers
    results:
      - output_string: the space-separated string representation of the output list
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the exact same elements as the input sequence.
  - The order of elements is changed according to a fixed rule: the first 4 elements are moved to the end.
  - This transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
  - Input and output formats are space-separated strings of numbers.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integer values.
3.  Divide the list into two parts:
    *   The "first part" consists of the first 4 integers (elements at index 0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   The "second part" consists of the remaining 8 integers (elements at index 4 through 11).
4.  Create a new list by concatenating the "second part" followed by the "first part".
5.  Format the new list back into a string of space-separated integers.
6.  Return the resulting string.
