objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - representation: space-separated string
      - length: 12 (constant across all examples)
      - elements: single-digit or multi-digit integers
actions:
  - name: parse
    parameters:
      - input_string: the space-separated string representation of the sequence
    results:
      - integer_list: a list containing the 12 integers
  - name: split_sequence
    parameters:
      - sequence: the list of 12 integers
      - index: the position *after* which to split (fixed at 4)
    results:
      - first_part: list containing the first 4 integers (indices 0-3)
      - second_part: list containing the remaining 8 integers (indices 4-11)
  - name: concatenate_swapped
    parameters:
      - first_part: the list of the first 4 integers
      - second_part: the list of the last 8 integers
    results:
      - output_list: a new list formed by concatenating second_part followed by first_part
  - name: format
    parameters:
      - integer_list: the transformed list of 12 integers
    results:
      - output_string: the space-separated string representation of the output list
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the exact same elements as the input sequence.
  - The order of elements is changed according to a fixed rule: the first 4 elements are moved to the end.
  - This transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
  - Input and output formats are space-separated strings of numbers.
