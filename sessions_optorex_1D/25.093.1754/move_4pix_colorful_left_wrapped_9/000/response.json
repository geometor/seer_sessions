The length of the input sequence is consistently 12, and the output sequence also has a length of 12. The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be divided into two parts at a fixed position, and these two parts are then swapped to produce the output sequence. All examples consistently show the first four elements of the input sequence being moved to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining eight elements are moved to the beginning.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
