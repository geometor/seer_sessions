**Perception:**

The input and output for each task are sequences of integers. The length of the input sequence is consistently 12, and the output sequence also has a length of 12. The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be divided into two parts at a fixed position, and these two parts are then swapped to produce the output sequence. All examples consistently show the first four elements of the input sequence being moved to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining eight elements are moved to the beginning.

**Facts:**

objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12 (constant across examples)
      - elements: individual numbers
actions:
  - name: split
    parameters:
      - sequence: the input sequence
      - index: the position after which to split (observed as 4)
    results:
      - first_part: subsequence from the beginning up to the split index
      - second_part: subsequence from after the split index to the end
  - name: swap_and_concatenate
    parameters:
      - first_part: the initial subsequence
      - second_part: the latter subsequence
    results:
      - output_sequence: the concatenation of second_part followed by first_part
relationships:
  - The output sequence is composed of the same elements as the input sequence, but in a different order.
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
  - The split point is fixed after the 4th element.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the first four elements as the "first part".
3.  Identify the remaining eight elements (from the 5th to the 12th element) as the "second part".
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the "second part" followed by the "first part".

**General Assessment:**

The initial perception correctly identified the core transformation: a cyclic shift or rotation of the sequence elements. The input sequence is split into two parts (the first 4 elements and the remaining 8), and these parts are swapped to form the output. This logic holds true for all provided training examples.

The `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object` encountered during the execution of the previous code indicates an issue with the *input data type* being passed to the `transform` function in the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The examples clearly show space-separated strings of integers, and the initial Python code was written to handle strings. The testing environment likely passed byte strings (`bytes`) to the `re.findall` function, which expects character strings (`str`).

**Strategy:**

The core logic identified previously is sound and consistent across all examples. The focus should be on ensuring the description and implementation clearly state the assumption of string input based on the examples provided, while noting the potential type mismatch observed during execution. The natural language program will remain largely the same, perhaps with added clarity on the expected input format. The coder phase will need to address the `TypeError`, possibly by decoding the input if it's indeed bytes, while adhering to the transformation logic defined here.

**Metrics:**

Based on observation and confirmed by code execution on example 1:

*   All input sequences consist of 12 integers.
*   All output sequences consist of 12 integers.
*   The transformation involves splitting the input sequence after the 4th element.
*   The output is formed by concatenating the segment from element 5 to 12 with the segment from element 1 to 4.
*   The transformation rule is consistently applied across all 7 training examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input, which is expected to be a string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse this string into an ordered list of 12 integers.
3.  Divide the list into two parts:
    *   The "first part" consists of the first 4 integers.
    *   The "second part" consists of the remaining 8 integers (from the 5th to the 12th).
4.  Create a new list by concatenating the "second part" followed by the "first part".
5.  Format this new list back into a string of space-separated integers, which is the output.
