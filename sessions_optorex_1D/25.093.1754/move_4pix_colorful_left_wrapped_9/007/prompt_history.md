**Perception:**

The input and output for each task are sequences of integers. The length of the input sequence is consistently 12, and the output sequence also has a length of 12. The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be divided into two parts at a fixed position, and these two parts are then swapped to produce the output sequence. All examples consistently show the first four elements of the input sequence being moved to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining eight elements are moved to the beginning.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12 (constant across examples)
      - elements: individual numbers
actions:
  - name: split
    parameters:
      - sequence: the input sequence
      - index: the position after which to split (observed as 4)
    results:
      - first_part: subsequence from the beginning up to the split index
      - second_part: subsequence from after the split index to the end
  - name: swap_and_concatenate
    parameters:
      - first_part: the initial subsequence
      - second_part: the latter subsequence
    results:
      - output_sequence: the concatenation of second_part followed by first_part
relationships:
  - The output sequence is composed of the same elements as the input sequence, but in a different order.
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
  - The split point is fixed after the 4th element.

**General Assessment**

The provided error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) indicate a problem during the testing or validation phase, specifically when comparing the generated output string with the expected output string. The error suggests that the entire expected output string (e.g., `'0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 7 7 9 6'`) is being incorrectly treated as a single integer literal, causing the `int()` conversion to fail.

A review of all seven training examples confirms that the initially perceived transformation logic holds true for every case: the input sequence of 12 integers is split after the 4th element, and the two resulting subsequences are swapped. The first four elements move to the end, and the last eight elements move to the beginning.

Therefore, the issue does not appear to stem from an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule or a flaw in the natural language program derived from the initial observations. The strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation, document it clearly, and acknowledge that the reported errors likely originate from the external testing mechanism, not the `transform` function's core logic itself.

**Metrics**

The consistency of input and output sequence lengths was verified using code execution.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a string of 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integer values.
3.  Divide the list into two parts:
    *   The "first part" consists of the first 4 integers (elements at index 0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   The "second part" consists of the remaining 8 integers (elements at index 4 through 11).
4.  Create a new list by concatenating the "second part" followed by the "first part".
5.  Format the new list back into a string of space-separated integers.
6.  Return the resulting string.
