            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial perception correctly identified the core transformation: a cyclic shift or rotation of the sequence elements. The input sequence is split into two parts (the first 4 elements and the remaining 8), and these parts are swapped to form the output. This logic holds true for all provided training examples.\n\nThe `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object` encountered during the execution of the previous code indicates an issue with the *input data type* being passed to the `transform` function in the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself. The examples clearly show space-separated strings of integers, and the initial Python code was written to handle strings. The testing environment likely passed byte strings (`bytes`) to the `re.findall` function, which expects character strings (`str`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core logic identified previously is sound and consistent across all examples. The focus should be on ensuring the description and implementation clearly state the assumption of string input based on the examples provided, while noting the potential type mismatch observed during execution. The natural language program will remain largely the same, perhaps with added clarity on the expected input format. The coder phase will need to address the `TypeError`, possibly by decoding the input if it's indeed bytes, while adhering to the transformation logic defined here.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on observation and confirmed by code execution on example 1:\n\n*   All input sequences consist of 12 integers.\n*   All output sequences consist of 12 integers.\n*   The transformation involves splitting the input sequence after the 4th element.\n*   The output is formed by concatenating the segment from element 5 to 12 with the segment from element 1 to 4.\n*   The transformation rule is consistently applied across all 7 training examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
