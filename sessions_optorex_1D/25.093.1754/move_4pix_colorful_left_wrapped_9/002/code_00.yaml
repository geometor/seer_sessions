objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string containing space-separated integers (as observed in examples)
      - length: 12 integers
      - structure: linear sequence
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string containing space-separated integers
      - length: 12 integers
      - structure: linear sequence derived from input_sequence
  - name: first_part
    properties:
      - derivation: first 4 integers from input_sequence
  - name: second_part
    properties:
      - derivation: integers from the 5th to the 12th position in input_sequence
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    parameters:
      - input_string: the input sequence string
    results:
      - list_of_integers: an ordered list representation of the input numbers
  - name: split_sequence
    parameters:
      - list_of_integers: the parsed input sequence
      - index: position to split after (observed as 4)
    results:
      - first_part: list containing the first 4 integers
      - second_part: list containing integers from index 4 to the end (8 integers)
  - name: construct_output_list
    parameters:
      - first_part: list from the beginning of the input
      - second_part: list from the end of the input
    results:
      - reordered_list: a new list formed by concatenating second_part followed by first_part
  - name: format_output
    parameters:
      - reordered_list: the transformed list of integers
    results:
      - output_string: a space-separated string representation of the reordered_list
relationships:
  - The output_sequence contains the same integers as the input_sequence.
  - The order of integers in the output_sequence is a cyclic shift of the input_sequence.
  - The transformation rule (split at 4, swap parts) is constant across all examples.
