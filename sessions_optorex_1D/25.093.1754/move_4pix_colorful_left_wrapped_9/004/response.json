            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the observed transformation rule: splitting a sequence of 12 integers after the 4th element and swapping the resulting two parts. The transformation rule itself appears consistent across all training examples. The Python code logically follows this rule, parsing the input string, splitting the list representation, concatenating the parts in the new order, and formatting the result back into a string.\n\nHowever, the execution results show a consistent `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:` across all examples. Crucially, the string causing the error in each case (`'0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 7 7 9 6'`, `'7 5 1 8 8 0 0 0 5 9 2 3'`, etc.) is the *expected output string*, not the input string or a substring extracted from the input. This strongly suggests the error is *not* originating from the intended parsing logic (`[int(x) for x in re.findall(r'\\d+', input_str)]`) acting on the *input* string. The error likely occurs due to an unexpected interaction with the testing framework or environment, where the expected output might be inadvertently processed by the `int()` function at some stage, or the input variable `input_grid` is somehow being overwritten or misinterpreted during the test execution.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nGiven that the observed input-output pattern is perfectly consistent and the core logic described in the initial analysis and implemented in the code accurately reflects this pattern, the strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation rule. The natural language program remains valid. The focus should be on understanding why the execution environment produces this specific error, rather than altering the transformation logic itself, as the logic appears sound based on the provided examples. No changes to the core transformation rule are indicated by the error messages when interpreted in the context of the code's structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Format:** String containing 12 space-separated integers.\n*   **Output Format:** String containing 12 space-separated integers.\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 integers across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 integers across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The first 4 elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence. Equivalently, the sequence is split after the 4th element, and the two resulting subsequences are swapped.\n*   **Consistency:** The rule holds true for all 7 provided training examples. The erroneous execution results do not invalidate the observed pattern in the input/output pairs themselves.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
