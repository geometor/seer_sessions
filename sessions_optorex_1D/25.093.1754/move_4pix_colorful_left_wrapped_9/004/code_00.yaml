objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers derived from a space-separated string
      - length: 12 (constant)
      - elements: integers (observed range 0-9)
  - name: first_part
    properties:
      - type: subsequence
      - source: first 4 elements of the input sequence
  - name: second_part
    properties:
      - type: subsequence
      - source: elements from index 4 to 11 (inclusive) of the input sequence
actions:
  - name: parse
    parameters:
      - input_string: the space-separated string representation
    results:
      - sequence: list of integers
  - name: split
    parameters:
      - sequence: the list of integers
      - index: position 4 (fixed)
    results:
      - first_part: elements 0 through 3
      - second_part: elements 4 through 11
  - name: concatenate_swapped
    parameters:
      - first_part: the initial subsequence
      - second_part: the latter subsequence
    results:
      - new_sequence: concatenation of second_part + first_part
  - name: format
    parameters:
      - new_sequence: the transformed list of integers
    results:
      - output_string: space-separated string representation
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence.
  - The transformation rule (split at index 4, swap parts) is invariant across all examples.
  - The execution errors seem unrelated to the core transformation logic derived from the examples.
