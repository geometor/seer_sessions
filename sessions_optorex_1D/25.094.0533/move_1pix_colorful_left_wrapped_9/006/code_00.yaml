objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - order: significant
      - constraint: Can be empty or contain one or more elements.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (same elements as input, rearranged)
      - order: significant
      - constraint: Has the same number of elements as the input_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    action: circular_shift_left_by_one
    description: >
      Moves the first element of the input_sequence to the end,
      shifting all other elements one position to the left to fill the gap.
      If the input sequence has 0 or 1 elements, the output is identical to the input.
