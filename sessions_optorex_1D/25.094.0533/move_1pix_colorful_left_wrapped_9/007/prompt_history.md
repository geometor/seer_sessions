## Perception

The input and output are both sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the first element of the input sequence is moved to the end of the sequence to form the output. All other elements retain their original relative order but shift one position to the left. This operation is equivalent to a left circular shift or rotation of the sequence by one position.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input sequence of integers.
2.  Take the first element from the input sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the input sequence *except* the first element, maintaining their relative order.
4.  Append the element identified in step 2 to the end of the new sequence created in step 3.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

## General Assessment

The provided results indicate that the previously executed code failed to perform the intended transformation. In every example, the "Transformed Output" is identical to the "Input", resulting in a mismatch with the "Expected Output". However, visual inspection of the input/output pairs across all examples strongly confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation rule is a **left circular shift by one position**. The first element of the input sequence is moved to the end of the sequence, and all other elements shift one position to the left.

The failure likely stems from an issue in the execution or application of the previous code (`np.roll(input_grid, shift=-1)`), not from an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule itself. The `np.roll` function with `shift=-1` is the correct NumPy operation for this task.

The strategy is to reaffirm the identified transformation rule based on the consistent pattern observed in the examples and refine the natural language program and YAML description accordingly. We will proceed assuming the rule is a left circular shift by one.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the transformation rule (left circular shift by 1) against each example pair.

    else:
        # Perform left circular shift by 1

    match = calculated_output_list == expected_output_list
