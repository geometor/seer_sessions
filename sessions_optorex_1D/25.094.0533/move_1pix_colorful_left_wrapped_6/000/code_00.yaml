Data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  separator: space
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  operation: cyclic_shift
  direction: left
  amount: 1
Details:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - list of integers
      - has a first element
      - has remaining elements
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - list of integers
      - same length as input_sequence
  - action: move_first_to_last
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - identify the first element of the input sequence
      - create a new sequence consisting of the elements from the second position to the end of the input sequence
      - append the identified first element to the end of the new sequence
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but in a different order.
  - The order of elements from the second position onwards in the input sequence is maintained in the beginning of the output sequence.
  - The first element of the input sequence becomes the last element of the output sequence.
