The input and output sequences consist of single-digit non-negative integers separated by spaces. Observing the examples, the core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the first element of the input sequence is relocated to the end of the sequence, while the relative order of the other elements is preserved. This is consistent across all provided examples.\n\n## Task Facts\n\n"
