Data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  container: list or numpy.ndarray # Input is received as a sequence container
Transformation:
  type: rearrangement
  operation: cyclic_shift
  direction: left
  amount: 1
Details:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - list or array of integers
      - has a first element
      - has remaining elements (index 1 onwards)
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - list or array of integers
      - same length as input_sequence
  - action: move_first_to_last
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - If the input sequence is empty, return an empty sequence.
      - Otherwise, identify the first element of the input sequence.
      - Create a new sequence consisting of the elements from the second element to the end of the input sequence.
      - Append the identified first element to the end of this new sequence.
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived directly from the input sequence container.
  - The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, rearranged.
  - The elements from index 1 onwards of the input sequence form the beginning of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
  - The element at index 0 of the input sequence becomes the last element of the output sequence.
