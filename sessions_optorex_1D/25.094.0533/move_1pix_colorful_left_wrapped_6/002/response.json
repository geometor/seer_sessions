            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided it as a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this mismatch.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (moving the first element to the end, a left cyclic shift by 1) appears correct based on visual inspection of all input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input data type is a sequence of integers (likely a list or NumPy array) rather than a string.\n2.  Remove the string parsing and formatting steps from the process.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the direct manipulation of the input sequence/array.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nBased on the error and visual inspection:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently treated as a NumPy array by the execution environment.\n*   **Output Type:** The expected output is also a sequence of integers (likely expected as a list or NumPy array).\n*   **Transformation:** In all 7 training examples, the transformation involves taking the first element of the input sequence and appending it to the end of the remaining elements.\n    *   Example 1: `4` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 2: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 3: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 4: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 5: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 6: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n    *   Example 7: `0` moves from index 0 to index 11.\n*   **Length:** The length of the input and output sequences is identical in all examples (12 elements).\n*   **Element Preservation:** All elements from the input sequence are present in the output sequence.\n\nNo code execution is needed to confirm these observations as the error itself reveals the input type, and the pattern is visually consistent across all examples.\n\n## Task Facts YAML\n\n"
