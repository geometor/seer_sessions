*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of integers.
    *   The length of the output sequence is the same as the length of the input sequence in all examples.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences, it appears that the elements are being rearranged.
    *   Specifically, the first element of the input sequence seems to be moved to the end of the sequence to form the output sequence. All other elements shift one position to the left. This is consistent across all provided training examples.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Sequence Transformation

    Objects:
      - InputSequence:
          type: List[int]
          description: An ordered sequence of integers.
      - OutputSequence:
          type: List[int]
          description: An ordered sequence of integers derived from the InputSequence.

    Properties:
      - length: The number of elements in a sequence. Both InputSequence and OutputSequence have the same length.
      - elements: The individual integers within the sequence.
      - order: The position of elements matters.

    Action:
      - name: LeftRotate
        description: Move the first element of the sequence to the last position.
        input: InputSequence
        output: OutputSequence

    Relationship:
      - The OutputSequence is a result of applying the LeftRotate action to the InputSequence.
      - Specifically, OutputSequence = InputSequence[1:] + [InputSequence[0]].
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Identify the first element of the sequence.
    3.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second element to the last element of the input sequence, maintaining their relative order.
    4.  Append the identified first element to the end of this new sequence.
    5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
