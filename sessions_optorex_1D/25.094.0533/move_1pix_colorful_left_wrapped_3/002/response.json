            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the transformation rule as a single left rotation of the sequence elements. However, the implementation assumed the input and output would be space-separated strings. The execution results clearly show that the `transform` function received a `numpy.ndarray` object instead of a string, causing the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` in the `parse_input` function.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to directly handle NumPy arrays as input and output, removing the string parsing and formatting steps. The core logic of performing a left rotation remains valid and consistent across all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input (NumPy Array)             | Expected Output (NumPy Array)   | Consistent with Left Rotation? | Notes                                       |\n| :------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |\n| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 0 4 8 5 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 0 0 0 4 8 5 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |\n| train_2 | `[0 0 4 6 1 1 4 5 9 5 8 0]` | `[0 4 6 1 1 4 5 9 5 8 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |\n| train_3 | `[0 0 5 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 5 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |\n| train_4 | `[3 7 3 9 9 2 0 0 8 9 3 2]` | `[7 3 9 9 2 0 0 8 9 3 2 3]` | Yes                            | First element `3` moved to the end.       |\n| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |\n| train_6 | `[5 9 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7]` | `[9 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5]` | Yes                            | First element `5` moved to the end.       |\n| train_7 | `[2 0 0 0 0 6 2 6 7 2 4 7]` | `[0 0 0 0 6 2 6 7 2 4 7 2]` | Yes                            | First element `2` moved to the end.       |\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The left rotation rule consistently applies to all training examples when considering the data as sequences (NumPy arrays). The error reported during execution was due to a data type mismatch (expecting string, received NumPy array).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
