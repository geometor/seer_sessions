objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1-dimensional sequence of integers.
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: list[integer]
        value_description: Single-digit integers (0-9).
      - name: length
        value_description: The fixed number of integers in the sequence (observed as 12 in all examples).
actions:
  - name: left_rotate
    description: Shifts all elements one position to the left, moving the first element to the last position.
    input:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: sequence
    output:
      - name: output_sequence
        type: sequence
        description: The input sequence after a single left rotation.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output sequence is generated by applying a single left rotation to the input sequence.
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The element at index `i` (0-based) in the output sequence is the element from index `(i + 1) % length` of the input sequence, where `length` is the total number of elements in the sequence. Equivalently, take the first element and append it to the sequence formed by the remaining elements.
