## Perception

The input and output are both sequences of integers.
Comparing the input and output sequences, it appears that the first element of the input sequence is moved to the end of the sequence to form the output. The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved. This operation is equivalent to a single left rotation of the sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the first integer in the sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all integers from the input sequence *except* the first one, maintaining their original relative order.
4.  Append the first integer (identified in step 2) to the end of the new sequence created in step 3.
5.  Return the resulting sequence as the output.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation rule as a single left rotation of the sequence elements. However, the implementation assumed the input and output would be space-separated strings. The execution results clearly show that the `transform` function received a `numpy.ndarray` object instead of a string, causing the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` in the `parse_input` function.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to directly handle NumPy arrays as input and output, removing the string parsing and formatting steps. The core logic of performing a left rotation remains valid and consistent across all examples.

## Metrics

| Example | Input (NumPy Array)             | Expected Output (NumPy Array)   | Consistent with Left Rotation? | Notes                                       |

| train_2 | `[0 0 4 6 1 1 4 5 9 5 8 0]` | `[0 4 6 1 1 4 5 9 5 8 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |
| train_3 | `[0 0 5 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 5 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |
| train_4 | `[3 7 3 9 9 2 0 0 8 9 3 2]` | `[7 3 9 9 2 0 0 8 9 3 2 3]` | Yes                            | First element `3` moved to the end.       |
| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0 0 0 0]` | Yes                            | First element `0` moved to the end.       |
| train_6 | `[5 9 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7]` | `[9 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5]` | Yes                            | First element `5` moved to the end.       |
| train_7 | `[2 0 0 0 0 6 2 6 7 2 4 7]` | `[0 0 0 0 6 2 6 7 2 4 7 2]` | Yes                            | First element `2` moved to the end.       |

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The left rotation rule consistently applies to all training examples when considering the data as sequences (NumPy arrays). The error reported during execution was due to a data type mismatch (expecting string, received NumPy array).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence as a 1D NumPy array of integers.
2.  Check if the array has fewer than two elements. If so, return the array unchanged.
3.  Identify the first element of the input array.
4.  Create a new NumPy array containing all elements from the input array *except* the first one, maintaining their original relative order.
5.  Append the first element (identified in step 3) to the end of the new array created in step 4.
6.  Return the resulting NumPy array as the output.
