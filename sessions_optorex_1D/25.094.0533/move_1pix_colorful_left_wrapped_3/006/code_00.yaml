objects:
  - type: sequence
    description: A 1-dimensional ordered list of integers.
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: list[integer]
        description: The integer values composing the sequence.
      - name: length
        type: integer
        description: The number of elements in the sequence (consistently 12 in the examples).
  - type: element
    description: An individual integer within the sequence.
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: integer
      - name: position
        type: integer
        description: The 0-based index of the element in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: left_circular_shift
    description: Moves every element one position to the left, wrapping the first element around to the last position.
    input:
      - name: sequence
        type: sequence
        description: The original sequence of integers.
    output:
      - name: shifted_sequence
        type: sequence
        description: The sequence after performing the left circular shift.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output sequence is generated by applying a single left circular shift to the input sequence.
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The element at index 0 of the input sequence is moved to the last index (n-1), and every other element originally at index `i` (where i > 0) is moved to index `i-1`.
