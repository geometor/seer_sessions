No new values are introduced, and no existing values (other than potentially duplicates) are removed; it's a positional change.\n*   **Observed Pattern:** Comparing input and output sequences, it consistently appears that the first element of the input sequence is moved to the last position in the output sequence. All other elements shift one position to the left to fill the gap created by moving the first element. This is characteristic of a left circular shift operation.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
