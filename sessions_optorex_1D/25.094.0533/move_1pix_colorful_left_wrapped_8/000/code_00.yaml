objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (digits 0-9)
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in examples)
actions:
  - name: circular_shift_left
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the first element of the input sequence to the last position, shifting all other elements one position to the left.
relationships:
  - input_sequence[0] becomes output_sequence[n-1] (where n is the length)
  - input_sequence[i] becomes output_sequence[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1
