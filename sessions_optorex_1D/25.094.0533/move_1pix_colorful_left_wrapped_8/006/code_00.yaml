task_description: Perform a single left circular shift on a sequence of numbers.
input_object:
  name: input_sequence
  type: 1D array (list) of integers
  properties:
    - elements: single digits (0-9)
    - length: variable (12 in all examples shown)
output_object:
  name: output_sequence
  type: 1D array (list) of integers
  properties:
    - elements: single digits (0-9) derived from input
    - length: same as input_sequence
action:
  name: left_circular_shift
  input: input_sequence
  output: output_sequence
  description: Moves the element at index 0 of the input_sequence to the last index (length-1) of the output_sequence. All elements from index 1 to length-1 of the input_sequence are shifted one position to the left (index i becomes index i-1) in the output_sequence.
relationships:
  - output_sequence[length-1] = input_sequence[0]
  - output_sequence[i-1] = input_sequence[i] for 1 <= i < length
  - len(output_sequence) == len(input_sequence)
  - The set of elements in output_sequence is identical to the set in input_sequence (only positions change).
