objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - elements: integers (dtype appears to be int64)
      - shape: 1D array, (12,) in examples
actions:
  - name: circular_shift_left
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    description: Moves the first element of the input array to the last position, shifting all other elements one position to the left.
relationships:
  - input_sequence[0] becomes output_sequence[n-1] (where n is the length)
  - input_sequence[1:] becomes output_sequence[0:n-1]
