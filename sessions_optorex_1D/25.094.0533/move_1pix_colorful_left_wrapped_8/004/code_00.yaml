objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list or 1D array
    properties:
      - elements: list of single-digit integers (0-9)
      - length: fixed (12 in all examples)
actions:
  - name: circular_shift_left
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Performs a single left circular shift on the input sequence.
relationships:
  - let n be the length of the sequence.
  - output_sequence[n-1] = input_sequence[0]
  - output_sequence[i] = input_sequence[i+1] for 0 <= i < n-1
