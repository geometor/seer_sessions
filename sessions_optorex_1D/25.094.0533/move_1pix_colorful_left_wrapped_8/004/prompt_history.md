Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output sequences appear to have the same fixed length (12 elements in these examples).
*   **Element Values:** The elements are digits from 0 to 9.
*   **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. No new values are introduced, and no existing values (other than potentially duplicates) are removed; it's a positional change.
*   **Observed Pattern:** Comparing input and output sequences, it consistently appears that the first element of the input sequence is moved to the last position in the output sequence. All other elements shift one position to the left to fill the gap created by moving the first element. This is characteristic of a left circular shift operation.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (digits 0-9)
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in examples)
actions:
  - name: circular_shift_left
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the first element of the input sequence to the last position, shifting all other elements one position to the left.
relationships:
  - input_sequence[0] becomes output_sequence[n-1] (where n is the length)
  - input_sequence[i] becomes output_sequence[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Identify the first element of the sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second element to the last element of the input sequence, maintaining their relative order.
4.  Append the identified first element (from step 2) to the end of the new sequence created in step 3.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
