**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of digits. Both the input and output are strings containing space-separated digits. Comparing the input and output sequences across the examples reveals that the digits present are the same, but their order has changed. Specifically, the first digit in the input sequence appears to be moved to the last position in the output sequence, while the remaining digits shift one position to the left. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    subtype: integer_digits
    properties:
      - ordered
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    subtype: integer_digits
    properties:
      - ordered
      - same_length_as_input
      - contains_same_digits_as_input
actions:
  - name: move_element
    actor: transformation_process
    object: first_element_of_input_sequence
    target_position: end_of_output_sequence
  - name: shift_elements
    actor: transformation_process
    object: remaining_elements_of_input_sequence
    direction: left
    amount: 1_position
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is a cyclic left shift of the input sequence by one position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of digits.
2.  Remove the first digit from the sequence.
3.  Append the removed first digit to the end of the remaining sequence.
4.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
