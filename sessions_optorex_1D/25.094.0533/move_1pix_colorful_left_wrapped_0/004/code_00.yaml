task_description: "Perform a cyclic left shift on a sequence of digits."

  type: string
  description: "Space-separated sequence of single digits."
  elements:
    type: integer_digit
output_format:
  type: string
  description: "Space-separated sequence of single digits, representing the transformed input."
  elements:
    type: integer_digit
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_digits # Derived from splitting the input string
    properties:
      - ordered
      - fixed_length # Length is 12 in all examples
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_digits # To be joined into the output string

actions:
  - name: identify_first_element

    result: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: "The output sequence is generated by moving the first element of the input sequence to the end, shifting all other elements one position to the left (cyclic left shift by 1)."
execution_notes:
  - "Previous execution attempt using a NumPy-based function failed, returning the input unchanged. This suggests potential issues with input type handling (string vs. array) or the execution environment, rather than an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule."
