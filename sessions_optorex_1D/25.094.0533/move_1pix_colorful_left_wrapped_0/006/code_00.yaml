actions:
  - name: extract_element
    actor: transformation_process
    object: input_sequence
    parameters:
      index: 0 # First element
  - name: extract_subarray
    actor: transformation_process
    object: input_sequence
    parameters:
      start_index: 1 # Second element
      end_index: end # To the end of the array
  - name: concatenate_arrays
    actor: transformation_process
    operands:
      - result_of: extract_subarray # Elements from index 1 to end
      - result_of: extract_element # Element at index 0
    target: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is generated by taking the input sequence, removing the element at index 0, and appending that element to the end of the remaining sequence. This constitutes a cyclic left shift by one position.
