task_description: "Conditionally transform a sequence of digits based on its first element."
input_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit
  representation: space-separated string (or 1D integer array)
  length: 12
output_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit
  representation: space-separated string (or 1D integer array)
  length: 12
transformation:
  conditional: true
  condition_field: first_element
  cases:
    - condition_value: non-zero
      action: left_cyclic_shift
      details: Move the first element to the end of the sequence.
      invariants:
        - sequence length
        - multiset of elements
        - relative order of elements from index 1 to end
    - condition_value: zero
      action: remove_first_zero_and_append_zero
      details: Find the index of the first '0', remove it, and append a '0' to the end of the sequence.
      invariants:
        - sequence length
        - multiset of elements (number of zeros remains constant)
      changes:
        - relative order of elements preceding the removed zero might change if the first element was zero.
        - relative order of elements following the removed zero is preserved.
