            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided execution results indicate that the previously submitted code failed to perform the intended transformation. In all examples (training and test), the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, while the `Expected Output` is different. This suggests an issue with the execution environment, the function signature matching, or data type conversion within the test harness, rather than an error in the core logic of the provided Python code (which correctly described a left cyclic shift).\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Input` and the `Expected Output` across all examples consistently reveals the *actual* transformation rule. The `Pixels Off` metric quantifies the difference between the `Input` and the `Expected Output` at each position, confirming that a transformation *should* have occurred.\n\nThe strategy is to ignore the execution failure artifact and focus on the relationship between the `Input` and `Expected Output` pairs provided in the task description. This relationship defines the true transformation rule we need to capture.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nComparing `Input` and `Expected Output` for each example:\n\n*   **Train 1:** `0 0 1 4 5 2 5 9 9 2 0 0` -> `0 1 4 5 2 5 9 9 2 0 0 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 2:** `5 7 1 7 9 0 0 0 9 5 9 8` -> `7 1 7 9 0 0 0 9 5 9 8 5`. The first element (`5`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 3:** `0 0 4 6 9 5 6 7 3 4 6 6` -> `0 4 6 9 5 6 7 3 4 6 6 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 4:** `0 0 2 8 1 8 4 2 2 8 0 0` -> `0 2 8 1 8 4 2 2 8 0 0 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 5:** `2 9 9 5 5 3 4 6 6 0 0 4` -> `9 9 5 5 3 4 6 6 0 0 4 2`. The first element (`2`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 6:** `8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4` -> `9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 8`. The first element (`8`) moves to the end.\n*   **Train 7:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.\n*   **Test 1:** `3 8 3 0 0 0 0 9 8 9 2 9` -> `8 3 0 0 0 0 9 8 9 2 9 3`. The first element (`3`) moves to the end.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** All examples demonstrate a consistent pattern: the sequence undergoes a left cyclic shift (rotation) by one position. The element at index 0 is moved to the last index (index 11), and all other elements shift one position to the left. The `Pixels Off` count reflects the number of positions where the value in the `Expected Output` differs from the value in the `Input`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
