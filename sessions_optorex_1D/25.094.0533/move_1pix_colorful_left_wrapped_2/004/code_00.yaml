task_description: "Perform a left cyclic shift by one position on a sequence of digits."
input_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer digit (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string
  length: 12
  attributes: ordered
output_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer digit (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string
  length: 12
  attributes: ordered
transformation:
  name: Left Cyclic Shift
  amount: 1 position
  description: Moves the first element of the sequence to the end, shifting all intermediate elements one position to the left.
  input_elements_preserved: true
  element_order_preserved: false (globally), true (for elements from index 1 to end, relative to each other)
  sequence_length_preserved: true
invariants:
  - sequence length (remains 12)
  - multiset of elements (the same digits are present, just rearranged)
consistent_across_examples: true
execution_issue_observed: The provided code execution results showed the input returned unchanged, indicating a test harness or execution problem, not a flaw in the previously hypothesized logic (left shift). The logic derived from Input vs Expected Output remains a left cyclic shift.
