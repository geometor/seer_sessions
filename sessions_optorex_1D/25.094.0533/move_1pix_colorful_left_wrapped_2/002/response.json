The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the actual input object type is a NumPy array.\n    *   All examples consistently failed with the same error, reinforcing the conclusion about the input type.\n    *   The core transformation logic identified previously (left cyclic shift by one position) appears correct when visually inspecting the input/output pairs, even considering them as arrays rather than strings.\n    *   The strategy is to update the understanding of the input/output data types to NumPy arrays and revise the natural language program to describe array manipulation instead of string operations.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input Type: Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples (inferred from error).\n    *   Output Type: Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the task structure.\n    *   Input Length: 12 elements in all training examples.\n    *   Output Length: 12 elements in all training examples.\n    *   Element Type: Appears to be integers (digits 0-9).\n    *   Transformation Consistency: The rule \"move the first element to the end\" holds for all 7 training examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
