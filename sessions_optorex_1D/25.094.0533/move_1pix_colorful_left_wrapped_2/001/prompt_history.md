*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the input and output sequences remains constant for each example pair (12 digits).
    *   Comparing input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the first digit of the input sequence is moved to the end of the sequence to form the output sequence. The relative order of the other digits remains unchanged. This operation is known as a left cyclic shift or rotation by one position.

*   **YAML facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: "Perform a left cyclic shift on a sequence of digits."
    input_object:
      type: sequence
      element_type: digit
      representation: space-separated string
      length: 12
    output_object:
      type: sequence
      element_type: digit
      representation: space-separated string
      length: 12
    transformation:
      action: left_cyclic_shift
      details: Move the first element of the input sequence to the end position.
      invariants:
        - sequence length
        - set of elements (multiset)
        - relative order of elements from index 1 to end
    examples_consistent: true
    ```


*   **Natural language program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Identify the first digit in the sequence.
    3.  Create a new sequence containing all digits from the second position to the end of the original input sequence.
    4.  Append the identified first digit to the end of this new sequence.
    5.  Output the resulting sequence.
