*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the input and output sequences remains constant for each example pair (12 digits).
    *   Comparing input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the first digit of the input sequence is moved to the end of the sequence to form the output sequence. The relative order of the other digits remains unchanged. This operation is known as a left cyclic shift or rotation by one position.

*   **YAML facts:**

## General Assessment

The provided execution results indicate that the previously submitted code failed to perform the intended transformation. In all examples (training and test), the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, while the `Expected Output` is different. This suggests an issue with the execution environment, the function signature matching, or data type conversion within the test harness, rather than an error in the core logic of the provided Python code (which correctly described a left cyclic shift).

However, the comparison between the `Input` and the `Expected Output` across all examples consistently reveals the *actual* transformation rule. The `Pixels Off` metric quantifies the difference between the `Input` and the `Expected Output` at each position, confirming that a transformation *should* have occurred.

The strategy is to ignore the execution failure artifact and focus on the relationship between the `Input` and `Expected Output` pairs provided in the task description. This relationship defines the true transformation rule we need to capture.

## Metrics and Analysis

Comparing `Input` and `Expected Output` for each example:

*   **Train 1:** `0 0 1 4 5 2 5 9 9 2 0 0` -> `0 1 4 5 2 5 9 9 2 0 0 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 2:** `5 7 1 7 9 0 0 0 9 5 9 8` -> `7 1 7 9 0 0 0 9 5 9 8 5`. The first element (`5`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 3:** `0 0 4 6 9 5 6 7 3 4 6 6` -> `0 4 6 9 5 6 7 3 4 6 6 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 4:** `0 0 2 8 1 8 4 2 2 8 0 0` -> `0 2 8 1 8 4 2 2 8 0 0 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 5:** `2 9 9 5 5 3 4 6 6 0 0 4` -> `9 9 5 5 3 4 6 6 0 0 4 2`. The first element (`2`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 6:** `8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4` -> `9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 8`. The first element (`8`) moves to the end.
*   **Train 7:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0`. The first element (`0`) moves to the end.
*   **Test 1:** `3 8 3 0 0 0 0 9 8 9 2 9` -> `8 3 0 0 0 0 9 8 9 2 9 3`. The first element (`3`) moves to the end.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** All examples demonstrate a consistent pattern: the sequence undergoes a left cyclic shift (rotation) by one position. The element at index 0 is moved to the last index (index 11), and all other elements shift one position to the left. The `Pixels Off` count reflects the number of positions where the value in the `Expected Output` differs from the value in the `Input`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  **Identify** and temporarily store the digit located at the first position (index 0) of the sequence.
3.  **Create** a new sequence containing all digits from the second position (index 1) through the last position (index 11) of the original input sequence, maintaining their relative order.
4.  **Append** the digit stored in step 2 to the end of the new sequence created in step 3.
5.  **Return** the resulting sequence.
