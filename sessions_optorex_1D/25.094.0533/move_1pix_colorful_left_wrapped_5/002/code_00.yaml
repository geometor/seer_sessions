objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list or 1D numpy array of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list or 1D numpy array of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers produced as output.
  - name: first_element
    type: integer
    description: The element at the beginning (index 0) of the input_sequence.
  - name: remaining_elements
    type: list or 1D numpy array of integers
    description: The elements of the input_sequence starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.

actions:
  - name: move_first_to_end
    actor: transformation_process
    object: input_sequence
    result: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Check if the input_sequence has more than one element. If not, return it unchanged.
      - Identify the first_element (at index 0) of the input_sequence.
      - Identify the remaining_elements (from index 1 onwards) of the input_sequence.
      - Construct the output_sequence by concatenating the remaining_elements followed by the first_element.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is formed by taking the first_element of the input_sequence and appending it to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining_elements. The relative order of the remaining_elements is preserved.
  - type: composition
    container: output_sequence
    contains:
      - remaining_elements (in original relative order, shifted left by one position)
      - first_element (at the end)
  - type: data_format
    object: input_sequence
    format: Expected to be a list or NumPy array of integers, not a string.
