            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the execution results is a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format (a NumPy array, based on the error message) and the format the `transform` function was designed to handle (a space-separated string). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the function received an array but attempted to call a string method on it.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n\n1.  **Correcting Input Handling:** Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a 1D NumPy array directly. Remove the string splitting step.\n2.  **Adapting Logic to Arrays:** Ensure all indexing, searching for '2's, identifying '0' blocks, finding bordering non-zero digits, and replacement operations are performed using NumPy array methods and indexing.\n3.  **Verifying Output Format:** Ensure the function returns a NumPy array, consistent with the assumed input format.\n4.  **Re-validating Logic:** Mentally re-trace the core transformation logic (fill adjacent '0' blocks near a '2' with the bordering non-zero digit) using the examples, treating them as arrays from the start. Based on a preliminary mental walkthrough, the core logic appears consistent with the examples even when considering array inputs.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nSince the code failed at the input processing stage for all examples due to the type mismatch, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered from the execution. The failure was uniform across all examples.\n\nA manual re-evaluation of the logic against the examples (treating inputs/outputs as arrays) confirms the transformation rule derived previously seems correct:\n\n*   Examples 1, 2, 3, 6: No changes occur because the digit(s) adjacent to '2' are either non-zero or the adjacent '0's are bordered only by the array boundary without a non-zero digit to propagate.\n*   Example 4: The `0 0 0` block left of '2' is bordered by '3' on its left, so it becomes `3 3 3`.\n*   Example 5: The `0 0 0` block right of '2' is bordered by '3' on its right, so it becomes `3 3 3`.\n*   Example 7: The `0` block right of '2' is bordered by '7' on its right, so it becomes `7`.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
