**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified by the execution results is a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format (a NumPy array, based on the error message) and the format the `transform` function was designed to handle (a space-separated string). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the function received an array but attempted to call a string method on it.

The strategy to resolve this involves:

1.  **Correcting Input Handling:** Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a 1D NumPy array directly. Remove the string splitting step.
2.  **Adapting Logic to Arrays:** Ensure all indexing, searching for '2's, identifying '0' blocks, finding bordering non-zero digits, and replacement operations are performed using NumPy array methods and indexing.
3.  **Verifying Output Format:** Ensure the function returns a NumPy array, consistent with the assumed input format.
4.  **Re-validating Logic:** Mentally re-trace the core transformation logic (fill adjacent '0' blocks near a '2' with the bordering non-zero digit) using the examples, treating them as arrays from the start. Based on a preliminary mental walkthrough, the core logic appears consistent with the examples even when considering array inputs.

**Metrics Gathering**

Since the code failed at the input processing stage for all examples due to the type mismatch, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered from the execution. The failure was uniform across all examples.

A manual re-evaluation of the logic against the examples (treating inputs/outputs as arrays) confirms the transformation rule derived previously seems correct:

*   Examples 1, 2, 3, 6: No changes occur because the digit(s) adjacent to '2' are either non-zero or the adjacent '0's are bordered only by the array boundary without a non-zero digit to propagate.
*   Example 4: The `0 0 0` block left of '2' is bordered by '3' on its left, so it becomes `3 3 3`.
*   Example 5: The `0 0 0` block right of '2' is bordered by '3' on its right, so it becomes `3 3 3`.
*   Example 7: The `0` block right of '2' is bordered by '7' on its right, so it becomes `7`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input as a 1D NumPy array of integers. Create a copy of the input array to store the output, allowing modification without affecting ongoing checks on the original data.
2.  Find all indices `i` in the input array where the element's value is `2`.
3.  For each index `i` found:
    a.  **Check Left:**
        i.  If the element at index `i-1` exists and is `0`, identify the contiguous block of `0`s extending to the left from `i-1`. Let this block span from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` (inclusive, where `zero_end = i-1`).
        ii. Check the element at index `zero_start - 1`. If this index is valid (within array bounds) and the element `d` at this index is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output array* from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` with the value `d`.
    b.  **Check Right:**
        i.  If the element at index `i+1` exists and is `0`, identify the contiguous block of `0`s extending to the right from `i+1`. Let this block span from index `zero_start` (`zero_start = i+1`) to `zero_end` (inclusive).
        ii. Check the element at index `zero_end + 1`. If this index is valid (within array bounds) and the element `d` at this index is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output array* from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` with the value `d`.
4.  After checking both sides for all occurrences of `2`, return the modified output array. If no `2` was found, or if no replacements were triggered based on the conditions, the returned array will be identical to the input array.
