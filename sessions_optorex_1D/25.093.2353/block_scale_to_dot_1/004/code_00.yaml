task_description: "Fill blocks of zeros adjacent to a '2' based on the non-zero digit bordering the block."
input_format:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  representation: space-separated string
output_format:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  representation: space-separated string
rules:
  - rule: "Identity Transformation (Default)"
    condition: "No '2' is present, OR no '0' blocks are adjacent to any '2', OR adjacent '0' blocks are not bordered by a non-zero digit on the side opposite the '2'."
    action: Output is identical to the input.
  - rule: "Zero Block Filling"
    condition: "A digit '2' exists in the sequence."
    action:
      - scope: "For each occurrence of the digit '2' at index `idx`:"
      - step: "Check Left Adjacency"
        sub_condition: "Index `idx-1` exists AND contains '0'."
        sub_action:
          - "Identify the contiguous block of '0's ending at `idx-1` (from `zero_start_left` to `zero_end_left=idx-1`)."
          - "Identify the bordering digit at index `border_idx = zero_start_left - 1`."
          - "If `border_idx` is valid (>= 0) AND the digit at `border_idx` is non-zero:"
          - "Replace all elements in the output sequence from `zero_start_left` to `zero_end_left` with the bordering digit."
      - step: "Check Right Adjacency"
        sub_condition: "Index `idx+1` exists AND contains '0'."
        sub_action:
          - "Identify the contiguous block of '0's starting at `idx+1` (from `zero_start_right=idx+1` to `zero_end_right`)."
          - "Identify the bordering digit at index `border_idx = zero_end_right + 1`."
          - "If `border_idx` is valid (< sequence length) AND the digit at `border_idx` is non-zero:"
          - "Replace all elements in the output sequence from `zero_start_right` to `zero_end_right` with the bordering digit."
    notes:
      - "Modifications are based on the original input state but applied to the output."
      - "The process is applied independently for the left and right sides of each '2'."
      - "The fill operation stops at the sequence boundaries or at the bordering non-zero digit."
key_elements:
  - element: digit '2'
    role: trigger, boundary
  - element: digit '0'
    role: target for replacement
  - element: non-zero digit (1, 3-9)
    role: source for fill value, boundary for zero block search
