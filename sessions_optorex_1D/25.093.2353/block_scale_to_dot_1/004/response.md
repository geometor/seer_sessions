**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code (`code_00.py`) aimed to implement the transformation rule observed in the initial examples. The core logic involved finding the digit '2', identifying adjacent blocks of '0's, and filling those '0's with the non-zero digit bordering the block on the side opposite the '2'.

However, the execution results show failures on `train_4`, `train_5`, and `train_7`. In all failed cases, the code's output matched the *input*, indicating that the intended replacement of '0' blocks did not occur. Manual walkthroughs of the code logic against these failed examples suggest the code *should* have produced the expected output.

This discrepancy points towards a potential issue either in the exact code version executed by the test harness or a subtle implementation detail (perhaps related to array slicing or loop bounds) that behaves differently in practice than in the manual trace.

The strategy is to:
1.  Assume the *intended* logic (as described in the previous natural language program and the code's comments) is correct based on the *expected* outputs.
2.  Refine the description (YAML facts and natural language program) to be as precise as possible about the conditions for replacement, especially regarding boundaries and the non-zero fill value requirement.
3.  Document the performance metrics based on the *actual* results provided, highlighting the specific examples where the implementation failed.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits. Create a mutable copy for the output.
2.  Find all indices where the digit '2' appears in the original input sequence.
3.  If no '2' is found, the output is identical to the input. Return the output sequence.
4.  If '2's are found, iterate through each index `idx` where a '2' is located:
    a.  **Process Left Side:**
        i.  Check if the element immediately to the left (`idx-1`) exists and is '0'.
        ii. If yes, identify the contiguous block of '0's extending leftwards from `idx-1`. Let the start index of this block be `zero_start_left`.
        iii. Check the element at index `zero_start_left - 1`.
        iv. If this element exists (index >= 0) and its value is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output sequence* from index `zero_start_left` up to `idx-1` (inclusive) with this non-zero value.
    b.  **Process Right Side:**
        i.  Check if the element immediately to the right (`idx+1`) exists and is '0'.
        ii. If yes, identify the contiguous block of '0's extending rightwards from `idx+1`. Let the end index of this block be `zero_end_right`.
        iii. Check the element at index `zero_end_right + 1`.
        iv. If this element exists (index < sequence length) and its value is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output sequence* from index `idx+1` up to `zero_end_right` (inclusive) with this non-zero value.
5.  After processing all occurrences of '2', return the modified output sequence.
