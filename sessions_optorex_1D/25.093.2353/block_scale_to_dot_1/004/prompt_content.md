"""
The transformation rule operates on a 1D NumPy array of integers. It identifies 
all occurrences of the integer '2'. For each '2', it checks its immediate left 
and right neighbors. If a neighbor is '0', it identifies the full contiguous 
block of '0's extending away from the '2'. It then looks at the element 
immediately bordering this block of '0's on the side opposite the '2'. If this 
bordering element exists (is within the array bounds) and is non-zero, the 
entire contiguous block of '0's is replaced with the value of that non-zero 
bordering element. This check and potential replacement are performed 
independently for the left and right sides of each '2' found in the array. 
If no '2' is present, or if the conditions for replacement (adjacent '0' block 
bordered by a non-zero digit) are not met, the array remains unchanged. The 
modifications are based on the original input array but applied to a copy, 
which is then returned.
