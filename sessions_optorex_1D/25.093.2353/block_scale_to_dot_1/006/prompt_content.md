"""
The transformation rule operates on a 1D NumPy array of integers. It identifies
all occurrences of the integer '2'. For each '2', it checks its immediate left
and right neighbors based on the *original* input array. If a neighbor is '0',
it identifies the full contiguous block of '0's extending away from the '2' in
that direction, again based on the original input. It then looks at the element
immediately bordering this block of '0's on the side opposite the '2' in the
original input. If this bordering element exists (is within the array bounds)
and is non-zero, the entire contiguous block of '0's in the *output* array is
replaced with the value of that non-zero bordering element. This check and
potential replacement are performed independently for the left and right sides
of each '2' found in the array. If no '2' is present, or if the conditions for
replacement (adjacent '0' block bordered by a non-zero digit) are not met for
a given side, the corresponding section of the output array remains unchanged
from the initial copy of the input.
