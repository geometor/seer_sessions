data_representation:
  type: sequence
  format: 1D array (derived from space-separated string)
  elements: integers (digits 0-9)

objects:
  - object: target_marker
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: trigger for potential modification, boundary for fill operation

  - object: fillable_element
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: element to be potentially replaced

  - object: fill_source
    properties:
      - value: any integer from 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
      - role: provides the value used to replace fillable_elements

  - object: sequence_segment
    properties:
      - type: contiguous block of fillable_elements (0s)
      - role: target for replacement action

state:
  - input_array: the original sequence of integers
  - output_array: a modifiable copy of the input_array, initially identical

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a copy of the input array to store results.

  - action: locate_targets
    input: input_array
    target: target_marker (value 2)
    output: list of indices where the target_marker exists

  - action: process_target_neighbors
    trigger: for each index found by locate_targets
    input: input_array, target_marker_index
    steps:
      - check_direction: left
        - condition_1: index > 0 (boundary check)
        - condition_2: element at index - 1 is fillable_element (0)
        - if_conditions_met:
          - find_segment: identify contiguous block of fillable_elements (0s) extending leftwards from index - 1.
          - find_source: check element immediately to the left of the identified segment.
          - condition_3: source element exists (within bounds).
          - condition_4: source element is a fill_source (non-zero digit).
          - if_conditions_met:
            - replace_segment: modify the output_array by replacing the identified segment with the value of the fill_source.
      - check_direction: right
        - condition_1: index < length - 1 (boundary check)
        - condition_2: element at index + 1 is fillable_element (0)
        - if_conditions_met:
          - find_segment: identify contiguous block of fillable_elements (0s) extending rightwards from index + 1.
          - find_source: check element immediately to the right of the identified segment.
          - condition_3: source element exists (within bounds).
          - condition_4: source element is a fill_source (non-zero digit).
          - if_conditions_met:
            - replace_segment: modify the output_array by replacing the identified segment with the value of the fill_source.

  - action: finalize_output
    description: Return the modified output_array.

flow:
  - Initialize output array from input.
  - Find all indices of '2' in the input array.
  - For each index of '2':
    - Perform 'process_target_neighbors' for the left direction, using the input array for checks and modifying the output array for replacements.
    - Perform 'process_target_neighbors' for the right direction, using the input array for checks and modifying the output array for replacements.
  - Return the final output array.
