For each '2', it checks its immediate left\nand right neighbors based on the *original* input array. If a neighbor is '0',\nit identifies the full contiguous block of '0's extending away from the '2' in\nthat direction, again based on the original input. It then looks at the element\nimmediately bordering this block of '0's on the side opposite the '2' in the\noriginal input. If this bordering element exists (is within the array bounds)\nand is non-zero, the entire contiguous block of '0's in the *output* array is\nreplaced with the value of that non-zero bordering element. This check and\npotential replacement are performed independently for the left and right sides\nof each '2' found in the array. If no '2' is present, or if the conditions for\nreplacement (adjacent '0' block bordered by a non-zero digit) are not met for\na given side, the corresponding section of the output array remains unchanged\nfrom the initial copy of the input.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the zero-filling rule adjacent to '2's based on bordering non-zero digits.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 1D NumPy array containing integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 1D NumPy array containing the transformed sequence of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input to allow modifications\n    # All checks for conditions (locations of 2s, 0s, fill digits) will be done\n    # on the original input_grid, but modifications will be applied to output_grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    n = len(input_grid)\n\n    # Find indices of all elements equal to 2 in the original input\n    two_indices = np.where(input_grid == 2)[0]\n\n    # Iterate through each index where a '2' was found in the input\n    for idx in two_indices:\n\n        # --- Check Left Side ---\n        # Check if there's an element to the left and if it's 0 in the input_grid\n        if idx > 0 and input_grid[idx - 1] == 0:\n            # Find the start of the contiguous block of zeros ending at idx - 1\n            # We scan leftwards from idx - 1\n            zero_end_left = idx - 1\n            zero_start_left = zero_end_left\n            # Keep moving left as long as we are in bounds and see a 0 in the input\n            while zero_start_left > 0 and input_grid[zero_start_left - 1] == 0:\n                zero_start_left -= 1\n\n            # Check the element bordering the zero block on the far left in the input_grid\n            fill_digit_idx_left = zero_start_left - 1\n            # Ensure the border index is valid\n            if fill_digit_idx_left >= 0:\n                fill_digit_left = input_grid[fill_digit_idx_left]\n                # If the bordering element is non-zero, fill the zeros in the output grid\n                if fill_digit_left != 0:\n                    # Modify the output_grid in the range of the zero block\n                    output_grid[zero_start_left : zero_end_left + 1] = fill_digit_left\n\n        # --- Check Right Side ---\n        # Check if there's an element to the right and if it's 0 in the input_grid\n        if idx < n - 1 and input_grid[idx + 1] == 0:\n            # Find the end of the contiguous block of zeros starting at idx + 1\n            # We scan rightwards from idx + 1\n            zero_start_right = idx + 1\n            zero_end_right = zero_start_right\n            # Keep moving right as long as we are in bounds and see a 0 in the input\n            while zero_end_right < n - 1 and input_grid[zero_end_right + 1] == 0:\n                zero_end_right += 1\n\n            # Check the element bordering the zero block on the far right in the input_grid\n            fill_digit_idx_right = zero_end_right + 1\n            # Ensure the border index is valid\n            if fill_digit_idx_right < n:\n                fill_digit_right = input_grid[fill_digit_idx_right]\n                # If the bordering element is non-zero, fill the zeros in the output grid\n                if fill_digit_right != 0:\n                     # Modify the output_grid in the range of the zero block\n                    output_grid[zero_start_right : zero_end_right + 1] = fill_digit_right\n\n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
