Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems conditional. In many cases (train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6), the input is identical to the output. In others (train_4, train_5, train_7), specific changes occur.
3.  **Key Element '2':** The digit '2' appears to play a crucial role. Changes only happen in examples containing a '2', and the changes occur *near* the '2'.
4.  **Key Element '0':** The digit '0' also seems important. The changes involve replacing sequences of '0's.
5.  **Filling Behavior:** When changes occur, sequences of '0's adjacent to a '2' are replaced by a non-zero digit. This non-zero digit appears to be "copied" from the digit bordering the sequence of '0's on the side *opposite* the '2'.
    *   In `train_4` (`... 3 3 3 0 0 0 2 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the left of `2` and bordered by `3` on its left. It becomes `3 3 3`.
    *   In `train_5` (`... 2 0 0 0 3 3 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the right of `2` and bordered by `3` on its right. It becomes `3 3 3`.
    *   In `train_7` (`... 2 0 7 7 ...`), the `0` is to the right of `2` and bordered by `7` on its right. It becomes `7`.
6.  **Boundary Condition:** The '2' seems to act as a boundary for this filling process. The filling stops *at* the '2'.
7.  **No Change Condition:** If the digits adjacent to '2' are not '0's, or if the zeros are bordered only by other '0's or the sequence boundaries without a non-zero digit to copy from, no change occurs in that direction.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Represent the input string of digits as a list or array.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the index (or indices, if multiple '2's exist) of the digit '2'.
3.  For each index `i` where the digit is '2':
    a.  **Check Left:** Examine the digits to the left of index `i` (i.e., index `i-1`, `i-2`, ...). If there is a contiguous block of '0's immediately to the left of '2' (ending at index `i-1`), find the first non-zero digit `d` encountered when moving further left from this block of '0's. If such a non-zero digit `d` is found before reaching the beginning of the sequence or another '2', replace all the '0's in that contiguous block with `d`.
    b.  **Check Right:** Examine the digits to the right of index `i` (i.e., index `i+1`, `i+2`, ...). If there is a contiguous block of '0's immediately to the right of '2' (starting at index `i+1`), find the first non-zero digit `d` encountered when moving further right from this block of '0's. If such a non-zero digit `d` is found before reaching the end of the sequence or another '2', replace all the '0's in that contiguous block with `d`.
4.  If no '2' is found in the list, or if the conditions for replacement in step 3a or 3b are not met for any '2', the list remains unchanged.
5.  Convert the potentially modified list back into a space-separated string of digits for the output.
