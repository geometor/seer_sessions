            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of digits separated by spaces.\n2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems conditional. In many cases (train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6), the input is identical to the output. In others (train_4, train_5, train_7), specific changes occur.\n3.  **Key Element '2':** The digit '2' appears to play a crucial role. Changes only happen in examples containing a '2', and the changes occur *near* the '2'.\n4.  **Key Element '0':** The digit '0' also seems important. The changes involve replacing sequences of '0's.\n5.  **Filling Behavior:** When changes occur, sequences of '0's adjacent to a '2' are replaced by a non-zero digit. This non-zero digit appears to be \"copied\" from the digit bordering the sequence of '0's on the side *opposite* the '2'.\n    *   In `train_4` (`... 3 3 3 0 0 0 2 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the left of `2` and bordered by `3` on its left. It becomes `3 3 3`.\n    *   In `train_5` (`... 2 0 0 0 3 3 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the right of `2` and bordered by `3` on its right. It becomes `3 3 3`.\n    *   In `train_7` (`... 2 0 7 7 ...`), the `0` is to the right of `2` and bordered by `7` on its right. It becomes `7`.\n6.  **Boundary Condition:** The '2' seems to act as a boundary for this filling process. The filling stops *at* the '2'.\n7.  **No Change Condition:** If the digits adjacent to '2' are not '0's, or if the zeros are bordered only by other '0's or the sequence boundaries without a non-zero digit to copy from, no change occurs in that direction.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
