Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems conditional. In many cases (train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6), the input is identical to the output. In others (train_4, train_5, train_7), specific changes occur.
3.  **Key Element '2':** The digit '2' appears to play a crucial role. Changes only happen in examples containing a '2', and the changes occur *near* the '2'.
4.  **Key Element '0':** The digit '0' also seems important. The changes involve replacing sequences of '0's.
5.  **Filling Behavior:** When changes occur, sequences of '0's adjacent to a '2' are replaced by a non-zero digit. This non-zero digit appears to be "copied" from the digit bordering the sequence of '0's on the side *opposite* the '2'.
    *   In `train_4` (`... 3 3 3 0 0 0 2 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the left of `2` and bordered by `3` on its left. It becomes `3 3 3`.
    *   In `train_5` (`... 2 0 0 0 3 3 ...`), the `0 0 0` block is to the right of `2` and bordered by `3` on its right. It becomes `3 3 3`.
    *   In `train_7` (`... 2 0 7 7 ...`), the `0` is to the right of `2` and bordered by `7` on its right. It becomes `7`.
6.  **Boundary Condition:** The '2' seems to act as a boundary for this filling process. The filling stops *at* the '2'.
7.  **No Change Condition:** If the digits adjacent to '2' are not '0's, or if the zeros are bordered only by other '0's or the sequence boundaries without a non-zero digit to copy from, no change occurs in that direction.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Represent the input string of digits as a list or array.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the index (or indices, if multiple '2's exist) of the digit '2'.
3.  For each index `i` where the digit is '2':
    a.  **Check Left:** Examine the digits to the left of index `i` (i.e., index `i-1`, `i-2`, ...). If there is a contiguous block of '0's immediately to the left of '2' (ending at index `i-1`), find the first non-zero digit `d` encountered when moving further left from this block of '0's. If such a non-zero digit `d` is found before reaching the beginning of the sequence or another '2', replace all the '0's in that contiguous block with `d`.
    b.  **Check Right:** Examine the digits to the right of index `i` (i.e., index `i+1`, `i+2`, ...). If there is a contiguous block of '0's immediately to the right of '2' (starting at index `i+1`), find the first non-zero digit `d` encountered when moving further right from this block of '0's. If such a non-zero digit `d` is found before reaching the end of the sequence or another '2', replace all the '0's in that contiguous block with `d`.
4.  If no '2' is found in the list, or if the conditions for replacement in step 3a or 3b are not met for any '2', the list remains unchanged.
5.  Convert the potentially modified list back into a space-separated string of digits for the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified by the execution results is a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format (a NumPy array, based on the error message) and the format the `transform` function was designed to handle (a space-separated string). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the function received an array but attempted to call a string method on it.

The strategy to resolve this involves:

1.  **Correcting Input Handling:** Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a 1D NumPy array directly. Remove the string splitting step.
2.  **Adapting Logic to Arrays:** Ensure all indexing, searching for '2's, identifying '0' blocks, finding bordering non-zero digits, and replacement operations are performed using NumPy array methods and indexing.
3.  **Verifying Output Format:** Ensure the function returns a NumPy array, consistent with the assumed input format.
4.  **Re-validating Logic:** Mentally re-trace the core transformation logic (fill adjacent '0' blocks near a '2' with the bordering non-zero digit) using the examples, treating them as arrays from the start. Based on a preliminary mental walkthrough, the core logic appears consistent with the examples even when considering array inputs.

**Metrics Gathering**

Since the code failed at the input processing stage for all examples due to the type mismatch, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered from the execution. The failure was uniform across all examples.

A manual re-evaluation of the logic against the examples (treating inputs/outputs as arrays) confirms the transformation rule derived previously seems correct:

*   Examples 1, 2, 3, 6: No changes occur because the digit(s) adjacent to '2' are either non-zero or the adjacent '0's are bordered only by the array boundary without a non-zero digit to propagate.
*   Example 4: The `0 0 0` block left of '2' is bordered by '3' on its left, so it becomes `3 3 3`.
*   Example 5: The `0 0 0` block right of '2' is bordered by '3' on its right, so it becomes `3 3 3`.
*   Example 7: The `0` block right of '2' is bordered by '7' on its right, so it becomes `7`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input as a 1D NumPy array of integers. Create a copy of the input array to store the output, allowing modification without affecting ongoing checks on the original data.
2.  Find all indices `i` in the input array where the element's value is `2`.
3.  For each index `i` found:
    a.  **Check Left:**
        i.  If the element at index `i-1` exists and is `0`, identify the contiguous block of `0`s extending to the left from `i-1`. Let this block span from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` (inclusive, where `zero_end = i-1`).
        ii. Check the element at index `zero_start - 1`. If this index is valid (within array bounds) and the element `d` at this index is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output array* from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` with the value `d`.
    b.  **Check Right:**
        i.  If the element at index `i+1` exists and is `0`, identify the contiguous block of `0`s extending to the right from `i+1`. Let this block span from index `zero_start` (`zero_start = i+1`) to `zero_end` (inclusive).
        ii. Check the element at index `zero_end + 1`. If this index is valid (within array bounds) and the element `d` at this index is non-zero, then replace all elements in the *output array* from index `zero_start` to `zero_end` with the value `d`.
4.  After checking both sides for all occurrences of `2`, return the modified output array. If no `2` was found, or if no replacements were triggered based on the conditions, the returned array will be identical to the input array.
