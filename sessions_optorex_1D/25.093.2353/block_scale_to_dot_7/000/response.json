The core operation appears to be conditionally replacing sequences of one or more zeros based on the non-zero numbers immediately preceding and succeeding the zero sequence. The specific value used for replacement depends on the value of the succeeding non-zero number. If the succeeding number is `2`, the preceding number is used for replacement; otherwise, the succeeding number is used. Sequences where zeros are not enclosed by non-zero numbers, or sequences without the specific `X 0...0 Y` pattern, remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the start (`i`) of every maximal contiguous block of zeros that is preceded by a non-zero number (`X` at index `i-1`) and followed by a non-zero number (`Y` at index `k+1`, where `k` is the end index of the zero block).\n    5.  For each such identified block of zeros (from index `i` to `k`):\n        a.  Let `X` be the value at index `i-1`.\n        b.  Let `Y` be the value at index `k+1`.\n        c.

Replace all elements in the output sequence from index `i` to `k` (inclusive) with the `fill_value`.\n    6.  Ensure that the iteration process correctly handles modifications, perhaps by identifying all necessary changes first and then applying them, or by carefully adjusting the iteration index after a replacement to avoid re-evaluating modified sections incorrectly. A simple approach is to iterate and modify a copy, applying changes based on the original sequence's structure.\n    7.  Return the modified sequence."
