elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - representation: list or array of integers
      - length: 12 (typically, though code should handle variable length defensively)
      - item_type: integer
      - item_range: 0-9
objects:
  - id: marker
    value: 2
    description: A fixed reference digit. Its position dictates the fill boundaries. It is never modified or moved.
  - id: fillable_space
    value: 0
    description: Represents positions eligible for replacement by a 'fill_value'.
  - id: fill_value
    value: N (any digit from 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    description: A non-zero, non-marker digit that provides the value for filling adjacent 'fillable_space' digits towards the 'marker'.
relationships:
  - type: position
    description: The index of the 'marker' is crucial.
  - type: adjacency_search
    description: The transformation depends on finding the nearest 'fill_value' to the left and right of the 'marker'.
  - type: intervening_sequence
    description: A sequence of one or more 'fillable_space' digits located between the 'marker' and the nearest 'fill_value' on either side.
actions:
  - name: locate_marker
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    output: index of the 'marker' (digit 2), or indication of absence.
  - name: search_nearest_left_fill
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    input_param: marker_index
    output: index and value of the nearest non-zero digit left of the marker, or indication of none found.
  - name: search_nearest_right_fill
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    input_param: marker_index
    output: index and value of the nearest non-zero digit right of the marker, or indication of none found.
  - name: fill_intervening_zeros
    actor: system
    target: output_sequence (copy of input)
    input_params:
      - marker_index
      - left_fill_index (if found)
      - left_fill_value (if found)
      - right_fill_index (if found)
      - right_fill_value (if found)
    condition: A non-zero fill value exists on a side, and there are 'fillable_space' (0) digits between it and the 'marker'.
    effect: Replace 'fillable_space' (0) digits within the identified intervening sequences with the corresponding 'fill_value'. This happens independently for the left and right sides.
