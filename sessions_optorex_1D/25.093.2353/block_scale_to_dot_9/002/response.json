            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe primary issue identified in the previous execution attempt was a type mismatch. The code expected a space-separated string as input (`input_sequence_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the testing environment provided the input as a `numpy.ndarray`. The underlying logic (identifying the '2' marker, finding nearest non-zero neighbors, and filling the intervening '0's) appears consistent with all provided training examples.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the input handling by directly working with the input list/array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step. The core transformation algorithm remains the same.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nSince the previous code failed during input processing, no meaningful metrics about its execution behavior (e.g., which specific indices were filled) can be gathered from the error report. However, analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the proposed transformation rule:\n\n*   **Consistency:** In all 7 examples, the output is derived from the input by locating the digit `2`.\n*   **Marker (`2`):** The position of `2` is unchanged in all outputs.\n*   **Fill Value (`N`):** Non-zero digits other than `2` act as the source for filling.\n*   **Fillable (`0`):** Only `0` digits are ever replaced.\n*   **Filling Mechanism:** `0`s located strictly *between* the marker `2` and the nearest non-zero digit (`N`) on either side (left or right) are replaced by that `N`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   If `2` is at an edge or adjacent to a non-`0`, no filling occurs on that side (Examples 4, 6).\n    *   If a side only contains `0`s extending to the boundary, no filling occurs on that side (Examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 show variations of this).\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
