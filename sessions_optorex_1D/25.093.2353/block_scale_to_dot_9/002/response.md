**General Assessment**

The primary issue identified in the previous execution attempt was a type mismatch. The code expected a space-separated string as input (`input_sequence_str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the testing environment provided the input as a `numpy.ndarray`. The underlying logic (identifying the '2' marker, finding nearest non-zero neighbors, and filling the intervening '0's) appears consistent with all provided training examples.

The strategy is to correct the input handling by directly working with the input list/array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step. The core transformation algorithm remains the same.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

Since the previous code failed during input processing, no meaningful metrics about its execution behavior (e.g., which specific indices were filled) can be gathered from the error report. However, analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the proposed transformation rule:

*   **Consistency:** In all 7 examples, the output is derived from the input by locating the digit `2`.
*   **Marker (`2`):** The position of `2` is unchanged in all outputs.
*   **Fill Value (`N`):** Non-zero digits other than `2` act as the source for filling.
*   **Fillable (`0`):** Only `0` digits are ever replaced.
*   **Filling Mechanism:** `0`s located strictly *between* the marker `2` and the nearest non-zero digit (`N`) on either side (left or right) are replaced by that `N`.
*   **Boundary Conditions:**
    *   If `2` is at an edge or adjacent to a non-`0`, no filling occurs on that side (Examples 4, 6).
    *   If a side only contains `0`s extending to the boundary, no filling occurs on that side (Examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 show variations of this).

elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - representation: list or array of integers

      - item_range: 0-9
objects:
  - id: marker
    value: 2
    description: A fixed reference digit. Its position dictates the fill boundaries. It is never modified or moved.
  - id: fillable_space
    value: 0
    description: Represents positions eligible for replacement by a 'fill_value'.
  - id: fill_value
    value: N (any digit from 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    description: A non-zero, non-marker digit that provides the value for filling adjacent 'fillable_space' digits towards the 'marker'.
relationships:
  - type: position
    description: The index of the 'marker' is crucial.
  - type: adjacency_search
    description: The transformation depends on finding the nearest 'fill_value' to the left and right of the 'marker'.
  - type: intervening_sequence
    description: A sequence of one or more 'fillable_space' digits located between the 'marker' and the nearest 'fill_value' on either side.
actions:
  - name: locate_marker
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    output: index of the 'marker' (digit 2), or indication of absence.
  - name: search_nearest_left_fill
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    input_param: marker_index
    output: index and value of the nearest non-zero digit left of the marker, or indication of none found.
  - name: search_nearest_right_fill
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    input_param: marker_index
    output: index and value of the nearest non-zero digit right of the marker, or indication of none found.
  - name: fill_intervening_zeros
    actor: system
    target: output_sequence (copy of input)
    input_params:
      - marker_index
      - left_fill_index (if found)
      - left_fill_value (if found)
      - right_fill_index (if found)
      - right_fill_value (if found)
    condition: A non-zero fill value exists on a side, and there are 'fillable_space' (0) digits between it and the 'marker'.
    effect: Replace 'fillable_space' (0) digits within the identified intervening sequences with the corresponding 'fill_value'. This happens independently for the left and right sides.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of integers).
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to store the results.
3.  Find the index of the digit `2` (the `marker`) in the input sequence. If the marker `2` is not found, return the original sequence copy unchanged. Let the found index be `marker_index`.
4.  **Left-Side Processing:**
    a.  Initialize `left_fill_value` to `None` and `left_fill_index` to `-1`.
    b.  Iterate backwards from index `marker_index - 1` down to `0`.
    c.  If a non-zero digit is encountered at index `i`, set `left_fill_value` to this digit's value, set `left_fill_index` to `i`, and stop this backward iteration.
    d.  If `left_fill_value` is not `None` (meaning a non-zero digit was found):
        i.  Iterate forwards from index `left_fill_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
        ii. For each index `j` in this range, if the digit in the *result sequence* at index `j` is `0`, update the digit in the *result sequence* at index `j` to `left_fill_value`.
5.  **Right-Side Processing:**
    a.  Initialize `right_fill_value` to `None` and `right_fill_index` to `-1`.
    b.  Iterate forwards from index `marker_index + 1` up to the end of the sequence.
    c.  If a non-zero digit is encountered at index `i`, set `right_fill_value` to this digit's value, set `right_fill_index` to `i`, and stop this forward iteration.
    d.  If `right_fill_value` is not `None` (meaning a non-zero digit was found):
        i.  Iterate forwards from index `marker_index + 1` up to (but not including) `right_fill_index`.
        ii. For each index `j` in this range, if the digit in the *result sequence* at index `j` is `0`, update the digit in the *result sequence* at index `j` to `right_fill_value`.
6.  Return the modified result sequence.
