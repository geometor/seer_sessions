elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - item_type: integer
      - item_range: 0-9
objects:
  - id: marker
    value: 2
    description: A fixed position digit that acts as a boundary. Its own value and position never change.
  - id: fillable_space
    value: 0
    description: Represents positions that can be potentially overwritten.
  - id: fill_value
    value: N (any digit from 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    description: A non-zero, non-marker digit that can expand to replace adjacent 'fillable_space' digits.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The relative positions of 'marker', 'fillable_space', and 'fill_value' determine the transformation.
  - type: spatial_gap
    description: A sequence of one or more 'fillable_space' digits located between a 'marker' and the nearest 'fill_value' on either side.
actions:
  - name: locate_marker
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    description: Find the index of the 'marker' (digit 2).
  - name: locate_nearest_fill_value
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - direction: left_of_marker
      - direction: right_of_marker
    description: Find the index of the nearest non-zero, non-marker digit ('fill_value') to the left and right of the 'marker'.
  - name: fill_gap
    actor: system
    target: sequence (initially a copy of input)
    condition: A 'spatial_gap' exists between the 'marker' and a 'fill_value'.
    effect: Replace all 'fillable_space' (0) digits within the 'spatial_gap' with the corresponding 'fill_value'. This happens independently for the left and right sides of the 'marker'.
