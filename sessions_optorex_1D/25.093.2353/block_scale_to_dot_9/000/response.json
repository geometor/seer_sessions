Other non-zero digits (like `3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` in the examples) act as \"fill\" values.\n3.  **The Role of '2':** The digit `2` seems to function as a fixed boundary or marker within the sequence. Its position does not change.\n4.  **The Role of '0':** The digit `0` represents an empty or fillable space. These are the only digits that get replaced.\n5.  **The Role of Other Non-Zero Digits (N):** These digits seem to expand or \"fill\" adjacent `0`s under certain conditions. The expansion originates from an existing block or instance of the digit `N`.\n6.  **Transformation Mechanism:** The transformation involves identifying sequences of `0`s that lie *between* the digit `2` and the nearest non-zero digit (`N`) on either side (left or right). These intervening `0`s are then replaced by the digit `N`. If `2` is already adjacent to a non-zero digit, or if there are no non-zero digits on one side, no filling occurs on that side.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
