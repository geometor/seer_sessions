            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Data Structure:** The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.\n*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and `2` appear to play special roles. Other non-zero digits (`1`, `3`, `4` in the examples) also act as significant elements.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing sequences of `0`s into other digits. The specific digit used for filling depends on the digits immediately flanking the sequence of `0`s.\n*   **Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged from input to output.\n*   **Boundaries:** Non-zero numbers act as boundaries for sequences of zeros. The transformation specifically targets zeros *between* two non-zero numbers.\n*   **Role of '2':** The digit `2` seems to be a special boundary marker. When a sequence of zeros is bounded by `2` on one side and another non-zero digit `X` on the other, the zeros are filled with `X`. If a sequence of zeros is bounded by two non-`2` digits, or two `2`s, no change occurs (based on the examples).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
