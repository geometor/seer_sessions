objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (0-9).
      - is_zero: Boolean, true if value is 0.
      - is_two: Boolean, true if value is 2.
      - is_boundary: Boolean, true if value is non-zero.
  - name: zero_segment
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only zeros.
    properties:
      - left_boundary: The non-zero element immediately preceding the segment (if any).
      - right_boundary: The non-zero element immediately following the segment (if any).

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices and values of all non-zero elements in the sequence.
  - name: locate_zero_segments_between_boundaries
    description: Find segments of zeros located strictly between two identified non-zero boundaries.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: Replace the zeros in a segment with a specified fill value.
    inputs:
      - segment_indices: The start and end index of the zero segment.
      - fill_value: The integer value to use for filling.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Non-zero elements define the start and end of potential zero segments to be filled.
  - type: conditional_filling
    description: The decision to fill a zero segment and the value used for filling depend on the values of the adjacent non-zero boundaries, with '2' playing a deciding role.

rules:
  - description: A zero segment is filled based on its adjacent non-zero boundaries if one boundary is '2' and the other is not.
    condition: A zero segment exists between index `i` and index `j` (sequence[i] != 0, sequence[j] != 0, sequence[k] == 0 for i < k < j).
    sub_rules:
      - condition: sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] != 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[j].
      - condition: sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] == 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[i].
      - condition: (sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] == 2) or (sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] != 2)
        action: Do not modify the zero segment.
