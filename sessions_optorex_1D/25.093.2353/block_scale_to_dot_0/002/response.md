## Assessment and Strategy

The error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string, but it received a NumPy array instead. This prevented the core transformation logic from being executed and tested.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a standard Python list, as NumPy arrays can be easily converted or iterated over like lists) as its primary input.
2.  **Remove String Processing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` and `format_output` helper functions, as the input is already in a numerical sequence format, and the execution environment likely handles the output formatting.
3.  **Validate Logic:** Since the core logic was never reached, re-verify the previously derived natural language program and YAML facts against the examples, assuming the input is now correctly handled as a list/array of integers. Based on a mental walkthrough (detailed in thought process), the existing logic seems correct and covers all provided training examples.

## Metrics

No computational metrics could be gathered from the previous execution attempt, as the code failed during input processing before the transformation logic could be applied. The failure occurred consistently across all examples due to the fundamental type mismatch.

## YAML Facts

The initial YAML block accurately describes the objects, actions, and rules based on the observed transformation pattern. No changes are needed based on the error analysis, as the error was related to implementation details (input type) rather than the core logic.


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int] # Or numpy.ndarray
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.

    type: int
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (0-9).
      - is_zero: Boolean, true if value is 0.
      - is_two: Boolean, true if value is 2.
      - is_boundary: Boolean, true if value is non-zero.
  - name: zero_segment
    type: List[int] # Represents a slice/view of the main sequence
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only zeros located between two non-zero elements.
    properties:
      - left_boundary_value: The value of the non-zero element immediately preceding the segment.
      - left_boundary_index: The index of the non-zero element immediately preceding the segment.
      - right_boundary_value: The value of the non-zero element immediately following the segment.
      - right_boundary_index: The index of the non-zero element immediately following the segment.

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices and values of all non-zero elements in the sequence.
  - name: locate_zero_segments_between_boundaries
    description: Identify segments composed entirely of zeros located strictly between two consecutive non-zero boundaries found in the previous step.
  - name: fill_segment_conditionally
    description: Replace the zeros in an identified segment based on the values of its boundaries.
    inputs:
      - segment_indices: The start (exclusive) and end (exclusive) index of the zero segment.
      - left_boundary_value: The value of the left boundary.
      - right_boundary_value: The value of the right boundary.
    outputs:
      - Modified sequence segment.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Non-zero elements define the start and end of potential zero segments to be filled.
  - type: conditional_filling
    description: The decision to fill a zero segment and the value used for filling depend specifically on whether exactly one of the adjacent non-zero boundaries is the digit '2'.

rules:
  - description: A zero segment situated between two non-zero numbers (`left_val` at index `i`, `right_val` at index `j`) is filled if exactly one of the boundary values is '2'.
    condition: A segment of the sequence from index `i+1` to `j-1` consists entirely of zeros.
    sub_rules:
      - condition: `left_val` == 2 and `right_val` != 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices `i+1` to `j-1`) with `right_val`.
      - condition: `left_val` != 2 and `right_val` == 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices `i+1` to `j-1`) with `left_val`.
      - condition: (`left_val` == 2 and `right_val` == 2) or (`left_val` != 2 and `right_val` != 2)
        action: Do not modify the zero segment.
  - description: Zeros not located strictly between two non-zero numbers (e.g., leading zeros, trailing zeros, zeros adjacent to only one non-zero number) are never modified.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the working output sequence.
3.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the original input sequence.
4.  Iterate through each consecutive pair of these non-zero indices. Let the first index be `i` and the second index be `j`.
5.  For each pair (`i`, `j`):
    a.  Check if there is a gap between them (i.e., `j > i + 1`).
    b.  If there is a gap, check if all elements in the original input sequence strictly between `i` and `j` (from index `i + 1` to `j - 1`) are zeros.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are met, retrieve the values at the boundaries: `left_val = input_sequence[i]` and `right_val = input_sequence[j]`.
    d.  Determine the fill value based on the boundary values:
        i.  If `left_val` is 2 and `right_val` is *not* 2, the fill value is `right_val`.
        ii. If `left_val` is *not* 2 and `right_val` is 2, the fill value is `left_val`.
        iii. Otherwise (if both are 2, or neither is 2), there is no fill value, and this segment is skipped.
    e.  If a fill value was determined in step (d), modify the working output sequence by setting all elements from index `i + 1` to `j - 1` to this fill value.
6.  After iterating through all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, return the modified working output sequence.
