            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string, but it received a NumPy array instead. This prevented the core transformation logic from being executed and tested.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a standard Python list, as NumPy arrays can be easily converted or iterated over like lists) as its primary input.\n2.  **Remove String Processing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` and `format_output` helper functions, as the input is already in a numerical sequence format, and the execution environment likely handles the output formatting.\n3.  **Validate Logic:** Since the core logic was never reached, re-verify the previously derived natural language program and YAML facts against the examples, assuming the input is now correctly handled as a list/array of integers. Based on a mental walkthrough (detailed in thought process), the existing logic seems correct and covers all provided training examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo computational metrics could be gathered from the previous execution attempt, as the code failed during input processing before the transformation logic could be applied. The failure occurred consistently across all examples due to the fundamental type mismatch.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\nThe initial YAML block accurately describes the objects, actions, and rules based on the observed transformation pattern. No changes are needed based on the error analysis, as the error was related to implementation details (input type) rather than the core logic.\n\n"
