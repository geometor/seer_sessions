Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Data Structure:** The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and `2` appear to play special roles. Other non-zero digits (`1`, `3`, `4` in the examples) also act as significant elements.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing sequences of `0`s into other digits. The specific digit used for filling depends on the digits immediately flanking the sequence of `0`s.
*   **Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged from input to output.
*   **Boundaries:** Non-zero numbers act as boundaries for sequences of zeros. The transformation specifically targets zeros *between* two non-zero numbers.
*   **Role of '2':** The digit `2` seems to be a special boundary marker. When a sequence of zeros is bounded by `2` on one side and another non-zero digit `X` on the other, the zeros are filled with `X`. If a sequence of zeros is bounded by two non-`2` digits, or two `2`s, no change occurs (based on the examples).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (0-9).
      - is_zero: Boolean, true if value is 0.
      - is_two: Boolean, true if value is 2.
      - is_boundary: Boolean, true if value is non-zero.
  - name: zero_segment
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only zeros.
    properties:
      - left_boundary: The non-zero element immediately preceding the segment (if any).
      - right_boundary: The non-zero element immediately following the segment (if any).

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices and values of all non-zero elements in the sequence.
  - name: locate_zero_segments_between_boundaries
    description: Find segments of zeros located strictly between two identified non-zero boundaries.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: Replace the zeros in a segment with a specified fill value.
    inputs:
      - segment_indices: The start and end index of the zero segment.
      - fill_value: The integer value to use for filling.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Non-zero elements define the start and end of potential zero segments to be filled.
  - type: conditional_filling
    description: The decision to fill a zero segment and the value used for filling depend on the values of the adjacent non-zero boundaries, with '2' playing a deciding role.

rules:
  - description: A zero segment is filled based on its adjacent non-zero boundaries if one boundary is '2' and the other is not.
    condition: A zero segment exists between index `i` and index `j` (sequence[i] != 0, sequence[j] != 0, sequence[k] == 0 for i < k < j).
    sub_rules:
      - condition: sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] != 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[j].
      - condition: sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] == 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[i].
      - condition: (sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] == 2) or (sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] != 2)
        action: Do not modify the zero segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to store the result.
3.  Find the indices of all non-zero digits in the sequence.
4.  Iterate through each consecutive pair of these non-zero indices, calling the left index `i` and the right index `j`.
5.  For each pair (`i`, `j`):
    a.  Check if the distance between `i` and `j` is greater than 1 (i.e., `j > i + 1`).
    b.  If it is, check if all the digits in the original sequence *between* index `i` and index `j` (from `i+1` to `j-1`) are zeros.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, examine the values at the boundaries: `left_val = sequence[i]` and `right_val = sequence[j]`.
    d.  If `left_val` is `2` and `right_val` is *not* `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `right_val`.
    e.  If `left_val` is *not* `2` and `right_val` is `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `left_val`.
    f.  Otherwise (if both are `2` or neither is `2`), make no changes to this segment of zeros.
6.  After checking all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, the result sequence contains the final output. Return the result sequence.

"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rule:
1. Identify all non-zero digits and their positions in the sequence.
2. Examine each contiguous segment of zeros that is located strictly *between* two non-zero digits.
3. Let the non-zero digit to the left of the zero segment be 'left_val' at index 'i', and the non-zero digit to the right be 'right_val' at index 'j'.
4. If 'left_val' is 2 and 'right_val' is *not* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with 'right_val'.
5. If 'left_val' is *not* 2 and 'right_val' is 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with 'left_val'.
6. In all other cases (both are 2, neither is 2, or the segment is not composed entirely of zeros), the segment remains unchanged.
7. Zeros at the beginning or end of the sequence, or adjacent to only one non-zero number, are not modified.
