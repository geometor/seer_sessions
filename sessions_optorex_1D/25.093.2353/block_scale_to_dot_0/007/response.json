Identify all non-zero digits and their positions (indices) in the sequence.\n2. Examine each contiguous segment composed entirely of zeros that is located strictly *between* two non-zero digits found in step 1.\n3. Let the non-zero digit to the left of such a zero segment be 'L' (at index 'i'), and the non-zero digit to the right be 'R' (at index 'j').\n4. Apply the filling rule:\n   - If 'L' is 2 AND 'R' is *not* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'R'.\n   - If 'L' is *not* 2 AND 'R' *is* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'L'.\n   - In all other cases for the boundaries (both are 2, or neither is 2), the zero segment remains unchanged.\n5. Zero segments not strictly between two non-zero numbers (e.g., at the start/end of the sequence, or adjacent to only one non-zero number) are not modified.\n6. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_zero_indices(grid: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the indices of all non-zero elements in the grid.\"\"\"\n    return [i for i, x in enumerate(grid) if x != 0]\n\ndef transform(input_grid) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a list for easier manipulation and copying\n    input_list = list(input_grid) \n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a mutable copy of the input\n    # Changes will be made to this grid, preserving the original input_list for checks\n    output_grid = list(input_list)\n    n = len(input_list)\n\n    # Step 1: Identify all non-zero elements and their indices (boundaries)\n    non_zero_indices = find_non_zero_indices(input_list)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Iterate through consecutive pairs of non-zero indices to find potential segments\n    # We need at least two non-zero numbers to define a segment *between* them.\n    for idx in range(len(non_zero_indices) - 1):\n        i = non_zero_indices[idx]      # Index of the left boundary\n        j = non_zero_indices[idx + 1]  # Index of the right boundary\n\n        # Step 4a: Check if there is a gap (one or more elements) between the boundaries\n        if j > i + 1:\n            # Step 4b: Extract the segment between the boundaries from the *original* input\n            segment = input_list[i + 1 : j]\n            \n            # Step 4c: Check if this segment consists *only* of zeros\n            is_zero_segment = all(x == 0 for x in segment)\n\n            if is_zero_segment:\n                # Step 4d: Get the values of the boundary elements\n                left_val = input_list[i]\n                right_val = input_list[j]\n\n                # Step 4e: Determine the fill value based on the specific conditional logic involving '2'\n                fill_value = None # Use None to indicate no fill needed by default\n                if left_val == 2 and right_val != 2:\n                    # Fill with the right value if left is 2 and right is not 2\n                    fill_value = right_val\n                elif left_val != 2 and right_val == 2:\n                    # Fill with the left value if left is not 2 and right is 2\n                    fill_value = left_val\n                \n                # Step 4f: If a fill condition was met (fill_value is not None), update the output grid\n                if fill_value is not None:\n                    for k in range(i + 1, j):\n                        output_grid[k] = fill_value\n                # Otherwise (both 2, neither 2, or fill_value is None), the segment remains zeros \n                # as initialized in output_grid (copied from input_list)\n\n    # Step 5: Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
