Identify all non-zero digits and their positions (indices) in the sequence.\n2. Examine each contiguous segment composed entirely of zeros that is located strictly *between* two non-zero digits found in step 1.\n3. Let the non-zero digit to the left of such a zero segment be 'L' (at index 'i'), and the non-zero digit to the right be 'R' (at index 'j').\n4. Apply the filling rule:\n   - If 'L' is *not* 2 AND 'R' *is* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'L'.\n   - If 'L' *is* 2 AND 'R' is *not* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'R'.\n   - In all other cases for the boundaries (both are 2, or neither is 2), the zero segment remains unchanged.\n5. Zero segments not strictly between two non-zero numbers (e.g., at the start/end of the sequence, or adjacent to only one non-zero number) are not modified.\n6. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_zero_indices(grid: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the indices of all non-zero elements in the grid.\"\"\"\n    return [i for i, x in enumerate(grid) if x != 0]\n\ndef transform(input_grid) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a list for easier manipulation and copying\n    input_list = list(input_grid) \n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a mutable copy of the input\n    output_grid = list(input_list)\n    n = len(input_list)\n\n    # Find the indices of all non-zero elements.
