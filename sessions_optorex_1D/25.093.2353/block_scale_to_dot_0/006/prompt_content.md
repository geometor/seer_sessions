"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of single-digit integers based on the following rule:
1. Identify all non-zero digits and their positions (indices) in the sequence.
2. Examine each contiguous segment composed entirely of zeros that is located strictly *between* two non-zero digits found in step 1.
3. Let the non-zero digit to the left of such a zero segment be 'L' (at index 'i'), and the non-zero digit to the right be 'R' (at index 'j').
4. Apply the filling rule:
   - If 'L' is *not* 2 AND 'R' *is* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'L'.
   - If 'L' *is* 2 AND 'R' is *not* 2, fill the zero segment (elements from index i+1 to j-1) with the value of 'R'.
   - In all other cases for the boundaries (both are 2, or neither is 2), the zero segment remains unchanged.
5. Zero segments not strictly between two non-zero numbers (e.g., at the start/end of the sequence, or adjacent to only one non-zero number) are not modified.
6. The length of the sequence remains constant.
