data_structure:
  type: sequence
  format: List[int]
  description: A 1-dimensional sequence (list) of single-digit integers.
  length_constraint: Input and output sequences have the same length.

elements:
  - name: zero
    value: 0
    role: Represents empty space that can potentially be filled.
  - name: two
    value: 2
    role: Special boundary marker affecting fill logic.
  - name: other_non_zero
    value: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    role: Standard boundary markers.

objects:
  - name: non_zero_boundary
    type: Element
    description: A non-zero element in the sequence.
    properties:
      - index: Position in the sequence.
      - value: The integer value (1-9).
      - is_special: Boolean, true if value is 2.
  - name: zero_segment
    type: Sub-sequence (List[int])
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only zeros located strictly between two non_zero_boundary elements.
    properties:
      - start_index: Index immediately after the left boundary.
      - end_index: Index immediately before the right boundary.
      - left_boundary: The non_zero_boundary element immediately to the left.
      - right_boundary: The non_zero_boundary element immediately to the right.

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices and values of all non-zero elements.
  - name: identify_zero_segments
    description: Iterate through consecutive pairs of non-zero boundaries and check if the elements strictly between them are all zeros.
  - name: conditional_fill
    description: Fill an identified zero_segment based on the values of its left and right boundaries.
    condition: The segment must be a zero_segment (all zeros between two non-zeros).
    rule:
      - if left_boundary.is_special is true AND right_boundary.is_special is false:
          fill_value = right_boundary.value
      - else if left_boundary.is_special is false AND right_boundary.is_special is true:
          fill_value = left_boundary.value
      - else:
          no fill occurs (segment remains zeros).
    effect: Modifies the output sequence by replacing zeros in the segment with the determined fill_value.

process_constraints:
  - Only zero_segments strictly between two non_zero_boundaries are considered for filling.
  - Zeros at the start or end of the sequence are never filled.
  - Zeros adjacent to only one non-zero number are never filled.
  - If a segment between non-zero boundaries contains non-zero elements, it is not modified.
