Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Data Structure:** The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and `2` appear to play special roles. Other non-zero digits (`1`, `3`, `4` in the examples) also act as significant elements.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing sequences of `0`s into other digits. The specific digit used for filling depends on the digits immediately flanking the sequence of `0`s.
*   **Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged from input to output.
*   **Boundaries:** Non-zero numbers act as boundaries for sequences of zeros. The transformation specifically targets zeros *between* two non-zero numbers.
*   **Role of '2':** The digit `2` seems to be a special boundary marker. When a sequence of zeros is bounded by `2` on one side and another non-zero digit `X` on the other, the zeros are filled with `X`. If a sequence of zeros is bounded by two non-`2` digits, or two `2`s, no change occurs (based on the examples).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (0-9).
      - is_zero: Boolean, true if value is 0.
      - is_two: Boolean, true if value is 2.
      - is_boundary: Boolean, true if value is non-zero.
  - name: zero_segment
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only zeros.
    properties:
      - left_boundary: The non-zero element immediately preceding the segment (if any).
      - right_boundary: The non-zero element immediately following the segment (if any).

actions:
  - name: identify_boundaries
    description: Find the indices and values of all non-zero elements in the sequence.
  - name: locate_zero_segments_between_boundaries
    description: Find segments of zeros located strictly between two identified non-zero boundaries.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: Replace the zeros in a segment with a specified fill value.
    inputs:
      - segment_indices: The start and end index of the zero segment.
      - fill_value: The integer value to use for filling.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Non-zero elements define the start and end of potential zero segments to be filled.
  - type: conditional_filling
    description: The decision to fill a zero segment and the value used for filling depend on the values of the adjacent non-zero boundaries, with '2' playing a deciding role.

rules:
  - description: A zero segment is filled based on its adjacent non-zero boundaries if one boundary is '2' and the other is not.
    condition: A zero segment exists between index `i` and index `j` (sequence[i] != 0, sequence[j] != 0, sequence[k] == 0 for i < k < j).
    sub_rules:
      - condition: sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] != 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[j].
      - condition: sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] == 2
        action: Fill the zero segment (indices i+1 to j-1) with sequence[i].
      - condition: (sequence[i] == 2 and sequence[j] == 2) or (sequence[i] != 2 and sequence[j] != 2)
        action: Do not modify the zero segment.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to store the result.
3.  Find the indices of all non-zero digits in the sequence.
4.  Iterate through each consecutive pair of these non-zero indices, calling the left index `i` and the right index `j`.
5.  For each pair (`i`, `j`):
    a.  Check if the distance between `i` and `j` is greater than 1 (i.e., `j > i + 1`).
    b.  If it is, check if all the digits in the original sequence *between* index `i` and index `j` (from `i+1` to `j-1`) are zeros.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, examine the values at the boundaries: `left_val = sequence[i]` and `right_val = sequence[j]`.
    d.  If `left_val` is `2` and `right_val` is *not* `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `right_val`.
    e.  If `left_val` is *not* `2` and `right_val` is `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `left_val`.
    f.  Otherwise (if both are `2` or neither is `2`), make no changes to this segment of zeros.
6.  After checking all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, the result sequence contains the final output. Return the result sequence.
