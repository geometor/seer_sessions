Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Data Structure:** The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and `2` appear to play special roles. Other non-zero digits (`1`, `3`, `4` in the examples) also act as significant elements.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing sequences of `0`s into other digits. The specific digit used for filling depends on the digits immediately flanking the sequence of `0`s.
*   **Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged from input to output.
*   **Boundaries:** Non-zero numbers act as boundaries for sequences of zeros. The transformation specifically targets zeros *between* two non-zero numbers.
*   **Role of '2':** The digit `2` seems to be a special boundary marker. When a sequence of zeros is bounded by `2` on one side and another non-zero digit `X` on the other, the zeros are filled with `X`. If a sequence of zeros is bounded by two non-`2` digits, or two `2`s, no change occurs (based on the examples).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to store the result.
3.  Find the indices of all non-zero digits in the sequence.
4.  Iterate through each consecutive pair of these non-zero indices, calling the left index `i` and the right index `j`.
5.  For each pair (`i`, `j`):
    a.  Check if the distance between `i` and `j` is greater than 1 (i.e., `j > i + 1`).
    b.  If it is, check if all the digits in the original sequence *between* index `i` and index `j` (from `i+1` to `j-1`) are zeros.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, examine the values at the boundaries: `left_val = sequence[i]` and `right_val = sequence[j]`.
    d.  If `left_val` is `2` and `right_val` is *not* `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `right_val`.
    e.  If `left_val` is *not* `2` and `right_val` is `2`, then in the result sequence, change all digits from index `i+1` to `j-1` to the value of `left_val`.
    f.  Otherwise (if both are `2` or neither is `2`), make no changes to this segment of zeros.
6.  After checking all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, the result sequence contains the final output. Return the result sequence.

## Assessment and Strategy

The error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string, but it received a NumPy array instead. This prevented the core transformation logic from being executed and tested.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a standard Python list, as NumPy arrays can be easily converted or iterated over like lists) as its primary input.
2.  **Remove String Processing:** Eliminate the `parse_input` and `format_output` helper functions, as the input is already in a numerical sequence format, and the execution environment likely handles the output formatting.
3.  **Validate Logic:** Since the core logic was never reached, re-verify the previously derived natural language program and YAML facts against the examples, assuming the input is now correctly handled as a list/array of integers. Based on a mental walkthrough (detailed in thought process), the existing logic seems correct and covers all provided training examples.

## Metrics

No computational metrics could be gathered from the previous execution attempt, as the code failed during input processing before the transformation logic could be applied. The failure occurred consistently across all examples due to the fundamental type mismatch.

## YAML Facts

The initial YAML block accurately describes the objects, actions, and rules based on the observed transformation pattern. No changes are needed based on the error analysis, as the error was related to implementation details (input type) rather than the core logic.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the working output sequence.
3.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the original input sequence.
4.  Iterate through each consecutive pair of these non-zero indices. Let the first index be `i` and the second index be `j`.
5.  For each pair (`i`, `j`):
    a.  Check if there is a gap between them (i.e., `j > i + 1`).
    b.  If there is a gap, check if all elements in the original input sequence strictly between `i` and `j` (from index `i + 1` to `j - 1`) are zeros.
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are met, retrieve the values at the boundaries: `left_val = input_sequence[i]` and `right_val = input_sequence[j]`.
    d.  Determine the fill value based on the boundary values:
        i.  If `left_val` is 2 and `right_val` is *not* 2, the fill value is `right_val`.
        ii. If `left_val` is *not* 2 and `right_val` is 2, the fill value is `left_val`.
        iii. Otherwise (if both are 2, or neither is 2), there is no fill value, and this segment is skipped.
    e.  If a fill value was determined in step (d), modify the working output sequence by setting all elements from index `i + 1` to `j - 1` to this fill value.
6.  After iterating through all consecutive pairs of non-zero indices, return the modified working output sequence.
