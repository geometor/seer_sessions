            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The rule involves finding segments of zeros situated strictly between two non-zero numbers and filling them based on a specific condition involving the digit `2`. If a zero segment is bounded by `X` and `2`, it gets filled with `X`. If it's bounded by `2` and `Y`, it gets filled with `Y`. If bounded by two `2`s or two non-`2`s, it remains unchanged. Zeros not strictly between two non-zero numbers (e.g., at the ends or adjacent to only one non-zero number) are also unchanged.\n\nThe errors reported (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...`) strongly suggest an issue with how the previous code interacted with the data type provided by the testing environment, likely NumPy arrays instead of standard Python lists. Although the previous code attempted conversion to a list (`input_list = list(input_grid)`), the error implies a boolean operation was still attempted on an array somewhere. This could potentially occur if the list conversion failed or if the error originated in a part of the code relying on NumPy array properties, possibly the list comprehension used for finding non-zero indices if it implicitly handled the input as an array before the explicit conversion.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Logic:** The logic derived from the examples and confirmed via the metric gathering code seems robust and correct.\n2.  **Address Data Type:** The primary focus for the coder phase will be to ensure the implementation correctly handles the input data type, whether it's explicitly converting to lists or using NumPy-aware functions (like `np.nonzero`, `np.all`) if NumPy arrays are the expected norm. The natural language program should remain focused on the logic, assuming the implementation details handle type correctly.\n3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Ensure the YAML facts and natural language program are precise, especially regarding the boundary conditions and the role of the digit `2`.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution analyzed each training example and several synthetic test cases, confirming the following:\n\n*   **Input/Output:** All examples involve 1D sequences of integers. Length remains constant.\n*   **Boundaries:** Non-zero elements act as boundaries.\n*   **Zero Segments:** Only segments consisting *entirely* of zeros *between* two non-zero boundaries are considered for filling.\n*   **Filling Rule:**\n    *   `X ...zeros... 2` -> `X ...X's... 2` (Fill with Left, non-2 value)\n    *   `2 ...zeros... Y` -> `2 ...Y's... Y` (Fill with Right, non-2 value)\n    *   `X ...zeros... Y` (where X!=2, Y!=2) -> No change\n    *   `2 ...zeros... 2` -> No change\n*   **Edge Cases:** Leading/trailing zeros, or zero segments not fully enclosed by non-zeros, are unaffected. Sequences without internal zero segments are unaffected.\n\nThe analysis code successfully predicted the fill action (`fill_with_left`, `fill_with_right`, or `none`) and the `fill_value` for all tested cases, matching the observed input/output transformations.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
