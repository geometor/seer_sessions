objects:
  - sequence: A list or array of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: The integer 2, acting as a reference point.
  - fillable_space: The integer 0, representing cells that can potentially be filled.
  - source_digit: An integer X, where X is not 0 and X is not 2. This digit provides the value for filling.

properties:
  - sequence: has ordered elements with indices.
  - boundary_marker: has a specific index (`idx_2`) within the sequence. Can occur at most once (based on examples).
  - fillable_space: Defined by the value 0.
  - source_digit: Defined by values other than 0 and 2.

actions:
  - find_boundary: Locate the index `idx_2` of the `boundary_marker` (2).
  - check_adjacency: Examine the element immediately to the left (`idx_2 - 1`) and right (`idx_2 + 1`) of the `boundary_marker`.
  - scan_outwards_left: If the left adjacent cell is `fillable_space` (0), search leftwards starting from `idx_2 - 2` to find the first `source_digit`.
  - scan_outwards_right: If the right adjacent cell is `fillable_space` (0), search rightwards starting from `idx_2 + 2` to find the first `source_digit`.
  - fill_region_left: If a `source_digit` is found to the left (at `idx_left`), replace all elements from `idx_left + 1` up to `idx_2 - 1` (inclusive) with the `source_digit` value.
  - fill_region_right: If a `source_digit` is found to the right (at `idx_right`), replace all elements from `idx_2 + 1` up to `idx_right - 1` (inclusive) with the `source_digit` value.

relationships:
  - Filling occurs *only* if the cell immediately adjacent (left or right) to the `boundary_marker` (2) is a `fillable_space` (0).
  - The value used for filling (`source_digit`) is determined by the *first* non-zero, non-`boundary_marker` digit encountered when scanning outwards from the `boundary_marker` *past* the adjacent `fillable_space`.
  - The fill operation replaces *all* cells between the identified `source_digit` and the `boundary_marker`.
  - Left and right side filling operations are independent.
