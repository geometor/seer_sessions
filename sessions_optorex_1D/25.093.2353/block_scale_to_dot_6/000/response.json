            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, presented as space-separated strings. They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.\n2.  **Key Digit '2':** The digit '2' appears to play a special role. It acts as a boundary or a reference point for the transformation.\n3.  **Key Digit '0':** The digit '0' represents empty or fillable space.\n4.  **Other Digits (X):** Digits other than '0' and '2' (e.g., 3, 7, 6, 4, 8) seem to be \"source\" values that can propagate.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling sequences of '0's that are located *between* a non-zero digit `X` (where `X` is not '2') and the digit '2'. The '0's are replaced by the digit `X`.\n6.  **Directionality:** The filling action propagates *towards* the '2'.\n    *   If the sequence is `... X ... 0 0 0 ... 2 ...`, the '0's are filled with `X` moving rightwards towards '2'. (See train_3, train_6, train_7)\n    *   If the sequence is `... 2 ... 0 0 0 ... X ...`, the '0's are filled with `X` moving leftwards towards '2'. (See train_2, train_5)\n7.  **No Change Cases:** If there are no zeros between a non-zero digit `X` and the '2', or if the region next to '2' only contains zeros extending to the sequence boundary, no change occurs in that direction. (See train_1, train_4)\n8.  **Implicit Assumption:** Based on the examples, there appears to be at most one '2' in any given sequence.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
