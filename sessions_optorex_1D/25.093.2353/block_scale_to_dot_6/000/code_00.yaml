objects:
  - sequence: a list of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: the integer 2.
  - fillable_space: the integer 0.
  - source_digit: any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.

properties:
  - sequence: has indices and elements.
  - boundary_marker: has a specific index within the sequence.
  - fillable_space: can be replaced by a source_digit.
  - source_digit: determines the value used for filling.

actions:
  - find_boundary: locate the index of the boundary_marker (2).
  - scan_left: search elements to the left of the boundary_marker.
  - scan_right: search elements to the right of the boundary_marker.
  - identify_fill_region: detect consecutive fillable_spaces (0s) adjacent to the boundary_marker.
  - identify_source: find the first source_digit encountered when scanning away from the boundary_marker past a fill_region.
  - fill_region: replace the fillable_spaces (0s) in the identified region with the identified source_digit.

relationships:
  - fillable_space (0) occurs between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - filling happens *towards* the boundary_marker (2).
  - source_digit (X) must be the first non-zero digit encountered when moving away from the boundary_marker (2) across a block of zeros.
