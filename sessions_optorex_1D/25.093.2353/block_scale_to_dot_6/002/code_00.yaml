objects:
  - sequence: A list or array of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: The integer 2.
  - fillable_space: The integer 0.
  - source_digit: Any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.

properties:
  - sequence: Has indices and elements. Can be modified.
  - boundary_marker: Has a specific index within the sequence.
  - fillable_space: Can be replaced by a source_digit under specific conditions.
  - source_digit: Determines the value used for filling. Resides at a specific index.

actions:
  - find_boundary: Locate the index of the boundary_marker (2) in the sequence.
  - scan_left: Iterate backwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - scan_right: Iterate forwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - check_intermediate_zeros: Verify if all elements between a found source_digit and the boundary_marker are fillable_spaces (0s).
  - fill_region_left: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the left side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the left source_digit and the boundary_marker with the left source_digit's value.
  - fill_region_right: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the right side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the boundary_marker and the right source_digit with the right source_digit's value.

relationships:
  - Filling occurs only if a contiguous block of fillable_spaces (0s) exists directly between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - Filling propagates *towards* the boundary_marker (2) from the source_digit (X).
  - Operations on the left and right sides of the boundary_marker are independent.
  - If the boundary_marker (2) is not found, the sequence remains unchanged.
  - If no source_digit is found on a side, or if the intermediate region contains non-zero digits, no filling occurs on that side.
