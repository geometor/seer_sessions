The testing environment appears to pass the input data as a NumPy array directly, rather than the space-separated string format presented in the problem description.\n\nThe core transformation logic, as described in the previous natural language program (finding '2', scanning left/right for source digits, and filling intervening '0's), appears sound when mentally traced through the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input/Output Handling:** Modify the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input and return a list or NumPy array as output. Remove the string parsing (`_parse_input`) and formatting (`_format_output`) steps.\n2.  **Validate Logic:** Re-confirm the filling logic (scan outwards from '2', find first non-zero/non-2 digit, check if intermediate elements are all '0', fill towards '2').\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the list/array-based processing.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the training examples to confirm patterns.\n\n"
