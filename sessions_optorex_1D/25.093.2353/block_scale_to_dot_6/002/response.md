**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (designed for a string) and the actual data type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The testing environment appears to pass the input data as a NumPy array directly, rather than the space-separated string format presented in the problem description.

The core transformation logic, as described in the previous natural language program (finding '2', scanning left/right for source digits, and filling intervening '0's), appears sound when mentally traced through the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adapt Input/Output Handling:** Modify the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input and return a list or NumPy array as output. Remove the string parsing (`_parse_input`) and formatting (`_format_output`) steps.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Re-confirm the filling logic (scan outwards from '2', find first non-zero/non-2 digit, check if intermediate elements are all '0', fill towards '2').
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the list/array-based processing.

**Metrics Gathering**

**Metrics Summary:**

*   All input sequences have a length of 12.
*   The digit '2' acts as a boundary.
*   The logic identifies potential 'source' digits (non-zero, non-2) to the left and right of '2'.
*   It correctly identifies whether the segment between the source digit and '2' consists solely of '0's.
*   The 'Can Fill' flags accurately predict whether a fill operation should occur based on the examples. Note: The indices reported for the fill region are inclusive start and end; when `start > end` (e.g., Examples 1 and 4), it signifies no actual elements exist strictly *between* the source and '2', hence no fill occurs, which aligns with the observed outputs.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: A list or array of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: The integer 2.
  - fillable_space: The integer 0.
  - source_digit: Any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.

properties:
  - sequence: Has indices and elements. Can be modified.
  - boundary_marker: Has a specific index within the sequence.
  - fillable_space: Can be replaced by a source_digit under specific conditions.
  - source_digit: Determines the value used for filling. Resides at a specific index.

actions:
  - find_boundary: Locate the index of the boundary_marker (2) in the sequence.
  - scan_left: Iterate backwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - scan_right: Iterate forwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - check_intermediate_zeros: Verify if all elements between a found source_digit and the boundary_marker are fillable_spaces (0s).
  - fill_region_left: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the left side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the left source_digit and the boundary_marker with the left source_digit's value.
  - fill_region_right: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the right side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the boundary_marker and the right source_digit with the right source_digit's value.

relationships:
  - Filling occurs only if a contiguous block of fillable_spaces (0s) exists directly between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - Filling propagates *towards* the boundary_marker (2) from the source_digit (X).
  - Operations on the left and right sides of the boundary_marker are independent.
  - If the boundary_marker (2) is not found, the sequence remains unchanged.
  - If no source_digit is found on a side, or if the intermediate region contains non-zero digits, no filling occurs on that side.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (as a list or array of integers).
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
3.  Attempt to find the index of the boundary marker '2' in the sequence. Let this be `idx_2`.
4.  If '2' is not found in the sequence, return the original (copied) sequence without modification.
5.  **Process Left Side:**
    a.  Initialize `left_source_idx` to -1.
    b.  Iterate backwards from `idx_2 - 1` down to 0.
    c.  If an element is encountered that is not '0' and not '2', record its index as `left_source_idx` and its value as `left_source_value`, then stop this backward iteration.
    d.  If `left_source_idx` is not -1 (meaning a source digit was found):
        i.  Check if all elements in the sequence slice from index `left_source_idx + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_2` are equal to '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', then iterate from `i = left_source_idx + 1` up to `idx_2 - 1` and set the element at index `i` in the copied sequence to `left_source_value`.
6.  **Process Right Side:**
    a.  Initialize `right_source_idx` to -1.
    b.  Iterate forwards from `idx_2 + 1` up to the end of the sequence.
    c.  If an element is encountered that is not '0' and not '2', record its index as `right_source_idx` and its value as `right_source_value`, then stop this forward iteration.
    d.  If `right_source_idx` is not -1 (meaning a source digit was found):
        i.  Check if all elements in the sequence slice from index `idx_2 + 1` up to (but not including) `right_source_idx` are equal to '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', then iterate from `i = idx_2 + 1` up to `right_source_idx - 1` and set the element at index `i` in the copied sequence to `right_source_value`.
7.  Return the modified sequence copy.
