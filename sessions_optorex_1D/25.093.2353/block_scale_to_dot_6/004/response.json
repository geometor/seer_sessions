            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the role of '2' as a boundary marker and the general concept of filling '0's with adjacent non-zero digits. However, it failed on several examples (2, 3, 5, 6, 7). The analysis reveals the original condition for filling was slightly incorrect.\n\nThe errors consistently occurred when a sequence of '0's existed between a non-zero/non-2 digit (`X`) and the '2'. The initial code checked if *all* positions between the *first found* `X` (scanning away from '2') and '2' were '0's. The expected outputs suggest a simpler condition: the filling should occur *if and only if* the position immediately adjacent to '2' (in the direction being considered) is a '0'. If this condition holds, we find the nearest non-zero digit (`X`) in that direction (moving away from '2'), and if `X` is not '2', we fill *all* the '0's between `X` and '2' with `X`.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Update the YAML facts to better reflect the roles of adjacent zeros and the nearest source digit.\n2.  Refine the Natural Language Program to incorporate the check on the element immediately adjacent to '2' as the trigger for finding a source digit and performing the fill operation.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Example | Input                     | Expected Output           | Actual Output             | Match | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                   |\n| :------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :---- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | `... 3 3 3 3 2 0 0 0`     | `... 3 3 3 3 2 0 0 0`     | `... 3 3 3 3 2 0 0 0`     | True  | 0          | Correct.
