**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the role of '2' as a boundary marker and the general concept of filling '0's with adjacent non-zero digits. However, it failed on several examples (2, 3, 5, 6, 7). The analysis reveals the original condition for filling was slightly incorrect.

The errors consistently occurred when a sequence of '0's existed between a non-zero/non-2 digit (`X`) and the '2'. The initial code checked if *all* positions between the *first found* `X` (scanning away from '2') and '2' were '0's. The expected outputs suggest a simpler condition: the filling should occur *if and only if* the position immediately adjacent to '2' (in the direction being considered) is a '0'. If this condition holds, we find the nearest non-zero digit (`X`) in that direction (moving away from '2'), and if `X` is not '2', we fill *all* the '0's between `X` and '2' with `X`.

The strategy is to:
1.  Update the YAML facts to better reflect the roles of adjacent zeros and the nearest source digit.
2.  Refine the Natural Language Program to incorporate the check on the element immediately adjacent to '2' as the trigger for finding a source digit and performing the fill operation.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: The integer 2.
  - fillable_space: The integer 0.
  - source_digit: Any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.
  - fill_region: A contiguous subsequence of fillable_spaces (0s) located between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).

properties:
  - sequence: Has indexed elements.
  - boundary_marker: Has a unique index (`idx_2`) within the sequence (assumption based on examples).
  - fillable_space: Can be replaced by a source_digit. Located adjacent to the boundary_marker to trigger a potential fill.
  - source_digit: Determines the value used for filling. Must be the nearest non-0 digit when scanning away from the boundary_marker past a triggering fillable_space.

actions:
  - find_boundary_index: Locate the index (`idx_2`) of the boundary_marker (2).
  - check_adjacency: Examine the elements immediately to the left (`idx_2 - 1`) and right (`idx_2 + 1`) of the boundary_marker.
  - find_nearest_source_left: If the element at `idx_2 - 1` is 0, scan leftwards from `idx_2 - 2` to find the first non-0 digit (`X_left` at `idx_left`).
  - find_nearest_source_right: If the element at `idx_2 + 1` is 0, scan rightwards from `idx_2 + 2` to find the first non-0 digit (`X_right` at `idx_right`).
  - fill_left: If `X_left` is found and is not 2, replace all elements from `idx_left + 1` to `idx_2 - 1` with `X_left`.
  - fill_right: If `X_right` is found and is not 2, replace all elements from `idx_2 + 1` to `idx_right - 1` with `X_right`.

relationships:
  - A fill operation is triggered *only* if a fillable_space (0) is directly adjacent to the boundary_marker (2).
  - The source_digit (X) used for filling must be the *nearest* non-0 digit found when scanning *away* from the boundary_marker (2), starting from beyond the adjacent 0.
  - The source_digit (X) cannot be the boundary_marker (2).
  - Filling occurs *towards* the boundary_marker (2), replacing all fillable_spaces (0s) between the found source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - Left and right side filling operations are independent.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the sequence.
3.  Find the index of the digit '2'. If '2' is not present, return the original sequence unchanged. Let this index be `idx_2`.
4.  **Process Left Side:**
    a.  Check if `idx_2 > 0` (i.e., there is an element to the left).
    b.  If the element at `idx_2 - 1` is '0':
        i.  Scan backwards from `idx_2 - 2` down to index 0 to find the first element `X_left` that is not '0'. Let its index be `idx_left`.
        ii. If such an `X_left` is found *and* `X_left` is not '2':
            - Replace all elements in the sequence copy from `idx_left + 1` up to `idx_2 - 1` (inclusive) with `X_left`.
5.  **Process Right Side:**
    a.  Check if `idx_2 < length - 1` (i.e., there is an element to the right).
    b.  If the element at `idx_2 + 1` is '0':
        i.  Scan forwards from `idx_2 + 2` up to the end of the sequence to find the first element `X_right` that is not '0'. Let its index be `idx_right`.
        ii. If such an `X_right` is found *and* `X_right` is not '2':
            - Replace all elements in the sequence copy from `idx_2 + 1` up to `idx_right - 1` (inclusive) with `X_right`.
6.  Return the modified sequence.
