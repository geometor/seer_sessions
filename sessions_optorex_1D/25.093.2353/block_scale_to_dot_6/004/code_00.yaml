objects:
  - sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: The integer 2.
  - fillable_space: The integer 0.
  - source_digit: Any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.
  - fill_region: A contiguous subsequence of fillable_spaces (0s) located between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).

properties:
  - sequence: Has indexed elements.
  - boundary_marker: Has a unique index (`idx_2`) within the sequence (assumption based on examples).
  - fillable_space: Can be replaced by a source_digit. Located adjacent to the boundary_marker to trigger a potential fill.
  - source_digit: Determines the value used for filling. Must be the nearest non-0 digit when scanning away from the boundary_marker past a triggering fillable_space.

actions:
  - find_boundary_index: Locate the index (`idx_2`) of the boundary_marker (2).
  - check_adjacency: Examine the elements immediately to the left (`idx_2 - 1`) and right (`idx_2 + 1`) of the boundary_marker.
  - find_nearest_source_left: If the element at `idx_2 - 1` is 0, scan leftwards from `idx_2 - 2` to find the first non-0 digit (`X_left` at `idx_left`).
  - find_nearest_source_right: If the element at `idx_2 + 1` is 0, scan rightwards from `idx_2 + 2` to find the first non-0 digit (`X_right` at `idx_right`).
  - fill_left: If `X_left` is found and is not 2, replace all elements from `idx_left + 1` to `idx_2 - 1` with `X_left`.
  - fill_right: If `X_right` is found and is not 2, replace all elements from `idx_2 + 1` to `idx_right - 1` with `X_right`.

relationships:
  - A fill operation is triggered *only* if a fillable_space (0) is directly adjacent to the boundary_marker (2).
  - The source_digit (X) used for filling must be the *nearest* non-0 digit found when scanning *away* from the boundary_marker (2), starting from beyond the adjacent 0.
  - The source_digit (X) cannot be the boundary_marker (2).
  - Filling occurs *towards* the boundary_marker (2), replacing all fillable_spaces (0s) between the found source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - Left and right side filling operations are independent.
