Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, presented as space-separated strings. They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.
2.  **Key Digit '2':** The digit '2' appears to play a special role. It acts as a boundary or a reference point for the transformation.
3.  **Key Digit '0':** The digit '0' represents empty or fillable space.
4.  **Other Digits (X):** Digits other than '0' and '2' (e.g., 3, 7, 6, 4, 8) seem to be "source" values that can propagate.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling sequences of '0's that are located *between* a non-zero digit `X` (where `X` is not '2') and the digit '2'. The '0's are replaced by the digit `X`.
6.  **Directionality:** The filling action propagates *towards* the '2'.
    *   If the sequence is `... X ... 0 0 0 ... 2 ...`, the '0's are filled with `X` moving rightwards towards '2'. (See train_3, train_6, train_7)
    *   If the sequence is `... 2 ... 0 0 0 ... X ...`, the '0's are filled with `X` moving leftwards towards '2'. (See train_2, train_5)
7.  **No Change Cases:** If there are no zeros between a non-zero digit `X` and the '2', or if the region next to '2' only contains zeros extending to the sequence boundary, no change occurs in that direction. (See train_1, train_4)
8.  **Implicit Assumption:** Based on the examples, there appears to be at most one '2' in any given sequence.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: a list of single-digit integers.
  - boundary_marker: the integer 2.
  - fillable_space: the integer 0.
  - source_digit: any integer X where X is not 0 and X is not 2.

properties:
  - sequence: has indices and elements.
  - boundary_marker: has a specific index within the sequence.
  - fillable_space: can be replaced by a source_digit.
  - source_digit: determines the value used for filling.

actions:
  - find_boundary: locate the index of the boundary_marker (2).
  - scan_left: search elements to the left of the boundary_marker.
  - scan_right: search elements to the right of the boundary_marker.
  - identify_fill_region: detect consecutive fillable_spaces (0s) adjacent to the boundary_marker.
  - identify_source: find the first source_digit encountered when scanning away from the boundary_marker past a fill_region.
  - fill_region: replace the fillable_spaces (0s) in the identified region with the identified source_digit.

relationships:
  - fillable_space (0) occurs between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - filling happens *towards* the boundary_marker (2).
  - source_digit (X) must be the first non-zero digit encountered when moving away from the boundary_marker (2) across a block of zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the index of the digit '2'. If '2' is not present in the sequence, return the original sequence unchanged. Let the index of '2' be `idx_2`.
3.  Create a modifiable copy of the sequence.
4.  **Fill Left:**
    a.  Scan the sequence copy backwards from index `idx_2 - 1` down to index 0.
    b.  Find the first digit `X_left` that is not '0' and not '2'.
    c.  If such a digit `X_left` is found at index `idx_left`:
        i.  Check if all elements between `idx_left + 1` and `idx_2 - 1` (inclusive) are '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', replace all elements in the sequence copy from `idx_left + 1` to `idx_2 - 1` with `X_left`.
5.  **Fill Right:**
    a.  Scan the sequence copy forwards from index `idx_2 + 1` up to the end of the sequence.
    b.  Find the first digit `X_right` that is not '0' and not '2'.
    c.  If such a digit `X_right` is found at index `idx_right`:
        i.  Check if all elements between `idx_2 + 1` and `idx_right - 1` (inclusive) are '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', replace all elements in the sequence copy from `idx_2 + 1` to `idx_right - 1` with `X_right`.
6.  Return the modified sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (designed for a string) and the actual data type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The testing environment appears to pass the input data as a NumPy array directly, rather than the space-separated string format presented in the problem description.

The core transformation logic, as described in the previous natural language program (finding '2', scanning left/right for source digits, and filling intervening '0's), appears sound when mentally traced through the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adapt Input/Output Handling:** Modify the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input and return a list or NumPy array as output. Remove the string parsing (`_parse_input`) and formatting (`_format_output`) steps.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Re-confirm the filling logic (scan outwards from '2', find first non-zero/non-2 digit, check if intermediate elements are all '0', fill towards '2').
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the list/array-based processing.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the structure of the training examples to confirm patterns.

**Metrics Summary:**

*   All input sequences have a length of 12.
*   The digit '2' acts as a boundary.
*   The logic identifies potential 'source' digits (non-zero, non-2) to the left and right of '2'.
*   It correctly identifies whether the segment between the source digit and '2' consists solely of '0's.
*   The 'Can Fill' flags accurately predict whether a fill operation should occur based on the examples. Note: The indices reported for the fill region are inclusive start and end; when `start > end` (e.g., Examples 1 and 4), it signifies no actual elements exist strictly *between* the source and '2', hence no fill occurs, which aligns with the observed outputs.

  - scan_left: Iterate backwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - scan_right: Iterate forwards from the boundary_marker's index to find the first source_digit.
  - check_intermediate_zeros: Verify if all elements between a found source_digit and the boundary_marker are fillable_spaces (0s).
  - fill_region_left: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the left side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the left source_digit and the boundary_marker with the left source_digit's value.
  - fill_region_right: If check_intermediate_zeros is true for the right side, replace the fillable_spaces (0s) between the boundary_marker and the right source_digit with the right source_digit's value.

relationships:
  - Filling occurs only if a contiguous block of fillable_spaces (0s) exists directly between a source_digit (X) and the boundary_marker (2).
  - Filling propagates *towards* the boundary_marker (2) from the source_digit (X).
  - Operations on the left and right sides of the boundary_marker are independent.
  - If the boundary_marker (2) is not found, the sequence remains unchanged.
  - If no source_digit is found on a side, or if the intermediate region contains non-zero digits, no filling occurs on that side.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence (as a list or array of integers).
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
3.  Attempt to find the index of the boundary marker '2' in the sequence. Let this be `idx_2`.
4.  If '2' is not found in the sequence, return the original (copied) sequence without modification.
5.  **Process Left Side:**
    a.  Initialize `left_source_idx` to -1.
    b.  Iterate backwards from `idx_2 - 1` down to 0.
    c.  If an element is encountered that is not '0' and not '2', record its index as `left_source_idx` and its value as `left_source_value`, then stop this backward iteration.
    d.  If `left_source_idx` is not -1 (meaning a source digit was found):
        i.  Check if all elements in the sequence slice from index `left_source_idx + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_2` are equal to '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', then iterate from `i = left_source_idx + 1` up to `idx_2 - 1` and set the element at index `i` in the copied sequence to `left_source_value`.
6.  **Process Right Side:**
    a.  Initialize `right_source_idx` to -1.
    b.  Iterate forwards from `idx_2 + 1` up to the end of the sequence.
    c.  If an element is encountered that is not '0' and not '2', record its index as `right_source_idx` and its value as `right_source_value`, then stop this forward iteration.
    d.  If `right_source_idx` is not -1 (meaning a source digit was found):
        i.  Check if all elements in the sequence slice from index `idx_2 + 1` up to (but not including) `right_source_idx` are equal to '0'.
        ii. If they are all '0', then iterate from `i = idx_2 + 1` up to `right_source_idx - 1` and set the element at index `i` in the copied sequence to `right_source_value`.
7.  Return the modified sequence copy.
