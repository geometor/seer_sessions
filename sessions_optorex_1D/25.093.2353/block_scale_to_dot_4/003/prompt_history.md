*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation seems to be filling sequences of zeros based on the proximity of a non-zero number to the number `2`. The number `2` acts as a central point or boundary. Zeros located between the number `2` and the nearest non-zero number (either to the left or right) are replaced by that non-zero number. If `2` is adjacent to a non-zero number, or if there are only zeros on one side extending to the end of the sequence, no filling occurs in that direction.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous code assumed the input `input_str` was a string, while the testing environment provided a different data type, likely a list or numpy array of integers. The core transformation logic, which involves finding '2' and filling adjacent zeros based on the nearest non-zero neighbors, appears sound based on a manual review of the examples, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch. The strategy is to correct the input handling to directly accept a sequence (e.g., a list) of integers and apply the established filling logic.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the analysis of the examples:
    *   The transformation hinges on the location of the integer `2`.
    *   If `2` is present, the algorithm scans left and right for the *first* non-zero integer encountered.
    *   All zero elements situated strictly *between* the `2` and the found non-zero element (if one exists on that side and is not adjacent) are replaced with the value of that non-zero element.
    *   If `2` is not present, or if no non-zero element exists to the left/right, or if the nearest non-zero element is immediately adjacent to `2`, no filling occurs on that side.
