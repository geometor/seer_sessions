            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous code assumed the input `input_str` was a string, while the testing environment provided a different data type, likely a list or numpy array of integers. The core transformation logic, which involves finding '2' and filling adjacent zeros based on the nearest non-zero neighbors, appears sound based on a manual review of the examples, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch. The strategy is to correct the input handling to directly accept a sequence (e.g., a list) of integers and apply the established filling logic.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Based on the analysis of the examples:\n    *   The transformation hinges on the location of the integer `2`.\n    *   If `2` is present, the algorithm scans left and right for the *first* non-zero integer encountered.\n    *   All zero elements situated strictly *between* the `2` and the found non-zero element (if one exists on that side and is not adjacent) are replaced with the value of that non-zero element.\n    *   If `2` is not present, or if no non-zero element exists to the left/right, or if the nearest non-zero element is immediately adjacent to `2`, no filling occurs on that side.\n\n    | Example  | Input Sequence             | Output Sequence            | Index of 2 | Left Non-Zero (Index) | Right Non-Zero (Index) | Left Fill Indices | Right Fill Indices | Notes                          |\n    | :------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------- |\n    | train_1  | `[0,0,8,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]` | `[0,0,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0,0]` | 6          | 8 (3)                 | None                   | 4, 5              | None               | Filled left with 8.            |\n    | train_2  | `[0,0,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]` | `[0,0,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]` | 2          | None                  | 1 (3)                  | None              | None               | Right non-zero adjacent.       |\n    | train_3  | `[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0]` | `[0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0]` | 10         | 1 (2)                 | None                   | 3-9               | None               | Filled left with 1.            |\n    | train_4  | `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8]` | `[2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]` | 0          | None                  | 8 (8)                  | None              | 1-7                | Filled right with 8.           |\n    | train_5  | `[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,2]` | `[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]` | 11         | 8 (8)                 | None                   | 9, 10             | None               | Filled left with 8.            |\n    | train_6  | `[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0]` | `[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0]` | 9          | 1 (8)                 | None                   | None              | None               | Left non-zero adjacent.        |\n    | train_7  | `[0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]` | `[0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]` | 4          | None                  | 4 (5)                  | None              | None               | Right non-zero adjacent.       |\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
