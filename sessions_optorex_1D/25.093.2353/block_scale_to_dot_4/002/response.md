*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous code assumed the input `input_str` was a string, while the testing environment provided a different data type, likely a list or numpy array of integers. The core transformation logic, which involves finding '2' and filling adjacent zeros based on the nearest non-zero neighbors, appears sound based on a manual review of the examples, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch. The strategy is to correct the input handling to directly accept a sequence (e.g., a list) of integers and apply the established filling logic.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the analysis of the examples:
    *   The transformation hinges on the location of the integer `2`.
    *   If `2` is present, the algorithm scans left and right for the *first* non-zero integer encountered.
    *   All zero elements situated strictly *between* the `2` and the found non-zero element (if one exists on that side and is not adjacent) are replaced with the value of that non-zero element.
    *   If `2` is not present, or if no non-zero element exists to the left/right, or if the nearest non-zero element is immediately adjacent to `2`, no filling occurs on that side.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a list of integers.
    2.  Create a copy of the input list to serve as the output list.
    3.  Attempt to find the index (`idx_2`) of the first occurrence of the integer `2` in the input list.
    4.  If `2` is not found in the list, return the original input list.
    5.  **Left Fill Scan:**
        a.  Search the portion of the list to the left of `idx_2` (from index `idx_2 - 1` down to `0`).
        b.  Find the index (`idx_L`) and value (`val_L`) of the first non-zero element encountered during this leftward scan.
        c.  If a non-zero element `val_L` is found at `idx_L` *and* `idx_L` is less than `idx_2 - 1` (i.e., it's not immediately adjacent to `2`):
            i.  Iterate through the indices from `idx_L + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_2`.
            ii. For each index `i` in this range, set the value of the element at index `i` in the *output* list to `val_L`.
    6.  **Right Fill Scan:**
        a.  Search the portion of the list to the right of `idx_2` (from index `idx_2 + 1` up to the end of the list).
        b.  Find the index (`idx_R`) and value (`val_R`) of the first non-zero element encountered during this rightward scan.
        c.  If a non-zero element `val_R` is found at `idx_R` *and* `idx_R` is greater than `idx_2 + 1` (i.e., it's not immediately adjacent to `2`):
            i.  Iterate through the indices from `idx_2 + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_R`.
            ii. For each index `i` in this range, set the value of the element at index `i` in the *output* list to `val_R`.
    7.  Return the modified output list.
