            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` consistently occurred across all examples. This indicates the `transform` function was implemented assuming a standard Python `list` input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy `ndarray`. The underlying transformation logic derived from the first example appears consistent with the other examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted to handle NumPy arrays. The strategy is to modify the code to use NumPy-compatible methods for finding elements and slicing/modifying the array, while keeping the core transformation logic intact.\n\n*   **Metrics:** The code failed execution at the point of searching for the element `2` (`input_list.index(2)`) in all cases due to the type mismatch. No meaningful transformation output was generated for comparison. The core logic requires identifying the index of `2`, scanning left and right for the first non-zero elements, and then filling the zeros *between* `2` and those non-zero elements (if they are not adjacent). Let's re-verify this logic against the examples conceptually:\n    *   `train_1`: `2` at index 6. Left non-zero `8` at index 3. Fill `[4:6]` with `8`. Output `0 0 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0`. Correct.\n    *   `train_2`: `2` at index 2. Right non-zero `1` at index 3 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`. Correct.\n    *   `train_3`: `2` at index 10. Left non-zero `1` at index 2. Fill `[3:10]` with `1`. Output `0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0`. Correct.\n    *   `train_4`: `2` at index 0. Right non-zero `8` at index 8. Fill `[1:8]` with `8`. Output `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Correct.\n    *   `train_5`: `2` at index 11. Left non-zero `8` at index 8. Fill `[9:11]` with `8`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`. Correct.\n    *   `train_6`: `2` at index 9. Left non-zero `1` at index 8 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 0`. Correct.\n    *   `train_7`: `2` at index 4. Right non-zero `4` at index 5 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4`. Correct.\n    The logic holds across all examples. The implementation just needs to handle the NumPy array type.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
