*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation seems to be filling sequences of zeros based on the proximity of a non-zero number to the number `2`. The number `2` acts as a central point or boundary. Zeros located between the number `2` and the nearest non-zero number (either to the left or right) are replaced by that non-zero number. If `2` is adjacent to a non-zero number, or if there are only zeros on one side extending to the end of the sequence, no filling occurs in that direction.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'
*   **General Assessment:** The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` consistently occurred across all examples. This indicates the `transform` function was implemented assuming a standard Python `list` input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy `ndarray`. The underlying transformation logic derived from the first example appears consistent with the other examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted to handle NumPy arrays. The strategy is to modify the code to use NumPy-compatible methods for finding elements and slicing/modifying the array, while keeping the core transformation logic intact.

*   **Metrics:** The code failed execution at the point of searching for the element `2` (`input_list.index(2)`) in all cases due to the type mismatch. No meaningful transformation output was generated for comparison. The core logic requires identifying the index of `2`, scanning left and right for the first non-zero elements, and then filling the zeros *between* `2` and those non-zero elements (if they are not adjacent). Let's re-verify this logic against the examples conceptually:
    *   `train_1`: `2` at index 6. Left non-zero `8` at index 3. Fill `[4:6]` with `8`. Output `0 0 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0`. Correct.
    *   `train_2`: `2` at index 2. Right non-zero `1` at index 3 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`. Correct.
    *   `train_3`: `2` at index 10. Left non-zero `1` at index 2. Fill `[3:10]` with `1`. Output `0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0`. Correct.
    *   `train_4`: `2` at index 0. Right non-zero `8` at index 8. Fill `[1:8]` with `8`. Output `2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Correct.
    *   `train_5`: `2` at index 11. Left non-zero `8` at index 8. Fill `[9:11]` with `8`. Output `0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2`. Correct.
    *   `train_6`: `2` at index 9. Left non-zero `1` at index 8 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 0`. Correct.
    *   `train_7`: `2` at index 4. Right non-zero `4` at index 5 (adjacent). No fill. Output `0 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4`. Correct.
    The logic holds across all examples. The implementation just needs to handle the NumPy array type.

    3.  If `2` is not found in the sequence, return the original output sequence unchanged.
    4.  **Left Fill:**
        a.  Scan the sequence leftwards starting from the element just before `idx_2` (i.e., index `idx_2 - 1`) down to the beginning (index 0).
        b.  Find the first non-zero element encountered. Let its value be `L` and its index be `idx_L`.
        c.  If such an element `L` is found AND its index `idx_L` is less than `idx_2 - 1` (i.e., it's not immediately adjacent to `2`):
            i.  Replace all elements in the output sequence from index `idx_L + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_2` with the value `L`.
    5.  **Right Fill:**
        a.  Scan the sequence rightwards starting from the element just after `idx_2` (i.e., index `idx_2 + 1`) up to the end of the sequence.
        b.  Find the first non-zero element encountered. Let its value be `R` and its index be `idx_R`.
        c.  If such an element `R` is found AND its index `idx_R` is greater than `idx_2 + 1` (i.e., it's not immediately adjacent to `2`):
            i.  Replace all elements in the output sequence from index `idx_2 + 1` up to (but not including) `idx_R` with the value `R`.
    6.  Return the modified output sequence.
