The core operation seems to be filling sequences of zeros based on the proximity of a non-zero number to the number `2`. The number `2` acts as a central point or boundary. Zeros located between the number `2` and the nearest non-zero number (either to the left or right) are replaced by that non-zero number. If `2` is adjacent to a non-zero number, or if there are only zeros on one side extending to the end of the sequence, no filling occurs in that direction.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
