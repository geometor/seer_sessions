Task: Fill zeros based on context
Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structure.
  - name: digit_2
    type: integer
    value: 2
    description: Acts as a left boundary or trigger for the transformation.
  - name: digit_0
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: The digit to be potentially replaced.
  - name: digit_X
    type: integer
    value: non-zero digit (1-9)
    description: The non-zero digit that determines the replacement value for zeros and acts as the right boundary of the zero sequence to be filled.
Properties:
  - name: index
    applies_to: sequence elements
    description: The position of a digit within the sequence.
Relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positioning of digits matters (`digit_2` must appear before `digit_0`s, which must appear before `digit_X`).
Actions:
  - name: find_first
    actor: transformation process
    object: digit_2
    description: Locate the index of the first occurrence of digit 2 in the sequence.
  - name: scan_right
    actor: transformation process
    start_position: index after first digit_2
    description: Examine the sequence elements to the right of the first digit 2.
  - name: identify_pattern
    actor: transformation process
    pattern: Sequence of one or more digit_0 followed immediately by a digit_X.
    context: Must occur after the first digit_2.
    description: Find the first occurrence of this specific pattern during the rightward scan.
  - name: replace_zeros
    actor: transformation process
    target: digit_0s within the identified pattern
    value: digit_X from the identified pattern
    description: Change the value of the identified zeros to the value of the subsequent non-zero digit X.
Conditions:
  - The transformation only occurs if a '2' exists in the sequence.
  - The transformation only applies to the *first* valid pattern `2...0...0 X` found after the *first* '2'.
