            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems to involve changing sequences of zeros (`0`) based on their surrounding digits. Specifically, the digit `2` appears to act as a trigger or boundary, and another non-zero digit (`X`) acts as the value to fill in the zeros.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   In examples where the output differs from the input (train_2, train_5, train_6), we observe a pattern like `... 2 0 ... 0 X ...` where `X` is a non-zero digit. The zeros between the `2` and `X` are replaced by `X`.\n    *   The change appears to propagate leftwards from `X` towards `2`.\n    *   The process seems to start from the *first* occurrence of `2`.\n    *   If there are no zeros between the first `2` and the next non-zero digit (`X`), no change occurs (train_3, train_4, train_7).\n    *   If the sequence doesn't contain this specific `2 ... 0 ... X` pattern starting from the first `2`, no change occurs (train_1).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
