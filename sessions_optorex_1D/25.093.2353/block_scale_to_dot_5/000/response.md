Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems to involve changing sequences of zeros (`0`) based on their surrounding digits. Specifically, the digit `2` appears to act as a trigger or boundary, and another non-zero digit (`X`) acts as the value to fill in the zeros.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   In examples where the output differs from the input (train_2, train_5, train_6), we observe a pattern like `... 2 0 ... 0 X ...` where `X` is a non-zero digit. The zeros between the `2` and `X` are replaced by `X`.
    *   The change appears to propagate leftwards from `X` towards `2`.
    *   The process seems to start from the *first* occurrence of `2`.
    *   If there are no zeros between the first `2` and the next non-zero digit (`X`), no change occurs (train_3, train_4, train_7).
    *   If the sequence doesn't contain this specific `2 ... 0 ... X` pattern starting from the first `2`, no change occurs (train_1).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Fill zeros based on context
Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structure.
  - name: digit_2
    type: integer
    value: 2
    description: Acts as a left boundary or trigger for the transformation.
  - name: digit_0
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: The digit to be potentially replaced.
  - name: digit_X
    type: integer
    value: non-zero digit (1-9)
    description: The non-zero digit that determines the replacement value for zeros and acts as the right boundary of the zero sequence to be filled.
Properties:
  - name: index
    applies_to: sequence elements
    description: The position of a digit within the sequence.
Relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positioning of digits matters (`digit_2` must appear before `digit_0`s, which must appear before `digit_X`).
Actions:
  - name: find_first
    actor: transformation process
    object: digit_2
    description: Locate the index of the first occurrence of digit 2 in the sequence.
  - name: scan_right
    actor: transformation process
    start_position: index after first digit_2
    description: Examine the sequence elements to the right of the first digit 2.
  - name: identify_pattern
    actor: transformation process
    pattern: Sequence of one or more digit_0 followed immediately by a digit_X.
    context: Must occur after the first digit_2.
    description: Find the first occurrence of this specific pattern during the rightward scan.
  - name: replace_zeros
    actor: transformation process
    target: digit_0s within the identified pattern
    value: digit_X from the identified pattern
    description: Change the value of the identified zeros to the value of the subsequent non-zero digit X.
Conditions:
  - The transformation only occurs if a '2' exists in the sequence.
  - The transformation only applies to the *first* valid pattern `2...0...0 X` found after the *first* '2'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the index of the first occurrence of the digit `2`. If `2` is not present in the sequence, return the original sequence unchanged.
3.  Initialize a search starting from the index immediately following the first `2`.
4.  Scan the sequence to the right from this starting position.
5.  Identify the first non-zero digit encountered during this scan. Let's call this digit `X` and its index `idx_X`.
6.  Examine the subsequence between the first `2` (exclusive) and `X` (exclusive). Check if this subsequence consists entirely of one or more zeros (`0`).
7.  If the subsequence consists of one or more zeros:
    a.  Create a copy of the input sequence.
    b.  For each position within this subsequence (i.e., from the index after the first `2` up to, but not including, `idx_X`), change the digit in the copied sequence to `X`.
    c.  Return the modified sequence.
8.  If the first non-zero digit `X` immediately follows the first `2`, or if no non-zero digit `X` is found after the first `2`, or if the subsequence between the first `2` and the first non-zero `X` contains non-zero digits, return the original input sequence unchanged.
