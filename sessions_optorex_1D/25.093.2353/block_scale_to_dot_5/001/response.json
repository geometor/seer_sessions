If found, it then searches\nfor the first non-zero digit ('X') that appears *after* this '2'.\nIf the sequence of digits strictly between the first '2' and the first 'X'\nconsists entirely of one or more zeros, then all these zeros are replaced\nby the digit 'X'. Otherwise, the sequence remains unchanged.
