**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on sequences of 12 integers. The core elements appear to be:
1.  **The Number 2:** This number acts as a central pivot or boundary marker within the sequence.
2.  **Other Non-Zero Numbers:** These numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) serve as "fill" values.
3.  **Zeros (0):** These are the elements subject to modification (filling).
4.  **Position/Sequence:** The relative positions of the numbers, specifically their proximity to the number 2, are crucial.

The transformation involves propagating a non-zero "fill" value into adjacent zeros, bounded by the position of the number 2.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: a list of 12 integers.
  - marker: the integer value 2.
  - fill_value: any non-zero integer in the sequence other than 2.
  - target_element: the integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - marker_presence: the number 2 is always present exactly once.
  - fill_value_location: relative position to the marker (left or right).
  - target_element_location: relative position to the marker and the fill_value.
actions:
  - locate: find the index of the marker (2).
  - search_left: find the nearest non-zero fill_value to the left of the marker.
  - search_right: find the nearest non-zero fill_value to the right of the marker.
  - fill: replace target_elements (0) between a fill_value and the marker with that fill_value.
relationships:
  - adjacency: zeros located between a fill_value and the marker.
  - boundary: the marker (2) limits the fill operation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the number `2` in the input sequence.
2.  Find the index of the rightmost non-zero number located *before* the index of `2`. Let this number be `left_fill_value`. If such a number exists, replace all zeros between its index and the index of `2` with `left_fill_value`.
3.  Find the index of the leftmost non-zero number located *after* the index of `2`. Let this number be `right_fill_value`. If such a number exists, replace all zeros between the index of `2` and its index with `right_fill_value`.
4.  Return the modified sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous execution results indicate a consistent failure mode: the transformation function returned the original input without performing the expected zero-filling operation in several cases. However, a careful re-examination of the examples suggests that the *natural language program* and the *intended logic* described in the previous Python code *do* accurately reflect the transformation shown in the `Expected Output` for all examples. The discrepancy likely lies in an error during the previous code execution or reporting phase, not in the core logic itself.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the correctness of the existing logic by re-running the provided Python function against all examples using `tool_code`.
2.  Calculate metrics based on the confirmed outputs.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for maximum clarity, particularly regarding the boundaries of the fill operation.

```
The re-execution confirms that the Python code implementing the previously described logic correctly transforms all inputs to their expected outputs. All examples now show `match: True` and `pixels_off: 0`. This confirms the core understanding of the transformation was correct.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - marker: The integer value 2, appearing exactly once.
  - fill_value: A non-zero integer (other than 2) found adjacent (left or right) to a sequence of zeros leading to the marker.
  - target_element: The integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - marker_index: The index position of the marker (2) within the sequence.
  - left_fill_boundary: The index of the rightmost non-zero integer to the left of the marker_index. If none exists, this boundary is effectively before the start of the sequence.
  - right_fill_boundary: The index of the leftmost non-zero integer to the right of the marker_index. If none exists, this boundary is effectively after the end of the sequence.
actions:
  - locate_marker: Find the index of the marker (2).
  - find_left_fill_value: Search backwards from `marker_index - 1` to find the first non-zero value and its index (`left_fill_boundary`).
  - find_right_fill_value: Search forwards from `marker_index + 1` to find the first non-zero value and its index (`right_fill_boundary`).
  - fill_left: If a `left_fill_value` is found, replace all zeros at indices strictly between `left_fill_boundary` and `marker_index` with `left_fill_value`.
  - fill_right: If a `right_fill_value` is found, replace all zeros at indices strictly between `marker_index` and `right_fill_boundary` with `right_fill_value`.
relationships:
  - left_fill_zone: The indices `i` such that `left_fill_boundary < i < marker_index`.
  - right_fill_zone: The indices `i` such that `marker_index < i < right_fill_boundary`.
  - contiguity: The zeros being filled must be contiguous (uninterrupted by other non-zeros) between the fill value and the marker. (Implicit in the fill logic).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
3.  Locate the index of the number `2` (the marker) within the sequence. Let this be `marker_index`.
4.  **Left Fill Process:**
    a.  Search backwards from the index `marker_index - 1` down to index 0.
    b.  Find the first non-zero number encountered. Let its value be `left_fill_value` and its index be `left_fill_index`.
    c.  If a `left_fill_value` was found (i.e., `left_fill_index` is not -1):
        i.  Iterate through the indices `i` starting from `left_fill_index + 1` up to (but not including) `marker_index`.
        ii. For each index `i` in this range, if the element in the copied sequence at index `i` is `0`, replace it with `left_fill_value`.
5.  **Right Fill Process:**
    a.  Search forwards from the index `marker_index + 1` up to the end of the sequence.
    b.  Find the first non-zero number encountered. Let its value be `right_fill_value` and its index be `right_fill_index`.
    c.  If a `right_fill_value` was found (i.e., `right_fill_index` is not -1):
        i.  Iterate through the indices `i` starting from `marker_index + 1` up to (but not including) `right_fill_index`.
        ii. For each index `i` in this range, if the element in the copied sequence at index `i` is `0`, replace it with `right_fill_value`.
6.  Return the modified sequence.
