objects:
  - sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - marker: The integer value 2, appearing exactly once.
  - fill_value: A non-zero integer (other than 2) found adjacent (left or right) to a sequence of zeros leading to the marker.
  - target_element: The integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - marker_index: The index position of the marker (2) within the sequence.
  - left_fill_boundary: The index of the rightmost non-zero integer to the left of the marker_index. If none exists, this boundary is effectively before the start of the sequence.
  - right_fill_boundary: The index of the leftmost non-zero integer to the right of the marker_index. If none exists, this boundary is effectively after the end of the sequence.
actions:
  - locate_marker: Find the index of the marker (2).
  - find_left_fill_value: Search backwards from `marker_index - 1` to find the first non-zero value and its index (`left_fill_boundary`).
  - find_right_fill_value: Search forwards from `marker_index + 1` to find the first non-zero value and its index (`right_fill_boundary`).
  - fill_left: If a `left_fill_value` is found, replace all zeros at indices strictly between `left_fill_boundary` and `marker_index` with `left_fill_value`.
  - fill_right: If a `right_fill_value` is found, replace all zeros at indices strictly between `marker_index` and `right_fill_boundary` with `right_fill_value`.
relationships:
  - left_fill_zone: The indices `i` such that `left_fill_boundary < i < marker_index`.
  - right_fill_zone: The indices `i` such that `marker_index < i < right_fill_boundary`.
  - contiguity: The zeros being filled must be contiguous (uninterrupted by other non-zeros) between the fill value and the marker. (Implicit in the fill logic).
