objects:
  - sequence: a list of 12 integers.
  - marker: the integer value 2.
  - fill_value: any non-zero integer in the sequence other than 2.
  - target_element: the integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - marker_presence: the number 2 is always present exactly once.
  - fill_value_location: relative position to the marker (left or right).
  - target_element_location: relative position to the marker and the fill_value.
actions:
  - locate: find the index of the marker (2).
  - search_left: find the nearest non-zero fill_value to the left of the marker.
  - search_right: find the nearest non-zero fill_value to the right of the marker.
  - fill: replace target_elements (0) between a fill_value and the marker with that fill_value.
relationships:
  - adjacency: zeros located between a fill_value and the marker.
  - boundary: the marker (2) limits the fill operation.
