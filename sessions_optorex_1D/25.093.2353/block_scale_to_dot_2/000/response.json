The core elements appear to be:\n1.  **The Number 2:** This number acts as a central pivot or boundary marker within the sequence.\n2.  **Other Non-Zero Numbers:** These numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) serve as \"fill\" values.\n3.  **Zeros (0):** These are the elements subject to modification (filling).\n4.  **Position/Sequence:** The relative positions of the numbers, specifically their proximity to the number 2, are crucial.\n\nThe transformation involves propagating a non-zero \"fill\" value into adjacent zeros, bounded by the position of the number 2.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
