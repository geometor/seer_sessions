objects:
  - sequence: A list or array of 12 integers.
  - marker: The integer value 2, appearing exactly once.
  - fill_value: Any non-zero integer in the sequence other than 2.
  - target_element: The integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: Always 12.
  - marker_index: The position (index) of the number 2.
  - left_fill_candidate: The non-zero number closest to the marker on its left.
  - right_fill_candidate: The non-zero number closest to the marker on its right.
actions:
  - locate_marker: Find the index of the marker (2).
  - search_left: Iterate backwards from `marker_index - 1` to find the first non-zero element (left_fill_candidate) and its index.
  - search_right: Iterate forwards from `marker_index + 1` to find the first non-zero element (right_fill_candidate) and its index.
  - fill_left: If a left_fill_candidate exists, replace all target_elements (0) between its index and the marker_index with the left_fill_candidate value.
  - fill_right: If a right_fill_candidate exists, replace all target_elements (0) between the marker_index and its index with the right_fill_candidate value.
relationships:
  - left_fill_zone: The sequence of indices strictly between the index of the left_fill_candidate and the marker_index.
  - right_fill_zone: The sequence of indices strictly between the marker_index and the index of the right_fill_candidate.
  - boundary: The marker (2) acts as a boundary, preventing fills from crossing over it. Fill operations occur independently on the left and right sides.
