objects:
  - sequence: A list/array of 12 integers.
  - marker: The integer value 2, appearing exactly once.
  - fill_value: A non-zero integer (other than 2) present in the sequence. There can be a fill_value to the left and/or right of the marker.
  - target_element: The integer value 0.
properties:
  - sequence_length: Always 12.
  - marker_index: The position (index) of the number 2.
  - left_fill_value: The value of the rightmost non-zero integer located to the left of the marker_index. Can be null/non-existent if no non-zero exists to the left.
  - left_fill_index: The index of the left_fill_value.
  - right_fill_value: The value of the leftmost non-zero integer located to the right of the marker_index. Can be null/non-existent if no non-zero exists to the right.
  - right_fill_index: The index of the right_fill_value.
actions:
  - locate_marker: Find the index of the number 2.
  - find_left_fill: Search backwards from marker_index - 1 to find the first non-zero element and its index.
  - find_right_fill: Search forwards from marker_index + 1 to find the first non-zero element and its index.
  - fill_left: If a left_fill_value exists, replace all zeros between left_fill_index and marker_index (exclusive indices) with left_fill_value.
  - fill_right: If a right_fill_value exists, replace all zeros between marker_index and right_fill_index (exclusive indices) with right_fill_value.
relationships:
  - contiguity: Zeros are filled only if they form a contiguous block between a fill_value and the marker.
  - boundary: The marker (2) acts as a boundary; filling does not cross the marker. Filling only occurs *between* a found fill_value and the marker.
