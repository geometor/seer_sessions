"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits based on the following rules:
1. Identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits present in the input sequence. 
   All examples provided contain exactly two such blocks.
2. Counts the total number of zero ('0') digits in the input sequence.
3. Determines the output order of the two non-zero blocks based on their length: 
   - The shorter block comes first.
   - If the blocks have equal lengths, their original order (the order they appeared in the input) is preserved.
4. Constructs the output sequence by concatenating:
   - The first block (according to the ordering rule).
   - A single zero digit, but only if the original input contained at least one zero.
   - The second block (according to the ordering rule).
   - All remaining zero digits from the input (total zeros minus the one used as a separator, if applicable) appended at the end.
