            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is that the previous code incorrectly assumed the input was a string of space-separated digits. The actual input format appears to be a list or a NumPy array of integers.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  Modify the main `transform` function to accept a list-like input (e.g., list or NumPy array) directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`).\n2.  Verify that the `find_non_zero_blocks` helper function correctly processes this list-like input. Based on the tool execution, the logic for identifying the blocks seems correct for the provided examples.\n3.  Confirm that the subsequent steps (counting zeros, comparing block lengths, ordering blocks, and assembling the output list) are compatible with list operations.\n4.  Ensure the final output is returned in the correct format (presumably a list or array, matching the expected output format implicit in the examples).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirms the `find_non_zero_blocks_test` function accurately identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits as expected from the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]` -> Blocks: `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9]` (len 2). Zeros: 6. Correctly identified. Rule: Shorter first -> `[9, 9]`, `[9, 9, 9, 9]`. Output: `[9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` + 5 zeros.\n*   **Example 2:** `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]` -> Blocks: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 4), `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 4). Zeros: 4. Correctly identified. Rule: Equal length, preserve order -> `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. Output: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]` + 3 zeros.\n*   **Example 4:** `[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]` -> Blocks: `[7, 7, 7, 7]` (len 4), `[7]` (len 1). Zeros: 7. Correctly identified. Rule: Shorter first -> `[7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`. Output: `[7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` + 6 zeros.\n\nThe analysis confirms the previously derived rules for block identification, ordering (shorter first, preserve order if equal), and zero placement (one separator, rest at the end) hold true for all provided examples. The only necessary change is adapting to the correct input data type.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
