Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single lists (or sequences) of digits.
2.  **Digit Conservation:** The multiset of digits in the output is the same as in the input. Specifically, the count of each non-zero digit and the count of zeros remain the same overall.
3.  **Key Digit:** The digit '0' acts as a separator or background element.
4.  **Non-Zero Structure:** The non-zero digits in the input appear in contiguous blocks of identical digits. All examples show exactly two such blocks.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging these two blocks of non-zero digits and repositioning the zeros.
6.  **Reordering Rule:** The two non-zero blocks are placed adjacent to each other in the output, separated by a single zero. Their relative order depends on their lengths: the shorter block comes first. If the blocks have equal lengths, their original order is preserved.
7.  **Zero Placement:** One zero is used as a separator between the two non-zero blocks. All remaining zeros from the input are moved to the end of the output sequence.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Input Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains exactly two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, potentially separated and surrounded by zeros.
  - item: Output Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains the two non-zero blocks from the input, ordered by length (shorter first), separated by a single zero, followed by all remaining zeros.
objects:
  - object: Digit Block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The digit making up the block (e.g., 9, 2, 6).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - order: Position relative to other blocks in the input (first or second).
  - object: Zero Digit
    description: The digit '0'.
    properties:
      - count: The total number of zeros in the input sequence.
actions:
  - action: Identify Blocks
    description: Find the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Record their content, length, and original order.
  - action: Collect Zeros
    description: Count and conceptually gather all the zero digits from the input.
  - action: Compare Lengths
    description: Compare the lengths of the two identified non-zero blocks.
  - action: Order Blocks
    description: Determine the output order of the two blocks based on length comparison (shorter block first, preserve original order if lengths are equal).
  - action: Construct Output
    description: Assemble the output sequence by concatenating the ordered first block, a single zero, the ordered second block, and all remaining original zeros.
relationships:
  - relationship: Block Ordering
    description: The relative order of the non-zero blocks in the output depends on their relative lengths in the input.
    rule: If length(Block1) <= length(Block2), output order is Block1, Block2. Else, output order is Block2, Block1.
  - relationship: Zero Placement
    description: One zero separates the two non-zero blocks in the output, and all other original zeros are appended at the end.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (let's call it `Block1`).
3.  Identify the second contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (let's call it `Block2`).
4.  Count the total number of zero digits in the input sequence.
5.  Compare the length of `Block1` and `Block2`.
6.  If the length of `Block1` is less than or equal to the length of `Block2`, set `FirstBlock` to `Block1` and `SecondBlock` to `Block2`.
7.  Otherwise (if the length of `Block1` is greater than the length of `Block2`), set `FirstBlock` to `Block2` and `SecondBlock` to `Block1`.
8.  Create the output sequence by concatenating:
    *   `FirstBlock`
    *   A single zero digit (`[0]`)
    *   `SecondBlock`
    *   A sequence containing all the remaining zeros (total count of zeros minus one).
9.  Return the constructed output sequence.
```python
import re

"""
Identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence.
Orders these blocks based on their length (shorter block first). If lengths are equal,
the original order is preserved.
Constructs the output sequence by concatenating the shorter (or first if equal length) block,
a single zero, the longer (or second if equal length) block, and finally all the remaining
zeros from the input sequence appended at the end.
