**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is that the previous code incorrectly assumed the input was a string of space-separated digits. The actual input format appears to be a list or a NumPy array of integers.

The strategy is to:

1.  Modify the main `transform` function to accept a list-like input (e.g., list or NumPy array) directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`).
2.  Verify that the `find_non_zero_blocks` helper function correctly processes this list-like input. Based on the tool execution, the logic for identifying the blocks seems correct for the provided examples.
3.  Confirm that the subsequent steps (counting zeros, comparing block lengths, ordering blocks, and assembling the output list) are compatible with list operations.
4.  Ensure the final output is returned in the correct format (presumably a list or array, matching the expected output format implicit in the examples).

**Metrics and Analysis**

The `tool_code` execution confirms the `find_non_zero_blocks_test` function accurately identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits as expected from the examples:

*   **Example 1:** `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]` -> Blocks: `[9, 9, 9, 9]` (len 4), `[9, 9]` (len 2). Zeros: 6. Correctly identified. Rule: Shorter first -> `[9, 9]`, `[9, 9, 9, 9]`. Output: `[9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` + 5 zeros.
*   **Example 2:** `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]` -> Blocks: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 4), `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 4). Zeros: 4. Correctly identified. Rule: Equal length, preserve order -> `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. Output: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]` + 3 zeros.
*   **Example 4:** `[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]` -> Blocks: `[7, 7, 7, 7]` (len 4), `[7]` (len 1). Zeros: 7. Correctly identified. Rule: Shorter first -> `[7]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`. Output: `[7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` + 6 zeros.

The analysis confirms the previously derived rules for block identification, ordering (shorter first, preserve order if equal), and zero placement (one separator, rest at the end) hold true for all provided examples. The only necessary change is adapting to the correct input data type.

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Input Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence (list or array of integers)
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains exactly two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, separated and potentially surrounded by zeros.
  - item: Output Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence (list or array of integers)
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains the two non-zero blocks from the input, ordered by length (shorter first, original order if equal), separated by a single zero, followed by all remaining zeros from the input.
objects:
  - object: Digit Block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits found in the input.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit making up the block (e.g., 9, 2, 6).
      - content: The list of digits forming the block (e.g., [9, 9, 9, 9]).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - original_order: The order (first or second) in which the block appears in the input sequence relative to the other non-zero block.
  - object: Zero Digit
    description: The digit '0'.
    properties:
      - count: The total number of zeros present in the input sequence.
actions:
  - action: Identify Blocks
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to find the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits. Record their content (as lists), length, and original order.
  - action: Count Zeros
    description: Count the total occurrences of the digit 0 in the input sequence.
  - action: Compare Lengths
    description: Compare the lengths (number of elements) of the two identified non-zero blocks.
  - action: Order Blocks
    description: Determine the output order of the two blocks. If one block is shorter than the other, place the shorter block first. If they have equal lengths, maintain their original relative order from the input.
  - action: Construct Output
    description: Create the output sequence by concatenating (in order): the first block (based on the ordering rule), a single zero digit `[0]`, the second block, and a sequence containing the remaining zeros (total zero count minus one).
relationships:
  - relationship: Block Ordering Rule
    description: The relative order of the non-zero blocks in the output depends on their lengths.
    rule: Let BlockA be the first block found, BlockB be the second. If length(BlockA) <= length(BlockB), the output order is BlockA, BlockB. Else, the output order is BlockB, BlockA.
  - relationship: Zero Placement Rule
    description: One zero from the input is used as a separator between the reordered non-zero blocks. All other zeros from the input are appended to the very end of the output sequence.
    condition: Requires at least one zero in the input to place a separator. If no zeros exist (not observed in examples), this rule might need adjustment.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (list or array) of digits.
2.  Initialize variables to store the first identified non-zero block (`Block1`), the second identified non-zero block (`Block2`), and the total count of zeros (`zero_count`).
3.  Iterate through the input sequence:
    *   Count each occurrence of the digit 0 and increment `zero_count`.
    *   Identify the first contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits and store it as `Block1`.
    *   Identify the second contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits and store it as `Block2`. (Helper function `find_non_zero_blocks` encapsulates this block identification).
4.  Determine the lengths of `Block1` and `Block2`.
5.  Compare the lengths:
    *   If the length of `Block1` is less than or equal to the length of `Block2`, assign `Block1` to `FirstBlock` and `Block2` to `SecondBlock`.
    *   Otherwise (length of `Block1` is greater than length of `Block2`), assign `Block2` to `FirstBlock` and `Block1` to `SecondBlock`.
6.  Construct the output sequence:
    *   Start with the elements of `FirstBlock`.
    *   Append a single zero (`[0]`) if `zero_count` is greater than 0.
    *   Append the elements of `SecondBlock`.
    *   Append `zero_count - 1` zero digits (ensure this count is not negative if `zero_count` was initially 0).
7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
