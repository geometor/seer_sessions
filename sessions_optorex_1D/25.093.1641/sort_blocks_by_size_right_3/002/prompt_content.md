"""
Identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence.
Orders these blocks based on their length (shorter block first). If lengths are equal,
the original order is preserved.
Constructs the output sequence by concatenating the shorter (or first if equal length) block,
a single zero, the longer (or second if equal length) block, and finally all the remaining
zeros from the input sequence appended at the end.
