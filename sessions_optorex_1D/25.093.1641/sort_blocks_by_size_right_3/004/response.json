            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: find two non-zero blocks, sort them by length (shorter first, maintaining original order if equal), and reconstruct the sequence with one zero separator and remaining zeros at the end.\n\nThe Python code implementing this logic failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error indicates that a NumPy array (likely passed by the testing environment) was used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if some_array:`). This typically happens when checking if an array is \"non-empty\" or \"true\". Standard Python lists evaluate to `False` if empty and `True` if non-empty in boolean contexts, but NumPy arrays require explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()` for such checks.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data type within the `transform` function. Although `input_list = list(input_data)` was used, the error persists, suggesting the issue might be deeper, possibly within the `find_non_zero_blocks` helper function if list appends/manipulations inadvertently involve array types, or if the check `if current_block:` is evaluating an array.\n2.  Modify the code, specifically the `find_non_zero_blocks` function, to explicitly use `len(current_block) > 0` instead of relying on the implicit boolean evaluation `if current_block:`, ensuring compatibility even if `current_block` somehow becomes array-like.\n3.  The core logic described in the previous Natural Language Program and YAML appears correct and consistent with all examples. The failure is an implementation bug, not a misunderstanding of the transformation rule. Therefore, the YAML and NLP will remain largely the same, focusing on the confirmed transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nSince the code failed execution, direct metrics aren't available. Manual analysis of the examples confirms the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input                                      | Output                                   | Block1 (len) | Block2 (len) | Zeros | Shorter First | Output Structure                                  |\n| :------ | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |\n| train_1 | `0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 0`                  | `9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0`                | `[9,9,9,9]` (4) | `[9,9]` (2)   | 6     | Yes (B2)    | `[9,9]`, `0`, `[9,9,9,9]`, `[0]*5`                 |\n| train_2 | `0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2`                  | `2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0`                | `[2,2,2,2]` (4) | `[2,2,2,2]` (4) | 4     | Equal (B1)  | `[2,2,2,2]`, `0`, `[2,2,2,2]`, `[0]*3`                 |\n| train_3 | `0 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0`                  | `6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0`                | `[6,6]` (2)   | `[6,6,6,6,6]` (5)| 5     | Yes (B1)    | `[6,6]`, `0`, `[6,6,6,6,6]`, `[0]*4`                 |\n| train_4 | `7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0`                  | `7 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0`                | `[7,7,7,7]` (4) | `[7]` (1)     | 7     | Yes (B2)    | `[7]`, `0`, `[7,7,7,7]`, `[0]*6`                 |\n| train_5 | `0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0`                  | `2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0`                | `[2,2,2]` (3) | `[2,2,2]` (3) | 6     | Equal (B1)  | `[2,2,2]`, `0`, `[2,2,2]`, `[0]*5`                 |\n| train_6 | `6 6 6 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0`                  | `6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0`                | `[6,6,6]` (3) | `[6,6,6,6]` (4) | 5     | Yes (B1)    | `[6,6,6]`, `0`, `[6,6,6,6]`, `[0]*4`                 |\n| train_7 | `5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0`                  | `5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0`                | `[5,5,5]` (3) | `[5,5]` (2)   | 7     | Yes (B2)    | `[5,5]`, `0`, `[5,5,5]`, `[0]*6`                 |\n\n*Observations Consistency:* All examples adhere to the pattern of having exactly two blocks of identical non-zero digits separated/surrounded by zeros. The output consistently places the shorter block first (maintaining original order if lengths are equal), uses one zero as a separator, and appends the rest.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
