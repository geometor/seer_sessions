Identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits present in the input sequence.\n2. Counts the total number of zero digits in the input sequence.\n3. Orders the two identified non-zero blocks based on their length: the shorter block comes first. \n   If the blocks have equal lengths, their original order (as found in the input) is preserved.\n4. Constructs the output sequence by concatenating:\n   - The first block (according to the ordering rule).\n   - A single zero digit (if any zeros were present in the input).\n   - The second block (according to the ordering rule).\n   - All the remaining zero digits from the input appended at the end.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_zero_blocks(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in a list of integers.\n\n    Args:\n        data: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the two identified blocks, each represented as a list of integers.\n        Returns an empty list if fewer than two blocks are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    current_block = []\n    in_block = False\n    last_digit = -1 # Sentinel value different from 0-9\n\n    for digit in data:\n        if digit != 0:\n            # Handle start of a block or continuation of the current block\n            if not in_block: \n                # Start of a new block\n                in_block = True\n                current_block = [digit]\n                last_digit = digit\n            elif digit == last_digit:\n                # Continue current block\n                current_block.append(digit)\n            else:\n                # Encountered a *different* non-zero digit immediately after another.\n                # This signifies the end of the previous block *and* the start of a new one.\n                # According to observed examples, blocks are separated by zeros,\n                # so this case implies either the end of the first block (if adjacent to a zero later)\n                # or potentially an unexpected input pattern if no zeros separate different non-zero digits.\n                # Let's refine the logic: a block ends when a 0 is seen, or a *different* non-zero digit is seen,\n                # or the end of the list is reached.\n                if current_block: # Store the completed block\n                     blocks.append(list(current_block)) # Use list() for a copy\n                     if len(blocks) == 2: break # Optimization\n                # Start the new block\n                current_block = [digit]\n                last_digit = digit\n                in_block = True # Ensure we are marked as in_block\n\n        elif digit == 0:\n            # A zero marks the end of any active non-zero block\n            if in_block:\n                blocks.append(list(current_block)) # Use list() for a copy\n                if len(blocks) == 2: # Optimization: Stop once two blocks are found\n                     break\n                current_block = []\n                in_block = False\n            last_digit = 0 # Reset last digit tracker (though not strictly needed for block logic)\n\n    # Handle the case where the last block extends to the end of the list\n    if in_block and current_block and len(blocks) < 2:\n         blocks.append(list(current_block)) # Use list() for a copy\n\n    # We expect exactly two blocks based on the problem description and examples\n    if len(blocks) == 2:\n        return blocks\n    else:\n        # Handle potential edge cases or malformed input if necessary.\n        # Returning the found blocks allows the caller to decide how to handle errors.\n        # print(f\"Warning/Error: Found {len(blocks)} non-zero blocks, expected 2 in data: {data}\")\n        # For robustness based on examples, perhaps return only first two if more are found?\n        # Or raise an error?
