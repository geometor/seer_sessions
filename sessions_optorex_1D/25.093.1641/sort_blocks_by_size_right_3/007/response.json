Identifies the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits present in the input sequence. \n   All examples provided contain exactly two such blocks.\n2. Counts the total number of zero ('0') digits in the input sequence.\n3. Determines the output order of the two non-zero blocks based on their length: \n   - The shorter block comes first.\n   - If the blocks have equal lengths, their original order (the order they appeared in the input) is preserved.\n4. Constructs the output sequence by concatenating:\n   - The first block (according to the ordering rule).\n   - A single zero digit, but only if the original input contained at least one zero.\n   - The second block (according to the ordering rule).\n   - All remaining zero digits from the input (total zeros minus the one used as a separator, if applicable) appended at the end.\nThe function expects a NumPy array as input and returns a NumPy array.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_zero_blocks(data: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in a list of integers.\n    Assumes exactly two such blocks exist based on the problem description.\n\n    Args:\n        data: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the two identified blocks, each represented as a list of integers.\n        Returns an empty list or fewer than two blocks if the assumption is violated.\n    \"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    i = 0\n    n = len(data)\n    \n    while i < n and len(blocks) < 2:\n        # Skip leading/intermediate zeros\n        while i < n and data[i] == 0:\n            i += 1\n        \n        # If we haven't reached the end, we've found the start of a non-zero block\n        if i < n:\n            start_index = i\n            block_digit = data[i]\n            \n            # Find the end of the current block of identical non-zero digits\n            while i < n and data[i] == block_digit:\n                i += 1\n                \n            # Add the found block (as a list) to our list of blocks\n            blocks.append(list(data[start_index:i])) # Ensure it's a list\n            \n    # Expecting exactly two blocks based on examples\n    return blocks\n\ndef transform(input_data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input NumPy array of digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert input NumPy array to a Python list for easier block processing\n    input_list = input_data.tolist() \n\n    # Count the total number of zeros in the original input\n    # Use the list for counting as well for consistency here\n    zero_count = input_list.count(0)\n\n    # Find the two non-zero blocks using the helper function\n    blocks = find_non_zero_blocks(input_list)\n\n    # --- Input Validation ---\n    # Check if exactly two blocks were found, as expected from examples.\n    if len(blocks) != 2:\n        # Handle unexpected input format.
