task_elements:
  - item: Input Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains exactly two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, potentially separated and surrounded by zeros.
  - item: Output Data
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - content: single digits (0-9)
      - structure: contains the two non-zero blocks from the input, ordered by length (shorter first), separated by a single zero, followed by all remaining zeros.
objects:
  - object: Digit Block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The digit making up the block (e.g., 9, 2, 6).
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
      - order: Position relative to other blocks in the input (first or second).
  - object: Zero Digit
    description: The digit '0'.
    properties:
      - count: The total number of zeros in the input sequence.
actions:
  - action: Identify Blocks
    description: Find the two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Record their content, length, and original order.
  - action: Collect Zeros
    description: Count and conceptually gather all the zero digits from the input.
  - action: Compare Lengths
    description: Compare the lengths of the two identified non-zero blocks.
  - action: Order Blocks
    description: Determine the output order of the two blocks based on length comparison (shorter block first, preserve original order if lengths are equal).
  - action: Construct Output
    description: Assemble the output sequence by concatenating the ordered first block, a single zero, the ordered second block, and all remaining original zeros.
relationships:
  - relationship: Block Ordering
    description: The relative order of the non-zero blocks in the output depends on their relative lengths in the input.
    rule: If length(Block1) <= length(Block2), output order is Block1, Block2. Else, output order is Block2, Block1.
  - relationship: Zero Placement
    description: One zero separates the two non-zero blocks in the output, and all other original zeros are appended at the end.
