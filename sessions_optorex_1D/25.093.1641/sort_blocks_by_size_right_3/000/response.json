Specifically, the count of each non-zero digit and the count of zeros remain the same overall.\n3.  **Key Digit:** The digit '0' acts as a separator or background element.\n4.  **Non-Zero Structure:** The non-zero digits in the input appear in contiguous blocks of identical digits. All examples show exactly two such blocks.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging these two blocks of non-zero digits and repositioning the zeros.\n6.  **Reordering Rule:** The two non-zero blocks are placed adjacent to each other in the output, separated by a single zero. Their relative order depends on their lengths: the shorter block comes first. If the blocks have equal lengths, their original order is preserved.\n7.  **Zero Placement:** One zero is used as a separator between the two non-zero blocks. All remaining zeros from the input are moved to the end of the output sequence.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
