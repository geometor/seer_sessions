Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Digits:** Each sequence consists of zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (e.g., only 1s and 0s in train\_1, only 3s and 0s in train\_2). This non-zero digit can be considered the 'target' digit for that specific task instance.
3.  **Structure:** The target digits in the input appear in exactly two separate, contiguous blocks (e.g., `1 1 1` and `1` in train\_1; `3 3 3` and `3 3` in train\_2).
4.  **Transformation:** The output is also a sequence of 12 digits containing the same target digit and zeros. The two blocks of the target digit from the input are present in the output, but their positions are changed. They are placed contiguously at the beginning of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions are filled with zeros.
5.  **Ordering:** The key transformation is the rearrangement of the two input blocks. Let's call the block that appears first in the input T1, and the block that appears second T2. The order of T1 and T2 in the output depends on their relative lengths:
    *   If T1 is *longer* than T2, the output starts with T2, then a single 0, then T1.
    *   If T1 is *shorter than or equal to* T2, the output starts with T1, then a single 0, then T2.
6.  **Padding:** After placing the two blocks and the separating zero, the rest of the 12 positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
