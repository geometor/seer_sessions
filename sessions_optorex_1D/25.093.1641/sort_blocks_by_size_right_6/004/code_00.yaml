Input:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integers.
  Format: Can be represented as a string of space-separated digits or a list/array of integers.
  Content: Contains exactly one non-zero digit (the 'target digit') appearing in exactly two distinct, contiguous blocks. The remaining elements are zeros.

Objects:
  - TargetDigit: The single non-zero digit present in the input sequence.
  - Block1 (B1): The first contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered when reading the input from left to right.
    - Property: Length (number of digits).
  - Block2 (B2): The second contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered.
    - Property: Length (number of digits).
  - ZeroSeparator: A single zero digit (0).
  - PaddingZeros: Zero digits (0) used to fill the output sequence to the required length.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Find the TargetDigit in the input sequence.
  2. Locate: Find the start and end indices (or extract the sequences) of Block1 and Block2.
  3. Compare: Compare the lengths of Block1 and Block2.
  4. Rearrange: Construct the beginning of the output sequence based on the comparison:
     - If Length(Block1) > Length(Block2): Output starts with Block2, then ZeroSeparator, then Block1.
     - If Length(Block1) <= Length(Block2): Output starts with Block1, then ZeroSeparator, then Block2.
  5. Pad: Append PaddingZeros to the rearranged sequence until the total length is 12.

Output:
  Type: Sequence of 12 integers.
  Format: Same format possibilities as input (string or list/array).
  Content: Contains the rearranged Block1 and Block2, separated by a single ZeroSeparator, followed by PaddingZeros to reach a total length of 12.
