Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Digits:** Each sequence consists of zeros and repetitions of a single non-zero digit (e.g., only 1s and 0s in train\_1, only 3s and 0s in train\_2). This non-zero digit can be considered the 'target' digit for that specific task instance.
3.  **Structure:** The target digits in the input appear in exactly two separate, contiguous blocks (e.g., `1 1 1` and `1` in train\_1; `3 3 3` and `3 3` in train\_2).
4.  **Transformation:** The output is also a sequence of 12 digits containing the same target digit and zeros. The two blocks of the target digit from the input are present in the output, but their positions are changed. They are placed contiguously at the beginning of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions are filled with zeros.
5.  **Ordering:** The key transformation is the rearrangement of the two input blocks. Let's call the block that appears first in the input T1, and the block that appears second T2. The order of T1 and T2 in the output depends on their relative lengths:
    *   If T1 is *longer* than T2, the output starts with T2, then a single 0, then T1.
    *   If T1 is *shorter than or equal to* T2, the output starts with T1, then a single 0, then T2.
6.  **Padding:** After placing the two blocks and the separating zero, the rest of the 12 positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.

## Documented Facts


```python
import math
import collections

"""
The transformation rule takes a sequence of 12 integers as input. 
This sequence contains exactly two non-overlapping, contiguous blocks of a single non-zero 'target' digit, with the rest being zeros.
The transformation rearranges these two blocks at the beginning of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. 
Let the first block encountered in the input be B1 and the second be B2.
If the length of B1 is strictly greater than the length of B2, the output starts with B2, then a zero, then B1.
Otherwise (if the length of B1 is less than or equal to the length of B2), the output starts with B1, then a zero, then B2.
The remaining positions in the 12-element output sequence are filled with zeros.

## Example 1:

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided information indicates a consistent error across all examples: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This error clearly points to an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the initial `transform` function. The function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but it is actually receiving a NumPy array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is compatible) directly. This involves removing the `input_str.split()` line and using the input array/list as `input_nums`.
2.  **Verify Logic:** The core logic identified (finding two blocks of a target digit, comparing their lengths, and rearranging them with a zero separator at the beginning of the output) appears sound based on manual inspection of the examples. The error was solely in input processing, not the transformation logic itself.
3.  **Confirm with Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically extract the target digit, block identification, block lengths, and the resulting order for each training example to formally verify the logic.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the correct input type (list/array of integers) and solidify the transformation steps.

## Metrics Gathering

We will use code execution to extract key features from each training example to verify the transformation logic.

The metrics confirm that the logic holds for all training examples. The transformation rule based on comparing the lengths of the two blocks and rearranging them correctly predicts the beginning of the output sequence in every case.

## Documented Facts (YAML)


```yaml
InputType: List[int] # Corrected from string
OutputFormat: List[int] # Often represented as space-separated string for display
SequenceLength: 12
Elements:
  - type: Zero (0)
    role: Background/Padding
  - type: TargetDigit (Non-zero integer, e.g., 1, 3, 8)
    role: Signal
    occurrence: Exactly two contiguous, non-overlapping blocks in the input.

Objects:
  - name: InputSequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Integers (0 and one TargetDigit)
  - name: Block1 (B1)
    description: The first contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered in InputSequence.
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - elements: TargetDigit
  - name: Block2 (B2)
    description: The second contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered in InputSequence.
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - elements: TargetDigit
  - name: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Integers (0 and the TargetDigit from input)

Actions:
  1. Identify: Find the non-zero TargetDigit in the InputSequence.
  2. Locate: Find the start and end indices of Block1 and Block2 in the InputSequence.
  3. Extract: Create lists representing Block1 and Block2.
  4. Compare: Determine if the length of Block1 is strictly greater than the length of Block2.
  5. ConstructPrefix:
     - If len(Block1) > len(Block2): OutputPrefix = Block2 + [0] + Block1
     - Else (len(Block1) <= len(Block2)): OutputPrefix = Block1 + [0] + Block2
  6. Pad: Append zeros to the OutputPrefix until the total length is 12.
  7. Format: (If necessary for final output) Convert the list of integers to a space-separated string.

Constraints:
  - Input always contains exactly two blocks of the TargetDigit.
  - Input and Output sequences always have a length of 12.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the input as a list of 12 integers.
2.  **Identify** the single non-zero integer present in the input list; this is the 'target digit'. If the input contains only zeros, return a list of 12 zeros.
3.  **Locate** the two separate, contiguous blocks (sequences) composed entirely of the target digit within the input list. Let the block appearing first be `Block1` and the block appearing second be `Block2`.
4.  **Compare** the lengths (number of elements) of `Block1` and `Block2`.
5.  **Determine** the arrangement:
    *   If the length of `Block1` is *strictly greater* than the length of `Block2`, arrange the blocks as: `Block2`, followed by a single `0`, followed by `Block1`.
    *   Otherwise (if the length of `Block1` is *less than or equal to* the length of `Block2`), arrange the blocks as: `Block1`, followed by a single `0`, followed by `Block2`.
6.  **Construct** the beginning of the output list using the arrangement determined in the previous step.
7.  **Pad** the constructed list with trailing zeros until the total length of the output list is 12.
8.  **Return** the resulting list of 12 integers.
