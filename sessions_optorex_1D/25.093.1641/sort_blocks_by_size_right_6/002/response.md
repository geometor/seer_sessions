## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided information indicates a consistent error across all examples: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This error clearly points to an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the initial `transform` function. The function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but it is actually receiving a NumPy array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is compatible) directly. This involves removing the `input_str.split()` line and using the input array/list as `input_nums`.
2.  **Verify Logic:** The core logic identified (finding two blocks of a target digit, comparing their lengths, and rearranging them with a zero separator at the beginning of the output) appears sound based on manual inspection of the examples. The error was solely in input processing, not the transformation logic itself.
3.  **Confirm with Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically extract the target digit, block identification, block lengths, and the resulting order for each training example to formally verify the logic.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the correct input type (list/array of integers) and solidify the transformation steps.

## Metrics Gathering

We will use code execution to extract key features from each training example to verify the transformation logic.

The metrics confirm that the logic holds for all training examples. The transformation rule based on comparing the lengths of the two blocks and rearranging them correctly predicts the beginning of the output sequence in every case.

## Documented Facts (YAML)


```yaml
InputType: List[int] # Corrected from string
OutputFormat: List[int] # Often represented as space-separated string for display
SequenceLength: 12
Elements:
  - type: Zero (0)
    role: Background/Padding
  - type: TargetDigit (Non-zero integer, e.g., 1, 3, 8)
    role: Signal
    occurrence: Exactly two contiguous, non-overlapping blocks in the input.

Objects:
  - name: InputSequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Integers (0 and one TargetDigit)
  - name: Block1 (B1)
    description: The first contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered in InputSequence.
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - elements: TargetDigit
  - name: Block2 (B2)
    description: The second contiguous sequence of the TargetDigit encountered in InputSequence.
    properties:
      - length: variable
      - elements: TargetDigit
  - name: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Integers (0 and the TargetDigit from input)

Actions:
  1. Identify: Find the non-zero TargetDigit in the InputSequence.
  2. Locate: Find the start and end indices of Block1 and Block2 in the InputSequence.
  3. Extract: Create lists representing Block1 and Block2.
  4. Compare: Determine if the length of Block1 is strictly greater than the length of Block2.
  5. ConstructPrefix:
     - If len(Block1) > len(Block2): OutputPrefix = Block2 + [0] + Block1
     - Else (len(Block1) <= len(Block2)): OutputPrefix = Block1 + [0] + Block2
  6. Pad: Append zeros to the OutputPrefix until the total length is 12.
  7. Format: (If necessary for final output) Convert the list of integers to a space-separated string.

Constraints:
  - Input always contains exactly two blocks of the TargetDigit.
  - Input and Output sequences always have a length of 12.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Receive** the input as a list of 12 integers.
2.  **Identify** the single non-zero integer present in the input list; this is the 'target digit'. If the input contains only zeros, return a list of 12 zeros.
3.  **Locate** the two separate, contiguous blocks (sequences) composed entirely of the target digit within the input list. Let the block appearing first be `Block1` and the block appearing second be `Block2`.
4.  **Compare** the lengths (number of elements) of `Block1` and `Block2`.
5.  **Determine** the arrangement:
    *   If the length of `Block1` is *strictly greater* than the length of `Block2`, arrange the blocks as: `Block2`, followed by a single `0`, followed by `Block1`.
    *   Otherwise (if the length of `Block1` is *less than or equal to* the length of `Block2`), arrange the blocks as: `Block1`, followed by a single `0`, followed by `Block2`.
6.  **Construct** the beginning of the output list using the arrangement determined in the previous step.
7.  **Pad** the constructed list with trailing zeros until the total length of the output list is 12.
8.  **Return** the resulting list of 12 integers.
