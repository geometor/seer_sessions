task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: numpy.ndarray
    role: input_output
    properties:
      - dtype: int (observed as int64)
      - length: constant_across_transformation (observed as 12)

identified_objects:
  - object: zero
    value: 0
    role: padding_element
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero integer digits within the array.
    properties:
      - surrounded_by_zeros (except potentially at the very start/end after transformation)
      - preceded_by_at_least_one_zero_in_input (observed)
      - unique_per_input (observed)
    role: primary_element_for_transformation

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: non_zero_block
    description: Find the start index of the non_zero_block (the index of the first non-zero element).
  - action: locate
    target: preceding_zero
    description: Identify the element at the index immediately before the start index of the non_zero_block.
  - action: condition_check
    description: Verify that the non_zero_block does not start at index 0 and that the preceding element is indeed 0.
  - action: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    precondition: condition_check is true
    mechanism:
      - remove: element at index (start_index - 1) from the array/list.
      - append: integer zero (value 0) to the end of the array/list.
    result: The non_zero_block appears one position earlier in the sequence, maintaining overall sequence length.

relationships:
  - type: position
    element1: non_zero_block
    element2: array
    description: The non_zero_block occupies a contiguous sub-sequence within the main array.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: preceding_zero
    element2: non_zero_block
    description: A zero exists directly before the start of the non_zero_block in the input array.
