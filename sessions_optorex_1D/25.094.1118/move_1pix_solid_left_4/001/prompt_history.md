Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits, represented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   **Zero (`0`):** Acts as a background or padding element.
    *   **Non-Zero Digit Block:** A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `6 6 6`, `5 5 5 5 5`, `8 8`). There appears to be only one such block in each input.
3.  **Relationship:** The non-zero block is always surrounded by zeros in the input, with at least one zero preceding it.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a shift of the non-zero block one position to the left.
5.  **Mechanism:** This left shift is accomplished by removing the zero immediately preceding the non-zero block and appending a zero to the end of the entire sequence. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated digits
    role: input_output
    length: constant_across_transformation

identified_objects:
  - object: zero
    value: 0
    role: padding_element
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - surrounded_by_zeros
      - preceded_by_at_least_one_zero
      - unique_per_input (observed)
    role: primary_element_for_transformation

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: non_zero_block
    description: Find the start and end indices of the non_zero_block.
  - action: locate
    target: preceding_zero
    description: Find the zero immediately before the start index of the non_zero_block.
  - action: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    mechanism:
      - remove: preceding_zero
      - append: zero (value 0) to the end of the sequence
    result: The non_zero_block appears one position earlier in the sequence, maintaining overall sequence length.

relationships:
  - type: position
    element1: non_zero_block
    element2: sequence
    description: The non_zero_block occupies a contiguous subsequence within the main sequence.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: preceding_zero
    element2: non_zero_block
    description: A zero exists directly before the start of the non_zero_block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Convert the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the list. Let this be `first_nonzero_index`.
3.  Identify the index of the zero immediately before this non-zero digit, which is `first_nonzero_index - 1`.
4.  Create a new list by removing the element at index `first_nonzero_index - 1`.
5.  Append a single integer `0` to the end of this modified list.
6.  Convert the resulting list of integers back into a space-separated string for the output.
