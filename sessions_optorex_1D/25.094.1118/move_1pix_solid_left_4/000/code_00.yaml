task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated digits
    role: input_output
    length: constant_across_transformation

identified_objects:
  - object: zero
    value: 0
    role: padding_element
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - surrounded_by_zeros
      - preceded_by_at_least_one_zero
      - unique_per_input (observed)
    role: primary_element_for_transformation

actions:
  - action: locate
    target: non_zero_block
    description: Find the start and end indices of the non_zero_block.
  - action: locate
    target: preceding_zero
    description: Find the zero immediately before the start index of the non_zero_block.
  - action: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    mechanism:
      - remove: preceding_zero
      - append: zero (value 0) to the end of the sequence
    result: The non_zero_block appears one position earlier in the sequence, maintaining overall sequence length.

relationships:
  - type: position
    element1: non_zero_block
    element2: sequence
    description: The non_zero_block occupies a contiguous subsequence within the main sequence.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: preceding_zero
    element2: non_zero_block
    description: A zero exists directly before the start of the non_zero_block.
