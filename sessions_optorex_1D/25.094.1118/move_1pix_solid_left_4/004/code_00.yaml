task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: list_of_integers (derived from space-separated string)
    role: input_output
    properties:
      - length: 12 (consistent across examples)
      - element_type: integer
      - value_range: 0-9 (observed)

identified_objects:
  - object: background_element
    value: 0
    role: padding
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A single, contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits within the sequence.
    properties:
      - identity: All digits within the block are the same non-zero value.
      - contiguity: The digits form an unbroken sequence.
      - uniqueness: Only one such block exists per sequence (observed).
      - location: Always preceded by at least one background_element (value 0) in the input.
    role: subject_of_transformation

actions:
  - action: find_block_start
    target: non_zero_block
    description: Identify the index of the first element of the non_zero_block.
  - action: find_preceding_zero
    target: background_element
    condition: Only if find_block_start index > 0.
    description: Identify the index of the background_element (value 0) immediately before the block_start_index. This index is block_start_index - 1.
  - action: shift_block_left
    target: non_zero_block
    mechanism:
      - step: remove_element
        description: Remove the element at the preceding_zero_index from the sequence.
      - step: append_element
        description: Add a background_element (value 0) to the end of the sequence.
    result: The non_zero_block is effectively shifted one position to the left, and the sequence length is preserved.

relationships:
  - type: position
    element1: non_zero_block
    element2: sequence
    description: The non_zero_block is a sub-sequence located within the main sequence.
  - type: adjacency
    element1: background_element (value 0)
    element2: non_zero_block
    description: A background_element must exist immediately before the non_zero_block in the input sequence for the shift to occur.
  - type: length_conservation
    element1: input_sequence
    element2: output_sequence
    description: The length of the sequence remains unchanged after the transformation.

constraints:
  - The input sequence always contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block in the input is always preceded by at least one zero.
