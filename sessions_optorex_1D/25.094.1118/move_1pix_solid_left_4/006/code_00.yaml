task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    format: 1D array/list of integers
    role: input_output
    properties:
      - length: constant_across_transformation

identified_objects:
  - object: padding_element
    value: 0
    role: filler, shift_mechanic
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: A single contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - value: constant_digit > 0 (preserved during transformation)
      - length: variable (preserved during transformation)
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - input_precondition: start_index > 0 (always preceded by a padding_element)

actions:
  - action: find_block_start
    target: input_sequence
    outputs: start_index
    description: Locate the index of the first non-zero digit.
  - action: conditional_shift
    condition: start_index > 0
    target: input_sequence
    mechanism:
      - step: Define the preceding element's index as `preceding_index = start_index - 1`.
      - step: Remove the element at `preceding_index` from the sequence.
      - step: Append a padding_element (value 0) to the end of the sequence.
    result: A new sequence where the non_zero_block is shifted one position to the left, maintaining overall sequence length.
  - action: identity (else case)
    condition: start_index == 0
    target: input_sequence
    result: The sequence remains unchanged (implied, not observed).

relationships:
  - type: positional_transformation
    element: non_zero_block
    input_property: start_index
    output_property: start_index
    change: decremented by 1 (if input start_index > 0)
  - type: length_conservation
    element: sequence
    property: length
    result: remains constant
  - type: content_conservation
    element: non_zero_block
    properties: [value, length]
    result: remain constant
