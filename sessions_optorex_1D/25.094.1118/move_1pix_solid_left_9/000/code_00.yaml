Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers
  Structure: Linear array/list
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)

Objects:
  - Name: Zero Padding
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Role: Fills space outside the non-zero block
  - Name: Non-Zero Block
    Properties:
      - Digits: Identical non-zero integers (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8)
      - Contiguity: Forms a single continuous segment within the sequence
      - Position: Defined by start and end indices

Relationships:
  - Non-Zero Block is surrounded by Zero Padding.

Actions:
  - Identification: Locate the start and end indices of the Non-Zero Block.
  - Transformation: Shift the identified Non-Zero Block.
  - Modification: Adjust the surrounding Zero Padding to maintain sequence length.

Transformation Rule:
  - Input: Sequence containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - Output: Sequence where the Non-Zero Block is shifted one position to the left.
  - Constraint: The length of the sequence remains constant.
  - Detail: The zero previously to the left of the block moves to the right end of the sequence after the shift.
