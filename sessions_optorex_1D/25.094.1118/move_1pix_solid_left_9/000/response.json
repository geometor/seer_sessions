Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros on either side. The corresponding output sequence shows this block of non-zero digits shifted one position to the left, while maintaining the overall length of the sequence by adjusting the surrounding zeros. The specific non-zero digit (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8) is preserved during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
