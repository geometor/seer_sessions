Data:
  Type: NumPy array of integers (or list of integers)
  Structure: 1-dimensional array
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Length: Fixed (e.g., 12 in examples, but could vary)

Objects:
  - Name: Zero Padding
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Role: Fills space outside the non-zero block
  - Name: Non-Zero Block
    Properties:
      - Digits: Identical non-zero integers (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8)
      - Contiguity: Forms a single continuous segment within the sequence
      - Position: Defined by start and end indices
      - Constraint: Does not start at index 0 (based on examples requiring a left shift)

Relationships:
  - Non-Zero Block is surrounded by Zero Padding.
  - The Non-Zero Block's start index is always greater than 0 in the input.

Actions:
  - Identification: Locate the start index, end index (exclusive), and value of the single contiguous Non-Zero Block.
  - Transformation: Shift the identified Non-Zero Block one position to the left.
  - Modification: Create a new array filled with zeros and place the shifted block into it.

Transformation Rule:
  - Input: A 1D NumPy array containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros. The block does not start at the very beginning (index 0).
  - Output: A new 1D NumPy array of the same length, where the Non-Zero Block is shifted one position to the left compared to its input position. The rest of the array elements are zeros.
  - Constraint: The length of the array remains constant.
