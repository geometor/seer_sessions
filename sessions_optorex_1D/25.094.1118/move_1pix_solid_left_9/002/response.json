            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code failed across all examples with the same error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual format provided during testing (a NumPy array).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers) directly as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_grid = [int(x) for x in input_grid_str.split()]`).\n2.  Ensure the `find_non_zero_block` function works correctly with this array/list input. Based on its implementation, it should already handle list-like or NumPy array inputs correctly.\n3.  Re-validate the core logic (identifying the block and shifting it left) against the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Data Analysis:**\n\nThe crucial metric revealed by the errors is the input data type. The test harness provides NumPy arrays, not strings.\n\nLet's verify the core logic assumptions with an example (`train_1`):\nInput: `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0]` (as a NumPy array)\nLength: 12\n"
