Use a.any() or a.all()`. A detailed review of the `transform` and `find_non_zero_block_indices` functions reveals no obvious internal logic that would cause this specific error when operating on the expected 1D NumPy array inputs. The error typically arises when attempting to use a boolean *array* in a context requiring a single boolean (like an `if` statement). The code's internal checks (`start_index is not None`, `start_index > 0`, comparisons within `find_non_zero_block_indices`) all appear to correctly yield single boolean values. Furthermore, simulation using `tool_code` confirms that the *logic* implemented in the provided functions correctly transforms the inputs to the expected outputs for all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven the discrepancy between the reported error and the code analysis/simulation, the most probable cause of the error lies *outside* the provided code snippet, likely within the testing framework used to compare the function's NumPy array output against the expected output array. Standard Python comparison (`==`) between NumPy arrays produces a boolean array, which cannot be directly used in an `if` condition, leading to the observed `ValueError`.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to:\n1.  Assume the *intended logic* of the provided Python code is correct, as verified by simulation against the examples.\n2.  Document the task's facts and transformation rule based on this correct logic.\n3.  Provide a refined Natural Language Program describing this logic clearly.\n4.  Implicitly signal to the Coder phase that while the core logic seems correct, the integration or comparison within the execution environment likely needs adjustment (e.g., using `np.array_equal()` for comparison instead of `==`).\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered by simulating the execution of the provided Python code's logic against each training example.\n\n"
