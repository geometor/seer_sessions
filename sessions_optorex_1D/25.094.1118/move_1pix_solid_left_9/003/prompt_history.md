Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing sequences (or lists) of single-digit integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros on either side. The corresponding output sequence shows this block of non-zero digits shifted one position to the left, while maintaining the overall length of the sequence by adjusting the surrounding zeros. The specific non-zero digit (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8) is preserved during the transformation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers
  Structure: Linear array/list
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)

Objects:
  - Name: Zero Padding
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Role: Fills space outside the non-zero block
  - Name: Non-Zero Block
    Properties:
      - Digits: Identical non-zero integers (e.g., 7, 5, 9, 8)
      - Contiguity: Forms a single continuous segment within the sequence
      - Position: Defined by start and end indices

Relationships:
  - Non-Zero Block is surrounded by Zero Padding.

Actions:
  - Identification: Locate the start and end indices of the Non-Zero Block.
  - Transformation: Shift the identified Non-Zero Block.
  - Modification: Adjust the surrounding Zero Padding to maintain sequence length.

Transformation Rule:
  - Input: Sequence containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - Output: Sequence where the Non-Zero Block is shifted one position to the left.
  - Constraint: The length of the sequence remains constant.
  - Detail: The zero previously to the left of the block moves to the right end of the sequence after the shift.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Determine its starting and ending indices.
2.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Copy the identified non-zero block from the input sequence into the new sequence, but starting at an index one less than its original starting index.
4.  The resulting sequence, with the block shifted left and zeros adjusted, is the output.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided code failed across all examples with the same error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual format provided during testing (a NumPy array).

The strategy to resolve this is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers) directly as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_grid = [int(x) for x in input_grid_str.split()]`).
2.  Ensure the `find_non_zero_block` function works correctly with this array/list input. Based on its implementation, it should already handle list-like or NumPy array inputs correctly.
3.  Re-validate the core logic (identifying the block and shifting it left) against the examples.

**Metrics and Data Analysis:**

The crucial metric revealed by the errors is the input data type. The test harness provides NumPy arrays, not strings.

Let's verify the core logic assumptions with an example (`train_1`):
Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0]` (as a NumPy array)
Length: 12

The code execution confirms:
1.  The input type is likely `numpy.ndarray`.
2.  The core logic of finding the start/end indices and the value of the non-zero block works as expected for `train_1`.
3.  The logic of shifting the block left by one position (`new_start = start - 1`, `new_end = end - 1`) and creating the output array correctly reproduces the expected output for `train_1` and `train_4`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional array (e.g., NumPy array or list) of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input array. Determine its starting index, ending index (exclusive), and the value of the digits in the block. (It's assumed there's only one such block and its starting index is greater than 0).
3.  Create a new array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 1 from its original starting index.
5.  Calculate the new ending index (exclusive) for the block by subtracting 1 from its original ending index.
6.  Copy the value of the digits from the identified block into the new array, spanning from the calculated new starting index up to (but not including) the new ending index.
7.  Return the newly created array as the output.
