task_description: Transform a 1D array of integers by finding the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting this block one position to the left. The array length remains constant, with zeros filling positions not occupied by the shifted block.

elements:
  - name: integer_array
    type: 1D numpy array of integers
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12)
      - contains: single-digit integers (0-9 observed)
      - role: input and output data structure
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: contiguous sub-sequence within the array
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero integers (e.g., all 2s, all 7s)
      - location: identified by start_index (inclusive) and end_index (exclusive)
      - uniqueness: only the *first* such block encountered from left-to-right is considered.
  - name: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/padding element

actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_block
    input: integer_array
    output: start_index, end_index, block_value
    description: Scans the array from left to right to find the first non-zero element. If found, determines its value and the extent (end_index) of the contiguous block of elements matching that value. Returns None if no non-zero elements exist.
  - name: generate_output_array
    input: original_length
    output: new_integer_array
    description: Creates a new array of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with zeros.
  - name: place_shifted_block
    input: output_array, original_start_index, original_end_index, block_value
    output: modified_output_array
    description: Calculates the new start index (original_start_index - 1) and new end index (original_end_index - 1). Copies the `block_value` into the `output_array` within these new indices. Ensures indices stay within array bounds (implicitly handles shift starting from index 1 to index 0).

relationships:
  - The output array has the same length as the input array.
  - If a non_zero_block is found in the input starting at index `s` and ending at index `e`, the output array will contain the same block value at indices `s-1` to `e-1`.
  - All positions in the output array *not* occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
  - If no non_zero_block exists in the input, the output is identical to the input (or an all-zero array of the same length, consistent with the process).
  - The transformation only affects the *first* identified non-zero block; subsequent blocks or isolated non-zero numbers are ignored.
