*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in all examples).
    *   Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The rest of the elements are zeros.
    *   The output sequence is related to the input sequence by a positional shift of the non-zero block.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Shift the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits one position to the left within a fixed-length list of integers.
    
    elements:
      - name: sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - length: fixed (e.g., 12)
          - contains: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - name: non_zero_block
        type: contiguous sub-sequence
        properties:
          - elements: identical non-zero integers
          - location: surrounded by zeros or list boundaries
      - name: zero
        type: integer
        value: 0
        role: padding element, background element
    
    actions:
      - name: identify_first_non_zero_block
        input: sequence
        output: start_index, end_index, block_value
      - name: shift_left
        input: sequence, start_index, end_index
        output: modified_sequence
        details: Moves the elements from start_index to end_index one position to the left.
      - name: pad_end
        input: sequence
        output: modified_sequence
        details: Appends a zero to the end if necessary to maintain original length after shift.
    
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is a transformation of the input sequence.
      - The non_zero_block in the output sequence starts one position earlier (index-1) than in the input sequence.
      - The length of the input and output sequences is identical.
      - The values within the non_zero_block remain unchanged.
      - The relative order of zeros outside the shifted block is maintained, except for the zero potentially displaced by the shift and the zero added at the end.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input list of integers.
    2.  Find the starting index of the first non-zero element in the list. If no non-zero element exists, return the original list.
    3.  Identify the value of this first non-zero element.
    4.  Determine the end index of the contiguous block of elements that have this same non-zero value, starting from the found starting index.
    5.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initially filled with zeros.
    6.  Copy the identified block of non-zero elements into the new list, starting at an index one less than the original starting index.
    7.  Return the new list.
