            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue appears to be a mismatch between the data structure assumed by the Python code (a 1D list of integers) and the actual data structure likely passed during testing (probably a 2D NumPy array, even if it only has one row, e.g., `[[0, 9, 0, ...]]`). The error \"only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\" strongly suggests an attempt to use a multi-element array in a context expecting a single number, such as a simple `if` condition comparing an array to a scalar.\n\nThe transformation logic described in the initial natural language program seems correct based on a manual check against the examples. The failure is in the implementation's handling of the input data type.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input is a 2D NumPy array (1x12).\n2.  **Adapt Code Logic:** Modify the Python code to correctly handle a 2D NumPy array input. This involves accessing elements using 2D indexing (e.g., `grid[0, i]`) and potentially using NumPy functions for manipulation if beneficial, or converting the relevant row to a list for easier manipulation with `.pop()` and `.append()` and then converting back.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the 2D grid structure accurately.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** All examples appear to represent 1x12 grids (1 row, 12 columns). Although displayed linearly, the error message strongly suggests a 2D structure like a NumPy array `np.array([[...]])`.\n*   **Content:** Each grid contains primarily zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** The rule identified previously holds across all examples:\n    *   Find the column index (`c`) of the first non-zero digit in the row.\n    *   If `c > 0`, the zero at `[0, c-1]` is moved to the end of the row `[0, 11]`.\n    *   All elements from the original `[0, c]` to `[0, 11]` shift one position left.\n    *   If `c == 0`, the grid remains unchanged. (This case is not explicitly shown but is implied).\n*   **Error Source:** The Python error occurred because the code iterated through the input expecting single digits (`digit`) but likely received array-like elements (perhaps the entire row if iterating over a 2D array incorrectly, or NumPy integer types that didn't coerce as expected in the `int()` comparison, although the `int()` cast should have handled the latter). The most probable cause is iterating over `np.array([[...]])` yields the inner list/array `[...]`, which cannot be converted to `int`. The code needs to operate explicitly on the *first row* of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
