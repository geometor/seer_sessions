Data:
  Type: 2D Grid (NumPy Array)
  Dimensions: 1 row x 12 columns
  Element Type: Integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous horizontal block of identical non-zero digits within the single row, surrounded by zero digits.

Objects:
  - Name: Grid
    Properties:
      - rows: 1
      - columns: 12
      - elements: integers
  - Name: BackgroundDigit
    Value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - digits: > 0 (identical within the block)
      - contiguous: true (horizontally)
      - row_index: 0
      - location: start_column_index, end_column_index

Identification:
  - Task: Find the column index of the first non-zero digit in the first (only) row.
  - Alias: first_nz_col_index

Action:
  - Name: Conditional Cyclic Row Shift
  - Condition: The `first_nz_col_index` is greater than 0.
  - Target: The single row of the Grid.
  - Step 1: Identify the element preceding the block (at `[0, first_nz_col_index - 1]`, which is always 0).
  - Step 2: Remove this element from the row.
  - Step 3: Append this element (the 0) to the end of the row.
  - Note: This effectively shifts the block and subsequent elements one position to the left.
  - No Action: If `first_nz_col_index` is 0 or no non-zero element exists (-1).

Result:
  - A new 1x12 Grid reflecting the potentially shifted row elements.
