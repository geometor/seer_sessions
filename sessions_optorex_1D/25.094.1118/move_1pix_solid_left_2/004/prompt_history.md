Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are 1D sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.
*   **Sequence Length:** All examples show sequences of length 12.
*   **Digits:** The digit '0' appears to be a background or empty element. Other digits (2, 3, 4, 8, 9 in the examples) form contiguous blocks.
*   **Structure:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits, preceded and/or followed by zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a shift operation involving the non-zero block and the zero immediately preceding it (if one exists). Specifically, the non-zero block shifts one position to the left, and the zero that was originally to its left moves to the very end of the sequence. If the non-zero block is already at the beginning (index 0), no change occurs (though this case isn't explicitly shown).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Digits (0-9)
  Length: 12
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero digits surrounded by zero digits.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits
  - Name: BackgroundDigit
    Value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - digits: > 0
      - contiguous: true
      - location: start_index, end_index

Identification:
  - Task: Find the start index of the NonZeroBlock.
  - Condition: Check if the start index is greater than 0.

Action:
  - Name: Cyclic Shift Subsequence
  - Target: The subsequence starting from the digit immediately preceding the NonZeroBlock up to the end of the Sequence.
  - Description: The digit preceding the NonZeroBlock is moved to the end of the Sequence. All digits from the start of the NonZeroBlock to the original end of the Sequence shift one position to the left.
  - Condition: Only performed if the NonZeroBlock does not start at index 0.

Result:
  - A new Sequence reflecting the shifted elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Locate the starting index of the first non-zero digit in the sequence. If no non-zero digit exists, or if the first non-zero digit is already at index 0, return the original sequence as the output.
3.  If the first non-zero digit is found at an index greater than 0 (let's call this index `first_nz_index`):
    a.  Take the digit located at `first_nz_index - 1` (which will be '0' based on the examples) and store it temporarily.
    b.  Create a new sequence by taking all digits from the original sequence *except* the one at `first_nz_index - 1`.
    c.  Append the stored digit (from step 3a) to the end of this new sequence.
    d.  Return the resulting sequence as the output.

Takes a sequence of 12 digits containing a single contiguous block of non-zero digits.
If the non-zero block starts at index 0, the sequence is returned unchanged.
Otherwise, the zero digit immediately preceding the non-zero block is moved to the
end of the sequence, and all elements from the start of the non-zero block onwards
are shifted one position to the left to fill the gap.

Transformation Rule:
1. Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`first_nz_index`).

   the sequence remains unchanged.
