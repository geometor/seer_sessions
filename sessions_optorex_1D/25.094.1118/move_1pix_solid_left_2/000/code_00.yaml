Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Digits (0-9)
  Length: 12
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero digits surrounded by zero digits.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits
  - Name: BackgroundDigit
    Value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - digits: > 0
      - contiguous: true
      - location: start_index, end_index

Identification:
  - Task: Find the start index of the NonZeroBlock.
  - Condition: Check if the start index is greater than 0.

Action:
  - Name: Cyclic Shift Subsequence
  - Target: The subsequence starting from the digit immediately preceding the NonZeroBlock up to the end of the Sequence.
  - Description: The digit preceding the NonZeroBlock is moved to the end of the Sequence. All digits from the start of the NonZeroBlock to the original end of the Sequence shift one position to the left.
  - Condition: Only performed if the NonZeroBlock does not start at index 0.

Result:
  - A new Sequence reflecting the shifted elements.
