Other digits (2, 3, 4, 8, 9 in the examples) form contiguous blocks.\n*   **Structure:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero digits, preceded and/or followed by zeros.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a shift operation involving the non-zero block and the zero immediately preceding it (if one exists). Specifically, the non-zero block shifts one position to the left, and the zero that was originally to its left moves to the very end of the sequence. If the non-zero block is already at the beginning (index 0), no change occurs (though this case isn't explicitly shown).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
