InputType: String (Space-separated digits)
OutputType: String (Space-separated digits)
Sequence:
  Type: 1D List or Array of Integers
  Length: 12
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zero elements and exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.

Objects:
  - Name: DigitSequence
    Properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers (derived from input string)
  - Name: BackgroundDigit
    Value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - elements: Identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous: true
      - exists: true (based on examples)
    Identification: Find the start index (`first_nz_index`) of the block.

Identification Logic:
  - Task: Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`first_nz_index`).
  - Check: Determine if `first_nz_index` is greater than 0.

Action:
  - Name: Conditional Cyclic Shift
  - Condition: `first_nz_index` > 0
  - Steps:
      1. Identify the target element: The element at index `first_nz_index - 1` (always 0).
      2. Remove the target element from the sequence.
      3. Append the removed target element to the end of the sequence.
  - Condition: `first_nz_index` <= 0 (i.e., 0 or -1 if no non-zeros found)
  - Steps:
      1. No change is made to the sequence.

Output:
  - The modified (or original, if no change was made) sequence, formatted back into a space-separated string.
