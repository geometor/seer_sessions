*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Both input and output sequences have the same length. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be shifted cyclically to the left by one position.

*   **Facts:**

    task_elements:

    transformation:

      target: input_sequence
      parameter: shift_amount
      parameter_value: 1
      steps:
        - step_1: Identify the first element of the input sequence.
        - step_2: Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second element to the last element of the input sequence.
        - step_3: Append the element identified in step_1 to the end of the sequence created in step_2.
      output: The sequence resulting from step_3.
    relationship:
      - type: sequence_transformation
      - rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the last position and shifting all other elements one position to the left.

**General Assessment:**

The provided results indicate a consistent failure across all training and test examples. The `Transformed Output` consistently matches the `Input`, and differs from the `Expected Output` by exactly two elements ('Pixels Off: 2'). This strongly suggests that the code (`code_00.py`) used to generate the `Transformed Output` in the test run did not correctly implement the intended transformation; instead, it appears to have returned the input sequence unchanged.

Comparing the `Input` sequences with the `Expected Output` sequences confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation is a left cyclic shift by one position. The element at index 0 moves to index 11, and all other elements shift one position to the left. The '2 pixels off' metric arises naturally when comparing the original input to the correctly shifted output.

The strategy is to maintain the original hypothesis of a left cyclic shift, as it correctly describes the relationship between the `Input` and `Expected Output` pairs. The previously documented facts and natural language program remain valid. The error was in the execution/implementation during testing, not in the understanding of the task's goal.

**Metrics:**

Code execution was used to confirm the difference between the `Input` (reported as `Transformed Output` in the results) and the `Expected Output` for each example.
