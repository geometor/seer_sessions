task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: integer elements (including 0 and other single digits)
transformation:
  action: left_cyclic_shift
  target: input_sequence
  parameter: shift_amount
  parameter_value: 1
  steps:
    - step_1: Identify the element at the first position (index 0) of the input sequence.
    - step_2: Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second position (index 1) to the last position (index 11) of the input sequence.
    - step_3: Append the element identified in step_1 to the end of the sequence created in step_2.
  output: The sequence resulting from step_3.
relationship:
  - type: sequence_transformation
  - rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the last position and shifting all other elements one position to the left.
