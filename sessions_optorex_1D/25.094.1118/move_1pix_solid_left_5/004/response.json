            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided results indicate a consistent failure across all training and test examples. The `Transformed Output` consistently matches the `Input`, and differs from the `Expected Output` by exactly two elements ('Pixels Off: 2'). This strongly suggests that the code (`code_00.py`) used to generate the `Transformed Output` in the test run did not correctly implement the intended transformation; instead, it appears to have returned the input sequence unchanged.\n\nComparing the `Input` sequences with the `Expected Output` sequences confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation is a left cyclic shift by one position. The element at index 0 moves to index 11, and all other elements shift one position to the left. The '2 pixels off' metric arises naturally when comparing the original input to the correctly shifted output.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the original hypothesis of a left cyclic shift, as it correctly describes the relationship between the `Input` and `Expected Output` pairs. The previously documented facts and natural language program remain valid. The error was in the execution/implementation during testing, not in the understanding of the task's goal.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nCode execution was used to confirm the difference between the `Input` (reported as `Transformed Output` in the results) and the `Expected Output` for each example.\n\n"
