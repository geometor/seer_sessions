*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Both input and output sequences have the same length. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the sequence seems to be shifted cyclically to the left by one position.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - length: 12
          - contains: integer elements (including 0 and other digits)
    transformation:
      action: left_cyclic_shift
      target: input_sequence
      parameter: shift_amount
      parameter_value: 1
      steps:
        - step_1: Identify the first element of the input sequence.
        - step_2: Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second element to the last element of the input sequence.
        - step_3: Append the element identified in step_1 to the end of the sequence created in step_2.
      output: The sequence resulting from step_3.
    relationship:
      - type: sequence_transformation
      - rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the last position and shifting all other elements one position to the left.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Perform a left cyclic shift on the sequence by one position:
        *   Take the element at the first position (index 0).
        *   Shift all elements from the second position (index 1) to the last position (index 11) one position to the left (e.g., the element at index 1 moves to index 0, index 2 moves to index 1, and so on).
        *   Place the original first element at the last position (index 11).
    3.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
