task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray (or list of integers)
      - length: 12
      - contains: integer elements
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (or numpy.ndarray) # Assumed return type from transform
      - length: 12
      - contains: integer elements derived from input
transformation:
  action: left_cyclic_shift
  target: input_sequence
  parameter: shift_amount
  parameter_value: 1
  steps:
    - step_1: Receive the input sequence (as numpy.ndarray or list).
    - step_2: If the sequence is not empty, identify the first element (at index 0).
    - step_3: Create a new sequence containing all elements from the second element (index 1) to the end.
    - step_4: Append the element identified in step_2 to the end of the sequence created in step_3.
    - step_5: If the sequence is empty, return an empty sequence.
  output: The sequence resulting from step_4 (or step_5).
relationship:
  - type: sequence_transformation
  - rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the last position and shifting all other elements one position to the left. The data type for input/output within the core transform function is expected to be array-like (list or ndarray), not string.
