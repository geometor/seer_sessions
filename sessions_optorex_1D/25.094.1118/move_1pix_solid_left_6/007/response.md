"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of 12 digits by finding a single contiguous block 
of identical non-zero digits and shifting this entire block one position to the 
left. Positions outside the shifted block are filled with zeros.

1.  Accept the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the input array.
3.  If no non-zero elements are found, return a NumPy array of 12 zeros.
4.  Otherwise, determine the start index (the minimum non-zero index) and the 
    end index (the maximum non-zero index) of the contiguous block.
5.  Calculate the new start index for the block in the output array by 
    subtracting 1 from the original start index.
6.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same size (12 elements), 
    initialized with zeros.
7.  Extract the block of non-zero digits from the input array (using slicing 
    from the original start index to the original end index, inclusive).
8.  Copy this extracted block into the output array, starting at the 
    calculated new start index.
9.  Return the resulting output NumPy array.
