**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 single digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this entire block of non-zero digits one position to the left. The positions outside the shifted block are filled with zeros.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Length: 12
  Format: Space-separated string
Input_Properties:
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
Output_Properties:
  - Same length as input (12).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 1 position
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions.
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence elements, specifically a leftward shift of the non-zero block.
  - The length of the non-zero block remains constant.
  - The value of the non-zero digits remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list or array of 12 integer digits.
2.  Identify the start index and the end index of the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the input list.
3.  Create a new output list of 12 elements, initialized with zeros.
4.  Copy the sequence of non-zero digits (from the identified start index to the end index in the input list) into the output list, starting at the position `start_index - 1`.
5.  Format the output list back into a space-separated string of digits.
