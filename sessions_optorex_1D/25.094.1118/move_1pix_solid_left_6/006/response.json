            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error report consistently shows `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function in the previous code (a string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process a NumPy array as input.\n2.  Remove the string parsing (`parse_input`) and formatting (`format_output`) steps, as they are no longer necessary.\n3.  Adapt the logic for finding the non-zero block to use NumPy functions (`np.where`).\n4.  Update the block copying mechanism to use NumPy array slicing and assignment.\n5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the NumPy array data structure.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe core logic (shifting the non-zero block left by one) appears correct based on the examples. The main metrics to confirm are the input/output types and the block positioning.\n\nInput Type: `numpy.ndarray`\nInput Shape: `(12,)`\nOutput Type: `numpy.ndarray`\nOutput Shape: `(12,)`\n\nLet's verify the block start/end indices and the shift for a couple of examples:\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Non-zero indices: `[2 3]` -> `start=2`, `end=3`\n    *   Shifted start: `2 - 1 = 1`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Matches example output structure)\n*   **train_6:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]`\n    *   Non-zero indices: `[4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]` -> `start=4`, `end=11`\n    *   Shifted start: `4 - 1 = 3`\n    *   Expected Output: `[0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0]` (Matches example output structure)\n\nThe assumption that the input contains *exactly one* contiguous block of identical non-zero digits surrounded by zeros holds for all examples. The transformation consistently shifts this block one position to the left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
