**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error report consistently shows `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function in the previous code (a string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array).

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process a NumPy array as input.
2.  Remove the string parsing (`parse_input`) and formatting (`format_output`) steps, as they are no longer necessary.
3.  Adapt the logic for finding the non-zero block to use NumPy functions (`np.where`).
4.  Update the block copying mechanism to use NumPy array slicing and assignment.
5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the NumPy array data structure.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The core logic (shifting the non-zero block left by one) appears correct based on the examples. The main metrics to confirm are the input/output types and the block positioning.

Input Type: `numpy.ndarray`
Input Shape: `(12,)`
Output Type: `numpy.ndarray`
Output Shape: `(12,)`

Let's verify the block start/end indices and the shift for a couple of examples:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Non-zero indices: `[2 3]` -> `start=2`, `end=3`
    *   Shifted start: `2 - 1 = 1`
    *   Expected Output: `[0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Matches example output structure)
*   **train_6:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]`
    *   Non-zero indices: `[4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]` -> `start=4`, `end=11`
    *   Shifted start: `4 - 1 = 3`
    *   Expected Output: `[0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0]` (Matches example output structure)

The assumption that the input contains *exactly one* contiguous block of identical non-zero digits surrounded by zeros holds for all examples. The transformation consistently shifts this block one position to the left.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: NumPy Array
  Elements: Integers (0-9)
  Shape: (12,)
Input_Properties:
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
  - The first element (index 0) is always zero in the examples.
Output_Properties:
  - Same shape as input (12,).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift Left
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits within the NumPy array.
  Magnitude: 1 position (index decreases by 1).
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions, including the position vacated at the right end of the original block and potentially the last element if the block reached the end.
Relationships:
  - The output array is derived from the input array by relocating the non-zero block.
  - The length and value of the non-zero block remain constant.
  - The start index of the block in the output is `input_start_index - 1`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the input array.
3.  If no non-zero elements are found, return a NumPy array of 12 zeros.
4.  Otherwise, determine the start index (the minimum non-zero index) and the end index (the maximum non-zero index) of the contiguous block.
5.  Calculate the new start index for the block in the output array by subtracting 1 from the original start index.
6.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same size (12 elements), initialized with zeros.
7.  Extract the block of non-zero digits from the input array (using slicing from the original start index to the original end index, inclusive).
8.  Copy this extracted block into the output array, starting at the calculated new start index.
9.  Return the resulting output NumPy array.
