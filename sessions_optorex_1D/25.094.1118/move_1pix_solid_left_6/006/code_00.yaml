Data:
  Type: NumPy Array
  Elements: Integers (0-9)
  Shape: (12,)
Input_Properties:
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
  - The first element (index 0) is always zero in the examples.
Output_Properties:
  - Same shape as input (12,).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift Left
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits within the NumPy array.
  Magnitude: 1 position (index decreases by 1).
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions, including the position vacated at the right end of the original block and potentially the last element if the block reached the end.
Relationships:
  - The output array is derived from the input array by relocating the non-zero block.
  - The length and value of the non-zero block remain constant.
  - The start index of the block in the output is `input_start_index - 1`.
