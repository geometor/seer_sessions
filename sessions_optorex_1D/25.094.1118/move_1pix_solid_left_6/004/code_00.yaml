Data:
  Structure: Sequence
  Element_Type: Integer Digit (0-9)
  Representation: Space-separated string
  Length: Fixed at 12 elements

Input_Pattern:
  - Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - This block is padded on both sides by zero digits.
  - The starting index of the block is always >= 1 (never at the very beginning).

Output_Pattern:
  - Same length as input (12).
  - Contains the same non-zero block (identical value and length) as the input.
  - The block's starting position is shifted exactly one index to the left compared to the input.
  - All other positions are filled with zero digits.

Transformation:
  Operation: Left Shift
  Object: The single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  Shift_Magnitude: 1 position.
  Boundary_Condition: Based on examples, the shift always results in a valid start index (>= 0) and the block fits within the 12-element sequence.
  Padding: Positions outside the shifted block become zero.

Invariants:
  - Sequence length (12)
  - Non-zero digit value within the block
  - Length of the non-zero block
