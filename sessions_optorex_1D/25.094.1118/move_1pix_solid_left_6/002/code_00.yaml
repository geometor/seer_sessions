Data:
  Type: Sequence / Array
  Elements: Single digits (0-9) as integers
  Length: 12
  Format: 1D NumPy array
Input_Properties:
  - NumPy array of integers.
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
Output_Properties:
  - Same length and type as input (1D NumPy array of 12 integers).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits within the NumPy array
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 1 position index
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions in the output array.
Relationships:
  - The output array contains the same non-zero elements as the input array, shifted.
  - The length of the non-zero block remains constant.
  - The value of the non-zero digits remains constant.
Implementation_Note:
  - Input is handled directly as a NumPy array; string parsing is not required.
