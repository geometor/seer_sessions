            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) in the `parse_input` function and the actual input type received during testing (NumPy array). The core logic described in the initial natural language program (identify non-zero block, shift left by one) appears consistent with the examples, but the implementation needs to handle NumPy arrays directly instead of attempting string manipulation.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the transformation function to accept a NumPy array as input, eliminate the string parsing step, and use NumPy operations to find the non-zero block and perform the shift.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the consistent error type across all examples and the simulation performed, the following metrics are relevant:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The `transform` function received a `numpy.ndarray` instead of the expected `str`.\n*   **Input Shape:** The NumPy array is one-dimensional (e.g., `(12,)` for the examples provided).\n*   **Input Data Type:** The elements within the array are integers (e.g., `int64`).\n*   **Error Consistency:** The `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in 100% of the test cases (7 train, 1 test shown), confirming the input type issue is systematic.\n*   **Core Logic Applicability:** The logic of finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by one position remains valid for all provided input/output pairs, despite the implementation error. The simulation confirms NumPy can be used to achieve this.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
