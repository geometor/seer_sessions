**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 single digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this entire block of non-zero digits one position to the left. The positions outside the shifted block are filled with zeros.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Single digits (0-9)
  Length: 12
  Format: Space-separated string
Input_Properties:
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
Output_Properties:
  - Same length as input (12).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 1 position
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions.
Relationships:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence elements, specifically a leftward shift of the non-zero block.
  - The length of the non-zero block remains constant.
  - The value of the non-zero digits remains constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list or array of 12 integer digits.
2.  Identify the start index and the end index of the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the input list.
3.  Create a new output list of 12 elements, initialized with zeros.
4.  Copy the sequence of non-zero digits (from the identified start index to the end index in the input list) into the output list, starting at the position `start_index - 1`.
5.  Format the output list back into a space-separated string of digits.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) in the `parse_input` function and the actual input type received during testing (NumPy array). The core logic described in the initial natural language program (identify non-zero block, shift left by one) appears consistent with the examples, but the implementation needs to handle NumPy arrays directly instead of attempting string manipulation.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the transformation function to accept a NumPy array as input, eliminate the string parsing step, and use NumPy operations to find the non-zero block and perform the shift.

**Metrics:**

Based on the consistent error type across all examples and the simulation performed, the following metrics are relevant:

*   **Input Type:** The `transform` function received a `numpy.ndarray` instead of the expected `str`.
*   **Input Shape:** The NumPy array is one-dimensional (e.g., `(12,)` for the examples provided).
*   **Input Data Type:** The elements within the array are integers (e.g., `int64`).
*   **Error Consistency:** The `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in 100% of the test cases (7 train, 1 test shown), confirming the input type issue is systematic.
*   **Core Logic Applicability:** The logic of finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by one position remains valid for all provided input/output pairs, despite the implementation error. The simulation confirms NumPy can be used to achieve this.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence / Array
  Elements: Single digits (0-9) as integers
  Length: 12
  Format: 1D NumPy array
Input_Properties:
  - NumPy array of integers.
  - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - The non-zero block is surrounded by zeros (padding).
Output_Properties:
  - Same length and type as input (1D NumPy array of 12 integers).
  - Contains the same non-zero block as the input.
  - The non-zero block's starting position is shifted one index to the left compared to the input.
  - Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
Transformation:
  Action: Shift
  Object: Contiguous block of non-zero digits within the NumPy array
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 1 position index
  Padding: Zeros fill the remaining positions in the output array.
Relationships:
  - The output array contains the same non-zero elements as the input array, shifted.
  - The length of the non-zero block remains constant.
  - The value of the non-zero digits remains constant.
Implementation_Note:
  - Input is handled directly as a NumPy array; string parsing is not required.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the indices of all non-zero elements in the input array.
3.  Determine the start index (the minimum non-zero index) and the end index (the maximum non-zero index) of the contiguous block. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist (though not expected based on examples).
4.  Calculate the new start index for the block in the output array by subtracting 1 from the original start index. Ensure the new start index is not less than 0.
5.  Create a new output NumPy array of the same size (12 elements), initialized with zeros.
6.  Extract the block of non-zero digits from the input array (from the original start index to the original end index, inclusive).
7.  Copy this extracted block into the output array, starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure copying does not exceed the array bounds.
8.  Return the resulting output NumPy array.
