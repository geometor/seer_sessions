            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The previous execution failed because the `transform` function received NumPy arrays as input, while the code was written assuming string inputs based on the visual representation in the problem description. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` directly points to this type mismatch.\n    *   The core logic identified previously \u2013 a left shift of the sequence by one position, discarding the first element and appending a zero at the end \u2013 appears consistent across all provided training examples when comparing the input and output arrays visually.\n    *   The strategy is to correct the implementation to work directly with NumPy arrays, eliminating the string parsing and formatting steps, and applying the shift operation using array slicing and appending.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Based on the runtime error, the input to the `transform` function is consistently a `numpy.ndarray`.\n    *   **Input Shape:** All provided input examples represent 1-dimensional arrays of length 12.\n    *   **Data Type:** The elements within the arrays are integers.\n    *   **Transformation Consistency:** A simulation using NumPy array slicing (`input_array[1:]`) followed by appending a zero (`np.append(..., 0)`) correctly reproduces the output for the tested examples (train_1, train_2, train_6), confirming the left-shift logic holds for array inputs.\n    *   **Output Type:** The expected output is also a `numpy.ndarray` of the same shape and data type as the input.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
