*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).
    *   The sequences primarily consist of zeros (`0`).
    *   Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the entire sequence appears to be shifted one position to the left. The element originally at index 0 is removed, and a zero (`0`) is appended to the end of the sequence to maintain the fixed length.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Shift a sequence of integers one position to the left, discarding the first element and appending a zero at the end.
    input_format: A string containing space-separated integers.
    output_format: A string containing space-separated integers.
    input_structure:
      type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      length: fixed (e.g., 12)
      properties: Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers surrounded by zeros.
    output_structure:
      type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      length: fixed (same as input)
      properties: Represents the input sequence after a left shift operation.
    transformation:
      action: left_shift
      target: the entire sequence
      details:
        - remove the element at index 0
        - shift all remaining elements one position to the left (index i becomes index i-1)
        - append a zero element at the last index
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying the left shift operation.
      - The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
    2.  Remove the first element (at index 0) from the list.
    3.  Append a single integer `0` to the end of the list.
    4.  Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous execution failed because the `transform` function received NumPy arrays as input, while the code was written assuming string inputs based on the visual representation in the problem description. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` directly points to this type mismatch.
    *   The core logic identified previously – a left shift of the sequence by one position, discarding the first element and appending a zero at the end – appears consistent across all provided training examples when comparing the input and output arrays visually.
    *   The strategy is to correct the implementation to work directly with NumPy arrays, eliminating the string parsing and formatting steps, and applying the shift operation using array slicing and appending.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** Based on the runtime error, the input to the `transform` function is consistently a `numpy.ndarray`.
    *   **Input Shape:** All provided input examples represent 1-dimensional arrays of length 12.
    *   **Data Type:** The elements within the arrays are integers.
    *   **Transformation Consistency:** A simulation using NumPy array slicing (`input_array[1:]`) followed by appending a zero (`np.append(..., 0)`) correctly reproduces the output for the tested examples (train_1, train_2, train_6), confirming the left-shift logic holds for array inputs.
    *   **Output Type:** The expected output is also a `numpy.ndarray` of the same shape and data type as the input.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input 1-dimensional NumPy array.
    2.  Create a new array by slicing the input array, starting from the element at index 1 and including all subsequent elements up to the end.
    3.  Append a single integer element with the value `0` to the end of the sliced array.
    4.  Return the resulting array.
