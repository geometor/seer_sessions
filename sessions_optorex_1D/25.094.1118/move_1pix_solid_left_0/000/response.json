When the block shifts left, the zero immediately preceding the block is effectively consumed or overwritten, and a new zero appears at the end of the sequence to maintain the overall length.\n*   **Invariant:** The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output. The non-zero digits themselves and their order within the block remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
