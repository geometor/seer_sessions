Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is a positional shift of this non-zero block.
*   **Direction:** The non-zero block consistently shifts one position to the left.
*   **Padding:** Zeros act as padding or background. When the block shifts left, the zero immediately preceding the block is effectively consumed or overwritten, and a new zero appears at the end of the sequence to maintain the overall length.
*   **Invariant:** The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output. The non-zero digits themselves and their order within the block remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: sequence
    output: start_index, end_index, value
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non-zero block.
  - name: shift_left
    input: sequence, non_zero_block
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Shift the identified non_zero_block one position to the left within the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [non_zero_block, zero]
    description: The non_zero_block is preceded and followed by zeros in the input (except possibly at sequence boundaries, though examples show internal blocks).
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The non_zero_block in the input_sequence is shifted one position left to produce the output_sequence, maintaining sequence length by adding a zero at the end.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Determine its starting index.
2.  **Check** if the starting index is greater than 0 (i.e., the block is not at the very beginning of the sequence).
3.  If the starting index is greater than 0:
    a.  **Remove** the element (which will be a zero) at the index immediately preceding the start of the block (start\_index - 1).
    b.  **Append** a zero (`0`) to the end of the resulting sequence.
4.  If the starting index is 0 (or if no non-zero block is found), return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  **Return** the modified sequence.
