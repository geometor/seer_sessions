"""
Transforms an input sequence (list of integers) by identifying the first contiguous block
of identical non-zero integers. If this block starts at an index greater than 0,
it is shifted one position to the left. This shift is achieved by effectively
removing the element (expected to be zero) immediately preceding the block and
appending a zero to the end of the sequence, maintaining its original length.
If no non-zero block is found, or if the block starts at index 0, the original
sequence is returned unchanged (as a new list).
