task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers one position to the left within a sequence of fixed length, padding with zeros.
task_elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    role: input_output_container
    properties:
      - length: 12 # Observed in all examples
      - length_invariant: true
      - contains_zeros: true
      - contains_single_non_zero_block: true # Based on examples
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    role: object_of_interest
    properties:
      - elements_are_identical: true
      - elements_are_non_zero: true
      - surrounded_by_zeros_or_boundary: true # Can touch start/end
  - name: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: padding_background
actions:
  - name: find_block
    input: sequence
    output: start_index, end_index
    description: Find the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indices of the contiguous non-zero block.
  - name: shift_block_left
    input: sequence, start_index, end_index
    output: modified_sequence
    condition: start_index > 0
    description: Create a new sequence of the same length, initially all zeros. Place the identified block (from start_index to end_index of the input) into the new sequence starting at index (start_index - 1).
  - name: copy_sequence
    input: sequence, start_index
    output: copied_sequence
    condition: start_index == 0 or block not found
    description: If the block starts at index 0 or no block exists, return an unchanged copy of the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [non_zero_block, zero]
    description: Zeros occupy positions outside the non_zero_block.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: If the non_zero_block in the input_sequence starts after index 0, the output_sequence is generated by placing the block one position earlier in a zero-padded sequence of the same length. Otherwise, the output_sequence is a copy of the input_sequence.
