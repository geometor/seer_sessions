      - expected_format: Python list or NumPy array of integers. # Added clarity on format

    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: padding_or_separator
actions:
  - name: find_block
    input: sequence (list of integers)
    output: start_index, end_index # end_index is exclusive
    description: Identify the start and end indices of the first contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers. Returns (None, None) if no such block is found.
  - name: shift_block_left
    input: sequence (list of integers)
    output: modified_sequence (new list)
    condition: A non_zero_block exists and its start_index is greater than 0.
    description: |-
      Constructs a new sequence by:
      1. Taking elements from the original sequence up to (but not including) the index before the block (index `start_index - 1`).
      2. Appending the `non_zero_block` itself.
      3. Appending the elements from the original sequence that came *after* the block (from `end_index` onwards).
      4. Appending a single `0` to the end.
      This effectively removes the element at `start_index - 1` and adds a `0` at the end, shifting the block left.
  - name: handle_no_shift_case
    input: sequence (list of integers)
    output: original_sequence_copy (new list)
    condition: No non_zero_block is found, or the block starts at index 0.
    description: Returns a copy of the original input sequence without modification.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [non_zero_block, zero]
    description: In inputs where shifting occurs, the non_zero_block is preceded by at least one zero.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: Apply `shift_block_left` if its condition is met; otherwise, apply `handle_no_shift_case`.
constraints:
  - item: sequence_length
    value: constant (preserved in output)
  - item: block_content
    value: preserved (the non-zero digits and their order within the block do not change)
  - item: shift_amount
    value: 1 position
  - item: shift_direction
    value: left
  - item: input_structure
    value: A single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers, surrounded by zeros.
