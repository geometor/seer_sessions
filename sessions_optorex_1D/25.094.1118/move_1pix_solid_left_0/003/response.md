"""
Identifies a unique, contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within an input sequence (list or NumPy array).
If this block starts at an index greater than 0, it is shifted one position to the left.
This shift is achieved by removing the element (expected to be zero) immediately preceding the block
and appending a zero to the end of the sequence to maintain its original length.
If no non-zero block is found, or if the block starts at index 0, the original sequence is returned unchanged.
