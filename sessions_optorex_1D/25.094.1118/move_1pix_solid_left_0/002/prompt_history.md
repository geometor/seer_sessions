Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Feature:** Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation observed across all examples is a positional shift of this non-zero block.
*   **Direction:** The non-zero block consistently shifts one position to the left.
*   **Padding:** Zeros act as padding or background. When the block shifts left, the zero immediately preceding the block is effectively consumed or overwritten, and a new zero appears at the end of the sequence to maintain the overall length.
*   **Invariant:** The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output. The non-zero digits themselves and their order within the block remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Determine its starting index.
2.  **Check** if the starting index is greater than 0 (i.e., the block is not at the very beginning of the sequence).
3.  If the starting index is greater than 0:
    a.  **Remove** the element (which will be a zero) at the index immediately preceding the start of the block (start\_index - 1).
    b.  **Append** a zero (`0`) to the end of the resulting sequence.
4.  If the starting index is 0 (or if no non-zero block is found), return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  **Return** the modified sequence.

Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in the input list.
If the block starts at an index greater than 0, shift the block one position to the left
by removing the zero immediately preceding it and appending a zero to the end of the list.
If the block starts at index 0 or no non-zero block is found, return the list unchanged.
