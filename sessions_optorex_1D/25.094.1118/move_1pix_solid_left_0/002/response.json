            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed on all examples with a NumPy-specific error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This indicates that the `transform` function, although designed using list logic, was likely passed NumPy arrays by the testing environment. The core transformation logic (identifying a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it one position left by removing the preceding zero and appending a zero) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs, perhaps by converting them to standard Python lists at the beginning of the function. This ensures the subsequent list-based logic operates on the expected data type, resolving the ambiguity error. The underlying pattern recognition and transformation rule remain valid.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-analyze the examples to confirm the pattern and check for edge cases, assuming the inputs might be NumPy arrays but represent the same sequences.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `[0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block `[5 5 5]` starts at index 2.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 1 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 2:** `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0]`\n    *   Block `[9]` starts at index 11.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 10 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 3:** `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block `[1]` starts at index 6.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 5 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 4:** `[0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block `[2 2]` starts at index 5.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 4 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 5:** `[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0]`\n    *   Block `[5 5 5 5 5 5]` starts at index 6.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 5 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 6:** `[0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0]` -> `[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block `[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]` starts at index 2.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 1 (0), append 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 7:** `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0]`\n    *   Block `[2 2 2 2 2]` starts at index 7.\n    *   Shift left: Remove element at index 6 (0), append 0. Correct.\n\nThe pattern holds consistently. The only implicit assumption is that there is always *at least one* zero before the block if the block is not at the very beginning. All examples satisfy this. The code correctly handles the case where the block might start at index 0 (no shift occurs), though no such example was provided in the training set.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
