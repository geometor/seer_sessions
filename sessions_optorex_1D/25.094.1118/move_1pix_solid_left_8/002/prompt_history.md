*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are linear sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   All provided examples have sequences of length 12.
    *   The core operation appears to be a shift of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Specifically, the elements seem to shift one position to the left.
    *   The element originally at the beginning (index 0) of the input sequence is discarded.
    *   A '0' digit is appended to the end of the sequence to maintain the original length.
    *   The values of the digits that are shifted remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Perform a left shift on the sequence by one position:
        a.  Discard the digit located at the first position (index 0).
        b.  Append a digit '0' to the end of the sequence.
    3.  Return the modified sequence as the output.
```python
import re

"""
Transforms an input sequence of space-separated digits by performing a left 
shift by one position. The digit at the first position (index 0) is discarded, 
and a digit '0' is appended to the end of the sequence to maintain the
