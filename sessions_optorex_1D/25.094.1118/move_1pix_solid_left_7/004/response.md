**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core error reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") across all examples points to a type mismatch or dimensionality issue during the execution of the provided NumPy code. It suggests the `transform` function is not receiving the input as a flat, 1D NumPy array of integers as intended by its signature (`input_grid: np.ndarray`). Instead, it might be receiving an array containing a single string, or a multi-dimensional array, causing comparisons like `digit != 0` to fail.

However, the underlying logic of the transformation—identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and swapping it with the single preceding zero—appears correct based on a manual trace and analysis of the input/output pairs.

The strategy is to refine the description of the task, assuming the input *will* be correctly parsed into a 1D integer array before the core logic is applied. The YAML facts and natural language program will be updated to reflect this assumption and clearly define the objects and actions based on a 1D integer array context. The coder phase must then ensure this input parsing happens correctly.

**Metrics**

Based on analyzing the examples as 1D sequences of integers:

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   All sequences have a length of 12.
*   Input and output lengths are always identical.
*   The number of zeros and non-zeros is conserved.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
*   This block is always preceded by at least one zero.
*   The transformation consistently swaps the non-zero block with the zero immediately preceding it.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
Task: Swap Non-Zero Block with Preceding Zero

Input:
  Type: Sequence (assumed 1D array/list of integers)
  Element_Type: Integer (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zeros and exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  Constraint: The non-zero block is guaranteed to be preceded by at least one zero element.

Output:
  Type: Sequence (same type as input)
  Structure: Permutation of the input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The 1D list or array of integers.
  - ZeroElement: An element with value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Contiguous sub-sequence within the main Sequence.
      Property: All elements are identical and greater than 0.
      Location: Defined by a start_index and end_index.
      Uniqueness: Only one such block exists per input sequence.
  - PrecedingZero:
      Type: A ZeroElement.
      Location: Its index is `start_index - 1`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the NonZeroBlock.
      Existence: Guaranteed by input constraints.

Relationships:
  - Positional: PrecedingZero is immediately before NonZeroBlock in the input.
  - Composition: Input Sequence = [Elements before PrecedingZero] + [PrecedingZero] + [NonZeroBlock] + [Elements after NonZeroBlock]
  - Transformation: Output Sequence = [Elements before PrecedingZero] + [NonZeroBlock] + [PrecedingZero] + [Elements after NonZeroBlock]
  - Invariance: Length, count of zeros, count of non-zeros, and the specific non-zero digit value remain unchanged.

Actions:
  - Find_Block: Identify the start index (`s`) and end index (`e`) of the unique NonZeroBlock.
  - Identify_Preceding_Zero_Index: Determine the index `p = s - 1`.
  - Segment: Divide the input sequence into four parts based on indices `p`, `s`, and `e`: `prefix` (0 to `p-1`), `zero` (at `p`), `block` (`s` to `e`), `suffix` (`e+1` to end).
  - Reassemble: Construct the output sequence by concatenating: `prefix`, `block`, `zero`, `suffix`.

Guard_Conditions:
  - If NonZeroBlock starts at index 0, no transformation occurs (no PrecedingZero exists). (This case is not shown in examples but is a logical edge case).
  - Assumes only one NonZeroBlock exists.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Start with the input sequence of integers.
2.  Locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. Note its starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`).
3.  If no such block exists, or if the block starts at the very beginning of the sequence (index 0), return the original sequence unchanged.
4.  Identify the element immediately before the block, which is at index `start_index - 1`. Confirm this element is a zero (as per the task's observed pattern).
5.  Construct the output sequence:
    a.  Copy all elements from the input sequence from the beginning up to (but not including) the `start_index - 1`.
    b.  Append the identified non-zero block (elements from `start_index` to `end_index`).
    c.  Append the zero element that was originally at `start_index - 1`.
    d.  Append all remaining elements from the input sequence (from `end_index + 1` onwards).
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence.
