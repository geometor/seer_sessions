Task: Swap Non-Zero Block with Preceding Zero

Input:
  Type: Sequence (assumed 1D array/list of integers)
  Element_Type: Integer (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zeros and exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  Constraint: The non-zero block is guaranteed to be preceded by at least one zero element.

Output:
  Type: Sequence (same type as input)
  Structure: Permutation of the input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The 1D list or array of integers.
  - ZeroElement: An element with value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Contiguous sub-sequence within the main Sequence.
      Property: All elements are identical and greater than 0.
      Location: Defined by a start_index and end_index.
      Uniqueness: Only one such block exists per input sequence.
  - PrecedingZero:
      Type: A ZeroElement.
      Location: Its index is `start_index - 1`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the NonZeroBlock.
      Existence: Guaranteed by input constraints.

Relationships:
  - Positional: PrecedingZero is immediately before NonZeroBlock in the input.
  - Composition: Input Sequence = [Elements before PrecedingZero] + [PrecedingZero] + [NonZeroBlock] + [Elements after NonZeroBlock]
  - Transformation: Output Sequence = [Elements before PrecedingZero] + [NonZeroBlock] + [PrecedingZero] + [Elements after NonZeroBlock]
  - Invariance: Length, count of zeros, count of non-zeros, and the specific non-zero digit value remain unchanged.

Actions:
  - Find_Block: Identify the start index (`s`) and end index (`e`) of the unique NonZeroBlock.
  - Identify_Preceding_Zero_Index: Determine the index `p = s - 1`.
  - Segment: Divide the input sequence into four parts based on indices `p`, `s`, and `e`: `prefix` (0 to `p-1`), `zero` (at `p`), `block` (`s` to `e`), `suffix` (`e+1` to end).
  - Reassemble: Construct the output sequence by concatenating: `prefix`, `block`, `zero`, `suffix`.

Guard_Conditions:
  - If NonZeroBlock starts at index 0, no transformation occurs (no PrecedingZero exists). (This case is not shown in examples but is a logical edge case).
  - Assumes only one NonZeroBlock exists.
