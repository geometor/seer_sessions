Task: Shift First Valid Non-Zero Block Left

Input:
  Type: NumPy array (potentially multi-dimensional, e.g., shape (1, N))
  Content: Represents a sequence of single integers. Contains mostly '0's and at least one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.

Output:
  Type: NumPy array (likely 1D or matching input dimensions)
  Content: A permutation of the input sequence.

Derived Objects (after flattening input to 1D):
  - Sequence: A 1D NumPy array of integers derived from the potentially multi-dimensional input.
  - Zero: The integer value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Properties:
        - Contiguous sub-sequence within the main Sequence.
        - Composed of identical integer digits > 0.
        - Must be immediately preceded by a Zero element within the Sequence.
        - There might be multiple such blocks; the transformation applies only to the first one encountered.
      Identification: Requires finding the start and end indices.
  - PrecedingZero: The Zero element immediately before the identified NonZeroBlock in the Sequence (at index `start_index - 1`).

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets the *first* NonZeroBlock (meeting all criteria) found when scanning the Sequence from left to right.
  - The Output Sequence is formed by swapping the position of the identified NonZeroBlock and its PrecedingZero.
  - Elements before the PrecedingZero and elements after the NonZeroBlock remain in their original relative positions.

Actions:
  - Flatten: Convert the input NumPy array to a 1D sequence.
  - Scan: Iterate through the 1D sequence to find the start and end indices of the first NonZeroBlock that is preceded by a Zero.
  - Check: If no such block is found (e.g., all zeros, block at start, block not preceded by zero), return the original sequence.
  - Extract: Identify the sub-sequence corresponding to the NonZeroBlock and the single element PrecedingZero.
  - Swap: Reconstruct the sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock where the PrecedingZero was, and the PrecedingZero immediately after the block.
  - Reshape (Optional): If required, reshape the resulting 1D sequence back to the original input dimensions. (Current examples suggest 1D output is sufficient).

Transformation:
  Rule: Find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers that is immediately preceded by a 0. Swap this block with the preceding 0.
  Condition: If no such block exists, the sequence remains unchanged.
