**General Assessment**

The provided code failed on all examples with the error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the input `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function (and subsequently to `find_first_non_zero_block`) is not a 1D NumPy array as initially assumed based on the visual representation of the examples. Instead, it's likely a 2D NumPy array (e.g., with shape (1, N)), causing element-wise comparisons like `digit != 0` and `arr[i - 1] != 0` to return boolean arrays, which cannot be evaluated as single booleans in `if` statements.

The strategy to resolve this is:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential multi-dimensional input by flattening it into a 1D array at the beginning (e.g., using `input_grid.flatten()`).
2.  Ensure the `find_first_non_zero_block` function operates correctly on this guaranteed 1D array. The logic within `find_first_non_zero_block` also needed correction to accurately identify the *first* block that meets the criteria (non-zero, contiguous, identical digits, and preceded by a zero).
3.  The `transform` function will then use the indices returned by the corrected `find_first_non_zero_block` function to perform the swap operation on the 1D array.
4.  Determine if the output needs to be reshaped back to the original input dimensions. Given the examples show 1D-like output, returning the modified 1D array seems appropriate unless specified otherwise.

**Metrics and Execution Analysis**

The previous code failed execution on all 7 training examples and the single test example provided, all yielding the same `ValueError`. This indicates a fundamental issue with input handling or the core logic's interaction with the NumPy array structure, rather than an edge case failure.

The core assumption that the input `input_grid` was a 1D array was incorrect. The testing framework likely provides inputs as 2D arrays (even if visually they represent a single sequence), possibly `np.array([[...]])`.

Executing the `find_first_non_zero_block_corrected` logic (designed for 1D) against simulated flattened inputs confirms it correctly identifies the target blocks:

import numpy as np

def find_first_non_zero_block_corrected(arr_1d: np.ndarray) -> tuple | None:
    """Finds the start/end indices of the first contiguous block of identical 
       non-zero integers preceded by a zero."""
    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    block_digit = None

    for i, digit in enumerate(arr_1d):
        if digit != 0:
            if start_index == -1: 
                if i > 0 and arr_1d[i - 1] == 0:
                    start_index = i
                    end_index = i 
                    block_digit = digit
                else:
                    continue 
            elif digit == block_digit:
                end_index = i 
            elif digit != block_digit and start_index != -1:
                break 
        elif digit == 0:
            if start_index != -1:
                 break 

    if start_index != -1:
        return start_index, end_index
    else:
        return None

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
Task: Shift First Valid Non-Zero Block Left

Input:
  Type: NumPy array (potentially multi-dimensional, e.g., shape (1, N))
  Content: Represents a sequence of single integers. Contains mostly '0's and at least one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.

Output:
  Type: NumPy array (likely 1D or matching input dimensions)
  Content: A permutation of the input sequence.

Derived Objects (after flattening input to 1D):
  - Sequence: A 1D NumPy array of integers derived from the potentially multi-dimensional input.
  - Zero: The integer value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Properties:
        - Contiguous sub-sequence within the main Sequence.
        - Composed of identical integer digits > 0.
        - Must be immediately preceded by a Zero element within the Sequence.
        - There might be multiple such blocks; the transformation applies only to the first one encountered.
      Identification: Requires finding the start and end indices.
  - PrecedingZero: The Zero element immediately before the identified NonZeroBlock in the Sequence (at index `start_index - 1`).

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets the *first* NonZeroBlock (meeting all criteria) found when scanning the Sequence from left to right.
  - The Output Sequence is formed by swapping the position of the identified NonZeroBlock and its PrecedingZero.
  - Elements before the PrecedingZero and elements after the NonZeroBlock remain in their original relative positions.

Actions:
  - Flatten: Convert the input NumPy array to a 1D sequence.
  - Scan: Iterate through the 1D sequence to find the start and end indices of the first NonZeroBlock that is preceded by a Zero.
  - Check: If no such block is found (e.g., all zeros, block at start, block not preceded by zero), return the original sequence.
  - Extract: Identify the sub-sequence corresponding to the NonZeroBlock and the single element PrecedingZero.
  - Swap: Reconstruct the sequence by placing the NonZeroBlock where the PrecedingZero was, and the PrecedingZero immediately after the block.
  - Reshape (Optional): If required, reshape the resulting 1D sequence back to the original input dimensions. (Current examples suggest 1D output is sufficient).

Transformation:
  Rule: Find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers that is immediately preceded by a 0. Swap this block with the preceding 0.
  Condition: If no such block exists, the sequence remains unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input NumPy array (`input_grid`).
2.  Flatten `input_grid` into a 1D NumPy array, let's call it `sequence`.
3.  Initialize variables `start_index`, `end_index`, and `block_digit` to track the target block (e.g., set indices to -1).
4.  Iterate through the `sequence` from the second element (`i` from 1 to length-1):
    a.  Let `current_digit` be `sequence[i]` and `previous_digit` be `sequence[i-1]`.
    b.  If `current_digit` is non-zero AND `previous_digit` is zero:
        i.   This is the potential start of the *first valid block*.
        ii.  Record `i` as `start_index`, `i` as `end_index`, and `current_digit` as `block_digit`.
        iii. Continue iterating from `i+1` to find the end of this block. Scan forward while subsequent digits match `block_digit`, updating `end_index` for each match.
        iv.  Once a digit differs or the sequence ends, the block is fully identified (from `start_index` to `end_index`). Stop the search process (break the main loop).
5.  If no valid `start_index` was found (it remains -1), return a copy of the original `input_grid` (or the flattened `sequence` if 1D output is acceptable).
6.  If a valid block was found (from `start_index` to `end_index`):
    a.  Identify the index of the preceding zero: `preceding_zero_index = start_index - 1`.
    b.  Create a new array (or modify a copy of `sequence`).
    c.  Copy elements from `sequence` before `preceding_zero_index` to the new array.
    d.  Append the identified non-zero block (`sequence[start_index : end_index + 1]`) to the new array.
    e.  Append the preceding zero (`sequence[preceding_zero_index]`) to the new array.
    f.  Append the remaining elements from `sequence` after the original block (`sequence[end_index + 1 :]`) to the new array.
    g.  Return the newly constructed array. (Consider reshaping to `input_grid.shape` if necessary).
