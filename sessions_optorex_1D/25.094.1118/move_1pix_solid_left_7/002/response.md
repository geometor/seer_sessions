**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed universally across all examples due to a fundamental type mismatch. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, whereas it was designed to process a space-separated string.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the code to work directly with NumPy arrays (or lists of numbers, assuming the input could be either, though NumPy is specified). This involves:

1.  Removing the `input_str.split(' ')` operation.
2.  Adapting the `find_non_zero_block` function and the main `transform` logic to handle numerical comparisons (e.g., `digit != 0` instead of `digit != '0'`) and array/list indexing and slicing.
3.  Ensuring the output format matches the input format (likely returning a NumPy array or list).

The core logic of identifying the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and swapping it with the immediately preceding zero appears consistent with the examples provided. The focus should be on correcting the implementation to handle the correct data type.

**Gather Metrics:**

Since the previous code failed during the initial input processing step due to the type error, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered from the execution results. All attempts failed before the core logic could be evaluated against the examples.

We can infer the input type is `numpy.ndarray`. Let's confirm the structure and data type within the arrays using a tool call on one example.
``` python
import numpy as np

# Simulating the input based on the error message and examples
input_array_1 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0])
input_array_3 = np.array([0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
input_array_5 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0])


print(f"Example 1: Type={type(input_array_1)}, Shape={input_array_1.shape}, Dtype={input_array_1.dtype}")
print(f"Example 3: Type={type(input_array_3)}, Shape={input_array_3.shape}, Dtype={input_array_3.dtype}")
print(f"Example 5: Type={type(input_array_5)}, Shape={input_array_5.shape}, Dtype={input_array_5.dtype}")

# Verify comparison works as expected
print(f"Is input_array_1[2] == 0? {input_array_1[2] == 0}")
print(f"Is input_array_1[3] != 0? {input_array_1[3] != 0}")
```
```
Example 1: Type=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape=(12,), Dtype=int64
Example 3: Type=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape=(12,), Dtype=int64
Example 5: Type=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, Shape=(12,), Dtype=int64
Is input_array_1[2] == 0? True
Is input_array_1[3] != 0? True

```
The metrics confirm the input is consistently a 1D NumPy array of integers (`int64`). Comparisons using numerical operators (`==`, `!=`) work as expected.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Shift Non-Zero Block Left (Array Input)

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Format: 1-dimensional array of integers.
  Content: Contains a sequence of integers, primarily 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Format: 1-dimensional array of integers.
  Content: A permutation of the input array.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The input NumPy array.
  - Zero: The integer value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock: A contiguous sub-array (slice) within the main Sequence, containing identical integers other than 0.
  - PrecedingZero: The 0 element immediately before the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence.

Relationships:
  - NonZeroBlock is surrounded by Zero elements in the input (unless at the very beginning/end, though examples show internal blocks preceded by zero).
  - The Output Sequence is formed by moving the NonZeroBlock one position earlier in the Sequence compared to the Input Sequence.
  - The PrecedingZero from the input moves to the position immediately after where the NonZeroBlock ends in the output.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the first NonZeroBlock.
  - Identify: Locate the index of the PrecedingZero (which is start_index - 1).
  - Check: Verify that a PrecedingZero exists (i.e., start_index > 0).
  - Slice: Extract the NonZeroBlock.
  - Slice: Extract parts of the array before the PrecedingZero and after the NonZeroBlock.
  - Concatenate: Reassemble the array slices and the PrecedingZero element in the new order: [prefix] + [NonZeroBlock] + [PrecedingZero] + [suffix].

Transformation:
  Rule: Find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. If such a block exists and is preceded by a zero, swap the block with that preceding zero.
  Constraint: Assumes there is exactly one such NonZeroBlock. If the block starts at index 0 or no non-zero block is found, return the original array.
  OutputFormat: The output must be a NumPy array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input NumPy array (`input_array`).
2.  Initialize variables to track the start index (`start_index = -1`), end index (`end_index = -1`), and the digit value (`block_digit = None`) of the non-zero block.
3.  Iterate through the `input_array` with index `i` and value `digit`:
    a.  If `digit != 0`:
        i.  If `start_index == -1` (first non-zero found):
            *   Check if `i == 0`. If yes, the block starts at the beginning; return the original `input_array` as no shift is possible.
            *   Set `start_index = i`.
            *   Set `block_digit = digit`.
            *   Set `end_index = i` (initially, block has length 1).
        ii. Else if `digit == block_digit` and `start_index != -1` (continuing the block):
            *   Update `end_index = i`.
        iii. Else if `digit != block_digit` and `start_index != -1` (block ended because a *different* non-zero digit was found):
            *   Break the loop (we only care about the *first* block).
    b.  Else (`digit == 0`):
        i.  If `start_index != -1` (a block was being tracked):
            *   Break the loop (the block has ended).
4.  If `start_index == -1` (no non-zero block was found), return the original `input_array`.
5.  Check if `start_index == 0`. This case should have been handled during the loop, but as a safeguard, if true, return the original `input_array`. (Alternatively, the loop logic ensures this won't be needed if implemented correctly).
6.  Confirm the element preceding the block is indeed 0: Check if `input_array[start_index - 1] == 0`. If not (which contradicts the pattern observed but is a defensive check), return the original `input_array`.
7.  Extract the relevant parts using array slicing and element access:
    a.  `prefix`: `input_array[:start_index - 1]`
    b.  `preceding_zero`: `[input_array[start_index - 1]]` (as a list/array for concatenation)
    c.  `non_zero_block`: `input_array[start_index : end_index + 1]`
    d.  `suffix`: `input_array[end_index + 1:]`
8.  Construct the output array by concatenating the parts in the new order: `prefix`, `non_zero_block`, `preceding_zero`, `suffix`. Use `numpy.concatenate` for efficient array joining.
9.  Return the newly constructed NumPy array.
