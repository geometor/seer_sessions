Task: Shift Non-Zero Block Left (Array Input)

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Format: 1-dimensional array of integers.
  Content: Contains a sequence of integers, primarily 0, with one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Format: 1-dimensional array of integers.
  Content: A permutation of the input array.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The input NumPy array.
  - Zero: The integer value 0.
  - NonZeroBlock: A contiguous sub-array (slice) within the main Sequence, containing identical integers other than 0.
  - PrecedingZero: The 0 element immediately before the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence.

Relationships:
  - NonZeroBlock is surrounded by Zero elements in the input (unless at the very beginning/end, though examples show internal blocks preceded by zero).
  - The Output Sequence is formed by moving the NonZeroBlock one position earlier in the Sequence compared to the Input Sequence.
  - The PrecedingZero from the input moves to the position immediately after where the NonZeroBlock ends in the output.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the first NonZeroBlock.
  - Identify: Locate the index of the PrecedingZero (which is start_index - 1).
  - Check: Verify that a PrecedingZero exists (i.e., start_index > 0).
  - Slice: Extract the NonZeroBlock.
  - Slice: Extract parts of the array before the PrecedingZero and after the NonZeroBlock.
  - Concatenate: Reassemble the array slices and the PrecedingZero element in the new order: [prefix] + [NonZeroBlock] + [PrecedingZero] + [suffix].

Transformation:
  Rule: Find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. If such a block exists and is preceded by a zero, swap the block with that preceding zero.
  Constraint: Assumes there is exactly one such NonZeroBlock. If the block starts at index 0 or no non-zero block is found, return the original array.
  OutputFormat: The output must be a NumPy array.
