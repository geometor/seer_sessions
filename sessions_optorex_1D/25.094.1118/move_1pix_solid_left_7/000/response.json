The primary characteristic of the input sequences is the presence of a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits surrounded by zeros. The transformation appears to involve shifting this non-zero block one position towards the beginning of the sequence, effectively swapping it with the zero immediately preceding it.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

All other elements retain their relative order.\n  Constraint: Assumes there is exactly one such NonZeroBlock and at least one Zero preceding it.\n```"
