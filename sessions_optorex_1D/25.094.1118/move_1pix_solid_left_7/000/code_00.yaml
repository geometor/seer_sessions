Task: Shift Non-Zero Block Left

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits
  Content: Contains a sequence of digits, primarily '0', with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits
  Content: A permutation of the input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of digits derived from the input/output string.
  - Zero: The digit '0'.
  - NonZeroBlock: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main Sequence, containing identical digits other than '0'.
  - PrecedingZero: The '0' element immediately before the NonZeroBlock in the input Sequence.

Relationships:
  - NonZeroBlock is surrounded by Zero elements in the input (except potentially at the very ends, although examples show internal blocks).
  - The Output Sequence is formed by moving the NonZeroBlock one position earlier in the Sequence compared to the Input Sequence.
  - The PrecedingZero from the input moves to the position immediately after where the NonZeroBlock ends in the output.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock.
  - Identify: Locate the index of the PrecedingZero (which is start_index - 1).
  - Shift: Move the NonZeroBlock one position to the left.
  - Relocate: Move the PrecedingZero to the position immediately following the shifted NonZeroBlock.

Transformation:
  Rule: Swap the NonZeroBlock with the single Zero element immediately preceding it. All other elements retain their relative order.
  Constraint: Assumes there is exactly one such NonZeroBlock and at least one Zero preceding it.
