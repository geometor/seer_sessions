Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
*   **Structure:** Each sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements.
*   **Transformation:** The core operation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples reveals a consistent pattern of movement. The last few elements of the input sequence appear at the beginning of the output sequence, and the initial elements of the input sequence appear at the end of the output sequence. Specifically, the last 4 elements consistently move to the front. This pattern corresponds to a right cyclic shift or rotation.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_name: sequence_cyclic_shift
description: Performs a cyclic shift on a sequence of integers.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
    actions:
      - name: right_cyclic_shift
        parameters:
          - amount: 4
relationships:
  - input_sequence -> right_cyclic_shift(amount=4) -> output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the last 4 elements of the sequence.
3.  Identify the first 8 elements of the sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 4 elements at the beginning, followed by the identified first 8 elements.
5.  This is equivalent to performing a right cyclic shift of the input sequence by 4 positions.
