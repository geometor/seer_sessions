Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples reveals a consistent pattern of movement. The last few elements of the input sequence appear at the beginning of the output sequence, and the initial elements of the input sequence appear at the end of the output sequence. Specifically, the last 4 elements consistently move to the front. This pattern corresponds to a right cyclic shift or rotation.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
