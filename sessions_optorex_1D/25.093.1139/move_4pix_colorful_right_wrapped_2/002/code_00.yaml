task_name: sequence_cyclic_shift_right_4
description: Performs a right cyclic shift (rotation) on a sequence of integers by 4 positions.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12 (fixed)
    actions:
      - name: right_cyclic_shift
        parameters:
          - amount: 4
        description: Moves the last 'amount' elements to the beginning of the sequence, shifting the preceding elements accordingly.
relationships:
  - input_sequence -> right_cyclic_shift(amount=4) -> output_sequence
validation:
  - rule: Output sequence must contain the same elements as the input sequence.
  - rule: The length of the output sequence must be equal to the length of the input sequence (12).
  - rule: The last 4 elements of the input sequence must be identical to the first 4 elements of the output sequence.
  - rule: The first 8 elements of the input sequence must be identical to the last 8 elements of the output sequence.
