Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
*   **Structure:** Each sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements.
*   **Transformation:** The core operation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples reveals a consistent pattern of movement. The last few elements of the input sequence appear at the beginning of the output sequence, and the initial elements of the input sequence appear at the end of the output sequence. Specifically, the last 4 elements consistently move to the front. This pattern corresponds to a right cyclic shift or rotation.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_name: sequence_cyclic_shift
description: Performs a cyclic shift on a sequence of integers.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
    actions:
      - name: right_cyclic_shift
        parameters:
          - amount: 4
relationships:
  - input_sequence -> right_cyclic_shift(amount=4) -> output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the last 4 elements of the sequence.
3.  Identify the first 8 elements of the sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last 4 elements at the beginning, followed by the identified first 8 elements.
5.  This is equivalent to performing a right cyclic shift of the input sequence by 4 positions.
```python
"""
Performs a right cyclic shift on a sequence of 12 integers by 4 positions.
The last 4 elements of the input sequence become the first 4 elements of the
output sequence, and the first 8 elements of the input sequence become the
last 8 elements of the output sequence.
"""

import numpy as np # numpy is commonly used for array manipulations

def transform(input_sequence):
    """
    Applies a right cyclic shift of 4 positions to the input sequence.

    Args:
        input_sequence (list or np.array): A sequence of 12 integers.

    Returns:
        list: The transformed sequence after the cyclic shift.
    """
    # Define the amount to shift
    shift_amount = 4
    
    # Ensure input is a list or easily convertible (like a numpy array)
    if isinstance(input_sequence, np.ndarray):
        input_sequence = input_sequence.tolist()
        
    # Check if the input sequence length is as expected (optional but good practice)
    if len(input_sequence) != 12:
        # Handle error or unexpected length if necessary
        # For this task, we assume length is always 12 based on examples
        pass 

    # Identify the last 'shift_amount' elements
    last_elements = input_sequence[-shift_amount:]
    
    # Identify the first 'length - shift_amount' elements
    first_elements = input_sequence[:-shift_amount]
    
    # Construct the output sequence by concatenating the parts
    # The last elements come first, followed by the first elements
    output_sequence = last_elements + first_elements
    
    return output_sequence

```
