"""
Performs a right cyclic shift (rotation) on a 1x12 grid of integers by 4 positions along the row.
The last 4 elements of the input grid's row become the first 4 elements of the
output grid's row, and the first 8 elements of the input grid's row become the
last 8 elements of the output grid's row.
