Accept a NumPy array as input.\n2.  Use NumPy array slicing to extract the first 8 elements and the last 4 elements.\n3.  Use NumPy concatenation or standard list concatenation to rearrange the segments.\n4.  Convert the elements of the resulting array/list to strings.\n5.  Join the string elements with spaces to produce the final output string.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a 1D NumPy array of length 12 based on the error message. The elements are likely numerical digits (integers or floats) or possibly strings representing digits.\n*   **Output Format:** Expected to be a string of 12 digits separated by single spaces.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Consistently involves moving the block of the last 4 elements to the beginning of the sequence, followed by the block of the first 8 elements.\n*   **Error Cause:** The function attempted to use the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array object, which does not possess this method.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
