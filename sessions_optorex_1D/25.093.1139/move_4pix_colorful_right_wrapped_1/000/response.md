**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves rearranging a sequence of 12 digits. Both the input and output are strings containing 12 digits separated by spaces. The digits themselves are not altered, only their positions within the sequence change. The transformation appears to be a specific type of cyclical shift or block movement.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: first_segment
    type: sub_sequence
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence
      - position: first 8 digits (indices 0-7)
  - name: second_segment
    type: sub_sequence
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence
      - position: last 4 digits (indices 8-11)
actions:
  - name: split
    input: input_sequence
    outputs: [first_segment, second_segment]
    parameters:
      - split_point: after the 8th digit
  - name: concatenate
    inputs: [second_segment, first_segment]
    output: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: rearrangement
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
  - type: composition
    of: output_sequence
    components: [second_segment, first_segment]
    order: second_segment followed by first_segment
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 space-separated digits.
2.  Identify the first 8 digits of the input sequence as the "first segment".
3.  Identify the last 4 digits of the input sequence as the "second segment".
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the "second segment" first, followed immediately by the "first segment".
5.  Format the resulting sequence as a string with digits separated by spaces.
