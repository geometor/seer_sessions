*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 numerical digits.
    *   The digits themselves within the sequence are preserved from input to output.
    *   The order of the digits is changed following a consistent pattern across all examples.
    *   The transformation appears to operate on fixed-size blocks or segments of the input sequence.
    *   Observing the examples, particularly how blocks of zeros and non-zeros shift, suggests a rearrangement of segments of length 4. The input sequence of 12 digits can be divided into three consecutive segments of 4 digits each.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    2.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating these segments in the following order: S3, then S1, then S2.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently indicates that the input data provided to the `transform` function is a NumPy array, not a string as previously assumed.
    *   The core transformation logic identified (splitting the sequence into three 4-element segments and rearranging them from S1, S2, S3 to S3, S1, S2) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.
    *   The failure occurred because the code attempted string operations (`.split()`, `.join()`) on a NumPy array.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Acknowledge that the input and output are sequences of integers, likely represented as NumPy arrays or Python lists.
    *   Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this data type.
    *   The fundamental rearrangement logic remains the same, but the description and implementation details must refer to array/list slicing and concatenation rather than string manipulation.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** NumPy array (or list) of integers.
    *   **Output Type:** NumPy array (or list) of integers.
    *   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements across all examples.
    *   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 elements across all examples.
    *   **Transformation:** Segment rearrangement. Confirmed by manual check:
        *   Example 1: Input `[0, 6, 3, 7, 7, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> S1=`[0, 6, 3, 7]`, S2=`[7, 3, 8, 0]`, S3=`[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Output `S3+S1+S2` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 7, 7, 3, 8, 0]`. Matches.
        *   Example 4: Input `[1, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 9, 6]` -> S1=`[1, 7, 7, 0]`, S2=`[0, 0, 0, 0]`, S3=`[7, 7, 9, 6]`. Output `S3+S1+S2` -> `[7, 7, 9, 6, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   The pattern S3 + S1 + S2 holds consistently.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the input sequence into three consecutive segments, each containing 4 integers:
        *   Segment 1 (S1): The integers from index 0 up to (but not including) index 4.
        *   Segment 2 (S2): The integers from index 4 up to (but not including) index 8.
        *   Segment 3 (S3): The integers from index 8 up to (but not including) index 12.
    3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating these segments in the order: S3, followed by S1, followed by S2.
