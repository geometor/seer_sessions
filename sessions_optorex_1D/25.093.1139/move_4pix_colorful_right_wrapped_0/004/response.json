            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the 12-element sequence into three 4-element segments (S1, S2, S3) and rearranging them into the order S3, S1, S2. The provided code implemented this logic. However, the execution results show a consistent `ValueError` across all examples, indicating a mismatch between the expected input data structure in the code (a 1D NumPy array of shape `(12,)`) and the actual input structure provided during testing (a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, 12)`). The strategy for resolution is straightforward: modify the code to correctly handle the `(1, 12)` input shape, ensuring slicing and concatenation operations work on the relevant dimension (axis 1). The underlying rearrangement logic (S3, S1, S2) remains valid.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Based on the error messages `Error: Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements, but got shape (1, 12)`, the following metrics are consistent across all examples:\n    *   Input Data Type: NumPy array\n    *   Input Shape: `(1, 12)` (1 row, 12 columns)\n    *   Number of Elements: 12\n    *   Expected Output Shape: `(1, 12)` (inferred, as the transformation rearranges elements within the same structure)\n    *   Segment Length: 4 elements\n    *   Number of Segments: 3\n    *   Rearrangement Pattern: Segment 3 -> Segment 1 -> Segment 2\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
