"""
Takes an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.
Divides the input sequence into three consecutive segments of 4 integers each:
  - Segment 1 (S1): Indices 0-3
  - Segment 2 (S2): Indices 4-7
  - Segment 3 (S3): Indices 8-11
Constructs the output sequence by concatenating these segments in the order: S3, S1, S2.
