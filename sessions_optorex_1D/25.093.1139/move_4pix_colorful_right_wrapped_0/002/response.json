Confirmed by manual check:\n        *   Example 1: Input `[0, 6, 3, 7, 7, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> S1=`[0, 6, 3, 7]`, S2=`[7, 3, 8, 0]`, S3=`[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Output `S3+S1+S2` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 7, 7, 3, 8, 0]`. Matches.\n        *   Example 4: Input `[1, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 9, 6]` -> S1=`[1, 7, 7, 0]`, S2=`[0, 0, 0, 0]`, S3=`[7, 7, 9, 6]`. Output `S3+S1+S2` -> `[7, 7, 9, 6, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   The pattern S3 + S1 + S2 holds consistently.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
