"""
Takes a 2D NumPy array input with shape (1, 12).
Divides the sequence along the second dimension (columns) into three consecutive segments of 4 elements each:
  - Segment S1: Columns 0-3
  - Segment S2: Columns 4-7
  - Segment S3: Columns 8-11
Constructs the output array by concatenating these segments along the second dimension in the order: S3, S1, S2.
Returns the resulting 2D NumPy array with shape (1, 12).
