*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The initial analysis identified a consistent pattern: moving the last 4 elements of the 12-element input sequence to the beginning to form the output.
    *   The provided test results show that the previously generated code failed to produce any output for all examples, resulting in mismatches.
    *   Crucially, the failure manifests as *empty* output, not *incorrect* output. This strongly suggests an issue with the execution framework, input parsing, or output formatting within the test run, rather than an error in the core transformation logic itself.
    *   A manual re-verification of the "move last 4 to front" rule against all examples confirms its consistency. The logic derived from the first example holds true for all other examples.
    *   Strategy: Maintain the previously derived transformation logic. The focus for the coder phase will be on ensuring the implementation details (input parsing, function signature, return value formatting) align with the requirements of the execution environment.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input Length: Consistently 12 integers for all examples.
    *   Output Length: Consistently 12 integers for all examples.
    *   Element Preservation: Output sequences contain the exact same integers as their corresponding input sequences, confirming rearrangement only.
    *   Transformation Rule Verification: The rule "Split the sequence at index 8 (after the 8th element), take the second part (elements 8-11), and concatenate it with the first part (elements 0-7)" correctly produces the expected output for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence transformation
    input_type: list of integers (represented as space-separated string)
    output_type: list of integers (represented as space-separated string)
    element_type: integer
    input_length: 12 (constant)
    output_length: 12 (constant)
    transformation: cyclic shift (rearrangement)
    properties:
      - object: input_sequence
        attributes:
          - length: 12
          - elements: integers
      - object: output_sequence
        attributes:
          - length: 12
          - elements: same integers as input_sequence, different order
    actions:
      - name: split
        input: input_sequence
        parameters:
          - split_point_index: 8 # Split occurs after the 8th element (index 7)
        outputs:
          - subsequence_A: first 8 elements (indices 0-7)
          - subsequence_B: last 4 elements (indices 8-11)
      - name: concatenate
        inputs:
          - subsequence_B
          - subsequence_A
        output: output_sequence
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is formed by placing subsequence_B (the last 4 elements of the input) before subsequence_A (the first 8 elements of the input).
    execution_notes:
      - The previous code execution failed to produce output, likely due to I/O handling or framework interaction issues, not flawed logic. The core transformation rule is correct.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the first 8 integers as Part A.
    3.  Identify the last 4 integers as Part B.
    4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating Part B followed by Part A.
