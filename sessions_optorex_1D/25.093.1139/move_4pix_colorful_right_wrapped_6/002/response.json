            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The initial analysis identified a consistent pattern: moving the last 4 elements of the 12-element input sequence to the beginning to form the output.\n    *   The provided test results show that the previously generated code failed to produce any output for all examples, resulting in mismatches.\n    *   Crucially, the failure manifests as *empty* output, not *incorrect* output. This strongly suggests an issue with the execution framework, input parsing, or output formatting within the test run, rather than an error in the core transformation logic itself.\n    *   A manual re-verification of the \"move last 4 to front\" rule against all examples confirms its consistency. The logic derived from the first example holds true for all other examples.\n    *   Strategy: Maintain the previously derived transformation logic. The focus for the coder phase will be on ensuring the implementation details (input parsing, function signature, return value formatting) align with the requirements of the execution environment.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input Length: Consistently 12 integers for all examples.\n    *   Output Length: Consistently 12 integers for all examples.\n    *   Element Preservation: Output sequences contain the exact same integers as their corresponding input sequences, confirming rearrangement only.\n    *   Transformation Rule Verification: The rule \"Split the sequence at index 8 (after the 8th element), take the second part (elements 8-11), and concatenate it with the first part (elements 0-7)\" correctly produces the expected output for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
