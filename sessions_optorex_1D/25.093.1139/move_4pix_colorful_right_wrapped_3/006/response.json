            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code failed across all examples with the same error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was called with a NumPy array as input, whereas the code was written assuming the input would be a space-separated string.\n\nThe core logic of the transformation \u2013 splitting the sequence into two segments (first 8 elements and last 4 elements) and swapping their order \u2013 appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided in the training examples.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list, which NumPy arrays can often be treated as for slicing) directly, eliminating the string parsing (`split`) and string formatting (`join`) steps. The slicing and concatenation logic can be applied directly to the array or list.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the error messages, the input type for all examples is consistently `numpy.ndarray`.\n\n*   **Input Type**: `numpy.ndarray`\n*   **Input Shape**: Assumed to be a 1D array of length 12 based on the visual examples.\n*   **Error Consistency**: The `AttributeError` occurred for every single training and test example, confirming the input type mismatch is the primary issue.\n*   **Core Logic Validity**: Visual inspection of the `input` and `output` pairs confirms that the transformation rule (swap first 8 with last 4) holds true for all provided examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
