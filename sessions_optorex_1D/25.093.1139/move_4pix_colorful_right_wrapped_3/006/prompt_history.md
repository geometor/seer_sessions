## Perception

The input is a sequence of 12 single-digit numbers. The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit numbers, containing the same digits as the input but in a different order. The transformation appears to be a structural rearrangement of the sequence. Specifically, the sequence is divided into two segments, and these segments are swapped in the output. The first segment consists of the first 8 numbers, and the second segment consists of the last 4 numbers.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the first segment consisting of the first 8 digits.
3.  Identify the second segment consisting of the last 4 digits.
4.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating the second segment followed by the first segment.
5.  Output the resulting sequence.
