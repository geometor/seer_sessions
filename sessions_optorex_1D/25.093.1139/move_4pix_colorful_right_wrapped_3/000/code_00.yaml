task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 digits by swapping two segments.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: segment_1
    type: sublist of input_sequence
    properties:
      - location: first 8 elements
      - length: 8
  - name: segment_2
    type: sublist of input_sequence
    properties:
      - location: last 4 elements
      - length: 4
actions:
  - name: split
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - split_point: after the 8th element
    output:
      - segment_1
      - segment_2
  - name: concatenate
    input:
      - segment_2
      - segment_1
    output: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: order_swap
    object_1: segment_1
    object_2: segment_2
    description: In the output sequence, segment_2 appears before segment_1.
