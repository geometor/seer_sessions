The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit numbers, containing the same digits as the input but in a different order. The transformation appears to be a structural rearrangement of the sequence. Specifically, the sequence is divided into two segments, and these segments are swapped in the output. The first segment consists of the first 8 numbers, and the second segment consists of the last 4 numbers.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
