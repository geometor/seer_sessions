task_description: Rearrange a sequence of 12 numbers by swapping two contiguous segments.
input_type: List or Array of 12 integers.
output_type: List or Array of 12 integers.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list or array of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list or array of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - contains the same elements as input_sequence but in a different order.
  - name: segment_1
    type: sub-sequence of input_sequence
    properties:
      - location: first 8 elements (indices 0-7)
      - length: 8
  - name: segment_2
    type: sub-sequence of input_sequence
    properties:
      - location: last 4 elements (indices 8-11)
      - length: 4
actions:
  - name: split
    input: input_sequence
    parameters:
      - split_point: after the 8th element (index 7)
    output:
      - segment_1
      - segment_2
  - name: concatenate
    input:
      - segment_2
      - segment_1
    output: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: sequence_composition
    object_1: input_sequence
    components: [segment_1, segment_2]
    description: The input sequence is composed of segment_1 followed by segment_2.
  - type: sequence_composition
    object_1: output_sequence
    components: [segment_2, segment_1]
    description: The output sequence is composed of segment_2 followed by segment_1.
  - type: order_swap
    object_1: segment_1
    object_2: segment_2
    description: The relative order of segment_1 and segment_2 is swapped between the input and output sequences.
