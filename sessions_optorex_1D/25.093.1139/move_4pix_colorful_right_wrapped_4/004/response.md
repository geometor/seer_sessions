*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code correctly identified the core transformation logic: moving the last four elements of the sequence to the beginning. However, it failed due to a data type mismatch. The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '...'`) indicate that the testing environment expected a numerical output (likely a NumPy array or a list of integers) but received a formatted string from the `transform` function. The comparison mechanism then attempted to convert this output string into an integer, which failed because the string contained multiple space-separated numbers. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to return the rearranged sequence in its native numerical format (NumPy array) instead of converting it to a space-separated string.

*   **Metrics and Assumptions:**
    *   **Input Format:** Assumed to be a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on the problem context and the previous attempt's code structure. The error messages do not contradict this but highlight issues with the output format.
    *   **Output Format:** Previously assumed to be a space-separated string. The errors strongly suggest the expected output format is numerical, likely a 1D NumPy array matching the structure of the rearranged input.
    *   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.
    *   **Transformation Rule:** Move the block of the last 4 elements to the beginning of the sequence. This rule holds across all 7 training examples.
    *   **Element Type:** Integers.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the first 8 elements of the input array (Part A).
    3.  Identify the last 4 elements of the input array (Part B).
    4.  Construct the output NumPy array by concatenating Part B followed by Part A.
    5.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
