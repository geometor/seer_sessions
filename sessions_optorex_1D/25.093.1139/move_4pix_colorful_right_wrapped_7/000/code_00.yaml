Task: Sequence Rotation

Objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers
  - name: first_segment
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence
      - elements: First 8 elements of input_sequence
      - length: 8
  - name: second_segment
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence
      - elements: Last 4 elements of input_sequence
      - length: 4

Actions:
  - name: Split
    description: Divide the input_sequence into two segments.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - split_point: index 8 (after the 8th element)
    outputs:
      - first_segment (elements 0 through 7)
      - second_segment (elements 8 through 11)
  - name: Concatenate
    description: Combine the segments in a specific order to form the output_sequence.
    inputs:
      - second_segment
      - first_segment
    outputs:
      - output_sequence

Relationships:
  - The output_sequence is formed by placing the second_segment before the first_segment.
  - output_sequence = second_segment + first_segment
