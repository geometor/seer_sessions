No arithmetic operations or changes to the individual digits are observed.\n3.  **Key Observation:** The last four elements of the input sequence consistently appear as the first four elements of the output sequence. The first eight elements of the input sequence consistently appear as the last eight elements of the output sequence.\n4.  **Inferred Action:** The transformation involves splitting the input sequence into two segments (the first 8 elements and the last 4 elements) and then concatenating them in reverse order (last 4 followed by first 8). This is equivalent to a cyclic shift or rotation of the sequence.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
