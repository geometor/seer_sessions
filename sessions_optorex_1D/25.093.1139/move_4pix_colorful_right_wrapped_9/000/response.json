The split occurs after the 8th element.\n    *   The first part consists of the first 8 elements, and the second part consists of the last 4 elements.\n    *   In the output, the order of these two parts is reversed: the last 4 elements from the input appear first, followed by the first 8 elements from the input.\n    *   The internal order of elements within each part remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
