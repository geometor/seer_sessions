*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 space-separated single digits.
    *   The transformation rearranges the elements of the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    *   Observing the examples, it appears the sequence is split into two parts. The split occurs after the 8th element.
    *   The first part consists of the first 8 elements, and the second part consists of the last 4 elements.
    *   In the output, the order of these two parts is reversed: the last 4 elements from the input appear first, followed by the first 8 elements from the input.
    *   The internal order of elements within each part remains unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 numbers.
    2.  Divide the sequence into two parts: the first 8 numbers (Part 1) and the last 4 numbers (Part 2).
    3.  Construct the output sequence by placing Part 2 first, followed by Part 1.
    4.  Format the resulting sequence as space-separated digits.
