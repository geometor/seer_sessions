            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the sequence after the 8th element and swapping the two resulting parts. However, the provided code failed during execution because it made an incorrect assumption about the format of the input passed to the `transform` function. The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...'`) indicate that the function received a *string representation* of a list/array (including brackets) instead of the expected list, NumPy array, or simple space-separated string. The strategy is to update the input handling logic within the `transform` function to correctly parse this unexpected string format, while also gracefully handling potentially correct formats like lists or NumPy arrays.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Format:** The execution environment passed the input to the `transform` function as a single string literal that includes the square brackets and spaces, resembling the string representation of a list (e.g., `'[1 1 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 3 7]'`). This is inconsistent with the initial assumption of a simple space-separated string or a direct list/array object.\n    *   **Parsing Failure:** The code attempted to process this string representation directly or indirectly led to an attempt to convert the entire string `'[1 1 0 ...]'` into a single integer, causing the `ValueError`.\n    *   **Consistency:** The error occurred consistently across all training and test examples, confirming the input format issue is systematic in the test harness.\n    *   **Core Logic:** The underlying split-and-swap logic (split at index 8, concatenate part2 + part1) remains valid based on the input/output pairs, but could not be executed due to the parsing failure.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
