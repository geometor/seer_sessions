"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers by splitting
it into two parts: the first 8 elements and the last 4 elements. It then
constructs and returns a new sequence (formatted as a space-separated string)
by concatenating the last 4 elements followed by the first 8 elements.

    Args:
