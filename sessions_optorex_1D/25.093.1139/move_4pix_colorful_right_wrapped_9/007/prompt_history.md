*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 space-separated single digits.
    *   The transformation rearranges the elements of the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    *   Observing the examples, it appears the sequence is split into two parts. The split occurs after the 8th element.
    *   The first part consists of the first 8 elements, and the second part consists of the last 4 elements.
    *   In the output, the order of these two parts is reversed: the last 4 elements from the input appear first, followed by the first 8 elements from the input.
    *   The internal order of elements within each part remains unchanged.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the sequence after the 8th element and swapping the two resulting parts. However, the provided code failed during execution because it made an incorrect assumption about the format of the input passed to the `transform` function. The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...'`) indicate that the function received a *string representation* of a list/array (including brackets) instead of the expected list, NumPy array, or simple space-separated string. The strategy is to update the input handling logic within the `transform` function to correctly parse this unexpected string format, while also gracefully handling potentially correct formats like lists or NumPy arrays.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Format:** The execution environment passed the input to the `transform` function as a single string literal that includes the square brackets and spaces, resembling the string representation of a list (e.g., `'[1 1 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 3 7]'`). This is inconsistent with the initial assumption of a simple space-separated string or a direct list/array object.
    *   **Parsing Failure:** The code attempted to process this string representation directly or indirectly led to an attempt to convert the entire string `'[1 1 0 ...]'` into a single integer, causing the `ValueError`.
    *   **Consistency:** The error occurred consistently across all training and test examples, confirming the input format issue is systematic in the test harness.
    *   **Core Logic:** The underlying split-and-swap logic (split at index 8, concatenate part2 + part1) remains valid based on the input/output pairs, but could not be executed due to the parsing failure.

*   **Facts:**

    1.  Receive the input sequence.
    2.  Check if the input is a string.
    3.  If it is a string:
        a.  Remove the leading square bracket (`[`) and trailing square bracket (`]`), if they exist.
        b.  Split the cleaned string into individual number strings using spaces as delimiters.
        c.  Convert each number string into an integer to form a list of numbers.
    4.  If the input is not a string (e.g., it's already a list or array):
        a.  Convert the input sequence into a standard Python list of numbers.
    5.  Divide the list of numbers into two parts: the first 8 numbers (Part 1) and the last 4 numbers (Part 2).
    6.  Create a new list by concatenating Part 2 followed by Part 1.
    7.  Convert the numbers in the new list back into strings.
    8.  Join these number strings together with single spaces in between to form the final output string.
