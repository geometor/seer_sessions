```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers. It first parses the input, which might be a string representation of a list (e.g., '[1 2 3 ...]') or a direct list/array. It then splits the sequence into two parts: the first 8 elements and the last 4 elements. Finally, it constructs and returns a new sequence, formatted as a space-separated string, by concatenating the last 4 elements followed by the first 8 elements.
