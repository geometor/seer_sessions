            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the input data type was a string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected space-separated string. The core transformation logic (splitting the sequence after the 8th element and swapping the two resulting parts) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the examples, but the implementation needs to operate directly on the array/list representation rather than performing string manipulation first.\n\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list, as NumPy arrays can be easily converted) as input.\n    2.  Remove the string parsing step (`parse_input_string`).\n    3.  Apply the splitting and concatenation logic directly to the input array/list.\n    4.  Retain the output formatting step (`format_output_list`) to convert the resulting list back into a space-separated string, assuming this is the required output format based on the initial examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples.\n    *   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements across all examples.\n    *   **Element Type:** Integers.\n    *   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` due to calling `.split()` on a NumPy array.\n    *   **Consistency:** The error is identical for all train and test examples, reinforcing that the input type mismatch is the sole issue. The underlying transformation logic hasn't been truly tested yet.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
