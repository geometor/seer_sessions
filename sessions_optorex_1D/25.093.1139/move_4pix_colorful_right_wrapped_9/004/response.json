            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The error `invalid literal for int() with base 10` consistently occurs across all examples because the previous code attempted to parse the input as a space-separated string (`input_str.split()`). However, the error messages reveal that the input being passed to the `transform` function is likely already a sequence data structure (like a list or a NumPy array), possibly represented as a string like `'[1, 1, 0, ...]'` when the error is logged, or more likely, the function is receiving the list/array directly and the string parsing logic fails. The core transformation logic (splitting the sequence after the 8th element and swapping the two parts) identified in the initial analysis appears correct and consistent with the input/output pairs. The strategy is to modify the code to directly accept the sequence (list or array) as input, eliminating the incorrect string parsing step.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Format:** The execution errors indicate the `transform` function received input that could not be processed by `int(digit)` after an assumed `.split()`. This points to the input *not* being a simple space-separated string of digits, but rather a list, NumPy array, or potentially the string representation of such a structure.\n    *   **Input Length:** All provided examples (both train and inferred test) have an input length of 12 elements.\n    *   **Output Length:** All provided examples have an output length of 12 elements.\n    *   **Element Type:** All elements are single-digit integers (0-9).\n    *   **Consistency:** The transformation rule (swap first 8 elements with last 4) holds true for all 7 training examples provided. The errors occurred during execution due to input format mismatch, not a flaw in the perceived transformation rule.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
