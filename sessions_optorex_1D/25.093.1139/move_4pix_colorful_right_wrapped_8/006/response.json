            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the input sequence into three blocks of four elements and rearranging them. The error reported (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected string. This mismatch between the function's expected input type (`str`) and the actual input type (`numpy.ndarray`) caused the failure. The underlying block rearrangement logic appears sound based on the examples, but the function needs to be adapted to handle numerical sequence inputs directly (like lists or NumPy arrays) instead of performing string parsing.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The transformation rule holds consistently across all provided training examples when the input is treated as a sequence of integers:\n    *   Input and Output are sequences of 12 integers.\n    *   The input sequence is divided into three contiguous blocks:\n        *   Block 1: Indices 0-3\n        *   Block 2: Indices 4-7\n        *   Block 3: Indices 8-11\n    *   The output sequence is formed by concatenating these blocks in the order: Block 3, Block 1, Block 2.\n    *   Verification confirms this pattern for all 7 examples. For instance, in `train_4`:\n        *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 6, 0, 0]`\n        *   Block 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   Block 2: `[0, 0, 0, 5]`\n        *   Block 3: `[7, 6, 0, 0]`\n        *   Concatenated (3, 1, 2): `[7, 6, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 5]` = `[7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]`\n        *   This matches the expected output: `[7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]`\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
