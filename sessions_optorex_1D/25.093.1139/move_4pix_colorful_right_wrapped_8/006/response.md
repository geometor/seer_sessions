*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: splitting the input sequence into three blocks of four elements and rearranging them. The error reported (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected string. This mismatch between the function's expected input type (`str`) and the actual input type (`numpy.ndarray`) caused the failure. The underlying block rearrangement logic appears sound based on the examples, but the function needs to be adapted to handle numerical sequence inputs directly (like lists or NumPy arrays) instead of performing string parsing.

*   **Metrics:**
    The transformation rule holds consistently across all provided training examples when the input is treated as a sequence of integers:
    *   Input and Output are sequences of 12 integers.
    *   The input sequence is divided into three contiguous blocks:
        *   Block 1: Indices 0-3
        *   Block 2: Indices 4-7
        *   Block 3: Indices 8-11
    *   The output sequence is formed by concatenating these blocks in the order: Block 3, Block 1, Block 2.
    *   Verification confirms this pattern for all 7 examples. For instance, in `train_4`:
        *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 6, 0, 0]`
        *   Block 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
        *   Block 2: `[0, 0, 0, 5]`
        *   Block 3: `[7, 6, 0, 0]`
        *   Concatenated (3, 1, 2): `[7, 6, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 5]` = `[7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]`
        *   This matches the expected output: `[7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]`

    actions:
      - name: rearrange_blocks
        inputs:
          - block_1
          - block_2
          - block_3
        outputs:
          - output_sequence
        rule: Concatenate the blocks in the order: block_3, block_1, block_2.
    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is composed of the same elements as the input_sequence, but rearranged.
      - The rearrangement rule is based on splitting the input_sequence into three fixed-size blocks and reordering these blocks.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive an input sequence (list or array) containing 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the input sequence into three consecutive blocks, each containing 4 elements:
        *   Block 1 consists of the elements at indices 0 through 3.
        *   Block 2 consists of the elements at indices 4 through 7.
        *   Block 3 consists of the elements at indices 8 through 11.
    3.  Construct the output sequence by concatenating these blocks in the following order: Block 3, then Block 1, then Block 2.
    4.  Return the resulting output sequence.
