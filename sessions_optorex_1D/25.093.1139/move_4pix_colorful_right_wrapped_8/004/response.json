            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: splitting the input sequence into three blocks of four elements and rearranging them in the order Block 3, Block 1, Block 2. The provided code snippets reflected this understanding. However, the execution results indicate a failure occurred during the input processing stage for all examples. The error \"Input list must contain exactly 12 elements\" suggests that the function tested expected a list object but received the input as a single string (e.g., `\"3 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"`), and the length check was performed on the string itself, not the list of integers derived from it. The first Python snippet provided in the previous turn correctly handled string parsing and formatting, while the second snippet (likely the one tested) assumed list input and included the faulty length check based on that assumption. The strategy is to ensure the transformation function correctly parses the input string into a list of integers before applying the block rearrangement logic and then formats the resulting list back into a space-separated string.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Total examples provided: 7 train, 1 test (implicitly, based on error report).\n    *   Examples successfully processed by the tested code: 0.\n    *   Examples failed: 8 (7 train, 1 test).\n    *   Common error message: `ValueError: Input list must contain exactly 12 elements.`\n    *   Input format: Space-separated string of 12 integers.\n    *   Output format: Space-separated string of 12 integers.\n    *   Core logic (block rearrangement 3, 1, 2): Appears correct based on manual verification against all examples.\n    *   Point of failure: Input parsing/validation within the tested function, assuming list input instead of string input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
