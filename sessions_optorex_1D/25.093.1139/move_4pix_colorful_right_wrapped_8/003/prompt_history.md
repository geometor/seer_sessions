*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 12 integers each.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the elements of the input sequence to produce the output sequence.
    *   The sequence appears to be treated as three distinct blocks of four elements each.
    *   The rearrangement follows a consistent pattern across all examples: the blocks are reordered.

*   **Facts:**

      - object: input_list
        properties:
          - type: list

            - block_2: elements at indices 4-7
            - block_3: elements at indices 8-11
    actions:

        inputs:
          - block_1
          - block_2
          - block_3
        outputs:
          - output_list
        rule: Concatenate the blocks in the order: block_3, block_1, block_2.
    relationships:
      - The output_list is composed of the same elements as the input_list, but rearranged.
      - The rearrangement rule is based on splitting the input_list into three fixed-size blocks and reordering these blocks.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input list of 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the input list into three consecutive blocks, each containing 4 elements:
        *   Block 1 consists of the first 4 elements (indices 0-3).
        *   Block 2 consists of the next 4 elements (indices 4-7).
        *   Block 3 consists of the last 4 elements (indices 8-11).
    3.  Construct the output list by concatenating these blocks in the following order: Block 3, then Block 1, then Block 2.

    # Ensure the input list length is a multiple of block_size
    if len(input_list) % block_size != 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list length must be a multiple of block size (4)")

    # Divide the input list into three blocks

*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a string and tried to use the `.split()` method, whereas the execution environment passed a list or NumPy array directly. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` confirms this.
    *   The core logic identified in the initial analysis (splitting the 12-element list into three 4-element blocks and rearranging them in the order 3, 1, 2) appears consistent across all provided examples based on manual inspection.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Modify the input handling part of the transformation logic to accept a list/array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).
        2.  Verify the block rearrangement logic (3, 1, 2) against all examples using code execution.
        3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the confirmed input type and transformation.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's verify the block rearrangement logic (indices 8-11, then 0-3, then 4-7) for each example.
