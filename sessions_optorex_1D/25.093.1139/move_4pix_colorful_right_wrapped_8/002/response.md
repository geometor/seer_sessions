*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a string and tried to use the `.split()` method, whereas the execution environment passed a list or NumPy array directly. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` confirms this.
    *   The core logic identified in the initial analysis (splitting the 12-element list into three 4-element blocks and rearranging them in the order 3, 1, 2) appears consistent across all provided examples based on manual inspection.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Modify the input handling part of the transformation logic to accept a list/array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).
        2.  Verify the block rearrangement logic (3, 1, 2) against all examples using code execution.
        3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the confirmed input type and transformation.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    Let's verify the block rearrangement logic (indices 8-11, then 0-3, then 4-7) for each example.


``` python
import numpy as np

def apply_transformation_logic(input_list):
    """Applies the hypothesized block rearrangement."""
    if len(input_list) != 12:
        return "Error: Input list length is not 12"
    block_1 = input_list[0:4]
    block_2 = input_list[4:8]
    block_3 = input_list[8:12]
    output_list = block_3 + block_1 + block_2
    return output_list

# Example Inputs (as lists of integers)
inputs = [
    [3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 3, 9],
    [0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 9, 8, 3, 4, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 6, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 6, 0],
    [7, 2, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

# Expected Outputs (as lists of integers)
expected_outputs = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 7, 3, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 9, 8],
    [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
    [6, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 3, 5, 4],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

results = []
for i, input_list in enumerate(inputs):
    calculated_output = apply_transformation_logic(input_list)
    is_match = (calculated_output == expected_outputs[i])
    results.append({
        "Example": i + 1,
        "Input": input_list,
        "Calculated Output": calculated_output,
        "Expected Output": expected_outputs[i],
        "Match": is_match
    })

# Print results for verification
for result in results:
    print(f"Example {result['Example']}: Match = {result['Match']}")
    # Optionally print more details if needed
    # print(f"  Input:           {result['Input']}")
    # print(f"  Calculated:      {result['Calculated Output']}")
    # print(f"  Expected:        {result['Expected Output']}")

all_match = all(r['Match'] for r in results)
print(f"\nAll examples match the logic: {all_match}")
```
```
Example 1: Match = True
Example 2: Match = True
Example 3: Match = True
Example 4: Match = True
Example 5: Match = True
Example 6: Match = True
Example 7: Match = True

All examples match the logic: True

```
*   **Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    properties:
      - type: list # Confirmed input is a list/array, not string
      - item_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - object: output_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - item_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - object: blocks
    properties:
      - count: 3
      - size: 4 elements each
      - source: derived from input_list by splitting it into three equal consecutive parts
        - block_1: elements at indices 0-3
        - block_2: elements at indices 4-7
        - block_3: elements at indices 8-11
actions:
  - name: rearrange_blocks
    inputs:
      - block_1
      - block_2
      - block_3
    outputs:
      - output_list
    rule: Concatenate the blocks in the order - block_3, block_1, block_2.
relationships:
  - The output_list is composed of the same elements as the input_list, rearranged according to the block reordering rule.
  - The input is directly provided as a list or array of 12 integers.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a list of 12 integers.
    2.  Divide the input list into three consecutive blocks, each containing 4 integers:
        *   Block 1 consists of the elements at indices 0 through 3.
        *   Block 2 consists of the elements at indices 4 through 7.
        *   Block 3 consists of the elements at indices 8 through 11.
    3.  Construct the output list by concatenating these blocks in the following order: Block 3, then Block 1, then Block 2.
    4.  Return the resulting list of 12 integers.
