task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    properties:
      - type: list # Confirmed input is a list/array, not string
      - item_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - object: output_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - item_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - object: blocks
    properties:
      - count: 3
      - size: 4 elements each
      - source: derived from input_list by splitting it into three equal consecutive parts
        - block_1: elements at indices 0-3
        - block_2: elements at indices 4-7
        - block_3: elements at indices 8-11
actions:
  - name: rearrange_blocks
    inputs:
      - block_1
      - block_2
      - block_3
    outputs:
      - output_list
    rule: Concatenate the blocks in the order - block_3, block_1, block_2.
relationships:
  - The output_list is composed of the same elements as the input_list, rearranged according to the block reordering rule.
  - The input is directly provided as a list or array of 12 integers.
