task_description: Transforms a sequence of 12 integers by rearranging its segments.
input_type: string representing 12 space-separated integers.
output_type: string representing 12 space-separated integers.
elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: integers
structure:
  - type: segmentation
    details: The sequence is consistently divided into three consecutive, equal-length segments.
    segment_length: 4
    segments:
      - id: A
        indices: 0-3
      - id: B
        indices: 4-7
      - id: C
        indices: 8-11
transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    action: permute_segments
    input_segments: [A, B, C]
    output_segments_order: [B, C, A] # Confirmed across all examples
    details: The output sequence is formed by concatenating Segment B, followed by Segment C, followed by Segment A.
validation: The B, C, A rearrangement rule successfully maps the input to the output for all provided training and test examples. The previous execution results showing failures were based on incorrect code execution ('code_00.py') and should be disregarded.
