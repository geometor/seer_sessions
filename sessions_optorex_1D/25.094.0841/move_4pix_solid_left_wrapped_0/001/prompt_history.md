**Perception of the elements of the task (train_7):**

*   **Input/Output:** The task takes a sequence of numbers as input and produces a sequence of numbers as output.
*   **Format:** Both input and output are presented as space-separated strings of integers.
*   **Structure:** The input and output sequences both contain 12 numbers.
*   **Content:** The numbers in the input sequence are 0 and 1. The output sequence also contains only 0s and 1s. The count of each number (eight 0s and four 1s) is preserved between input and output.
*   **Transformation:** The positions of the numbers are changed. The block of four '1's, initially located at indices 4 through 7 in the input (`0 0 0 0 **1 1 1 1** 0 0 0 0`), moves to the beginning of the sequence in the output, occupying indices 0 through 3 (`**1 1 1 1** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`). The zeros are rearranged accordingly.

relationship:
  - type: rearrangement
    action: divide_and_permute_segments
    details: The input sequence is divided into three equal segments of length 4. These segments are then rearranged to form the output sequence.
    input_segments: [segment_A, segment_B, segment_C]
    output_segments_order: [segment_B, segment_C, segment_A] # Based on observing multiple similar examples; fits this example too.
    # Alternative interpretation fitting only this example: [segment_B, segment_A, segment_C] (swap A and B)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers.
2.  Divide the input list into three consecutive, non-overlapping segments, each containing 4 elements:
    *   Segment A: Elements from index 0 to 3.
    *   Segment B: Elements from index 4 to 7.
    *   Segment C: Elements from index 8 to 11.
3.  Construct the output list by concatenating the segments in the following order: Segment B, then Segment C, then Segment A.
4.  Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string.
