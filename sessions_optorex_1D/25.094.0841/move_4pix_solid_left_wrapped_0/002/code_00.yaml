task_description: Transforms a sequence of 12 integers by rearranging its segments.
input_object:
  type: sequence_of_integers # Corrected type
  length: 12
  structure: Can be divided into three consecutive, non-overlapping segments of equal length (4).
  segments:
    - segment_A: Indices 0-3
    - segment_B: Indices 4-7
    - segment_C: Indices 8-11
output_object:
  type: sequence_of_integers # Corrected type
  length: 12
  structure: Composed of the rearranged segments from the input.
transformation:
  action: segment_rearrangement
  input_segments: [segment_A, segment_B, segment_C]
  rearrangement_order: [segment_B, segment_C, segment_A] # Confirmed order
  output: Concatenation of segments in the specified order (B + C + A).
constraints:
  - Input sequence always contains 12 integers.
  - Output sequence always contains 12 integers.
  - The number and values of integers are preserved, only their positions change.
