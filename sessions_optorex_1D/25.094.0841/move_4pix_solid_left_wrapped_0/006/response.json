The subsequent testing revealed errors across all examples. These errors (`ValueError: Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements. Got shape: (1, 12)`) are not due to incorrect transformation logic but rather an incompatibility between the expected input shape (`(12,)`, a 1D array) and the actual input shape provided by the testing environment (`(1, 12)`, a 2D array).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the B, C, A rearrangement rule holds for all examples using the provided tool execution.\n2.  Update the understanding of the input format to accommodate the `(1, 12)` shape.\n3.  Modify the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this understanding. The core transformation logic remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing all training examples:\n\n"
