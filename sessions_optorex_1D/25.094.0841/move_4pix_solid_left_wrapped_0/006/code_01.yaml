task_description: Rearranges segments of a 12-element integer sequence.
input_object:
  type: sequence_of_integers
  representation: numpy_array # Assumed based on previous code and error message
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - shape: (1, 12) # Inferred from runtime error
    - segmentation:
        type: consecutive_blocks
        count: 3
        segment_length: 4
        segments:
          - name: A
            indices: [0, 1, 2, 3]
          - name: B
            indices: [4, 5, 6, 7]
          - name: C
            indices: [8, 9, 10, 11]
output_object:
  type: sequence_of_integers
  representation: numpy_array # Assumed based on previous code
  properties:
    - length: 12
    - shape: (1, 12) or (12,) # Target shape depends on implementation/requirements
    - derived_from: input_object
transformation:
  type: segment_rearrangement
  action: Permute segments
  input_segments: [A, B, C]
  output_segments_order: [B, C, A]
  details: The input sequence is divided into three segments (A, B, C) of 4 elements each. The output sequence is constructed by concatenating segment B, followed by segment C, followed by segment A.
implementation_note: The input array arrives with shape (1, 12) and needs to be treated as a 1D sequence of 12 elements for slicing and concatenation. Flattening the input array before processing is a necessary step.
