The output sequence also contains only 0s and 1s. The count of each number (eight 0s and four 1s) is preserved between input and output.\n*   **Transformation:** The positions of the numbers are changed. The block of four '1's, initially located at indices 4 through 7 in the input (`0 0 0 0 **1 1 1 1** 0 0 0 0`), moves to the beginning of the sequence in the output, occupying indices 0 through 3 (`**1 1 1 1** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`). The zeros are rearranged accordingly.\n\n**YAML facts:**\n\n"
