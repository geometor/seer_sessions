Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by rearranging its segments.
The input sequence is divided into three equal segments of 4 integers each:
- Segment A: Indices 0-3
- Segment B: Indices 4-7
- Segment C: Indices 8-11
The output sequence is formed by concatenating these segments in the order: 
Segment B, then Segment C, then Segment A.
