*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits.
    *   The digits used include 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
    *   The number of occurrences of each digit is preserved between the input and output.
    *   The linear sequence structure seems insufficient to explain the transformation directly (e.g., simple rotations or block swaps fail on some examples).
    *   The length 12 suggests a 2D grid structure, potentially 3x4 or 4x3.
    *   Testing the 3x4 grid interpretation reveals a consistent pattern across all examples.

## Example 1:

*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**
    *   The core error across all examples (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous assumption about the input format was incorrect. The `transform` function expected a space-separated string, but it received a NumPy array.
    *   The underlying logic identified previously (interpreting the 12 elements as a 3x4 grid and performing a vertical circular shift upwards by one row) appears sound based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Update the understanding of the input format to be a NumPy array of 12 integers.
        2.  Adapt the transformation process to work directly with the NumPy array (reshaping, shifting, flattening).
        3.  Ensure the final output is formatted correctly as a space-separated string, as shown in the desired outputs.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input Data Type: NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`)
    *   Input Shape: (12,) - A 1-dimensional array with 12 elements.
    *   Output Data Type: String (`str`)
    *   Output Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
    *   Grid Interpretation: 3 rows x 4 columns.
    *   Transformation Consistency: The vertical circular shift rule (Row 1 -> Row 3, Row 2 -> Row 1, Row 3 -> Row 2) appears consistent across all provided training examples when applied to the 3x4 grid interpretation.

*   **YAML Facts:**

        steps:

          2: Apply vertical circular shift up by 1 to the grid rows.
          3: Flatten the transformed 2D array back to a 1D sequence/array (12,).
          4: Convert the elements of the flattened sequence to strings and join them with spaces.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input, which is a 1-dimensional NumPy array containing 12 integers.
    2.  Interpret this 1D array as a 3x4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns) by reshaping it. The first 4 elements form the first row, the next 4 form the second row, and the last 4 form the third row.
    3.  Perform a vertical circular shift upwards on the rows of the grid:
        *   Move the contents of the original second row to become the new first row.
        *   Move the contents of the original third row to become the new second row.
        *   Move the contents of the original first row to become the new third row.
    4.  Flatten the transformed 3x4 grid back into a 1-dimensional sequence of 12 integers.
    5.  Convert each integer in the resulting sequence to its string representation.
    6.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces, to form the final output string.
