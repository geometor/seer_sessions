*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits.
    *   The digits used include 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
    *   The number of occurrences of each digit is preserved between the input and output.
    *   The linear sequence structure seems insufficient to explain the transformation directly (e.g., simple rotations or block swaps fail on some examples).
    *   The length 12 suggests a 2D grid structure, potentially 3x4 or 4x3.
    *   Testing the 3x4 grid interpretation reveals a consistent pattern across all examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    task_elements:
      - item: input_sequence
        properties:
          format: sequence of 12 digits
          interpretable_as: 3x4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns)
      - item: output_sequence
        properties:
          format: sequence of 12 digits
          derived_from: transformed 3x4 grid
    transformation:
      action: vertical_circular_shift
      target: rows of the 3x4 grid
      direction: upwards
      magnitude: 1 position
      details:
        - Row 1 moves to Row 3.
        - Row 2 moves to Row 1.
        - Row 3 moves to Row 2.
      post_processing: Flatten the transformed grid back into a sequence.
    relationships:
      - type: structure_mapping
        from: input_sequence
        to: 3x4_grid_representation
      - type: element_preservation
        description: The count of each digit remains the same between input and output.
      - type: sequential_transformation
        steps:
          1: Reshape input sequence to 3x4 grid.
          2: Apply vertical circular shift up by 1 to the grid rows.
          3: Flatten the transformed grid to the output sequence.
