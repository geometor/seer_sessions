task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    properties:
      format: sequence of 12 single digits (space-separated string or 1D array/list)
      structure: Represents a 3x4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns) when read sequentially.
      elements: Integers (observed: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7)
      length: 12
  - item: output_sequence
    properties:
      format: sequence of 12 single digits (space-separated string or 1D array/list)
      structure: Represents the transformed 3x4 grid, flattened sequentially.
      elements: Integers (same as input)
      length: 12
  - item: grid_representation
    properties:
      dimensions: 3 rows, 4 columns
      construction: Input sequence elements fill the grid row by row (first 4 elements are row 0, next 4 are row 1, last 4 are row 2).

transformation:
  type: sequential_grid_manipulation
  steps:
    - name: reshape
      action: Interpret the 1D input sequence as a 2D grid.
      details: Map the 12 elements into a 3x4 grid structure.
    - name: row_shift
      action: Perform a vertical circular shift upwards on the rows of the grid.
      details:
        - The original row 0 moves to become the new row 2.
        - The original row 1 moves to become the new row 0.
        - The original row 2 moves to become the new row 1.
      magnitude: 1 position upwards (circularly).
    - name: flatten
      action: Convert the transformed 2D grid back into a 1D sequence.
      details: Concatenate the rows (new row 0, then new row 1, then new row 2) sequentially.

relationships:
  - type: structure_mapping
    from: input_sequence
    to: grid_representation (3x4)
  - type: element_preservation
    description: The multiset of digits (count of each digit) remains the same between the input and output sequences.
  - type: inverse_structure_mapping
    from: transformed grid_representation (3x4)
    to: output_sequence

validation_notes:
  - The core logic (reshape 3x4, circular shift rows [1, 2, 0], flatten) successfully transforms input to output for all 7 training examples.
  - Previous execution errors were due to input data being passed with incorrect dimensionality (e.g., shape (1, 12) instead of (12,)), not a flaw in the transformation logic itself.
