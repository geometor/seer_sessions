            "text": "*   **General Assessment & Strategy:**\n    *   The core error across all examples (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous assumption about the input format was incorrect. The `transform` function expected a space-separated string, but it received a NumPy array.\n    *   The underlying logic identified previously (interpreting the 12 elements as a 3x4 grid and performing a vertical circular shift upwards by one row) appears sound based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.\n    *   The strategy is to:\n        1.  Update the understanding of the input format to be a NumPy array of 12 integers.\n        2.  Adapt the transformation process to work directly with the NumPy array (reshaping, shifting, flattening).\n        3.  Ensure the final output is formatted correctly as a space-separated string, as shown in the desired outputs.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input Data Type: NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`)\n    *   Input Shape: (12,) - A 1-dimensional array with 12 elements.\n    *   Output Data Type: String (`str`)\n    *   Output Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.\n    *   Grid Interpretation: 3 rows x 4 columns.\n    *   Transformation Consistency: The vertical circular shift rule (Row 1 -> Row 3, Row 2 -> Row 1, Row 3 -> Row 2) appears consistent across all provided training examples when applied to the 3x4 grid interpretation.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
