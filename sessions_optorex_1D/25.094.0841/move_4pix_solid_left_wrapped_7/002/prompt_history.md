*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits.
    *   The digits used include 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
    *   The number of occurrences of each digit is preserved between the input and output.
    *   The linear sequence structure seems insufficient to explain the transformation directly (e.g., simple rotations or block swaps fail on some examples).
    *   The length 12 suggests a 2D grid structure, potentially 3x4 or 4x3.
    *   Testing the 3x4 grid interpretation reveals a consistent pattern across all examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**
