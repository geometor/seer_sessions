For example, in `train_1`, the `5 5` block moves from indices 7, 8 to 3, 4. In `train_3`, `8 8 8` moves from 8, 9, 10 to 4, 5, 6. This consistent difference of -4 suggests a leftward shift.\n    *   Checking other examples confirms this pattern holds, including wrap-around behavior (circular shift). For instance, in `train_4`, the `7` at index 0 moves to index 8 (0 - 4 = -4, which is 8 mod 12).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
