task_description: Transform a sequence of 12 digits by circularly shifting its elements to the left by 4 positions.
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single digits (integers 0-9)
input_object:
  name: input_sequence
  is_a: sequence
output_object:
  name: output_sequence
  is_a: sequence
transformation:
  name: left_circular_shift
  parameters:
    - shift_amount: 4
    - sequence_length: 12
  actions:
    - action: determine_target_index
      description: For each element at index `i` in the input_sequence, calculate the target index `j` in the output_sequence.
      formula: j = (i - shift_amount + sequence_length) % sequence_length
    - action: assign_value
      description: Place the element from input_sequence at index `i` into output_sequence at index `j`.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence is a permutation of the input_sequence.
  - Every element originally at index `i` in the input_sequence is found at index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12` in the output_sequence.
  - The number of occurrences of each digit remains the same between the input and output sequences.
