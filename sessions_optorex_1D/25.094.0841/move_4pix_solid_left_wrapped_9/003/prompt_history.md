*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.
    *   All input and output sequences have a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The digits within the sequences range from 0 to 9.
    *   The core transformation appears to involve rearranging the positions of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the digits themselves are preserved, but their indices change.
    *   The relative order of the non-zero digits seems mostly maintained, suggesting a shift or rotation operation.
    *   Specifically, comparing the positions of identical digits (especially non-zero ones) between input and output reveals a consistent pattern of movement. For example, in `train_1`, the `5 5` block moves from indices 7, 8 to 3, 4. In `train_3`, `8 8 8` moves from 8, 9, 10 to 4, 5, 6. This consistent difference of -4 suggests a leftward shift.
    *   Checking other examples confirms this pattern holds, including wrap-around behavior (circular shift). For instance, in `train_4`, the `7` at index 0 moves to index 8 (0 - 4 = -4, which is 8 mod 12).

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Create a new sequence of the same length (12) for the output, initially empty or filled with placeholders.
    3.  For each element at index `i` (from 0 to 11) in the input sequence:
        a.  Calculate the target index `j` in the output sequence using the formula: `j = (i - 4 + 12) % 12`. This performs a left shift by 4 positions with wrap-around.
        b.  Place the element from the input sequence at index `i` into the output sequence at index `j`.
    4.  Return the completed output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided information shows a discrepancy. The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation as a left circular shift by 4 positions, based on comparing the input and output pairs. The natural language program and the conceptual description of the Python code accurately reflect this logic. However, the execution results indicate that the code, when run, failed to perform the shift and instead returned the input unchanged for all examples.

This suggests one of two possibilities:
1.  There was an error in the *implementation* of the `transform` function used for testing (e.g., it accidentally returned the input list directly instead of the `output_grid`).
2.  There was an error in reporting the results (e.g., the `Transformed Output` was mistakenly populated with the `Input` data).

Given that the input/output pairs *consistently* demonstrate a left circular shift by 4 across all seven training examples, the most likely scenario is an issue with the tested code's execution or reporting, not a flaw in the initial perception of the task rule.

**Strategy:**
The strategy is to reaffirm the originally deduced rule (left circular shift by 4) as it is strongly supported by all provided input/output examples. The YAML facts and natural language program will be refined to state this rule clearly and unambiguously, disregarding the contradictory execution results as likely stemming from an external error. We will proceed assuming the task is indeed a left circular shift by 4.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the shift amount for each example by tracking the position change of the first non-zero element (or a representative block). We use the formula: `output_index = (input_index - shift + length) % length`. Here, `length = 12`. We test the hypothesis `shift = 4`.

*   **Example 1:** `5` at index 7 moves to index 3. `(7 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 15 % 12 = 3`. Matches.
*   **Example 2:** `7` at index 2 moves to index 10. `(2 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 10 % 12 = 10`. Matches.
*   **Example 3:** `8` at index 8 moves to index 4. `(8 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 16 % 12 = 4`. Matches.
*   **Example 4:** `7` at index 0 moves to index 8. `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8 % 12 = 8`. Matches.
*   **Example 5:** `2` at index 0 moves to index 8. `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8 % 12 = 8`. Matches.
*   **Example 6:** `6` at index 9 moves to index 5. `(9 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 17 % 12 = 5`. Matches.
*   **Example 7:** `9` at index 0 moves to index 8. `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8 % 12 = 8`. Matches.

All examples consistently show a left circular shift by 4 positions. The execution results provided previously are inconsistent with the input/output data and should be disregarded for determining the transformation rule.

      - Fixed length.

  description: >
    Each element from the input sequence at index `i` is moved to index `j`
    in the output sequence, where `j` is calculated as `(i - 4 + 12) % 12`.
    This operation preserves all elements and their relative order within the
    circular structure.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence contains the exact same elements as the input_sequence.
  - The position of each element is shifted 4 places to the left, wrapping around from the beginning to the end of the sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence, which is a list of 12 digits.
2.  Define the shift amount as 4 positions to the left.
3.  Define the length of the sequence as 12.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initially filled with a placeholder value (like 0, though this will be overwritten).
5.  Iterate through each index `i` from 0 to 11 of the input sequence.
    a.  Get the digit `d` located at `input_sequence[i]`.
    b.  Calculate the target index `j` for the output sequence using the formula: `j = (i - 4 + 12) % 12`.
    c.  Place the digit `d` into the output sequence at the calculated target index `j`: `output_sequence[j] = d`.
6.  Return the fully populated output sequence.
