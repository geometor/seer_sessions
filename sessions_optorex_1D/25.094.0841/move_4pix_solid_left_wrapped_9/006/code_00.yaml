task_description: Circularly shift a sequence of 12 digits 4 positions to the left.
elements:
  - name: digit_sequence
    type: list of integers
    length: 12
    constraints:
      - contains digits 0-9
input:
  name: input_sequence
  type: digit_sequence
output:
  name: output_sequence
  type: digit_sequence
transformation:
  type: circular_shift
  attributes:
    direction: left
    amount: 4
    modulus: 12 # length of the sequence
actions:
  - action: create_output_sequence
    description: Create a new list of the same size as the input (12), initialized perhaps with zeros.
  - action: map_elements
    description: For each element at index `i` in the input sequence, calculate its target index `j` in the output sequence.
    formula: j = (i - 4 + 12) % 12
  - action: assign_value
    description: Place the value from the input sequence at index `i` into the output sequence at the calculated target index `j`.
relationships:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The value at index `i` in the input sequence corresponds to the value at index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12` in the output sequence.
