task_description: Transform a sequence of digits by circularly shifting its elements to the left.
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    length: 12
    properties:
      - Contains single digits (0-9).
      - Fixed length.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence
    description: The initial sequence of 12 digits.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    description: The resulting sequence after transformation.
transformation:
  action: circular_shift
  parameters:
    direction: left
    amount: 4
    modulus: 12 (length of the sequence)
  description: >
    Each element from the input sequence at index `i` is moved to index `j`
    in the output sequence, where `j` is calculated as `(i - 4 + 12) % 12`.
    This operation preserves all elements and their relative order within the
    circular structure.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence contains the exact same elements as the input_sequence.
  - The position of each element is shifted 4 places to the left, wrapping around from the beginning to the end of the sequence.
