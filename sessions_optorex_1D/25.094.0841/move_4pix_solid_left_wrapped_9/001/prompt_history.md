*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.
    *   All input and output sequences have a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The digits within the sequences range from 0 to 9.
    *   The core transformation appears to involve rearranging the positions of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the digits themselves are preserved, but their indices change.
    *   The relative order of the non-zero digits seems mostly maintained, suggesting a shift or rotation operation.
    *   Specifically, comparing the positions of identical digits (especially non-zero ones) between input and output reveals a consistent pattern of movement. For example, in `train_1`, the `5 5` block moves from indices 7, 8 to 3, 4. In `train_3`, `8 8 8` moves from 8, 9, 10 to 4, 5, 6. This consistent difference of -4 suggests a leftward shift.
    *   Checking other examples confirms this pattern holds, including wrap-around behavior (circular shift). For instance, in `train_4`, the `7` at index 0 moves to index 8 (0 - 4 = -4, which is 8 mod 12).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Circularly shift a sequence of digits to the left.
    elements:
      - name: digit_sequence
        type: list of integers
        length: 12
        properties: contains digits 0-9
    input:
      name: input_sequence
      type: digit_sequence
    output:
      name: output_sequence
      type: digit_sequence
    transformation:
      type: circular_shift
      properties:
        direction: left
        amount: 4 positions
        wrap_around: true
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving each element 4 positions to the left, wrapping around the ends of the sequence.
      - The value at index `i` in the input sequence moves to index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12` in the output sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Create a new sequence of the same length (12) for the output, initially empty or filled with placeholders.
    3.  For each element at index `i` (from 0 to 11) in the input sequence:
        a.  Calculate the target index `j` in the output sequence using the formula: `j = (i - 4 + 12) % 12`. This performs a left shift by 4 positions with wrap-around.
        b.  Place the element from the input sequence at index `i` into the output sequence at index `j`.
    4.  Return the completed output sequence.
