Input:
  type: Sequence # Specifically, a list or array-like structure (e.g., numpy.ndarray)
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9 # Based on observed examples
  length: 12
Output:
  type: Sequence # Assumed to be the same type as Input
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9 # Based on observed examples
  length: 12
Transformation:
  type: Rearrangement
  operation: Cyclic Shift
  direction: Left
  amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is derived from the Input sequence.
  - The elements and their counts are conserved between Input and Output.
  - Each element at index `i` in the Output corresponds to the element at index `(i + 4) mod 12` in the Input.
Input_Processing_Note: The input is received as a numerical sequence object (like a list or NumPy array), not a string requiring parsing.
