            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution results indicate a type mismatch error. The `transform` function was designed based on the initial string representation of the examples, expecting a string input that it would then parse (`input_str.split()`). However, the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method. This confirms that the input format during execution differs from the format presented in the initial problem description. The underlying transformation logic (cyclic left shift by 4) appears correct based on visual inspection of all examples, but the implementation failed due to incorrect assumptions about the input data type. The strategy is to update the understanding of the input format and adjust the natural language program accordingly, preparing the coder to handle list-like or array-like numerical input directly.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nNo complex calculations are needed. The primary metric derived is the consistent input/output structure across all examples, despite the initial type misunderstanding:\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently observed as `numpy.ndarray` during execution (inferred from error messages).\n*   **Output Type (Expected):** Assumed to be the same type as the input, `numpy.ndarray` or a similar numerical sequence (e.g., list).\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Element Type:** Integers (0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 observed).\n*   **Transformation Rule Consistency:** The rule \"cyclic left shift by 4 positions\" holds true for all 7 provided training examples when applied to the sequence of numbers.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
