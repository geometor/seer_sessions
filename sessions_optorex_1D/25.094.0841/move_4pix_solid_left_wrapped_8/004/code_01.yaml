Input:
  type: Sequence
  data_type: List[Integer] # Or potentially np.ndarray[int] based on context
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9 (observed)
  length: 12
Output:
  type: Sequence
  data_type: List[Integer] # Or np.ndarray[int]
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9 (observed)
  length: 12
Transformation:
  type: Permutation # Specific type of rearrangement
  operation: Cyclic Shift
  direction: Left
  amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is derived from the Input sequence by rearranging elements.
  - The multiset of elements (numbers and their counts) is conserved between Input and Output.
  - The element at index `i` in the Output sequence corresponds to the element at index `(i + 4) mod 12` in the Input sequence.
Constraints:
  - Input sequence length is fixed at 12.
  - Shift amount is fixed at 4.
