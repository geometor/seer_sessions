Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single lines containing space-separated integers.
2.  **Data Type:** The elements are single-digit non-negative integers (specifically 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 appear in the examples).
3.  **Sequence Length:** In all examples, the input and output sequences have the same length, which is 12.
4.  **Conservation of Elements:** The multiset of numbers in the output is identical to the multiset of numbers in the input. This implies the transformation is a rearrangement or permutation of the input sequence.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs suggests a positional shift.
    *   In `train_1`, `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4` becomes `4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4`. The elements at indices 0-3 (`4 4 4 4`) move to indices 8-11. The elements at indices 4-11 (`4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4`) move to indices 0-7. This is consistent with a cyclic left shift by 4 positions.
    *   Let's verify with `train_2`: Input `0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0`. Shift left by 4: `4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. This matches the output.
    *   Let's verify with `train_3`: Input `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0`. Shift left by 4: `9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9`. This matches the output.
    *   Let's verify with `train_7`: Input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0`. Shift left by 4: `0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0`. This matches the output.
6.  **Consistent Operation:** The transformation appears to be a consistent cyclic left shift by 4 positions across all examples, regardless of the specific numbers or their arrangement (like the position of zeros).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: Sequence
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9
  length: 12
Output:
  type: Sequence
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9
  length: 12
Transformation:
  type: Rearrangement
  operation: Cyclic Shift
  direction: Left
  amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is derived from the Input sequence.
  - The elements and their counts are conserved between Input and Output.
  - Each element at index `i` in the Output corresponds to the element at index `(i + 4) mod 12` in the Input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a cyclic left rotation on the sequence by 4 positions. This means the first 4 elements move to the end of the sequence, and the remaining elements shift 4 positions to the left.
3.  Output the resulting sequence.
