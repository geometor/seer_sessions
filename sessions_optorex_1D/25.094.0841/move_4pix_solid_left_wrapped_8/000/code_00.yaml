Input:
  type: Sequence
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9
  length: 12
Output:
  type: Sequence
  elements:
    type: Integer
    range: 0-9
  length: 12
Transformation:
  type: Rearrangement
  operation: Cyclic Shift
  direction: Left
  amount: 4 positions
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is derived from the Input sequence.
  - The elements and their counts are conserved between Input and Output.
  - Each element at index `i` in the Output corresponds to the element at index `(i + 4) mod 12` in the Input.
