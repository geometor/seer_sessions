Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The core element is a sequence (or list) of integers.
*   Each sequence in the examples has a fixed length of 12 elements.
*   The integers within the sequences vary, including 0 and other single digits (1, 3, 4, 5, 6).
*   The transformation modifies the *position* of the elements within the sequence, but not the elements themselves or their count.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Structure: Sequence of integers
  Length: 12
Transformation:
  Type: Positional rearrangement
  Operation: Circular shift
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 4 positions
Properties:
  - Preserves element values
  - Preserves element counts
  - Changes element positions
  - Sequence length remains constant (12)
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is the input sequence circularly shifted 4 positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a circular left shift operation on the sequence by 4 positions. This means the first 4 elements are moved to the end of the sequence in their original order, and all other elements shift 4 positions towards the beginning.
3.  Return the resulting sequence.
