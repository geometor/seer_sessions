Input:
  Type: String
  Content: Space-separated integers
  Processing: Requires parsing into a list of integers.
Output:
  Type: String
  Content: Space-separated integers derived from the transformed list.
Data_Structure:
  Type: List of integers
  Length: 12 (after parsing)
Transformation:
  Action: Circular shift
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 4 positions
Properties:
  - Preserves element values
  - Preserves element counts
  - Changes element positions
  - Sequence length remains constant (12) after parsing
Relationship:
  - The output list is the parsed input list circularly shifted 4 positions to the left.
  - The output string is the space-separated representation of the transformed list.
