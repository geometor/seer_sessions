Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The core element is a sequence (or list) of integers.
*   Each sequence in the examples has a fixed length of 12 elements.
*   The integers within the sequences vary, including 0 and other single digits (1, 3, 4, 5, 6).
*   The transformation modifies the *position* of the elements within the sequence, but not the elements themselves or their count.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Structure: Sequence of integers
  Length: 12
Transformation:
  Type: Positional rearrangement
  Operation: Circular shift
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 4 positions
Properties:
  - Preserves element values
  - Preserves element counts
  - Changes element positions
  - Sequence length remains constant (12)
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is the input sequence circularly shifted 4 positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a circular left shift operation on the sequence by 4 positions. This means the first 4 elements are moved to the end of the sequence in their original order, and all other elements shift 4 positions towards the beginning.
3.  Return the resulting sequence.
```python
import numpy as np
import collections

"""
Transforms the input sequence by interpreting it as a 3x4 grid (row-major order)
and performing a circular upward shift of the rows by one position. The first
row moves to the last position, and all other rows shift up. The resulting grid
is then flattened back into a sequence.

def reshape_to_grid(sequence, rows, cols):
  """Reshapes a flat sequence into a 2D grid (list of lists)."""
  if len(sequence) != rows * cols:
    raise ValueError("Sequence length does not match grid dimensions")
  grid = []
  for i in range(rows):
    start_index = i * cols
    end_index = start_index + cols
    grid.append(list(sequence[start_index:end_index]))
  return grid

def flatten_grid(grid):
  """Flattens a 2D grid (list of lists) into a flat sequence."""
  return [item for sublist in grid for item in sublist]

def shift_rows_up(grid):

  if not grid:
    return []
  # Use collections.deque for efficient rotation
  rows_deque = collections.deque(grid)
  rows_deque.rotate(-1) # Negative rotation shifts elements to the left (upward)
  return list(rows_deque)

    """
