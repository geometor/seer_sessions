Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The core element is a sequence (or list) of integers.
*   Each sequence in the examples has a fixed length of 12 elements.
*   The integers within the sequences vary, including 0 and other single digits (1, 3, 4, 5, 6).
*   The transformation modifies the *position* of the elements within the sequence, but not the elements themselves or their count.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Structure: Sequence of integers
  Length: 12
Transformation:
  Type: Positional rearrangement
  Operation: Circular shift
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 4 positions
Properties:
  - Preserves element values
  - Preserves element counts
  - Changes element positions
  - Sequence length remains constant (12)
Relationship:
  - Output sequence is the input sequence circularly shifted 4 positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a circular left shift operation on the sequence by 4 positions. This means the first 4 elements are moved to the end of the sequence in their original order, and all other elements shift 4 positions towards the beginning.
3.  Return the resulting sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code execution failed across all examples with the error "Sequence length does not match grid dimensions". This indicates a fundamental issue with how the input data was being processed before the intended transformation was applied. The error message strongly suggests that the input, initially perceived as a list or sequence ready for reshaping, was actually treated as a single string.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Correct Input Processing:** Recognize that the input is a string of space-separated integers and must be parsed into a list of integers first.
2.  **Re-evaluate Transformation:** Apply the original hypothesis (circular left shift by 4 positions) to the *parsed* list of integers for each example.
3.  **Verify Consistency:** Check if this corrected process (parse then shift) yields the expected output for all provided training examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the parsing step and the confirmed transformation rule. The grid interpretation appears to have been an unnecessary complication and should be removed unless evidence supports it.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the input format, sequence length after parsing, and the effect of a circular left shift by 4.
