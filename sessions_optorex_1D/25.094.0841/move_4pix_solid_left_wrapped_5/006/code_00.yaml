Data:
  Structure: Sequence of 12 integers, interpretable as a 3x4 grid (row-major).
  Rows: 3
  Columns: 4
Transformation:
  Type: Grid manipulation followed by flattening.
  Operation: Circular upward shift of grid rows.
  Magnitude: 1 row position.
  Details:
    - The first row of the grid moves to the last row position.
    - All other rows shift up by one position.
  Output: The modified grid is flattened back into a sequence of 12 integers.
Properties:
  - Preserves element values.
  - Preserves element counts.
  - Changes element positions based on row shifts.
  - Sequence length remains constant (12).
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is derived by reshaping the input into a 3x4 grid, circularly shifting the rows upward by one, and flattening the result.
