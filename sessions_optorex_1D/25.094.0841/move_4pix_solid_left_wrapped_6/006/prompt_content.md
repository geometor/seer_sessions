"""
Transforms an input sequence (list) of 12 digits by cyclically shifting the 
subsequence of non-zero elements. The amount of the shift is determined by the 
count (N) of these non-zero elements according to a specific set of rules:
- N in {1, 2, 3, 4}: shift = 8
- N = 5: shift = 4
- N = 7: shift = 5
- N = 8: shift = 2
- Otherwise: shift = 0 (default)
The shifted non-zero sequence is then placed back into a list of 12 zeros, 
starting at an index calculated by (original_first_non_zero_index + shift_amount) % 12,
wrapping around cyclically.
