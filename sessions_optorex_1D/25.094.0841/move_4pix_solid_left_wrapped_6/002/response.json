            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue identified is a type mismatch during input processing. The provided `transform` function expects a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and uses the `.split()` method in the `_parse_input` helper function. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the function was actually called with a NumPy array during testing.\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying non-zero elements, counting them, determining a shift amount based on this count, finding the first non-zero index, and cyclically placing the non-zero elements in the output array based on the calculated shift) appears consistent with the patterns observed across all training examples, as verified by manual calculation below.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the input handling to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step. The rest of the logic, including the shift calculation based on the count (`N`), seems sound and should produce the correct outputs once the input type issue is resolved.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                        | Non-Zero Subsequence | N | first\\_nz\\_idx\\_in | Shift (Rule) | output\\_start\\_idx (calc) | Expected Output Sequence                  | Actual Output Sequence (from data)        | Match |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------ | :------------------- | :-: | :----------------- | :-----------: | :------------------------: | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----: |\n| 1       | `[6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6]`           | `[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]`  | 8 | 0                  | 2             | (0+2)%12=2                 | `[0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0]`           | `[0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0]`           | Yes   |\n| 2       | `[0,0,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | `[9,9,9,9]`          | 4 | 2                  | 8             | (2+8)%12=10                | `[9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]`           | `[9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]`           | Yes   |\n| 3       | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | `[9]`                | 1 | 5                  | 8             | (5+8)%12=1                 | `[0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | `[0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | Yes   |\n| 4       | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`           | `[7,7,7]`            | 3 | 5                  | 8             | (5+8)%12=1                 | `[0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | `[0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`           | Yes   |\n| 5       | `[7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7]`           | `[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`    | 7 | 0                  | 5             | (0+5)%12=5                 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`           | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`           | Yes   |\n| 6       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]`           | `[9,9]`              | 2 | 9                  | 8             | (9+8)%12=5                 | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0]`           | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0]`           | Yes   |\n| 7       | `[9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9]`           | `[9,9,9,9,9]`        | 5 | 0                  | 4             | (0+4)%12=4                 | `[0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0]`           | `[0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0]`           | Yes   |\n\n*Note: The `Shift (Rule)` column reflects the shift amount dictated by the count `N` based on the established rules ({1,2,3,4}: 8, 5: 4, 7: 5, 8: 2).
