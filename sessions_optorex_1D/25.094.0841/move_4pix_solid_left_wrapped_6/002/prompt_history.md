## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence is constant across all examples (12 elements).
3.  **Element Preservation:** The non-zero digits present in the input are exactly the same non-zero digits present in the output, and their relative order is preserved. The number of zeros is also preserved.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements. Specifically, the subsequence of non-zero elements is extracted from the input and then placed back into a sequence of zeros at a new starting position.
5.  **Repositioning Rule:** The placement seems to involve a cyclic shift of the non-zero subsequence. The amount of this shift depends on the *count* of non-zero elements.
6.  **Shift Calculation:**
    *   Identify the index of the *first* non-zero element in the input (`first_nz_idx_in`).
    *   Count the total number of non-zero elements (`N`).
    *   Determine a `shift_amount` based on `N` using the observed pattern:
        *   N=1 => shift=8
        *   N=2 => shift=8
        *   N=3 => shift=8
        *   N=4 => shift=8
        *   N=5 => shift=4
        *   N=7 => shift=5
        *   N=8 => shift=2
    *   The starting index for the non-zero subsequence in the output (`output_start_idx`) is calculated as `(first_nz_idx_in + shift_amount) % 12`.
7.  **Placement:** The extracted non-zero subsequence is placed into an initially all-zero output sequence of length 12, starting at `output_start_idx`, wrapping around the end of the sequence if necessary.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new list containing only the non-zero integers from the input list, maintaining their original relative order. Let this be the `non_zero_sequence`.
3.  Count the number of elements in the `non_zero_sequence`. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Find the index of the first non-zero element in the original input list. Let this be `first_nz_idx_in`. Handle the case where there are no non-zero elements (although not present in examples, the output would be all zeros).
5.  Determine the `shift_amount` based on the value of `N` according to the following rules:
    *   If `N` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, the `shift_amount` is 8.
    *   If `N` is 5, the `shift_amount` is 4.
    *   If `N` is 7, the `shift_amount` is 5.
    *   If `N` is 8, the `shift_amount` is 2.
    *   (Assume these cover all relevant cases based on provided examples).
6.  Calculate the starting index for placing the `non_zero_sequence` in the output list: `output_start_idx = (first_nz_idx_in + shift_amount) % 12`.
7.  Create the output list, initially filled with 12 zeros.
8.  Iterate through the `non_zero_sequence`. For each element, place it into the output list at the position `(output_start_idx + current_index_in_non_zero_sequence) % 12`.
9.  Convert the output list back into a space-separated string.

"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 digits by cyclically shifting the subsequence 
of non-zero elements based on the count of these non-zero elements.

1. Parses the input string into a list of 12 integers.
2. Extracts the non-zero elements into a separate list, preserving their order.
3. Finds the index of the first non-zero element in the original input.
4. Counts the number of non-zero elements (N).
5. Determines a shift amount based on N using a specific mapping:
   - N in {1, 2, 3, 4}: shift = 8
   - N = 5: shift = 4
   - N = 7: shift = 5
   - N = 8: shift = 2
   - (Other values of N are not handled based on examples, defaults to 0 shift if needed).
6. Calculates the starting index for the non-zero subsequence in the output list 
   using the formula: (first_non_zero_index + shift_amount) % 12.
7. Creates an output list of 12 zeros.
8. Places the extracted non-zero subsequence into the output list starting at the 
   calculated index, wrapping around the end of the list cyclically.
9. Formats the output list back into a space-separated string.
