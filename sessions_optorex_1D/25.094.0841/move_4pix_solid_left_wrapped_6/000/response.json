The number of zeros is also preserved.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the elements. Specifically, the subsequence of non-zero elements is extracted from the input and then placed back into a sequence of zeros at a new starting position.\n5.  **Repositioning Rule:** The placement seems to involve a cyclic shift of the non-zero subsequence. The amount of this shift depends on the *count* of non-zero elements.\n6.  **Shift Calculation:**\n    *   Identify the index of the *first* non-zero element in the input (`first_nz_idx_in`).\n    *   Count the total number of non-zero elements (`N`).\n    *   Determine a `shift_amount` based on `N` using the observed pattern:\n        *   N=1 => shift=8\n        *   N=2 => shift=8\n        *   N=3 => shift=8\n        *   N=4 => shift=8\n        *   N=5 => shift=4\n        *   N=7 => shift=5\n        *   N=8 => shift=2\n    *   The starting index for the non-zero subsequence in the output (`output_start_idx`) is calculated as `(first_nz_idx_in + shift_amount) % 12`.\n7.  **Placement:** The extracted non-zero subsequence is placed into an initially all-zero output sequence of length 12, starting at `output_start_idx`, wrapping around the end of the sequence if necessary.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new list containing only the non-zero integers from the input list, maintaining their original relative order. Let this be the `non_zero_sequence`.\n3.  Count the number of elements in the `non_zero_sequence`. Let this count be `N`.\n4.  Find the index of the first non-zero element in the original input list. Let this be `first_nz_idx_in`. Handle the case where there are no non-zero elements (although not present in examples, the output would be all zeros).\n5.  Determine the `shift_amount` based on the value of `N` according to the following rules:\n    *   If `N` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, the `shift_amount` is 8.\n    *   If `N` is 5, the `shift_amount` is 4.\n    *   If `N` is 7, the `shift_amount` is 5.\n    *   If `N` is 8, the `shift_amount` is 2.\n    *   (Assume these cover all relevant cases based on provided examples).\n6.  Calculate the starting index for placing the `non_zero_sequence` in the output list: `output_start_idx = (first_nz_idx_in + shift_amount) % 12`.\n7.  Create the output list, initially filled with 12 zeros.\n8.  Iterate through the `non_zero_sequence`. For each element, place it into the output list at the position `(output_start_idx + current_index_in_non_zero_sequence) % 12`.\n9.  Convert the output list back into a space-separated string."
