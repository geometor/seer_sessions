            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code implements the logic derived from the initial analysis: identify non-zero elements, determine a shift based on their count, find the first non-zero index, calculate a new starting position, and place the non-zero elements cyclically into a new list. All training examples failed with the same error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n\nThis specific error usually arises when a boolean check (like `if condition:`) is performed on a data structure that contains multiple boolean values (e.g., a NumPy array resulting from a comparison like `array > 0`). While the provided `transform` function explicitly uses Python lists and integer comparisons (`if x != 0:`), the error suggests that the environment executing the code might be passing inputs as NumPy arrays, or there's an interaction with NumPy elsewhere in the test harness.\n\nThe core transformation *logic* derived previously (extract, count, shift, place cyclically) appears correct, as manually verified against all examples. The issue seems to be an *implementation detail* related to data types (list vs. array) or the execution environment, rather than a flaw in the perceived transformation rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic based on manual verification of all examples.\n2.  Refine the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to be precise about the steps and data structures (assuming standard Python lists as input/output for the core logic).\n3.  The Coder phase will need to address the potential data type mismatch, possibly by ensuring inputs are treated as lists or by using NumPy-safe comparisons if arrays are indeed involved.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nManual verification of the transformation logic against all training examples:\n\n| Example | Input List                          | Output List                         | Non-Zeros (NZ)        | N (Count NZ) | First NZ Index (Input) | Shift (Rule: N={1..4}:8, N=5:4, N=7:5, N=8:2) | Calculated Start Index (Output) (first + shift) % 12 | Matches Example Output? |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6]`         | `[0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0]`         | `[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]` | 8            | 0                        | 2                                              | (0 + 2) % 12 = 2                                       | Yes                     |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]`         | `[9,9,9,9]`       | 4            | 2                        | 8                                              | (2 + 8) % 12 = 10                                      | Yes                     |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[9]`             | 1            | 5                        | 8                                              | (5 + 8) % 12 = 1                                       | Yes                     |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`         | `[0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[7,7,7]`         | 3            | 5                        | 8                                              | (5 + 8) % 12 = 1                                       | Yes                     |\n| train_5 | `[7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7]`         | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`         | `[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]` | 7            | 0                        | 5                                              | (0 + 5) % 12 = 5                                       | Yes                     |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]`         | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0]`         | `[9,9]`           | 2            | 9                        | 8                                              | (9 + 8) % 12 = 5                                       | Yes                     |\n| train_7 | `[9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9]`         | `[0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0]`         | `[9,9,9,9,9]`     | 5            | 0                        | 4                                              | (0 + 4) % 12 = 4                                       | Yes                     |\n\n*Conclusion*: The rule holds for all examples.
