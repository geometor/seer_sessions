            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences of 12 integers.\n2.  **Content:** The sequences contain the digit 0 and one other non-zero digit (e.g., 7, 9, 3, 6). The non-zero digits often appear in contiguous blocks.\n3.  **Transformation:** The positions of the digits change between the input and output, but the digits themselves and their counts remain the same. The transformation appears to be a positional rearrangement of the entire sequence.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** Observing the examples, specifically how the initial elements of the input sequence relate to the final elements of the output sequence, suggests a cyclical shift or rotation. Comparing the first few elements of the input with the last few elements of the output, and vice-versa, reveals a consistent pattern. For instance, in `train_1`, `0 7 7 7` from the start of the input appears at the end of the output. In `train_3`, `3 3 3 3` from the start of the input appears at the end of the output. This holds true for all examples. The amount shifted seems constant. Let's check `train_1`: Input `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0`. Output `7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7`. The first 4 elements (`0 7 7 7`) have moved to the end. This suggests a left rotation by 4 positions. Let's verify this across other examples.\n    *   `train_5`: Input `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6`. Left rotate 4: `0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0`. Matches output.\n    *   `train_7`: Input `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0`. Left rotate 4: `0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Matches output.\n    The pattern consistently appears to be a left circular shift by 4 positions.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
