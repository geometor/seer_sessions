Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences of 12 integers.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain the digit 0 and one other non-zero digit (e.g., 7, 9, 3, 6). The non-zero digits often appear in contiguous blocks.
3.  **Transformation:** The positions of the digits change between the input and output, but the digits themselves and their counts remain the same. The transformation appears to be a positional rearrangement of the entire sequence.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** Observing the examples, specifically how the initial elements of the input sequence relate to the final elements of the output sequence, suggests a cyclical shift or rotation. Comparing the first few elements of the input with the last few elements of the output, and vice-versa, reveals a consistent pattern. For instance, in `train_1`, `0 7 7 7` from the start of the input appears at the end of the output. In `train_3`, `3 3 3 3` from the start of the input appears at the end of the output. This holds true for all examples. The amount shifted seems constant. Let's check `train_1`: Input `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0`. Output `7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7`. The first 4 elements (`0 7 7 7`) have moved to the end. This suggests a left rotation by 4 positions. Let's verify this across other examples.
    *   `train_5`: Input `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6`. Left rotate 4: `0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0`. Matches output.
    *   `train_7`: Input `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0`. Left rotate 4: `0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Matches output.
    The pattern consistently appears to be a left circular shift by 4 positions.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list
      - element_type: integer
      - length: 12
      - content: digits (0 and one other non-zero digit per example)
transformation:
  - action: circular_shift
    direction: left
    amount: 4 positions
  - alternate_view: split_and_swap
    split_point: after the 4th element
    part_1: first 4 elements
    part_2: last 8 elements
    reorder: concatenate part_2 followed by part_1
relationship:
  - type: positional_mapping
    rule: output_index = (input_index - 4 + 12) % 12
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Perform a circular left shift (rotation) on the sequence by 4 positions. (Alternatively: Take the first 4 digits and move them to the end of the sequence, shifting the remaining 8 digits to the beginning).
3.  Return the resulting sequence as the output.
```python
"""

    # Parse the input string into a list of integers
