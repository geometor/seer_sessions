**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits. Each input sequence is mapped to an output sequence of the same length (12 digits). The transformation appears to involve rearranging the positions of the digits within the sequence. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern of movement emerges. Specifically, elements seem to shift to the left, and elements shifted off the beginning reappear at the end.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: list
      properties:
        - elements: list of digits (0-9)
        - length: 12
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: list
      properties:
        - elements: list of digits (0-9)
        - length: 12
  - Element:
      type: digit
      properties:
        - value: 0-9
        - position: index (0-11)

Actions:
  - Circular_Shift_Left:
      actor: System
      object: Input_Sequence
      properties:
        - shift_amount: 4 positions
      result: Output_Sequence

Relationships:
  - Positional_Mapping:
      description: Each element at index `i` in the Input_Sequence moves to index `(i - 4) mod 12` in the Output_Sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Shift each digit in the sequence 4 positions to the left.
3.  When a digit is shifted past the beginning (index 0), wrap it around to the end of the sequence. Specifically, a digit originally at index `i` moves to index `(i - 4 + 12) % 12`.
4.  The rearranged sequence is the output.
