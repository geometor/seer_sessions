**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code failed execution because it assumed the input data was a string of space-separated digits (`input_str: str`) and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the input data type is actually a NumPy array.

The core transformation logic identified previously (a circular left shift of 4 positions) appears consistent across all examples when visually inspected. The strategy is to adapt the understanding of the input data type while retaining the identified transformation rule. The focus should be on processing the input as an array-like structure directly, eliminating the need for string parsing.

**Metrics Gathering**

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (based on error message).
*   **Input Shape:** All examples show a 1D array/sequence of length 12.
*   **Output Type:** Expected to be the same type and shape as the input (NumPy array, length 12).
*   **Transformation:** A consistent circular left shift by 4 positions is observed across all 7 training examples.
    *   Example 1: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 2: `[0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0]` -> `[9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 3: `[6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6]` -> `[6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 4: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 5: `[0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]` -> `[0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 6: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Shift left 4)
    *   Example 7: `[0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0]` -> `[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 8]` (Shift left 4)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input, which is an array-like sequence (e.g., NumPy array) of 12 digits.
2.  Perform a circular shift of the elements in the sequence 4 positions to the left.
3.  Elements shifted from the beginning of the sequence (indices 0, 1, 2, 3) wrap around to the end (indices 8, 9, 10, 11, respectively).
4.  Return the resulting sequence, maintaining the original data type and structure.
