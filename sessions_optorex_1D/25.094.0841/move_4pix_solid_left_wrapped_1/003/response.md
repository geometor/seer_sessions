"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 digits by performing a circular left shift of 4 positions.
Each digit in the input sequence at index `i` is moved to the index `(i - 4) mod 12`
in the output sequence. Digits shifted off the beginning wrap around to the end.
The input is expected to be a NumPy array.
