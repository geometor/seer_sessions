*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence has a specific length. The output sequence always has the same length as the corresponding input sequence.
    *   Input sequences consist of an initial subsequence of non-zero digits followed by a subsequence of zero digits (which might be empty if the input contains no zeros).
    *   The output sequence replaces the trailing zeros of the input sequence.
    *   The replacement pattern seems to be derived from the initial non-zero part of the input sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Fill trailing zeros with a repeating pattern from the start of the sequence.

    Objects:
      - Input_Sequence:
          Properties:
            - elements: List[int]
            - length: int
            - has_trailing_zeros: bool
            - active_part_end_index: int  # Index of the last non-zero element
      - Output_Sequence:
          Properties:
            - elements: List[int]
            - length: int  # Same as Input_Sequence length
      - Active_Subsequence:
          Properties:
            - elements: List[int] # The part of Input_Sequence before trailing zeros
            - length: int

    Relationships:
      - Output_Sequence.length == Input_Sequence.length
      - Active_Subsequence is derived from Input_Sequence (elements from index 0 up to active_part_end_index).
      - The part of Output_Sequence corresponding to the trailing zeros in Input_Sequence is filled by repeating the Active_Subsequence.

    Actions:
      - Identify the Active_Subsequence in the Input_Sequence by finding the last non-zero digit.
      - Determine the portion of the Input_Sequence consisting of trailing zeros (the "fill" portion).
      - Construct the Output_Sequence:
          - Copy the Active_Subsequence to the beginning of the Output_Sequence.
          - Fill the remaining positions (corresponding to the input's trailing zeros) by repeating the elements of the Active_Subsequence cyclically until the Output_Sequence reaches the required length.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Identify the 'active subsequence' which consists of all digits from the beginning of the input sequence up to and including the last non-zero digit. If there are no non-zero digits, the active subsequence is empty (though this case doesn't appear in the examples). If there are no zero digits, the active subsequence is the entire input sequence.
    3.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
    4.  Initialize the output sequence.
    5.  Iterate through the positions of the output sequence from the first position up to the determined length.
    6.  For each position in the output sequence, determine the corresponding digit by taking the digit from the 'active subsequence' at the index calculated by `(current_position_index MOD length_of_active_subsequence)`.
    7.  Assemble the resulting digits into the final output sequence.

"""
The transformation rule takes a sequence of single-digit integers as input.
It identifies the 'active subsequence' which consists of all digits from the beginning 
of the input sequence up to and including the last non-zero digit. 
If there are no trailing zeros, the output is identical to the input.
If there are trailing zeros, the output sequence is constructed by repeating the 
'active subsequence' cyclically until the output sequence reaches the same length 
as the input sequence.
