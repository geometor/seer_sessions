The output sequence always has the same length as the corresponding input sequence.\n    *   Input sequences consist of an initial subsequence of non-zero digits followed by a subsequence of zero digits (which might be empty if the input contains no zeros).\n    *   The output sequence replaces the trailing zeros of the input sequence.\n    *   The replacement pattern seems to be derived from the initial non-zero part of the input sequence.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
