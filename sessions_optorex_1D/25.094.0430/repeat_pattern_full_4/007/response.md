"""
The transformation rule generates an output sequence by cyclically repeating an initial 
subsequence derived from the input sequence. 

1.  Identify the 'active subsequence' in the input sequence, which consists of all 
    elements from the beginning up to and including the last non-zero element.
2.  If the input sequence contains only zeros or is empty, the active subsequence is 
    considered empty. The output is a sequence of zeros of the same length as the input.
3.  If the active subsequence is not empty, determine its length (L_active) and the 
    total length of the input sequence (L_input).
4.  Construct the output sequence of length L_input by repeating the active subsequence 
    cyclically. For each position `i` (from 0 to L_input - 1) in the output sequence, 
    the value is taken from the active subsequence at index `i % L_active`.
