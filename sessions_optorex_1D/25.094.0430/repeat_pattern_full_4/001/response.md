"""
The transformation rule takes a sequence of single-digit integers as input.
It identifies the 'active subsequence' which consists of all digits from the beginning 
of the input sequence up to and including the last non-zero digit. 
If there are no trailing zeros, the output is identical to the input.
If there are trailing zeros, the output sequence is constructed by repeating the 
'active subsequence' cyclically until the output sequence reaches the same length 
as the input sequence.
