Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** Each input is a string containing space-separated integers.
*   **Structure:** The inputs seem to consist of three parts:
    1.  A sequence of non-zero integers (`S`).
    2.  An immediate repetition of the same sequence (`S`).
    3.  A sequence of zero integers (`0`s) acting as padding.
*   **Output Data:** Each output is also a string of space-separated integers.
*   **Relationship:** The output appears to be formed by replacing the trailing zeros in the input with elements from the initial repeating sequence (`S`), cycling through `S` as needed until the output string reaches the same length as the input string.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Padding Replacement

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Structure:
    - Sequence_S:
        Type: List of non-zero integers
        Property: Represents the fundamental repeating unit.
    - Repetition_S:
        Type: List of non-zero integers
        Property: An identical copy of Sequence_S immediately following it.
    - Padding_Zeros:
        Type: List of zero integers
        Property: Variable length padding at the end.
  Overall_Length: Fixed length for each input/output pair.

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Structure:
    - Generated_Sequence:
        Type: List of integers
        Property: Has the same Overall_Length as the input.
        Derivation: Formed by repeating Sequence_S cyclically until the Overall_Length is reached.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace Padding_Zeros
  Method:
    1. Identify the fundamental repeating sequence (Sequence_S) by observing the pattern before the zeros (e.g., the first half of the non-zero part).
    2. Determine the total length of the input string.
    3. Generate the output by repeating Sequence_S cyclically until the generated sequence matches the total length of the input.
  Relationship: The zeros in the input act as placeholders that are filled by continuing the pattern established by Sequence_S.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of integers.
2.  Determine the total length of the input list.
3.  Find the index of the first zero in the list. This marks the end of the initial non-zero sequence block.
4.  Calculate the length of the fundamental repeating sequence by dividing the index of the first zero by two.
5.  Extract this fundamental repeating sequence from the beginning of the input list.
6.  Initialize an empty output list.
7.  Repeatedly append the elements of the fundamental repeating sequence to the output list, cycling through the sequence, until the output list's length equals the total length of the original input list.
8.  Convert the generated output list back into a space-separated string.
