A sequence of non-zero integers (`S`).\n    2.  An immediate repetition of the same sequence (`S`).\n    3.  A sequence of zero integers (`0`s) acting as padding.\n*   **Output Data:** Each output is also a string of space-separated integers.\n*   **Relationship:** The output appears to be formed by replacing the trailing zeros in the input with elements from the initial repeating sequence (`S`), cycling through `S` as needed until the output string reaches the same length as the input string.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
