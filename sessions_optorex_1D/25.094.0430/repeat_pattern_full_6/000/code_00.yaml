Task: Sequence Padding Replacement

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Structure:
    - Sequence_S:
        Type: List of non-zero integers
        Property: Represents the fundamental repeating unit.
    - Repetition_S:
        Type: List of non-zero integers
        Property: An identical copy of Sequence_S immediately following it.
    - Padding_Zeros:
        Type: List of zero integers
        Property: Variable length padding at the end.
  Overall_Length: Fixed length for each input/output pair.

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Structure:
    - Generated_Sequence:
        Type: List of integers
        Property: Has the same Overall_Length as the input.
        Derivation: Formed by repeating Sequence_S cyclically until the Overall_Length is reached.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace Padding_Zeros
  Method:
    1. Identify the fundamental repeating sequence (Sequence_S) by observing the pattern before the zeros (e.g., the first half of the non-zero part).
    2. Determine the total length of the input string.
    3. Generate the output by repeating Sequence_S cyclically until the generated sequence matches the total length of the input.
  Relationship: The zeros in the input act as placeholders that are filled by continuing the pattern established by Sequence_S.
