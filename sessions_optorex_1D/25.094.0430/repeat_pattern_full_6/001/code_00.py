Identifies a repeating sequence of non-zero integers at the beginning of the input list,
which appears twice consecutively followed by zeros. It then replaces the entire input 
list content by repeating this fundamental sequence cyclically until the original 
length of the input list is reached. Finally, it formats the resulting list 
back into a space-separated string.
