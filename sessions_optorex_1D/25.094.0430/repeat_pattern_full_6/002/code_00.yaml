Task: NumPy Array Pattern Tiling

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Element_Type: Integer
  Structure:
    - Initial_Block:
        Property: Consists of non-zero integers.
        Structure: Formed by a fundamental sequence (Pattern_S) repeated exactly twice consecutively (Pattern_S | Pattern_S).
    - Padding_Zeros:
        Property: Consists of zero integers following the Initial_Block.
        Property: Variable number of zeros, ensuring the total length is maintained across examples (e.g., 12 in training).
  Overall_Length: Consistent for the provided examples (e.g., 12).

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Element_Type: Integer
  Structure:
    - Generated_Array:
        Property: Has the same Overall_Length as the input array.
        Derivation: Formed by repeating the fundamental sequence (Pattern_S) cyclically until the Overall_Length is reached.

Transformation:
  Action: Replace the entire input array content.
  Method:
    1. Identify the first occurrence of a zero in the input array. Its index marks the end of the Initial_Block.
    2. Determine the length of the fundamental sequence (Pattern_S) by dividing the index of the first zero by two.
    3. Extract Pattern_S from the beginning of the input array.
    4. Generate the output array by tiling (repeating) Pattern_S until the resulting array matches the Overall_Length of the input array. Truncate if the tiled length exceeds the Overall_Length.
  Relationship: The input structure (Pattern_S | Pattern_S | Zeros) defines the Pattern_S which is then used to generate the full output array by repetition.
