*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of integers, always of length 12 in the examples.
    *   The input sequences consist of a pattern of non-zero integers followed by one or more trailing zeros.
    *   The output sequences replace the trailing zeros of the input with a segment copied from the beginning of the input sequence.
    *   The number of elements copied from the beginning corresponds exactly to the number of trailing zeros in the input.
    *   The non-zero part of the input sequence remains unchanged in the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Replace trailing zeros in a sequence with the initial segment of the sequence.
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list_of_integers
        properties:
          - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
          - structure: contains a non-zero prefix followed by a zero suffix (>= 0 zeros)
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list_of_integers
        properties:
          - length: same as input_sequence
          - derived_from: input_sequence
      - name: zero_suffix
        type: segment_of_input_sequence
        properties:
          - location: end of input_sequence
          - content: all zeros
          - length: N (variable, >= 0)
      - name: initial_segment
        type: segment_of_input_sequence
        properties:
          - location: beginning of input_sequence
          - length: N (same as zero_suffix length)
    actions:
      - name: identify_trailing_zeros
        input: input_sequence
        output: length (N) of zero_suffix
      - name: extract_initial_segment
        input: input_sequence, length N
        output: initial_segment
      - name: extract_non_zero_prefix
        input: input_sequence, length N
        output: segment before zero_suffix
      - name: construct_output
        inputs:
          - non_zero_prefix
          - initial_segment
        output: output_sequence (by concatenating prefix and initial_segment)
    relationships:
      - The length of the 'initial_segment' to be copied is determined by the length of the 'zero_suffix'.
      - The 'output_sequence' is formed by concatenating the part of the 'input_sequence' before the 'zero_suffix' with the 'initial_segment'.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Find the starting index of the block of trailing zeros. If no zeros exist at the end, return the input sequence unchanged.
    3.  Count the number of trailing zeros (`N`).
    4.  Identify the first `N` elements from the beginning of the input sequence.
    5.  Create the output sequence by taking all elements from the input sequence *up to* the start of the trailing zeros, and then appending the `N` elements identified in the previous step.
    6.  Return the constructed output sequence.
