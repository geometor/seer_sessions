task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    format: list or array of integers
    properties:
      - contains single-digit integers
      - ends with one or more zeros

  - type: sequence
    role: output
    format: list or array of integers (potentially formatted as string for final output)
    properties:
      - contains integers derived from input
      - does not contain zeros (in examples)
      - fixed length of 12 (in examples)

transformation:
  input_object: input_sequence (list/array of integers)
  actions:
    - identify the sub-sequence containing all digits from the start up to, but not including, the first zero. Call this `prefix_sequence`.
    - count the number of zero digits present from the first zero to the end of the `input_sequence`. Call this `zero_count`.
    - select the first `zero_count` digits from the `prefix_sequence`. Call this the `suffix_sequence`.
    - construct the `output_sequence` by concatenating the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence`.

relationships:
  - the number of trailing zeros (`zero_count`) determines the length of the `suffix_sequence`.
  - the `suffix_sequence` elements are the first `zero_count` elements of the `prefix_sequence`.
  - the `output_sequence` starts with the `prefix_sequence`.
  - the length of the `output_sequence` is the length of `prefix_sequence` plus `zero_count`.
