"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on the following rule:
1. Identify the sub-sequence containing all digits from the start up to, but not including, the first zero (`prefix_sequence`).
2. Count the number of zero digits present from the first zero to the end of the input sequence (`zero_count`).
3. Select the first `zero_count` digits from the `prefix_sequence` (`suffix_sequence`).
4. Construct the output sequence by concatenating the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence`.
