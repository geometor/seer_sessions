            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because it was structured to handle NumPy arrays directly, while the execution environment expected a function that processes space-separated strings as input and produces a space-separated string as output. The underlying logic identified (identifying the non-zero prefix, counting trailing zeros, and appending the start of the prefix based on the zero count) appears sound and consistent across all provided examples. The failure was in the input/output interface of the function, not the core transformation logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to reinstate the string parsing and formatting logic around the core transformation steps. We will use the pure Python version of the transformation which correctly handles string inputs and outputs. We will verify this logic against the metrics gathered from the examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example | Input String                | Prefix Length | Zero Count | Total Length | Status | Expected Output Length |\n| :------ | :-------------------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :----------- | :----- | :--------------------- |\n| Train 1 | `5 6 2 9 8 5 6 2 9 8 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |\n| Train 2 | `7 1 6 6 7 1 6 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |\n| Train 3 | `1 9 5 1 9 5 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |\n| Train 4 | `7 2 8 4 7 7 2 8 4 7 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |\n| Train 5 | `8 3 5 6 8 3 5 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |\n| Train 6 | `5 1 2 2 6 5 1 2 2 6 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |\n| Train 7 | `9 1 1 9 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |\n| Test 1  | `4 4 2 9 4 4 2 9 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |\n\nThe metrics confirm that for every example:\n1.  The input sequence ends with one or more zeros.\n2.  The total length of the input sequence is 12.\n3.  The length of the non-zero prefix plus the count of trailing zeros equals the total input length (12).\n4.  The expected output length is also 12, which equals the prefix length plus the zero count. This confirms the core logic: Output = Prefix + Prefix[:Zero_Count].\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
