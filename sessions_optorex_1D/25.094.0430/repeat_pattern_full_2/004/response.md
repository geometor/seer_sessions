**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed because it was structured to handle NumPy arrays directly, while the execution environment expected a function that processes space-separated strings as input and produces a space-separated string as output. The underlying logic identified (identifying the non-zero prefix, counting trailing zeros, and appending the start of the prefix based on the zero count) appears sound and consistent across all provided examples. The failure was in the input/output interface of the function, not the core transformation logic.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to reinstate the string parsing and formatting logic around the core transformation steps. We will use the pure Python version of the transformation which correctly handles string inputs and outputs. We will verify this logic against the metrics gathered from the examples.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:

| Example | Input String                | Prefix Length | Zero Count | Total Length | Status | Expected Output Length |
| :------ | :-------------------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :----------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| Train 1 | `5 6 2 9 8 5 6 2 9 8 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 2 | `7 1 6 6 7 1 6 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |
| Train 3 | `1 9 5 1 9 5 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |
| Train 4 | `7 2 8 4 7 7 2 8 4 7 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 5 | `8 3 5 6 8 3 5 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |
| Train 6 | `5 1 2 2 6 5 1 2 2 6 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 7 | `9 1 1 9 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |
| Test 1  | `4 4 2 9 4 4 2 9 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |

The metrics confirm that for every example:
1.  The input sequence ends with one or more zeros.
2.  The total length of the input sequence is 12.
3.  The length of the non-zero prefix plus the count of trailing zeros equals the total input length (12).
4.  The expected output length is also 12, which equals the prefix length plus the zero count. This confirms the core logic: Output = Prefix + Prefix[:Zero_Count].

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    format: string of space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers 0-9
      - fixed total length of 12 (based on examples)
      - always ends with one or more '0' digits
      - consists of a non-zero prefix followed by one or more zeros

  - type: sequence
    role: output
    format: string of space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers derived from the input's non-zero prefix
      - does not contain zeros (based on examples)
      - fixed total length of 12 (based on examples)

transformation:
  actions:
    - parse the input string into a list of integers.
    - identify the sub-list containing all digits from the start up to, but not including, the first occurrence of zero (`prefix_sequence`).
    - count the number of zero digits from the first zero to the end of the input list (`zero_count`). This is equivalent to `total_length - length(prefix_sequence)`.
    - select the first `zero_count` digits from the `prefix_sequence` (`suffix_sequence`).
    - construct the output list by concatenating the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence`.
    - format the output list back into a string of space-separated digits.

relationships:
  - the number of trailing zeros (`zero_count`) in the input determines the number of digits selected from the start of the `prefix_sequence` to form the `suffix_sequence`.
  - the output sequence is formed by appending the `suffix_sequence` to the `prefix_sequence`.
  - the length of the output sequence is equal to the length of the input sequence (12 in all examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string of space-separated digits.
2.  Split the input string into a list of individual digit strings.
3.  Convert the list of digit strings into a list of integers.
4.  Iterate through the list of integers to find the index of the first zero.
5.  Extract the sub-list of integers before the first zero; this is the `prefix_sequence`.
6.  Calculate the number of zeros (`zero_count`) by subtracting the length of the `prefix_sequence` from the total length of the input list.
7.  Create the `suffix_sequence` by taking the first `zero_count` elements from the `prefix_sequence`.
8.  Concatenate the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence` to form the final list of integers.
9.  Convert each integer in the final list back to its string representation.
10. Join the list of digit strings with spaces to create the final output string.
