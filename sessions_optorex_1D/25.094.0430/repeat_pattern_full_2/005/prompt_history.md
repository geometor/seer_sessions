Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of sequences of single-digit integers presented as space-separated strings. Each input sequence ends with one or more zero (`0`) digits.
2.  **Output Data:** The output also consists of sequences of single-digit integers presented as space-separated strings. The output sequences do not contain zeros in the provided examples.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve isolating the part of the input sequence *before* the trailing zeros and then extending this sequence based on the *number* of trailing zeros.
4.  **Trailing Zeros:** The zeros at the end of the input sequence are significant. They are not directly copied to the output but seem to control how the non-zero part is manipulated.
5.  **Sequence Extension:** The non-zero part of the input sequence forms the beginning of the output sequence. The output sequence is then extended by appending elements taken from the *beginning* of the non-zero sequence.
6.  **Length Control:** The number of elements appended to the non-zero sequence seems equal to the number of trailing zeros in the input. In all examples, the final output length is 12.

task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers
      - ends with one or more zeros

  - type: sequence
    role: output
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers derived from input
      - does not contain zeros (in examples)
      - fixed length of 12 (in examples)

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify the sub-sequence of non-zero digits from the start of the input (`S`)
    - count the number of trailing zeros in the input (`N`)
    - construct the output sequence by concatenating `S` with the first `N` digits of `S`

relationships:
  - the number of trailing zeros (`N`) in the input determines the number of digits appended to the non-zero sequence (`S`) to form the output.
  - the appended digits are the first `N` digits of the non-zero sequence `S`.
  - the output sequence starts with the non-zero input sequence `S`.
  - the length of the output sequence is the length of `S` plus `N`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Convert the input string into a list of integers.
3.  Identify the sub-list containing all digits from the beginning up to, but not including, the first occurrence of zero. Call this the `prefix_sequence`.
4.  Count the number of zero digits present at the end of the original input list. Call this `zero_count`.
5.  Take the first `zero_count` digits from the `prefix_sequence`. Call this the `suffix_sequence`.
6.  Create the output list by concatenating the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence`.
7.  Convert the output list back into a string of space-separated digits.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed because it was structured to handle NumPy arrays directly, while the execution environment expected a function that processes space-separated strings as input and produces a space-separated string as output. The underlying logic identified (identifying the non-zero prefix, counting trailing zeros, and appending the start of the prefix based on the zero count) appears sound and consistent across all provided examples. The failure was in the input/output interface of the function, not the core transformation logic.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to reinstate the string parsing and formatting logic around the core transformation steps. We will use the pure Python version of the transformation which correctly handles string inputs and outputs. We will verify this logic against the metrics gathered from the examples.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:

| Example | Input String                | Prefix Length | Zero Count | Total Length | Status | Expected Output Length |
| :------ | :-------------------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :----------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| Train 1 | `5 6 2 9 8 5 6 2 9 8 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 2 | `7 1 6 6 7 1 6 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |
| Train 3 | `1 9 5 1 9 5 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |
| Train 4 | `7 2 8 4 7 7 2 8 4 7 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 5 | `8 3 5 6 8 3 5 6 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |
| Train 6 | `5 1 2 2 6 5 1 2 2 6 0 0`   | 10            | 2          | 12           | OK     | 12 (10 + 2)            |
| Train 7 | `9 1 1 9 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`   | 6             | 6          | 12           | OK     | 12 (6 + 6)             |
| Test 1  | `4 4 2 9 4 4 2 9 0 0 0 0`   | 8             | 4          | 12           | OK     | 12 (8 + 4)             |

The metrics confirm that for every example:
1.  The input sequence ends with one or more zeros.
2.  The total length of the input sequence is 12.
3.  The length of the non-zero prefix plus the count of trailing zeros equals the total input length (12).
4.  The expected output length is also 12, which equals the prefix length plus the zero count. This confirms the core logic: Output = Prefix + Prefix[:Zero_Count].
