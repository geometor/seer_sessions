Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of sequences of single-digit integers presented as space-separated strings. Each input sequence ends with one or more zero (`0`) digits.
2.  **Output Data:** The output also consists of sequences of single-digit integers presented as space-separated strings. The output sequences do not contain zeros in the provided examples.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve isolating the part of the input sequence *before* the trailing zeros and then extending this sequence based on the *number* of trailing zeros.
4.  **Trailing Zeros:** The zeros at the end of the input sequence are significant. They are not directly copied to the output but seem to control how the non-zero part is manipulated.
5.  **Sequence Extension:** The non-zero part of the input sequence forms the beginning of the output sequence. The output sequence is then extended by appending elements taken from the *beginning* of the non-zero sequence.
6.  **Length Control:** The number of elements appended to the non-zero sequence seems equal to the number of trailing zeros in the input. In all examples, the final output length is 12.

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers
      - ends with one or more zeros

  - type: sequence
    role: output
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers derived from input
      - does not contain zeros (in examples)
      - fixed length of 12 (in examples)

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify the sub-sequence of non-zero digits from the start of the input (`S`)
    - count the number of trailing zeros in the input (`N`)
    - construct the output sequence by concatenating `S` with the first `N` digits of `S`

relationships:
  - the number of trailing zeros (`N`) in the input determines the number of digits appended to the non-zero sequence (`S`) to form the output.
  - the appended digits are the first `N` digits of the non-zero sequence `S`.
  - the output sequence starts with the non-zero input sequence `S`.
  - the length of the output sequence is the length of `S` plus `N`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Convert the input string into a list of integers.
3.  Identify the sub-list containing all digits from the beginning up to, but not including, the first occurrence of zero. Call this the `prefix_sequence`.
4.  Count the number of zero digits present at the end of the original input list. Call this `zero_count`.
5.  Take the first `zero_count` digits from the `prefix_sequence`. Call this the `suffix_sequence`.
6.  Create the output list by concatenating the `prefix_sequence` and the `suffix_sequence`.
7.  Convert the output list back into a string of space-separated digits.
