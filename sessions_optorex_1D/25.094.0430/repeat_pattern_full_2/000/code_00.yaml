task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers
      - ends with one or more zeros

  - type: sequence
    role: output
    format: space-separated single digits
    properties:
      - contains integers derived from input
      - does not contain zeros (in examples)
      - fixed length of 12 (in examples)

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify the sub-sequence of non-zero digits from the start of the input (`S`)
    - count the number of trailing zeros in the input (`N`)
    - construct the output sequence by concatenating `S` with the first `N` digits of `S`

relationships:
  - the number of trailing zeros (`N`) in the input determines the number of digits appended to the non-zero sequence (`S`) to form the output.
  - the appended digits are the first `N` digits of the non-zero sequence `S`.
  - the output sequence starts with the non-zero input sequence `S`.
  - the length of the output sequence is the length of `S` plus `N`.
