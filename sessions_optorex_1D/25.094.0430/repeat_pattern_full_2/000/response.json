Each input sequence ends with one or more zero (`0`) digits.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output also consists of sequences of single-digit integers presented as space-separated strings. The output sequences do not contain zeros in the provided examples.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve isolating the part of the input sequence *before* the trailing zeros and then extending this sequence based on the *number* of trailing zeros.\n4.  **Trailing Zeros:** The zeros at the end of the input sequence are significant. They are not directly copied to the output but seem to control how the non-zero part is manipulated.\n5.  **Sequence Extension:** The non-zero part of the input sequence forms the beginning of the output sequence. The output sequence is then extended by appending elements taken from the *beginning* of the non-zero sequence.\n6.  **Length Control:** The number of elements appended to the non-zero sequence seems equal to the number of trailing zeros in the input. In all examples, the final output length is 12.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
