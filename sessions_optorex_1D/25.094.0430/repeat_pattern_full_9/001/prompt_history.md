Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Input Structure:** Each input sequence consists of a non-zero part followed by one or more trailing zeros. The non-zero part appears to be composed of a repeating pattern. Specifically, in all examples, the non-zero part consists of exactly two repetitions of a base pattern.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output sequence contains only non-zero digits (based on the examples). It has the same total length as the corresponding input sequence. The output sequence starts with the non-zero part of the input and continues by repeating the base pattern found in the input until the total length is reached.
4.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves identifying the repeating pattern within the initial non-zero segment of the input and then using that pattern to replace the trailing zeros, extending the initial segment to the original input length.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    data_type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_trailing_zeros
      - initial_segment_is_non_zero
      - initial_segment_repeats_pattern_twice
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    data_type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - same_length_as_input
      - no_trailing_zeros (derived from examples)
      - consists_of_repeated_input_pattern

transformation:
  action: identify_pattern
  input: initial_non_zero_segment_of_input
  process: Find the shortest sequence (pattern) that repeats exactly twice to form the non_zero segment.
  output: base_pattern

  action: construct_output
  input: 
    - base_pattern
    - original_input_length
    - initial_non_zero_segment_of_input
  process: Start with the initial non-zero segment. Repeatedly append elements from the base_pattern in order until the sequence reaches the original_input_length.
  output: final_output_sequence

relationships:
  - output_length == input_length
  - output_prefix == input_non_zero_segment
  - output_suffix is constructed by repeating the base_pattern
  - length(input_non_zero_segment) == 2 * length(base_pattern)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Determine the total length of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the segment of the input sequence containing non-zero numbers that appears before any trailing zeros.
4.  Determine the repeating base pattern by taking the first half of the non-zero segment. (Verify that the second half matches the first half).
5.  Initialize the output sequence with the non-zero segment identified in step 3.
6.  Repeatedly append elements from the base pattern (starting from its first element and cycling through) to the end of the output sequence until the output sequence's length equals the total length determined in step 2.
7.  Return the fully constructed output sequence.
