The non-zero part appears to be composed of a repeating pattern. Specifically, in all examples, the non-zero part consists of exactly two repetitions of a base pattern.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output sequence contains only non-zero digits (based on the examples). It has the same total length as the corresponding input sequence. The output sequence starts with the non-zero part of the input and continues by repeating the base pattern found in the input until the total length is reached.\n4.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves identifying the repeating pattern within the initial non-zero segment of the input and then using that pattern to replace the trailing zeros, extending the initial segment to the original input length.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
