Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: Each input is a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Output Structure**: Each output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
3.  **Input Pattern**: The input sequences consistently start with a pattern of non-zero digits, followed by trailing zeros. This initial non-zero sequence appears to be constructed by repeating a shorter, core pattern exactly twice.
4.  **Output Pattern**: The output sequences are formed by repeating the core pattern identified in the input.
5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying the fundamental repeating unit within the non-zero part of the input and then using this unit to tile the entire output sequence, truncating as needed to fit the length of 12.
6.  **Core Pattern Identification**: The core pattern is found by taking the sequence of non-zero digits from the start of the input and selecting the first half of that sequence. For example, if the non-zero part is `A B C A B C`, the core pattern is `A B C`.
7.  **Output Generation**: The identified core pattern is repeated sequentially until a sequence of length 12 is generated. For instance, if the core pattern `P` has length `L`, the output is constructed by concatenating `P` with itself `ceil(12 / L)` times and then taking the first 12 elements.

## Facts


```yaml
Format:
  input_length: 12
  output_length: 12
  element_type: single_digit_integer
Input_Structure:
  components:
    - type: sequence
      name: non_zero_prefix
      description: A sequence of non-zero digits at the beginning.
      properties:
        - structure: Formed by repeating a 'core_pattern' twice.
        - length: Variable, but always even based on examples.
    - type: sequence
      name: zero_suffix
      description: A sequence of zero digits following the non_zero_prefix.
      properties:
        - length: Variable, fills the remaining space up to 12.
Core_Pattern:
  definition: The fundamental repeating unit within the non_zero_prefix.
  derivation: Take the first half of the non_zero_prefix sequence.
  example: If non_zero_prefix is [7, 1, 9, 7, 1, 9], core_pattern is [7, 1, 9].
Transformation_Action:
  name: Tiling
  input: core_pattern
  output: generated_output_sequence
  process: Repeat the core_pattern sequentially to fill a sequence of length 12. Truncate the final repetition if it exceeds the length limit.
Output_Structure:
  content: Result of the Tiling action applied to the core_pattern derived from the input.
  length: Always 12.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers starting from the beginning of the input sequence. Let this be the `non_zero_prefix`.
3.  Determine the length of the `non_zero_prefix`.
4.  Extract the first half of the `non_zero_prefix` sequence. This is the `core_pattern`.
5.  Initialize an empty output sequence.
6.  Repeatedly append the elements of the `core_pattern` to the output sequence until the output sequence contains exactly 12 elements. Stop appending immediately once the length reaches 12, even if mid-way through appending a `core_pattern`.
7.  Return the generated output sequence of 12 integers.
