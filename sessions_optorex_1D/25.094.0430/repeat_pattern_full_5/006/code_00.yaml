Format:
  input_length: 12
  output_length: 12
  element_type: integer (single digit in examples)
Input_Structure:
  description: A sequence of 12 integers.
  components:
    - type: sequence
      name: non_zero_prefix
      description: An initial contiguous subsequence containing only non-zero integers. Stops at the first zero or the end of the input.
      properties:
        - Observation: In all examples, this sequence has a positive, even length.
        - Observation: Structure appears to be formed by repeating a shorter 'core_pattern' twice.
    - type: sequence
      name: zero_suffix
      description: A sequence of zero integers following the non_zero_prefix, filling the rest of the 12 elements. Can be empty if the non_zero_prefix has length 12.
Derived_Objects:
  - name: core_pattern
    source: non_zero_prefix
    type: sequence
    derivation: Extracted as the first half of the `non_zero_prefix`.
    properties:
      - length: `length(non_zero_prefix) / 2`
Transformation_Action:
  name: Tiling
  input: core_pattern
  output: generated_output_sequence
  process: Create the output sequence by repeatedly appending the elements of the `core_pattern` (cycling through the pattern) until the output sequence reaches exactly 12 elements.
Output_Structure:
  content: Result of the Tiling action applied to the `core_pattern`.
  length: Always 12.
Assumption:
  - The input is provided as a sequence (e.g., Python list) of integers. If provided as another type (e.g., NumPy array), it might need conversion for certain operations depending on the implementation details.
