"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on a repeating pattern.

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the initial contiguous subsequence composed entirely of non-zero integers (the `non_zero_prefix`), starting from the first element and stopping at the first zero encountered or at the end of the sequence.
3.  Determine the `core_pattern` by taking the sequence of elements corresponding to the first half of the `non_zero_prefix`. (Assumption based on examples: the `non_zero_prefix` will always have a positive, even length).
4.  Initialize an empty `output_sequence`.
5.  Repeatedly append the elements of the `core_pattern` to the `output_sequence`, cycling through the `core_pattern` from beginning to end as necessary.
6.  Continue appending elements until the `output_sequence` reaches a length of exactly 12. If the `output_sequence` reaches length 12 partway through appending a `core_pattern`, stop immediately and do not append further elements.
7.  Return the generated `output_sequence` of 12 integers.
