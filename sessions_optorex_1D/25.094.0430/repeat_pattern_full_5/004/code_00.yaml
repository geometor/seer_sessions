Format:
  input_length: 12
  output_length: 12
  element_type: integer (single digit 0-9 observed)
Input_Structure:
  description: A sequence of 12 integers.
  components:
    - object: non_zero_prefix
      description: The initial contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers.
      properties:
        - source: Start of the input sequence.
        - termination: Ends at the first zero encountered or the end of the input sequence.
        - length: Variable, observed to be even and greater than 0 in all examples.
        - content_pattern: Consists of exactly two repetitions of a shorter sequence (the 'core_pattern').
    - object: zero_suffix
      description: Sequence of zero integers following the non_zero_prefix.
      properties:
        - content: Only zeros.
        - length: Fills the remaining length of the input sequence up to 12. May be empty if non_zero_prefix has length 12.
Derived_Object:
  name: core_pattern
  source: non_zero_prefix
  derivation_rule: The sequence formed by the first half of the elements of the non_zero_prefix.
  properties:
    - length: Half the length of the non_zero_prefix.
Transformation:
  action: Tiling
  input_object: core_pattern
  output_object: transformed_sequence
  process: Create the output sequence by repeatedly concatenating the core_pattern with itself.
  constraint: Stop concatenation and truncate the result to ensure the final transformed_sequence has a length of exactly 12.
Output_Structure:
  content: The transformed_sequence resulting from the Tiling action.
  length: Always 12.
