Input_Object:
  type: sequence
  name: input_sequence
  length: 12
  contains:
    - object: non_zero_prefix
      type: sequence
      description: Initial contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits.
      properties:
        - length: Always even (observed).
        - structure: Composed of the 'core_pattern' repeated exactly twice.
    - object: zero_suffix
      type: sequence
      description: Sequence of zero digits following the non_zero_prefix.
      properties:
        - length: Variable, fills remaining space up to 12.
Derived_Object:
  type: sequence
  name: core_pattern
  description: The fundamental repeating unit.
  derivation: Extracted as the first half of the 'non_zero_prefix'.
  properties:
    - length: Half the length of the 'non_zero_prefix'.
Transformation_Action:
  name: Tiling
  input: core_pattern
  output: output_sequence
  process: >
    Repeat the 'core_pattern' sequence cyclically to generate elements.
    Continue generating elements until exactly 12 elements have been produced.
Output_Object:
  type: sequence
  name: output_sequence
  length: 12
  content: Result of the Tiling action.
Constraints_Assumptions:
  - The input sequence always contains at least one non-zero digit.
  - The initial non-zero prefix always has an even length.
