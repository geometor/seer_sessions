"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on a repeating pattern.

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the initial contiguous subsequence starting from the first element, containing only non-zero integers. Let this be the `non_zero_prefix`. Stop identifying this prefix upon encountering the first zero or reaching the end of the input sequence.
3.  Determine the length of the `non_zero_prefix`. (Based on examples, this length is always positive and even).
4.  Calculate the length of the `core_pattern` by dividing the length of the `non_zero_prefix` by two.
5.  Extract the `core_pattern` by taking the first half of the `non_zero_prefix`.
6.  Initialize an empty `output_sequence`.
7.  Iteratively append elements to the `output_sequence`: In each step, determine the next element to append by taking the element from the `core_pattern` at the index corresponding to the current length of the `output_sequence` modulo the length of the `core_pattern`.
8.  Continue appending elements until the `output_sequence` contains exactly 12 elements.
9.  Return the generated `output_sequence`.
