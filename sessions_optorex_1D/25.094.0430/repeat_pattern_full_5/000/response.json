This initial non-zero sequence appears to be constructed by repeating a shorter, core pattern exactly twice.\n4.  **Output Pattern**: The output sequences are formed by repeating the core pattern identified in the input.\n5.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying the fundamental repeating unit within the non-zero part of the input and then using this unit to tile the entire output sequence, truncating as needed to fit the length of 12.\n6.  **Core Pattern Identification**: The core pattern is found by taking the sequence of non-zero digits from the start of the input and selecting the first half of that sequence. For example, if the non-zero part is `A B C A B C`, the core pattern is `A B C`.\n7.  **Output Generation**: The identified core pattern is repeated sequentially until a sequence of length 12 is generated. For instance, if the core pattern `P` has length `L`, the output is constructed by concatenating `P` with itself `ceil(12 / L)` times and then taking the first 12 elements.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
