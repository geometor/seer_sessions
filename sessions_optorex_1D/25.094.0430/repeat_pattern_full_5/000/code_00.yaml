Input_Structure:
  components:
    - type: sequence
      name: non_zero_prefix
      description: A sequence of non-zero digits at the beginning.
      properties:
        - structure: Formed by repeating a 'core_pattern' twice.
        - length: Variable, but always even based on examples.
    - type: sequence
      name: zero_suffix
      description: A sequence of zero digits following the non_zero_prefix.
      properties:
        - length: Variable, fills the remaining space up to 12.
Core_Pattern:
  definition: The fundamental repeating unit within the non_zero_prefix.
  derivation: Take the first half of the non_zero_prefix sequence.
  example: If non_zero_prefix is [7, 1, 9, 7, 1, 9], core_pattern is [7, 1, 9].
Transformation_Action:
  name: Tiling
  input: core_pattern
  output: generated_output_sequence
  process: Repeat the core_pattern sequentially to fill a sequence of length 12. Truncate the final repetition if it exceeds the length limit.
Output_Structure:
  content: Result of the Tiling action applied to the core_pattern derived from the input.
  length: Always 12.
