"""
Transforms an input list of 12 integers based on a repeating pattern.

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the initial contiguous subsequence consisting only of non-zero integers (let this be `non_zero_prefix`). Stop scanning at the first zero encountered or at the end of the input sequence if no zeros are present.
3.  Determine the length of the `non_zero_prefix`. (Based on observations, this length will always be an even number greater than zero).
4.  Calculate half the length of the `non_zero_prefix`.
5.  Extract the first half of the `non_zero_prefix` sequence. This subsequence is the `core_pattern`.
6.  Initialize an empty list for the `output_sequence`.
7.  Repeatedly append elements from the `core_pattern` (cycling through the `core_pattern` from beginning to end as needed) to the `output_sequence`.
8.  Stop appending elements as soon as the `output_sequence` reaches a length of 12.
9.  Return the generated `output_sequence`.
