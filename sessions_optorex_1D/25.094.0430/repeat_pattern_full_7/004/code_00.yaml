task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data:
  type: list_of_integers
  structure: Consists of an initial non-zero sequence (prefix) followed by one or more zeros (suffix).
  properties:
    - total_length: The total number of elements in the input list (N).
    - non_zero_prefix: The contiguous sequence of non-zero integers at the beginning of the list. Guaranteed to exist in valid inputs.
    - zero_suffix: The sequence of one or more zeros following the prefix.
    - prefix_structure: The non_zero_prefix is always formed by concatenating a smaller, non-empty block of integers (B) with itself (B B).
    - prefix_length: The length of the non_zero_prefix (P) is always even and P >= 2.
output_data:
  type: list_of_integers
  structure: A sequence generated by repeating a pattern.
  properties:
    - content: Derived entirely from repeating the fundamental block (B) identified in the input's non_zero_prefix.
    - length: Always equal to the total_length (N) of the input list.
transformation:
  action: pattern_completion_by_repetition
  steps:
    - Identify the non-zero prefix by finding the first zero in the input list.
    - Verify the prefix length (P) is even and at least 2.
    - Determine the fundamental repeating block (B) by taking the first half (length P/2) of the non-zero_prefix.
    - Verify that the second half of the non-zero_prefix is identical to B. (This check confirms the assumed structure).
    - Generate the output sequence by repeatedly concatenating the block B.
    - Stop generation when the output sequence length is greater than or equal to the total_length (N) of the input.
    - Truncate the generated sequence to exactly N elements.
relationships:
  - Output length is identical to input length (N).
  - Output content is solely determined by the repeating block (B) found in the first half of the input's non-zero prefix.
  - Zeros in the input act as placeholders indicating the segment to be filled by the repeated pattern.
assumptions:
  - Input sequences will always contain at least one zero.
  - The non-zero prefix before the first zero will always exist, have an even length >= 2, and conform to the B B structure.
