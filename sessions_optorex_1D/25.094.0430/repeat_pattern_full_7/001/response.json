Parses the input string into a list of integers.\n2.  Determines the total length of the input list.\n3.  Finds the index of the first zero in the list. This separates the non-zero prefix from the zero suffix.\n4.  Identifies the fundamental repeating block by taking the first half of the non-zero prefix. (The non-zero prefix is assumed to be formed by repeating this block twice).\n5.  Constructs the output list by repeatedly appending the fundamental block until the output list's length is at least the total length of the original input.\n6.  Truncates the generated output list to match the exact total length of the input list.\n7.
