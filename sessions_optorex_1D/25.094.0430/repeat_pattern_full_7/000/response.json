For example, in `train_1`, `5 7` is repeated twice to form `5 7 5 7`. In `train_2`, `2 5 7` is repeated twice to form `2 5 7 2 5 7`.\n    *   The zeros in the input act as placeholders.\n    *   The output sequence replaces the zeros by continuing the repetition of the identified block from the start of the input.\n    *   The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence. If the repetition doesn't perfectly fill the remaining length, it is truncated.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
