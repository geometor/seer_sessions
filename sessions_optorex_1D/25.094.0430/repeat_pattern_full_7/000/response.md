*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers represented as strings separated by spaces.
    *   The input sequences typically consist of an initial non-zero sequence followed by one or more zeros.
    *   The initial non-zero sequence in the input always appears to be formed by repeating a shorter block of numbers exactly twice. For example, in `train_1`, `5 7` is repeated twice to form `5 7 5 7`. In `train_2`, `2 5 7` is repeated twice to form `2 5 7 2 5 7`.
    *   The zeros in the input act as placeholders.
    *   The output sequence replaces the zeros by continuing the repetition of the identified block from the start of the input.
    *   The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence. If the repetition doesn't perfectly fill the remaining length, it is truncated.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input_data:
      type: list_of_integers
      structure: consists of an initial non-zero sequence followed by zero or more zeros
      properties:
        - non_zero_prefix: The segment of the list before the first zero.
        - zero_suffix: The segment of the list starting from the first zero.
        - repeating_block_source: The non_zero_prefix appears to be formed by repeating a smaller block twice (e.g., block 'B' forms 'B B').
        - total_length: The number of elements in the input list.
    output_data:
      type: list_of_integers
      structure: A sequence formed by repeating a specific block.
      properties:
        - content: Derived from repeating a block identified from the input's non_zero_prefix.
        - length: Always equal to the total_length of the input list.
    transformation:
      action: pattern_completion
      steps:
        - Identify the non-zero prefix in the input.
        - Determine the fundamental repeating block 'B' by taking the first half of the non-zero prefix.
        - Generate the output sequence by concatenating the block 'B' repeatedly.
        - Truncate the generated sequence to match the total_length of the input sequence.
    relationships:
      - The output length is determined by the input length.
      - The content of the output is determined by the repeating pattern found in the non-zero prefix of the input.
      - Zeros in the input indicate positions to be filled by the repeating pattern.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Determine the total length of the input sequence.
    3.  Find the index of the first zero in the sequence. If no zeros exist, the input is the output (though this case isn't shown in examples).
    4.  Extract the sub-sequence before the first zero (the non-zero prefix).
    5.  Calculate the length of this non-zero prefix.
    6.  Determine the fundamental repeating block by taking the first half of the non-zero prefix (length of prefix divided by 2).
    7.  Initialize an empty output sequence.
    8.  Repeatedly append the elements of the fundamental repeating block to the output sequence.
    9.  Stop appending when the length of the output sequence equals the total length of the original input sequence.
    10. Return the generated output sequence.
