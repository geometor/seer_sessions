task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data:
  type: list_of_integers # Potentially handled as array-like in execution
  structure: Consists of an initial non-zero sequence followed by zero or more zeros.
  properties:
    - non_zero_prefix: The segment of the sequence before the first zero. Assumed to have an even length >= 2.
    - zero_suffix: The segment of the sequence starting from the first zero (can be empty).
    - repeating_block_source: The non_zero_prefix is formed by repeating a smaller block 'B' exactly twice ('B B').
    - total_length: The number of elements in the input sequence.
output_data:
  type: list_of_integers # Format required for output
  structure: A sequence formed by repeating a specific block.
  properties:
    - content: Derived from repeating the block 'B' identified from the first half of the input's non_zero_prefix.
    - length: Always equal to the total_length of the input sequence.
transformation:
  action: pattern_completion_by_repetition
  steps:
    - Parse the input into a sequence of numbers.
    - Determine the total length of the sequence.
    - Find the index of the first zero.
    - Extract the non-zero prefix (sequence before the first zero).
    - Check if the prefix length is less than 2. If so, the 'B B' pattern is not present; handle as an edge case (e.g., return input or repeat the single element if length is 1 - requires clarification, but current examples always have length >= 2).
    - Determine the fundamental repeating block 'B' by taking the first half of the non-zero prefix.
    - Initialize an empty output sequence.
    - Repeatedly append the elements of block 'B' to the output sequence until its length is equal to or greater than the total required length.
    - Truncate the generated output sequence to match the exact total_length of the input sequence.
    - Format the output sequence back to the required output format (e.g., space-separated string).
error_handling:
  - The code needs to handle sequence types carefully in boolean contexts, using explicit length checks (e.g., `len(sequence) > 0` or `len(sequence) == 0`) instead of implicit truthiness (`if sequence:` or `if not sequence:`), especially if the execution environment uses array-like objects (e.g., NumPy arrays).
relationships:
  - Output length equals input length.
  - Output content is generated by repeating the first half of the non-zero input prefix.
  - Zeros in the input mark the section to be filled by the repeating pattern.
