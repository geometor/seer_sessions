"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.
The input contains an initial non-zero prefix, which consists of exactly two 
repetitions of a base pattern, followed by zero padding.
The transformation identifies this base pattern (the first half of the non-zero prefix)
and repeats it cyclically to fill a new sequence of length 12.
