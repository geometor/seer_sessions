task_description: Fill trailing zeros in a fixed-length sequence by cyclically repeating an initial pattern.
elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - structure: Contains an initial repeating pattern of non-zero integers followed by zero padding.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - structure: Consists of the initial pattern from the input repeated cyclically to fill the entire sequence length.
  - name: repeating_pattern
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - derived_from: Non-zero elements at the beginning of the input_sequence.
      - identification: Find the shortest sequence that repeats to form the non-zero prefix of the input.
  - name: zero_padding
    type: list of integers (value 0)
    properties:
      - location: End of the input_sequence.
      - role: Placeholder for pattern extension.
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: repeating_pattern, pattern_length
    description: >
      Iterate through the input sequence until the first zero is encountered.
      Within this non-zero prefix, find the shortest repeating unit.
      One way is to find the second occurrence of the first element; the sequence up to that point is the pattern.
  - name: generate_output
    inputs: repeating_pattern, pattern_length
    outputs: output_sequence
    description: >
      Create a new sequence of length 12.
      Fill this sequence by repeatedly appending elements from the `repeating_pattern` in order.
      Use the modulo operator on the index (`index % pattern_length`) to cycle through the pattern elements.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: >
      The output_sequence is generated by identifying the repeating_pattern in the non-zero prefix
      of the input_sequence and then cyclically repeating this pattern to fill a sequence of length 12.
      The zero_padding in the input is effectively replaced by the continuation of the pattern.
