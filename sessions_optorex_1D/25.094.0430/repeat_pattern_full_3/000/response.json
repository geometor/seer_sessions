The output sequence seems to be formed by repeating the initial non-zero pattern found in the input until the sequence length reaches 12.\n5.  **Pattern Identification:** The core task is to identify the repeating unit (pattern) from the non-zero part of the input sequence. This pattern is then used to generate the full output sequence. The length of this pattern varies across examples (e.g., length 4 in train_1, length 3 in train_3, length 5 in train_5).\n6.  **Filling Mechanism:** The trailing zeros in the input are filled by continuing the identified pattern cyclically.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
