The sequence typically shows a pattern repeated twice, followed by a variable number of zeros.\n    *   **Output Data:** A string containing space-separated single-digit integers, consistently having 12 elements in total.\n    *   **Core Object:** The fundamental unit is the sequence of integers. Within the input sequence, there's a \"core pattern\" which is the sequence of non-zero integers appearing at the beginning.\n    *   **Implicit Information:** The input format implies the existence of a repeating pattern delimited by zeros. The output format implies a fixed target length (12).\n    *   **Transformation:** The process involves identifying the core pattern from the input and then repeating this pattern cyclically to generate an output sequence of a specific fixed length (12).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
