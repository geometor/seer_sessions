*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   **Input Data:** A string containing space-separated single-digit integers. The sequence typically shows a pattern repeated twice, followed by a variable number of zeros.
    *   **Output Data:** A string containing space-separated single-digit integers, consistently having 12 elements in total.
    *   **Core Object:** The fundamental unit is the sequence of integers. Within the input sequence, there's a "core pattern" which is the sequence of non-zero integers appearing at the beginning.
    *   **Implicit Information:** The input format implies the existence of a repeating pattern delimited by zeros. The output format implies a fixed target length (12).
    *   **Transformation:** The process involves identifying the core pattern from the input and then repeating this pattern cyclically to generate an output sequence of a specific fixed length (12).

*   **YAML Facts:**

    task_elements:
      - object: input_sequence
        properties:
          - type: string
          - content: space-separated single-digit integers
          - structure: contains a repeating pattern followed by zeros
      - object: output_sequence
        properties:
          - type: string
          - content: space-separated single-digit integers
          - length: 12
      - object: core_pattern
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - derivation: sequence of integers in the input_sequence from the start up to the first occurrence of '0'
        relationship:
          - derived_from: input_sequence
          - used_to_generate: output_sequence
    transformation:
      action: extract_pattern
        input: input_sequence
        output: core_pattern
        rule: Take elements from the start until the first '0' is encountered.
      action: generate_output
        input: core_pattern
        parameter: target_length (value: 12)
        output: output_sequence
        rule: Repeat the core_pattern cyclically until the sequence reaches the target_length. Truncate if the last repetition exceeds the target_length.
      action: format_output
        input: generated sequence (list of integers)
        output: output_sequence (string)
        rule: Join the integers with spaces.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input string and parse it into a list of integers.
    2.  Identify the "core pattern" by taking the sequence of integers from the beginning of the list up to, but not including, the first integer that is `0`.
    3.  Initialize an empty output list.
    4.  Repeatedly append the elements of the "core pattern" to the output list.
    5.  Stop appending when the output list contains exactly 12 elements. If adding the full pattern would exceed 12 elements, only add the necessary elements from the start of the pattern to reach exactly 12.
    6.  Convert the integers in the final output list back into strings and join them with single spaces to form the output string.
