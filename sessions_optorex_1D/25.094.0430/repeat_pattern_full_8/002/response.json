            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code implements the core logic correctly based on the initial analysis: identify a repeating pattern before the zeros and repeat it cyclically to fill a sequence of length 12. However, it failed because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, instead of a string. This involves removing the initial string parsing step (`.split()` and `int()`) and working directly with the input array/list. The subsequent logic for pattern extraction and generation should remain the same. The final output should still be formatted as a space-separated string, as shown in the examples.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    *   **Input Format:** The error confirms the input is a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) of integers, not a string. All inputs seem to be 1D arrays/lists of integers.\n    *   **Output Format:** The desired output format, based on the examples, is a space-separated string containing 12 integers.\n    *   **Core Pattern Extraction:** The rule is to take elements from the beginning until the first `0` is encountered. This seems consistent across all examples.\n        *   Example 1: Pattern `[5, 8, 4]` (length 3)\n        *   Example 2: Pattern `[5, 7, 3, 6, 9]` (length 5)\n        *   Example 3: Pattern `[5, 8, 8, 5, 7]` (length 5)\n        *   Example 4: Pattern `[8, 5, 8, 2]` (length 4)\n        *   Example 5: Pattern `[3, 4, 8]` (length 3)\n        *   Example 6: Pattern `[1, 7]` (length 2)\n        *   Example 7: Pattern `[3, 4, 4, 5]` (length 4)\n    *   **Output Generation:** The rule is to repeat the extracted core pattern cyclically until a total length of 12 is reached.\n        *   Example 1: `[5, 8, 4]` repeated 4 times (12 / 3 = 4).\n        *   Example 2: `[5, 7, 3, 6, 9]` repeated 2 times + first 2 elements (12 = 5*2 + 2).\n        *   Example 3: `[5, 8, 8, 5, 7]` repeated 2 times + first 2 elements (12 = 5*2 + 2).\n        *   Example 4: `[8, 5, 8, 2]` repeated 3 times (12 / 4 = 3).\n        *   Example 5: `[3, 4, 8]` repeated 4 times (12 / 3 = 4).\n        *   Example 6: `[1, 7]` repeated 6 times (12 / 2 = 6).\n        *   Example 7: `[3, 4, 4, 5]` repeated 3 times (12 / 4 = 3).\n    *   **Consistency:** The logic holds true for all provided training examples. The only required change is adapting to the input data type.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
