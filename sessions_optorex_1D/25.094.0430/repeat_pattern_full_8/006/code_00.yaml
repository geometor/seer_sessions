task_description: "Identify a repeating pattern of non-zero integers at the start of an input sequence and repeat this pattern cyclically to generate an output sequence of fixed length 12."
task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray # Assumed based on runtime errors
      - dimensionality: Likely 1D or 2D (shape 1xN)
      - content: integers
      - structure: Contains a repeating pattern followed by zeros. Zeros act as a delimiter for the pattern.
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated integers
      - length: Exactly 12 integers (when split by space)
  - object: core_pattern
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - derivation: Sequence of integers in the input_sequence from the start up to the first occurrence of '0'.
      - length: Variable, determined by input.
    relationship:
      - derived_from: input_sequence
      - used_to_generate: output_sequence
parameters:
  - parameter: target_length
    value: 12
    description: "The required fixed length of the output integer sequence."
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1_preprocess_input
    action: flatten_and_convert
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: flat_integer_list (list of python ints)
    rule: Flatten the input numpy array to 1D and convert its elements to standard Python integers.
  - step: 2_extract_pattern
    action: extract_sequence_before_zero
    input: flat_integer_list
    output: core_pattern (list of integers)
    rule: Iterate through the flattened list and collect elements until the first '0' is encountered. If the list starts with '0' or is empty, the core_pattern is empty.
  - step: 3_generate_output
    action: repeat_pattern_cyclically
    input: core_pattern
    parameter: target_length (12)
    output: generated_integer_list (list of integers)
    rule: If core_pattern is empty, generate a list of 12 zeros. Otherwise, repeat the core_pattern cyclically until the list contains exactly target_length (12) elements. Use modulo arithmetic on the index and pattern length.
  - step: 4_format_output
    action: join_with_spaces
    input: generated_integer_list
    output: output_sequence (string)
    rule: Convert each integer in the list to a string and join them together, separated by single spaces.
