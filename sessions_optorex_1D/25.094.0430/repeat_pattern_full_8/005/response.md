"""
Transforms an input sequence (expected as a 1D NumPy array of integers) into 
a space-separated string of 12 integers. The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the 'core pattern' which consists of the integers from the 
   start of the input sequence up to, but not including, the first zero.
2. Generating an output sequence of exactly 12 integers by repeating the 
   'core pattern' cyclically. If the core pattern is empty (input starts 
   with 0), the output sequence consists of 12 zeros.
3. Formatting the generated 12-integer sequence into a single string with 
   elements separated by spaces.
