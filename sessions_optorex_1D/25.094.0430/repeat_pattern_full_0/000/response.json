            "text": "**Perception of the task elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers. The input sequence appears to consist of a repeating pattern of digits, followed by one or more zeros that pad the sequence to a consistent length (12 in all examples). The core pattern itself might be repeated once or more times before the zeros start. The output sequence takes this fundamental repeating pattern and repeats it as many times as needed to fill the original length of the input sequence, truncating the final repetition if necessary.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
