**Perception of the task elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers. The input sequence appears to consist of a repeating pattern of digits, followed by one or more zeros that pad the sequence to a consistent length (12 in all examples). The core pattern itself might be repeated once or more times before the zeros start. The output sequence takes this fundamental repeating pattern and repeats it as many times as needed to fill the original length of the input sequence, truncating the final repetition if necessary.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - contains: a repeating pattern followed by zeros
      - length: L (e.g., 12 in the examples)
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: L (same as input)
      - contains: repetitions of the fundamental pattern from the input
  - name: fundamental_pattern
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (subset of input_sequence)
      - derived_from: the initial non-zero part of the input_sequence
      - characteristic: the shortest sequence that repeats to form the non-zero part of the input

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_prefix
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: sequence of numbers before the first zero
  - name: find_fundamental_pattern
    inputs: non_zero_prefix
    outputs: fundamental_pattern
    logic: Find the shortest repeating unit at the start of the non_zero_prefix. Iterate through possible lengths 'p_len' from 1 up to half the length of the non_zero_prefix. The pattern is the sequence of length 'p_len' if the elements from index 0 to p_len-1 are identical to the elements from index p_len to 2*p_len-1.
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - fundamental_pattern
      - original_input_length (L)
    outputs: output_sequence
    logic: Repeat the fundamental_pattern until the generated sequence has length L. If the total length of repetitions exceeds L, truncate the sequence to length L.

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the fundamental_pattern identified in the input_sequence.
  - The length of the output_sequence is identical to the length of the input_sequence.
  - The fundamental_pattern is determined by finding the first repetition within the non-zero prefix of the input_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers (`input_sequence`) and note its total length (`L`).
2.  Identify the portion of the `input_sequence` that contains non-zero numbers occurring before any zeros. Call this the `non_zero_prefix`.
3.  Determine the `fundamental_pattern` by finding the shortest repeating sequence at the beginning of the `non_zero_prefix`. Check sequences of increasing length `p_len` (starting from 1): if the first `p_len` elements match the next `p_len` elements, then the first `p_len` elements constitute the `fundamental_pattern`.
4.  Initialize an empty `output_sequence`.
5.  Repeatedly append the `fundamental_pattern` to the `output_sequence` until the length of the `output_sequence` is greater than or equal to `L`.
6.  Truncate the `output_sequence` to ensure its final length is exactly `L`.
7.  Format the `output_sequence` back into a space-separated string.
