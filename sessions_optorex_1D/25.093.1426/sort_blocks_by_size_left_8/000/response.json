The non-zero numbers appear to form two distinct contiguous blocks, separated by one or more zeros. The core task involves identifying these two blocks, potentially reordering them based on their relative lengths, and then placing them at the right end of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
