task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: zeros, non_zero_numbers
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background_or_separator
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - composed_of: identical_non_zero_integers
      - identified_by: order_of_appearance (first, second)
      - property: length (number of elements)
      - property: value (the non-zero integer)
    relationships:
      - appears_twice_per_input: Two distinct blocks are present in each input sequence.
      - separated_by_zeros: The two blocks are separated by at least one zero in the input.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      conditions: Find the first and second contiguous non-zero blocks.
  - compare_lengths:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      output: boolean (is length B > length A?)
  - determine_output_order:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B), comparison_result
      output: ordered_pair_of_blocks (X, Y)
      logic: If len(B) > len(A), order is (B, A). Else, order is (A, B).
  - construct_output:
      actor: system
      input: sequence_length, ordered_blocks (X, Y)
      output: output_sequence
      steps:
        - Create zero-filled sequence of input length.
        - Place block Y at the rightmost end.
        - Place block X to the left of Y, separated by a single zero.
relationships:
  - input_output_length: The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - block_separation_output: The two non-zero blocks in the output are always separated by exactly one zero.
  - block_placement_output: The reordered blocks (X, Y) are placed at the far right of the output sequence, preceded by zeros.
