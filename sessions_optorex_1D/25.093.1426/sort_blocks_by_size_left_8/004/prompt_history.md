**Perception:**

The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, typically containing zeros and non-zero numbers. The non-zero numbers appear to form two distinct contiguous blocks, separated by one or more zeros. The core task involves identifying these two blocks, potentially reordering them based on their relative lengths, and then placing them at the right end of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: zeros, non_zero_numbers
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background_or_separator
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - composed_of: identical_non_zero_integers
      - identified_by: order_of_appearance (first, second)
      - property: length (number of elements)
      - property: value (the non-zero integer)
    relationships:
      - appears_twice_per_input: Two distinct blocks are present in each input sequence.
      - separated_by_zeros: The two blocks are separated by at least one zero in the input.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      conditions: Find the first and second contiguous non-zero blocks.
  - compare_lengths:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      output: boolean (is length B > length A?)
  - determine_output_order:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B), comparison_result
      output: ordered_pair_of_blocks (X, Y)
      logic: If len(B) > len(A), order is (B, A). Else, order is (A, B).
  - construct_output:
      actor: system
      input: sequence_length, ordered_blocks (X, Y)
      output: output_sequence
      steps:
        - Create zero-filled sequence of input length.
        - Place block Y at the rightmost end.
        - Place block X to the left of Y, separated by a single zero.
relationships:
  - input_output_length: The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - block_separation_output: The two non-zero blocks in the output are always separated by exactly one zero.
  - block_placement_output: The reordered blocks (X, Y) are placed at the far right of the output sequence, preceded by zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output
```python
import sys 
import re # Import re although not used in the final version, kept from thought process

"""
Identifies two blocks of identical non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
Reorders the blocks based on their lengths: if the second block found (B) is strictly longer 
than the first block found (A), the output order becomes (B, A). Otherwise, the order remains (A, B).
Let the final ordered blocks be X (first in pair) and Y (second in pair).
Constructs the output sequence by placing block Y at the far right, preceded by a single zero, 
preceded by block X. The remaining positions at the beginning are filled with zeros. 
The total length of the sequence remains unchanged.
