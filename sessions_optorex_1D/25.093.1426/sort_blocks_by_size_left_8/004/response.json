            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code execution failed across all examples, indicating a systematic issue rather than a problem with the core transformation logic itself. The error messages (`Warning: Could not find two non-empty blocks...` and `list index out of range`) strongly suggested that the `transform` function was not receiving the input data in the expected format (a flat list of integers). Instead, it appeared to be receiving a nested structure or a list containing the raw input string.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the core transformation logic by manually re-analyzing the examples and using code execution to verify block identification, length comparison, and output construction.\n2.  Refine the understanding of the input format (which appears to be a space-separated string of integers).\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input format and the confirmed transformation steps.\n4.  Ensure the Coder phase implements correct input string parsing before applying the transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nCode execution was used to systematically analyze each training example:\n*   Input strings were parsed into lists of integers.\n*   The `find_blocks` logic was applied to identify the first block (A) and the second block (B).\n*   Lengths of A and B were compared.\n*   Blocks were potentially swapped based on the rule: if `len(B) > len(A)`, the output order is (B, A), otherwise (A, B). Let the ordered pair be (X, Y).\n*   The expected output was constructed using the formula: `[0] * num_leading_zeros + X + [0] + Y`, where `num_leading_zeros = total_length - (len(X) + len(Y) + 1)`.\n*   The constructed output was compared against the provided example output.\n\nThe results confirmed:\n*   All examples have a fixed length of 12.\n*   All examples contain exactly two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, separated by at least one zero.\n*   The block swapping rule (`len(B) > len(A)`) is correctly applied in examples 2, 5, 6, and 7.\n*   The output construction rule (padding with zeros on the left, placing X, then a single zero, then Y at the right end) correctly reproduces the output for all examples.\n*   The previous execution failures were due to incorrect input handling/passing in the test environment, not flaws in the transformation logic derived from the examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
