**Perception:**

The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, typically containing zeros and non-zero numbers. The non-zero numbers appear to form two distinct contiguous blocks, separated by one or more zeros. The core task involves identifying these two blocks, potentially reordering them based on their relative lengths, and then placing them at the right end of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts:**

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array, based on the error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). The core logic for identifying the two non-zero blocks, comparing their lengths, reordering them, and constructing the output sequence seems consistent with the examples when manually verified.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to expect the input as a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step. The logic for block identification, comparison, and output construction should remain the same but operate on the list/array data structure.

**Gather Metrics:**

We will use code execution to verify the properties of the blocks in each training example and confirm the reordering rule.

task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers # Changed from sequence to be more specific, confirmed by error/fix
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: zeros, non_zero_numbers
      - structure: Contains exactly two distinct contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers, separated by at least one zero.
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background_filler_or_separator
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence (list of integers)
      - composed_of: identical_non_zero_integers
      - identified_by: order_of_appearance (first_block 'A', second_block 'B')
      - property: length (number of elements)
      - property: value (the non-zero integer)
    relationships:
      - appears_twice_per_input: Exactly two blocks (A, B) are present in each input sequence.
      - separated_by_zeros_input: Blocks A and B are separated by at least one zero in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: same_as_input_sequence
      - structure: Starts with zero or more zeros, followed by an ordered pair of non-zero blocks (X, Y) separated by a single zero `[..., 0, X, 0, Y]`.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence (list of integers)
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B) # Both as lists of integers
      conditions: Find the first and second contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.
  - compare_lengths:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      output: boolean (is length(B) > length(A)?)
  - determine_output_order:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B), comparison_result
      output: ordered_pair_of_blocks (X, Y) # X is the block placed to the left, Y to the right in the output structure
      logic: If length(B) > length(A), the output order is (X=B, Y=A). Otherwise (if length(B) <= length(A)), the output order is (X=A, Y=B).
  - construct_output:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence_length (n), ordered_blocks (X, Y)
      output: output_sequence (list of integers)
      steps:
        - Calculate required space: len(X) + len(Y) + 1 (for the separator zero).
        - Calculate number of leading zeros: n - (len(X) + len(Y) + 1).
        - Create the output list: `[0] * num_leading_zeros + X + [0] + Y`.
relationships:
  - input_output_length: The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - block_separation_output: The two non-zero blocks (X and Y) in the output are always separated by exactly one zero.
  - block_placement_output: The reordered blocks (X, Y) and their single zero separator are placed at the far right of the output sequence, preceded by leading zeros filling the remaining space.

**Natural Language Program (Updated):**

1.  **Receive Input:** Accept the input as a list of integers (let its length be `n`).
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input list to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block A) and the second contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block B). Store these blocks as lists of integers.
3.  **Compare Lengths:** Compare the lengths (number of elements) of Block B and Block A.
4.  **Determine Output Order:**
    *   If the length of Block B is strictly greater than the length of Block A, define the output blocks as X = Block B and Y = Block A.
    *   Otherwise (if the length of Block B is less than or equal to the length of Block A), define the output blocks as X = Block A and Y = Block B.
5.  **Construct Output:**
    *   Calculate the total length required for the non-zero part of the output: `len(X) + len(Y) + 1` (including the single separating zero).
    *   Calculate the number of leading zeros needed: `num_zeros = n - (len(X) + len(Y) + 1)`.
    *   Create the final output list by concatenating: `[0] * num_zeros`, followed by block `X`, followed by `[0]`, followed by block `Y`.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the constructed list of integers.
