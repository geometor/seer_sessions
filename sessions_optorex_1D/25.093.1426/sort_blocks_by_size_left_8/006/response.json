            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is a type mismatch error. The previous `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the testing framework provided the input as a NumPy array, which lacks this method, causing the immediate failure across all examples.\n\nThe underlying logic for identifying the two non-zero blocks (A and B), comparing their lengths, reordering them (swapping if B is strictly longer than A), and constructing the output sequence (padding with leading zeros, placing the first determined block X, a single zero separator, and the second determined block Y at the end) appears conceptually sound based on a manual review of the examples against the intended logic described in the previous natural language program.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle the input type, which is a list or NumPy array of integers, instead of a string. The `find_blocks` helper function already seems capable of handling list inputs.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the previous code failed during input processing, no metrics related to the transformation logic (block identification, comparison, output construction) were generated. The only available metric is the error message itself: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.\n\nManually verifying the logic against the examples:\n\n| Example   | Input Sequence                 | Block A (First) | Len(A) | Block B (Second) | Len(B) | Len(B) > Len(A)? | Output Order (X, Y) | Expected Output                  | Calculated Output              | Match |\n| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------- | :----- | :--------------- | :----- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :---- |\n| train\\_1  | `[3,3,3,0..0,3]`               | `[3,3,3]`       | 3      | `[3]`            | 1      | False            | (A, B)              | `[0..0, 3,3,3, 0, 3]`           | `[0..0, 3,3,3, 0, 3]`           | Yes   |\n| train\\_2  | `[0,0,2,0..0,2,2,2,2,0,0]`     | `[2]`           | 1      | `[2,2,2,2]`      | 4      | True             | (B, A)              | `[0..0, 2,2,2,2, 0, 2]`         | `[0..0, 2,2,2,2, 0, 2]`         | Yes   |\n| train\\_3  | `[7,7,7,7,0..0,7,7,0,0]`       | `[7,7,7,7]`     | 4      | `[7,7]`          | 2      | False            | (A, B)              | `[0..0, 7,7,7,7, 0, 7,7]`       | `[0..0, 7,7,7,7, 0, 7,7]`       | Yes   |\n| train\\_4  | `[2,2,2,0..0,2,2]`             | `[2,2,2]`       | 3      | `[2,2]`          | 2      | False            | (A, B)              | `[0..0, 2,2,2, 0, 2,2]`         | `[0..0, 2,2,2, 0, 2,2]`         | Yes   |\n| train\\_5  | `[0..0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3]`       | `[3,3]`         | 2      | `[3,3,3,3]`      | 4      | True             | (B, A)              | `[0..0, 3,3,3,3, 0, 3,3]`       | `[0..0, 3,3,3,3, 0, 3,3]`       | Yes   |\n| train\\_6  | `[0,0,7,7,0,7,7,7,0..0]`       | `[7,7]`         | 2      | `[7,7,7]`        | 3      | True             | (B, A)              | `[0..0, 7,7,7, 0, 7,7]`         | `[0..0, 7,7,7, 0, 7,7]`         | Yes   |\n| train\\_7  | `[0,1,1,1,0..0,1,1,1,1]`       | `[1,1,1]`       | 3      | `[1,1,1,1]`      | 4      | True             | (B, A)              | `[0..0, 1,1,1,1, 0, 1,1,1]`     | `[0..0, 1,1,1,1, 0, 1,1,1]`     | Yes   |\n\n*(Note: `0..0` represents sequences of zeros)*\n\nThe manual verification suggests the core transformation logic described previously is correct.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
