"""
Identifies two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers (A and B) in an input sequence (list of integers).
Reorders these blocks based on their lengths: if the second block found (B) is strictly longer than the first block found (A), the output order becomes (B, A). Otherwise, the order remains (A, B). Let the final ordered blocks be X and Y.
Constructs the output sequence by placing block Y at the far right, preceded by a single zero, preceded by block X. The remaining positions at the beginning of the sequence are filled with zeros. The total length of the sequence remains unchanged. The final output is a list of integers.
