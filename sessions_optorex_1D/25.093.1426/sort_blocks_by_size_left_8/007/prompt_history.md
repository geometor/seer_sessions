**Perception:**

The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, typically containing zeros and non-zero numbers. The non-zero numbers appear to form two distinct contiguous blocks, separated by one or more zeros. The core task involves identifying these two blocks, potentially reordering them based on their relative lengths, and then placing them at the right end of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts:**

    relationships:

      - separated_by_zeros: The two blocks are separated by at least one zero in the input.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      conditions: Find the first and second contiguous non-zero blocks.
  - compare_lengths:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      output: boolean (is length B > length A?)

  - construct_output:
      actor: system
      input: sequence_length, ordered_blocks (X, Y)

      steps:
        - Create zero-filled sequence of input length.
        - Place block Y at the rightmost end.
        - Place block X to the left of Y, separated by a single zero.
relationships:
  - input_output_length: The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - block_separation_output: The two non-zero blocks in the output are always separated by exactly one zero.
  - block_placement_output: The reordered blocks (X, Y) are placed at the far right of the output sequence, preceded by zeros.

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified is a type mismatch error. The previous `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the testing framework provided the input as a NumPy array, which lacks this method, causing the immediate failure across all examples.

The underlying logic for identifying the two non-zero blocks (A and B), comparing their lengths, reordering them (swapping if B is strictly longer than A), and constructing the output sequence (padding with leading zeros, placing the first determined block X, a single zero separator, and the second determined block Y at the end) appears conceptually sound based on a manual review of the examples against the intended logic described in the previous natural language program.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle the input type, which is a list or NumPy array of integers, instead of a string. The `find_blocks` helper function already seems capable of handling list inputs.

**Metrics:**

Since the previous code failed during input processing, no metrics related to the transformation logic (block identification, comparison, output construction) were generated. The only available metric is the error message itself: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.

Manually verifying the logic against the examples:

| Example   | Input Sequence                 | Block A (First) | Len(A) | Block B (Second) | Len(B) | Len(B) > Len(A)? | Output Order (X, Y) | Expected Output                  | Calculated Output              | Match |

The manual verification suggests the core transformation logic described previously is correct.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Receive Input:** Accept the input sequence as a list (or NumPy array) of integers. Let its length be `n`.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input sequence to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block A) and the second contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block B). Store these blocks as lists.
3.  **Compare Lengths:** Calculate the length of Block A (`len_A`) and the length of Block B (`len_B`).
4.  **Determine Output Order:** Compare the lengths.
    *   If `len_B` is strictly greater than `len_A`, assign Block B to be the first output block (Block X) and Block A to be the second output block (Block Y).
    *   Otherwise (if `len_B` is less than or equal to `len_A`), assign Block A to be Block X and Block B to be Block Y.
5.  **Calculate Padding:** Determine the total length required for the blocks and the single zero separator: `required_len = len(X) + len(Y) + 1`. Calculate the number of leading zeros needed: `num_leading_zeros = n - required_len`.
6.  **Construct Output:** Create the output list by concatenating:
    *   A list containing `num_leading_zeros` zeros.
    *   Block X.
    *   A list containing a single zero (`[0]`).
    *   Block Y.
7.  **Return Output:** Return the constructed list of integers.
