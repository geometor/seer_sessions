**General Assessment:**

The primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array, based on the error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). The core logic for identifying the two non-zero blocks, comparing their lengths, reordering them, and constructing the output sequence seems consistent with the examples when manually verified.

The strategy for resolution is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to expect the input as a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step. The logic for block identification, comparison, and output construction should remain the same but operate on the list/array data structure.

**Gather Metrics:**

We will use code execution to verify the properties of the blocks in each training example and confirm the reordering rule.

actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence (list of integers)
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B) # Both as lists of integers

**Natural Language Program (Updated):**

1.  **Receive Input:** Accept the input as a list of integers (let its length be `n`).
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the input list to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block A) and the second contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers (Block B). Store these blocks as lists of integers.
3.  **Compare Lengths:** Compare the lengths (number of elements) of Block B and Block A.
4.  **Determine Output Order:**
    *   If the length of Block B is strictly greater than the length of Block A, define the output blocks as X = Block B and Y = Block A.
    *   Otherwise (if the length of Block B is less than or equal to the length of Block A), define the output blocks as X = Block A and Y = Block B.
5.  **Construct Output:**
    *   Calculate the total length required for the non-zero part of the output: `len(X) + len(Y) + 1` (including the single separating zero).
    *   Calculate the number of leading zeros needed: `num_zeros = n - (len(X) + len(Y) + 1)`.
    *   Create the final output list by concatenating: `[0] * num_zeros`, followed by block `X`, followed by `[0]`, followed by block `Y`.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the constructed list of integers.
