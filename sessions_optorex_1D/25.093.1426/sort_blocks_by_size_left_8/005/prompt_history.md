**Perception:**

The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, typically containing zeros and non-zero numbers. The non-zero numbers appear to form two distinct contiguous blocks, separated by one or more zeros. The core task involves identifying these two blocks, potentially reordering them based on their relative lengths, and then placing them at the right end of the output sequence, separated by a single zero. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts:**

      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)

  - object: zero

      - identified_by: order_of_appearance (first, second)
      - property: length (number of elements)
      - property: value (the non-zero integer)
    relationships:
      - appears_twice_per_input: Two distinct blocks are present in each input sequence.
      - separated_by_zeros: The two blocks are separated by at least one zero in the input.
actions:
  - identify_blocks:
      actor: system
      input: input_sequence
      output: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      conditions: Find the first and second contiguous non-zero blocks.
  - compare_lengths:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B)
      output: boolean (is length B > length A?)
  - determine_output_order:
      actor: system
      input: first_block (A), second_block (B), comparison_result
      output: ordered_pair_of_blocks (X, Y)
      logic: If len(B) > len(A), order is (B, A). Else, order is (A, B).
  - construct_output:
      actor: system
      input: sequence_length, ordered_blocks (X, Y)
      output: output_sequence
      steps:
        - Create zero-filled sequence of input length.
        - Place block Y at the rightmost end.
        - Place block X to the left of Y, separated by a single zero.
relationships:
  - input_output_length: The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - block_separation_output: The two non-zero blocks in the output are always separated by exactly one zero.
  - block_placement_output: The reordered blocks (X, Y) are placed at the far right of the output sequence, preceded by zeros.

1.  Initialize an output
```python

"""
Identifies two blocks of identical non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
Reorders the blocks based on their lengths: if the second block found (B) is strictly longer 
than the first block found (A), the output order becomes (B, A). Otherwise, the order remains (A, B).
Let the final ordered blocks be X (first in pair) and Y (second in pair).
Constructs the output sequence by placing block Y at the far right, preceded by a single zero, 
preceded by block X. The remaining positions at the beginning are filled with zeros.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code execution failed across all examples, indicating a systematic issue rather than a problem with the core transformation logic itself. The error messages (`Warning: Could not find two non-empty blocks...` and `list index out of range`) strongly suggested that the `transform` function was not receiving the input data in the expected format (a flat list of integers). Instead, it appeared to be receiving a nested structure or a list containing the raw input string.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the core transformation logic by manually re-analyzing the examples and using code execution to verify block identification, length comparison, and output construction.
2.  Refine the understanding of the input format (which appears to be a space-separated string of integers).
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input format and the confirmed transformation steps.
4.  Ensure the Coder phase implements correct input string parsing before applying the transformation logic.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Code execution was used to systematically analyze each training example:
*   Input strings were parsed into lists of integers.
*   The `find_blocks` logic was applied to identify the first block (A) and the second block (B).
*   Lengths of A and B were compared.
*   Blocks were potentially swapped based on the rule: if `len(B) > len(A)`, the output order is (B, A), otherwise (A, B). Let the ordered pair be (X, Y).
*   The expected output was constructed using the formula: `[0] * num_leading_zeros + X + [0] + Y`, where `num_leading_zeros = total_length - (len(X) + len(Y) + 1)`.
*   The constructed output was compared against the provided example output.

The results confirmed:
*   All examples have a fixed length of 12.
*   All examples contain exactly two contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits, separated by at least one zero.
*   The block swapping rule (`len(B) > len(A)`) is correctly applied in examples 2, 5, 6, and 7.
*   The output construction rule (padding with zeros on the left, placing X, then a single zero, then Y at the right end) correctly reproduces the output for all examples.
*   The previous execution failures were due to incorrect input handling/passing in the test environment, not flaws in the transformation logic derived from the examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input, which is a single string containing space-separated integers. Convert this string into a list of integer values. Let the total number of integers (length of the list) be `n`.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the list of integers from left to right to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (Block A). Continue scanning from where the first block ended to find the second contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (Block B). Store both blocks as lists of integers.
3.  **Compare Lengths:** Compare the number of elements (length) of Block B with the length of Block A.
4.  **Determine Output Order:**
    *   If the length of Block B is strictly greater than the length of Block A, assign Block B to be the 'left block' (X) and Block A to be the 'right block' (Y) for the output construction.
    *   Otherwise (if `len(B) <= len(A)`), assign Block A to be the 'left block' (X) and Block B to be the 'right block' (Y).
5.  **Construct Output List:**
    *   Calculate the total space needed for the blocks and their separator: `required_length = length(X) + length(Y) + 1`.
    *   Calculate the number of leading zeros needed: `num_leading_zeros = n - required_length`.
    *   Create the final list of integers by concatenating: `num_leading_zeros` copies of `0`, followed by the elements of block X, followed by a single `0` (the separator), followed by the elements of block Y.
6.  **Format Output:** Convert the resulting list of integers back into a single string with elements separated by spaces.
