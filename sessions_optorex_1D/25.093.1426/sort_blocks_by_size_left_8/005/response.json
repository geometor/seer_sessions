Otherwise, the order remains (A, B). Let the final ordered blocks be X and Y.\nConstructs the output sequence by placing block Y at the far right, preceded by a single zero, preceded by block X. The remaining positions at the beginning of the sequence are filled with zeros. The total length of the sequence remains unchanged.
