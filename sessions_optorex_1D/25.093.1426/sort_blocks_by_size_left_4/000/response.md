Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (represented as space-separated strings) of integers. All examples have a sequence length of 12.
2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. The digit '0' acts as a separator or background. Each input example contains only one type of non-zero digit (e.g., only 4s, only 1s, only 6s).
3.  **Core Action:** The task involves rearranging these non-zero blocks within a sequence of zeros. Specifically, it identifies the two longest blocks (handling ties and cases with fewer than two blocks) and places them in
