All examples have a sequence length of 12.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. The digit '0' acts as a separator or background. Each input example contains only one type of non-zero digit (e.g., only 4s, only 1s, only 6s).\n3.  **Core Action:** The task involves rearranging these non-zero blocks within a sequence of zeros. Specifically, it identifies the two longest blocks (handling ties and cases with fewer than two blocks) and places them in"
