task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: sequence
  element_type: integer (scalar)
  separator: space (implied for initial parsing)
  representation: potentially list, 1D numpy array, or 2D numpy array (1 row)
  length: fixed (e.g., 12)

components:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (after normalization)
      - length: integer
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers
      - length: integer (equals input_sequence length)
  - object: block
    properties:
      - elements: list of non-zero integers (contiguous in input)
      - length: integer (number of elements)
      - start_index: integer (position of the first element in the input_sequence)

actions:
  - name: normalize_input
    input: raw_input (list, numpy array)
    output: normalized_input_sequence (list of integers), original_length (integer)
    description: Ensure the input is treated as a flat list of integers. Determine the sequence length.
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: normalized_input_sequence
    output: list of blocks (each with elements, length, start_index)
    description: Scan the normalized input sequence to find all contiguous sub-sequences composed entirely of non-zero digits.
  - name: sort_blocks
    input: list of blocks
    output: sorted list of blocks
    description: Sort the identified blocks first by length in descending order, then by their original start_index in ascending order to break ties.
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - sorted list of blocks
      - original_sequence_length
    output: output_sequence (list of integers)
    description: >
      Calculate the required number of leading zeroes based on the total length,
      the sum of block lengths, and the number of blocks (to account for separators).
      Create the output sequence by starting with the leading zeroes, then appending
      the sorted blocks, placing a single zero separator between consecutive blocks. Ensure final length matches original_length.

relationships:
  - The output sequence length must equal the input sequence length.
  - The non-zero elements in the output sequence are exactly the non-zero elements from the input sequence, rearranged into blocks.
  - The order of blocks in the output depends on the sorting criteria (length desc, index asc).
  - The number of leading zeroes depends on the total length and the space occupied by the sorted blocks and their separators (k-1 separators for k blocks).
