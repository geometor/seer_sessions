## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits (represented as space-separated integers) into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks of non-zero digits within the input sequence and rearranging these blocks in the output sequence based on specific criteria, padding with zeroes to maintain the original length.

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of integers of a fixed length (12 in all examples).
2.  **Zeroes and Non-Zeroes:** The digit '0' acts as a separator or background, while non-zero digits form meaningful blocks.
3.  **Block Identification:** Contiguous sequences of non-zero digits in the input seem to be treated as distinct units or "blocks".
4.  **Rearrangement:** These blocks are rearranged in the output. The original relative order of digits *within* a block is preserved.
5.  **Sorting Criterion:** The rearrangement of blocks appears to follow a sorting rule. Observing the examples suggests blocks are sorted primarily by their length in descending order. Ties in length seem to be broken by the original starting index of the block in ascending order.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence starts with a number of leading zeroes, followed by the sorted blocks. Each block is separated from the next by a single zero. The total length of the sequence remains constant.
7.  **Padding:** The number of leading zeroes is determined by the total length of the sequence minus the sum of the lengths of all blocks and the number of separating zeroes required between blocks.

    description: >
      Calculate the required number of leading zeroes based on the total length,
      the sum of block lengths, and the number of blocks (to account for separators).
      Create the output sequence by starting with the leading zeroes, then appending
      the sorted blocks, placing a single zero separator between consecutive blocks.

relationships:
  - The output sequence length must equal the input sequence length.
  - The non-zero elements in the output sequence are exactly the non-zero elements from the input sequence, potentially rearranged.
  - The order of blocks in the output depends on the sorting criteria (length desc, index asc).
  - The number of leading zeroes depends on the total length and the space occupied by the sorted blocks and their separators.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers (the `input_sequence`). Record its `length`.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `blocks`. Iterate through the `input_sequence` to identify contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers. For each block found, store its sequence of digits, its length, and its starting index in the `input_sequence`. Add this block information to the `blocks` list.
3.  Sort the `blocks` list. The primary sorting key is the block length (descending order). The secondary sorting key (for tie-breaking) is the block's original starting index (ascending order). Store the result as `sorted_blocks`.
4.  Calculate the total number of non-zero elements (`N`) by summing the lengths of all blocks in `sorted_blocks`.
5.  Calculate the number of blocks (`k`) which is the count of blocks in `sorted_blocks`.
6.  Calculate the number of separating zeroes required between blocks (`num_separators`). This is `k - 1` if `k > 0`, otherwise it is `0`.
7.  Calculate the number of leading zeroes (`num_leading_zeros`) needed for the output sequence. This is `length - N - num_separators`.
8.  Initialize the `output_sequence` as a list containing `num_leading_zeros` zeroes.
9.  Iterate through the `sorted_blocks`. For each `block`:
    a.  Append the elements of the `block` to the `output_sequence`.
    b.  If this is not the last block in `sorted_blocks`, append a single zero to the `output_sequence` as a separator.
10. Convert the `output_sequence` (list of integers) back into a space-separated string.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code failed during execution on all examples with the error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the input provided by the testing environment to the `transform` function was not a simple list of integers as anticipated by the function's internal logic (specifically the `_identify_blocks` helper). The error typically occurs when a conditional statement (like `if condition:`) receives a NumPy array of boolean values instead of a single True/False value. This could happen if the input `input_sequence` was a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]`) and the iteration `for i, num in enumerate(input_sequence)` resulted in `num` being an entire row array.

The core logic (identifying non-zero blocks, sorting by length descending then index ascending, and reconstructing with zero padding/separation) appears sound based on visual inspection and manual simulation of the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Normalization:** Modify the `transform` function to robustly handle potential input variations. It should explicitly check if the input is a multi-dimensional array and flatten it to a 1D list-like structure before further processing. Converting the input to a standard Python list at the beginning of the `transform` function is a safe approach.
2.  **Validate Core Logic:** Use code execution to manually trace the steps (block identification, sorting, reconstruction) for each example to confirm the transformation rule derived previously is correct.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the validated logic and necessary input handling adjustments.

## Metrics and Validation

The following code simulates the transformation logic manually for each training example to validate the core algorithm.

The manual simulation confirms that the core logic (identifying blocks, sorting by length desc / index asc, reconstructing with separators and padding) correctly transforms the input to the output for all training examples. The previous execution error was solely due to unexpected input format handling, not flawed logic.

    output: list of blocks (each with elements, length, start_index)
    description: Scan the normalized input sequence to find all contiguous sub-sequences composed entirely of non-zero digits.
  - name: sort_blocks
    input: list of blocks
    output: sorted list of blocks
    description: Sort the identified blocks first by length in descending order, then by their original start_index in ascending order to break ties.
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - sorted list of blocks
      - original_sequence_length
    output: output_sequence (list of integers)
    description: >
      Calculate the required number of leading zeroes based on the total length,
      the sum of block lengths, and the number of blocks (to account for separators).
      Create the output sequence by starting with the leading zeroes, then appending
      the sorted blocks, placing a single zero separator between consecutive blocks. Ensure final length matches original_length.

relationships:
  - The output sequence length must equal the input sequence length.
  - The non-zero elements in the output sequence are exactly the non-zero elements from the input sequence, rearranged into blocks.
  - The order of blocks in the output depends on the sorting criteria (length desc, index asc).
  - The number of leading zeroes depends on the total length and the space occupied by the sorted blocks and their separators (k-1 separators for k blocks).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (which might be a list, 1D array, or 2D array with one row).
2.  Normalize the input into a flat list of integers (`normalized_input_sequence`). Determine and record its `original_length`.
3.  Initialize an empty list called `blocks`. Iterate through the `normalized_input_sequence` using an index `i` and element value `num`.
4.  If `num` is not zero:
    a.  If this is the start of a new block, record the current index `i` as `start_index`.
    b.  Append `num` to a temporary `current_block` list.
5.  If `num` is zero and `current_block` is not empty:
    a.  Finalize the block by creating a record containing the `current_block` elements, its length (`len(current_block)`), and its `start_index`.
    b.  Add this record to the `blocks` list.
    c.  Clear `current_block` and reset `start_index`.
6.  After iterating through the entire `normalized_input_sequence`, if `current_block` is not empty, finalize the last block and add it to the `blocks` list.
7.  Sort the `blocks` list to create `sorted_blocks`. The primary sorting key is block length (descending). The secondary sorting key (for tie-breaking) is the block's `start_index` (ascending).
8.  Calculate the total number of non-zero elements (`N`) by summing the lengths of all blocks in `sorted_blocks`.
9.  Calculate the number of blocks (`k`) which is the count of blocks in `sorted_blocks`.
10. Calculate the number of separating zeroes (`num_separators`) needed between blocks: `max(0, k - 1)`.
11. Calculate the number of leading zeroes (`num_leading_zeros`) needed: `max(0, original_length - N - num_separators)`.
12. Initialize the `output_sequence` as a list containing `num_leading_zeros` zeroes.
13. Iterate through the `sorted_blocks`. For each `block`:
    a.  Append the elements of the `block` to the `output_sequence`.
    b.  If this is not the last block, append a single zero separator to the `output_sequence`.
14. Ensure the `output_sequence` has exactly `original_length` elements (pad with zeros or truncate if necessary, although this shouldn't be required with correct logic).
15. Return the `output_sequence` (as a list of integers).
