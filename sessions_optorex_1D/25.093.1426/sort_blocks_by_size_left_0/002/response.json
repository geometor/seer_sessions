            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicates that the previous code assumed the input was a string, while it is actually a NumPy array. The immediate fix involves modifying the input handling part of the `transform` function to work directly with NumPy arrays or lists derived from them.\n\nBeyond the input type error, a re-evaluation of the transformation logic using all examples reveals that the initial hypothesis about reversing block order under specific conditions was incorrect or incomplete. A simpler and more consistent rule appears to be sorting the identified non-zero blocks by their length in descending order before assembling the output.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1.  Correct the input handling to accept NumPy arrays.\n2.  Revise the core logic to sort blocks by length (descending) instead of the conditional reversal.\n3.  Verify this revised logic against all training examples using code execution for metric gathering.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the corrected understanding.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze each training example using the revised logic (identify blocks, sort by length desc, assemble).\n\n"
