task_description: Rearrange a sequence of numbers by consolidating non-zero blocks to the right end.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: single-digit non-negative integers
      - length: 12 (in examples)
  - type: number
    properties:
      - value: 0 (zero)
        role: separator, padding
      - value: non-zero (1-9)
        role: content_element
objects:
  - name: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of one or more non-zero numbers.
    properties:
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - content: sequence of non-zero numbers
      - original_position: order of appearance in the input sequence (1st, 2nd, etc.)
relationships:
  - type: separation
    between: non_zero_block
    by: one or more zeros in the input
    transformed_to: single zero separator in the output (if multiple blocks exist)
  - type: ordering
    of: non_zero_block
    in_output: Generally preserves original relative order, BUT reverses if exactly two blocks exist AND the first block has length 1.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of non_zero_blocks
  - name: determine_order
    input: list of non_zero_blocks
    output: ordered list of non_zero_blocks (potentially reversed)
    condition_for_reversal: count(blocks) == 2 AND length(first_block) == 1
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - ordered list of non_zero_blocks
      - original_sequence_length
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Concatenate blocks with single zero separators in between.
      - Calculate required padding zeros (original_length - length(concatenated_blocks_and_separators)).
      - Prepend padding zeros to the concatenated sequence.
