            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples, here's my perception of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit non-negative integers. All examples have a fixed length of 12.\n2.  **Key Entities:** The primary entities are the numbers within the sequence. They can be categorized into:\n    *   Zeros (0)\n    *   Non-zero numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)\n3.  **Structure:** The non-zero numbers often appear in contiguous groups or \"blocks\", separated by one or more zeros. Zeros also appear at the beginning and end of the sequence.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation rearranges the sequence. The non-zero blocks are moved towards the right end of the sequence. The number of zeros and non-zeros remains the same between input and output.\n5.  **Core Action:** The core action is identifying these non-zero blocks, potentially reordering them based on a specific condition, and then packing them together at the right end, separated by single zeros, with leading zeros filling the remaining space.\n6.  **Order Preservation/Reversal:** The relative order of the non-zero blocks from the input is generally preserved in the output *except* under a specific condition: if there are exactly two blocks and the first block consists of only a single number, the order of these two blocks is reversed in the output.\n7.  **Separators:** When the blocks are placed in the output, they are separated by exactly one zero, regardless of how many zeros separated them in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the final order for placing these blocks in the output:\n    *   Check if there are exactly two blocks identified in step 2.\n    *   If yes, check if the first block (the one that appeared earliest in the input) contains only one number (has a length of 1).\n    *   If both conditions are true (exactly two blocks AND the first block has length 1), reverse the order of the two blocks.\n    *   Otherwise (if there are not exactly two blocks, or if the first of the two blocks has length greater than 1), maintain the original relative order of the blocks.\n4.  Construct the core part of the output sequence by concatenating the blocks in the order determined in step 3. Insert a single zero between each consecutive block. (If there's only one block, no zeros are inserted here).\n5.  Calculate the number of leading zeros needed: subtract the total length of the core part (blocks + separating zeros) from the total length of the original input sequence.\n6.  Create the final output sequence by prepending the calculated number of leading zeros to the core part constructed in step 4."
