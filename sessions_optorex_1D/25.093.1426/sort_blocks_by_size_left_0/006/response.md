**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous execution attempt failed because the implemented code did not correctly reflect the transformation logic derived from the examples. The results showed the input was returned unchanged, indicating a flaw in the implementation of the rearrangement, likely related to using the wrong transformation hypothesis (sorting by length) or a bug preventing the modification.

Re-examining the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern:
1.  Identify contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers.
2.  Sort these blocks based on their length in descending order. A stable sort is crucial for blocks of equal length (preserving their original relative order).
3.  Reconstruct the sequence by placing the sorted blocks at the right end, separated by single zeros.
4.  Pad the beginning with the necessary number of zeros to match the original sequence length.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly implement the logic described above: block identification, stable sorting by length (descending), and reconstruction with zero separators and padding.
2.  Update the descriptive documents (YAML, natural language program) to accurately reflect this sorting-based transformation.
3.  Use code execution to gather metrics and verify the updated logic against all examples.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of numbers by consolidating non-zero blocks to the right end, sorting them by length.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: single-digit non-negative integers
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
  - type: number
    properties:
      - value: 0 (zero)
        role: separator, padding
      - value: non-zero (1-9)
        role: content_element
objects:
  - name: non_zero_block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of one or more non-zero numbers.
    properties:
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - content: sequence of non-zero numbers
      - original_position: implicit start index or order of appearance in the input sequence
relationships:
  - type: separation
    between: non_zero_block
    by: one or more zeros in the input
    transformed_to: single zero separator in the output (only between blocks)
  - type: ordering
    of: non_zero_block
    in_output: Blocks are ordered based on their length in descending order. If blocks have the same length, their relative order from the input is preserved (stable sort).
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of non_zero_blocks (preserving content and implicit original order)
  - name: sort_blocks
    input: list of non_zero_blocks
    output: ordered list of non_zero_blocks
    method: Stable sort by block length in descending order.
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - sorted list of non_zero_blocks
      - original_sequence_length
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Initialize an empty core list.
      - Iterate through the sorted blocks. Append each block's content to the core list.
      - If it is not the last block, append a single zero to the core list as a separator.
      - Calculate required padding zeros: original_length - length(core_list).
      - Prepend the padding zeros to the core list to create the final output sequence.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers. Note its total length.
2.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify all contiguous blocks (subsequences) consisting solely of non-zero numbers. Store these blocks, preserving the numbers within each block and implicitly noting their original relative order.
3.  Sort the identified blocks based on their length (number of elements) in descending order. If two or more blocks have the same length, maintain their original relative order (perform a stable sort).
4.  Create a new list, initially empty, to build the core part of the output.
5.  Iterate through the sorted blocks. For each block:
    *   Append all numbers from the current block to the core list.
    *   If this is not the last block in the sorted list, append a single zero (0) to the core list as a separator.
6.  Calculate the number of padding zeros required: subtract the length of the core list (containing sorted blocks and separators) from the original total length of the input sequence.
7.  Construct the final output sequence by creating a list of the calculated number of padding zeros and concatenating the core list to it.
8.  Return the final output sequence.
