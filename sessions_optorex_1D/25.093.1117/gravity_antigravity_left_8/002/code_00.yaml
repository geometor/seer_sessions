objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - elements: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - length: 12 (consistent across examples)
      - dtype: numpy.int64 (observed from metrics)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: (0, 1, or 2)

actions:
  - name: sort
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    rule: Rearrange digits from the input sequence based on the priority order [2, 0, 1].

relationships:
  - type: sorting_order
    values: [2, 0, 1] # Priority: 2 comes first, then 0, then 1
  - type: element_conservation
    description: The output sequence contains the exact same multiset of digits as the input sequence. Verified for all examples.
  - type: data_format
    description: Both input and output are represented as NumPy arrays of integers.
