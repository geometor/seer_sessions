The sorting order appears to prioritize the digit '2', followed by '0', and lastly '1'.\n*   **Anomaly:** Example train\\_1 presents a discrepancy. While it looks partially sorted, the counts of digits differ between input (`0:3, 1:6, 2:3`) and output (`0:3, 1:7, 2:2`). One '2' seems to be replaced by a '1' in the output, which breaks the simple sorting pattern observed in other examples. Assuming this might be an outlier or error in the example data, the dominant pattern is sorting.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
