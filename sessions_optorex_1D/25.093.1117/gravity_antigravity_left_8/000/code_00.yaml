objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - digits: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: 12 (consistent across examples)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: (0, 1, or 2)

actions:
  - name: sort
    input: input_sequence (list_of_digits)
    output: output_sequence (list_of_digits)
    rule: Arrange digits based on a specific priority order.

relationships:
  - type: sorting_order
    values: [2, 0, 1] # Priority: 2 comes first, then 0, then 1
  - type: element_conservation
    description: For examples 2-7, the output sequence contains the exact same multiset of digits as the input sequence. Example 1 shows a deviation from this.
