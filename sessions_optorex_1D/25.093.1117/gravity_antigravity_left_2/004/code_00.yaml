task_description: Sorts a list/array of integers (containing only 0, 1, and 2) according to a specific custom order.
input_object:
  type: list or 1D numpy array
  element_type: integer
  possible_values: [0, 1, 2]
  properties:
    - variable length (though constant within examples provided)
    - contains a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s
output_object:
  type: list or 1D numpy array (same type as input)
  element_type: integer
  possible_values: [0, 1, 2]
  properties:
    - same length as input object
    - contains the same count of each value (0, 1, 2) as the input object
    - elements are ordered specifically: all 2s first, then all 0s, then all 1s.
transformation:
  name: custom_sort
  action: Reorder the elements of the input object.
  rule: Sort elements based on the custom priority: 2 > 0 > 1.
  preserves:
    - element counts (number of 0s, 1s, 2s)
    - total number of elements (length)
relationship:
  input_output: The output object is a permutation of the input object, sorted according to the rule 2 > 0 > 1.
