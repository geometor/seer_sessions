Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** Each input is a sequence (list) of integers. The integers present are 0, 1, and 2. The length of the input sequence varies across examples but seems consistent within a single input/output pair.
*   **Output Data:** Each output is also a sequence (list) of integers containing only 0, 1, and 2. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the corresponding input sequence.
*   **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core operation appears to be a reordering or sorting of the elements. The counts of each distinct number (0, 1, 2) remain the same between the input and its corresponding output. The output sequences exhibit a consistent ordering pattern: all the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - variable_length
  - object: output_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - length: same as corresponding input_list
      - ordering: specific pattern (2s first, then 0s, then 1s)

actions:

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) is preserved from the input_list to the output_list.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output_list is a reordered version of the input_list.
  - type: ordering_rule
    description: Elements in the output_list are ordered such that all 2s precede all 0s, which precede all 1s.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input list of integers.
2.  Count the occurrences of the integer '2' in the input list.
3.  Count the occurrences of the integer '0' in the input list.
4.  Count the occurrences of the integer '1' in the input list.
5.  Construct the output list by:
    a.  Appending the integer '2' repeated by its count.
    b.  Appending the integer '0' repeated by its count.
    c.  Appending the integer '1' repeated by its count.
6.  Return the constructed output list.
