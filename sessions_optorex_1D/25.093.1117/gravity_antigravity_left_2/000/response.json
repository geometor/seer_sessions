The integers present are 0, 1, and 2. The length of the input sequence varies across examples but seems consistent within a single input/output pair.\n*   **Output Data:** Each output is also a sequence (list) of integers containing only 0, 1, and 2. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the corresponding input sequence.\n*   **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core operation appears to be a reordering or sorting of the elements. The counts of each distinct number (0, 1, 2) remain the same between the input and its corresponding output. The output sequences exhibit a consistent ordering pattern: all the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
