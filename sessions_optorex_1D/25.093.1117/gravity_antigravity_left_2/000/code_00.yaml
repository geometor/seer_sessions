task_elements:
  - object: input_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - variable_length
  - object: output_list
    properties:
      - type: list
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - length: same as corresponding input_list
      - ordering: specific pattern (2s first, then 0s, then 1s)
  - object: integer_0
    properties:
      - count_in_input: N
      - count_in_output: N
  - object: integer_1
    properties:
      - count_in_input: M
      - count_in_output: M
  - object: integer_2
    properties:
      - count_in_input: P
      - count_in_output: P
actions:
  - name: reorder
    input: input_list
    output: output_list
    rule: sort based on custom order (2 > 0 > 1)
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) is preserved from the input_list to the output_list.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output_list is a reordered version of the input_list.
  - type: ordering_rule
    description: Elements in the output_list are ordered such that all 2s precede all 0s, which precede all 1s.
