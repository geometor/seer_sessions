            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input format (a string of space-separated integers) and the actual input format provided by the execution environment (a NumPy array).\n\nThe core transformation logic, which involves sorting the input integers based on a custom order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s), appears correct based on the initial analysis and manual verification against the examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to modify the input handling part of the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or more generally, any iterable of integers) directly, instead of expecting a string and attempting to split it. The sorting logic itself can remain largely the same.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The error messages consistently point to the input being a `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Core Logic Validation:** The sorting logic (placing 2s, then 0s, then 1s) was validated using a tool execution simulating list inputs derived from the examples. The results matched the expected outputs for the first three training examples:\n    *   Example 1: Input `[0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` -> Output `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` (Correct)\n    *   Example 2: Input `[1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]` -> Output `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (Correct)\n    *   Example 3: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]` -> Output `[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` (Correct)\n*   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all training and test examples, reinforcing that the input type issue is universal for this task environment.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
