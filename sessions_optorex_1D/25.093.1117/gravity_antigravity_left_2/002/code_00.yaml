task_elements:
  - object: input_data
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error
      - dtype: integer
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - variable_shape # Assumed, typically 1D array/vector
  - object: output_data
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should match input type
      - dtype: integer
      - contains: integers (0, 1, 2)
      - shape: same as corresponding input_data
      - ordering: specific pattern (2s first, then 0s, then 1s)
  - object: integer_0
    properties:
      - count_in_input: N
      - count_in_output: N
  - object: integer_1
    properties:
      - count_in_input: M
      - count_in_output: M
  - object: integer_2
    properties:
      - count_in_input: P
      - count_in_output: P
actions:
  - name: sort
    input: input_data (iterable of integers)
    output: output_data (numpy array of integers)
    rule: sort based on custom order (2 > 0 > 1)
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) is preserved from the input_data to the output_data.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output_data is a sorted version of the input_data according to a specific key.
  - type: ordering_rule
    description: Elements in the output_data are ordered such that all 2s precede all 0s, which precede all 1s.
