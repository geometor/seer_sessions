Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** Each input is a sequence (list) of integers. The integers present are 0, 1, and 2. The length of the input sequence varies across examples but seems consistent within a single input/output pair.
*   **Output Data:** Each output is also a sequence (list) of integers containing only 0, 1, and 2. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the corresponding input sequence.
*   **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the core operation appears to be a reordering or sorting of the elements. The counts of each distinct number (0, 1, 2) remain the same between the input and its corresponding output. The output sequences exhibit a consistent ordering pattern: all the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input list of integers.
2.  Count the occurrences of the integer '2' in the input list.
3.  Count the occurrences of the integer '0' in the input list.
4.  Count the occurrences of the integer '1' in the input list.
5.  Construct the output list by:
    a.  Appending the integer '2' repeated by its count.
    b.  Appending the integer '0' repeated by its count.
    c.  Appending the integer '1' repeated by its count.
6.  Return the constructed output list.
