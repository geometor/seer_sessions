Task: Rearrange elements of a NumPy array according to a custom sort order.

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Contains only integers 0, 1, and 2.
    - Variable length (although examples show length 12).
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray (or list convertible to it)
  Properties:
    - Contains the same integers as the input array, with the same frequencies.
    - Elements are arranged in the specific order: 2s first, then 0s, then 1s.
    - Same length as the input array.
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange (sort) the elements of the input NumPy array.
  Rule: The elements are ordered based on the sequence: 2, 0, 1.
  Relationship: The output array is a permutation of the input array, maintaining element counts but changing their positions according to the custom sort order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
