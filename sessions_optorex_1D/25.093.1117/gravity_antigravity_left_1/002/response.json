            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe execution results reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the input data type. The provided code assumed the input was a space-separated string (`input_str`) and used the `.split()` method, which is valid for strings but not for NumPy arrays. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples, indicating the input is consistently a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the understanding of the input type to `numpy.ndarray`.\n2.  Verify that the previously observed transformation logic (custom sort order 2, 0, 1) still holds true given the input is an array.\n3.  Update the YAML fact document and the natural language program to reflect the correct input type and the steps required to process an array.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Confirmed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the runtime error.\n*   **Output Type:** Based on the examples, the output is also expected to be a sequence of integers, likely represented as a NumPy array or a list that can be easily converted to one.\n*   **Element Values:** Inputs and outputs consist solely of integers 0, 1, and 2.\n*   **Length:** Input and output arrays have identical lengths in all examples (12).\n*   **Element Conservation:** A manual count confirms that the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the input array matches the counts in the corresponding output array for each example.\n    *   Example 1: Input (5x0, 3x1, 4x2) -> Output (4x2, 5x0, 3x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 2: Input (8x0, 1x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 8x0, 1x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 3: Input (7x0, 2x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 7x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 4: Input (7x0, 2x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 7x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 5: Input (6x0, 3x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 6x0, 3x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 6: Input (7x0, 4x1, 1x2) -> Output (1x2, 7x0, 4x1) -> Counts match.\n    *   Example 7: Input (6x0, 2x1, 4x2) -> Output (4x2, 6x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The output array is consistently ordered with all 2s appearing first, followed by all 0s, and finally all 1s. This confirms the custom sorting order (2, 0, 1).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
