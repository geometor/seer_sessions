**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single strings representing space-separated sequences of integers.
2.  **Data Type:** The sequences consist only of the integers 0, 1, and 2.
3.  **Length Consistency:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence (12 elements in all provided examples).
4.  **Element Conservation:** Comparing the frequency counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the input and output for each example reveals that the counts are identical. This indicates the transformation is a rearrangement or permutation of the input elements.
5.  **Sorting Pattern:** The output is not simply sorted in ascending (0, 1, 2) or descending (2, 1, 0) order. Instead, it follows a specific custom sorting order: all 2s appear first, followed by all 0s, and finally all 1s.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange sequence elements according to a custom sort order.

Input:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains only integers 0, 1, and 2.
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples).
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains the same integers as the input, with the same frequencies.
    - Elements are arranged in a specific order.
    - Same length as the input.
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange (sort) the elements of the input list.
  Rule: The elements are ordered based on the sequence: 2, 0, 1.
  Relationship: The output list is a permutation of the input list, maintaining element counts but changing their positions according to the custom sort order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s).
2.  Count the occurrences of each integer (0, 1, and 2) in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by first appending all the 2s (based on the count), then appending all the 0s (based on the count), and finally appending all the 1s (based on the count).
4.  Return the constructed sequence.
