This indicates the transformation is a rearrangement or permutation of the input elements.\n5.  **Sorting Pattern:** The output is not simply sorted in ascending (0, 1, 2) or descending (2, 1, 0) order. Instead, it follows a specific custom sorting order: all 2s appear first, followed by all 0s, and finally all 1s.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
