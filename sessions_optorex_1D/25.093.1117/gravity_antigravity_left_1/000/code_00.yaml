Task: Rearrange sequence elements according to a custom sort order.

Input:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains only integers 0, 1, and 2.
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples).
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains the same integers as the input, with the same frequencies.
    - Elements are arranged in a specific order.
    - Same length as the input.
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange (sort) the elements of the input list.
  Rule: The elements are ordered based on the sequence: 2, 0, 1.
  Relationship: The output list is a permutation of the input list, maintaining element counts but changing their positions according to the custom sort order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
