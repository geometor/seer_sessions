**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single strings representing space-separated sequences of integers.
2.  **Data Type:** The sequences consist only of the integers 0, 1, and 2.
3.  **Length Consistency:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence (12 elements in all provided examples).
4.  **Element Conservation:** Comparing the frequency counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the input and output for each example reveals that the counts are identical. This indicates the transformation is a rearrangement or permutation of the input elements.
5.  **Sorting Pattern:** The output is not simply sorted in ascending (0, 1, 2) or descending (2, 1, 0) order. Instead, it follows a specific custom sorting order: all 2s appear first, followed by all 0s, and finally all 1s.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange sequence elements according to a custom sort order.

Input:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains only integers 0, 1, and 2.
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples).
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (represented as a space-separated string).
  Properties:
    - Contains the same integers as the input, with the same frequencies.
    - Elements are arranged in a specific order.
    - Same length as the input.
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange (sort) the elements of the input list.
  Rule: The elements are ordered based on the sequence: 2, 0, 1.
  Relationship: The output list is a permutation of the input list, maintaining element counts but changing their positions according to the custom sort order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s).
2.  Count the occurrences of each integer (0, 1, and 2) in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by first appending all the 2s (based on the count), then appending all the 0s (based on the count), and finally appending all the 1s (based on the count).
4.  Return the constructed sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution results reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the input data type. The provided code assumed the input was a space-separated string (`input_str`) and used the `.split()` method, which is valid for strings but not for NumPy arrays. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples, indicating the input is consistently a NumPy array.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the understanding of the input type to `numpy.ndarray`.
2.  Verify that the previously observed transformation logic (custom sort order 2, 0, 1) still holds true given the input is an array.
3.  Update the YAML fact document and the natural language program to reflect the correct input type and the steps required to process an array.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** Confirmed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the runtime error.
*   **Output Type:** Based on the examples, the output is also expected to be a sequence of integers, likely represented as a NumPy array or a list that can be easily converted to one.
*   **Element Values:** Inputs and outputs consist solely of integers 0, 1, and 2.
*   **Length:** Input and output arrays have identical lengths in all examples (12).
*   **Element Conservation:** A manual count confirms that the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the input array matches the counts in the corresponding output array for each example.
    *   Example 1: Input (5x0, 3x1, 4x2) -> Output (4x2, 5x0, 3x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 2: Input (8x0, 1x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 8x0, 1x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 3: Input (7x0, 2x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 7x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 4: Input (7x0, 2x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 7x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 5: Input (6x0, 3x1, 3x2) -> Output (3x2, 6x0, 3x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 6: Input (7x0, 4x1, 1x2) -> Output (1x2, 7x0, 4x1) -> Counts match.
    *   Example 7: Input (6x0, 2x1, 4x2) -> Output (4x2, 6x0, 2x1) -> Counts match.
*   **Transformation Rule:** The output array is consistently ordered with all 2s appearing first, followed by all 0s, and finally all 1s. This confirms the custom sorting order (2, 0, 1).

Task: Rearrange elements of a NumPy array according to a custom sort order.

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Contains only integers 0, 1, and 2.
    - Variable length (although examples show length 12).
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray (or list convertible to it)
  Properties:
    - Contains the same integers as the input array, with the same frequencies.
    - Elements are arranged in the specific order: 2s first, then 0s, then 1s.
    - Same length as the input array.
  Objects: Integers (0, 1, 2).

Transformation:
  Action: Rearrange (sort) the elements of the input NumPy array.
  Rule: The elements are ordered based on the sequence: 2, 0, 1.
  Relationship: The output array is a permutation of the input array, maintaining element counts but changing their positions according to the custom sort order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input NumPy array containing integers (0s, 1s, and 2s).
2.  Count the occurrences of each unique integer (0, 1, and 2) within the input array.
3.  Construct a new list (or array).
4.  Append the integer `2` to the new list, repeated according to its count from the input array.
5.  Append the integer `0` to the new list, repeated according to its count from the input array.
6.  Append the integer `1` to the new list, repeated according to its count from the input array.
7.  Convert the constructed list into a NumPy array (or return the list if that's the required output format).
8.  Return the resulting rearranged array (or list).
