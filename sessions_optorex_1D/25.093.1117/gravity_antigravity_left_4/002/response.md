**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the initial assumption about the input data format was incorrect. The input is not a space-separated string but a NumPy array. The core transformation logic (sorting the elements in the order 2, 0, 1) appears consistent with the examples, but the code needs modification to handle the NumPy array input correctly. The strategy is to revise the input processing step in the natural language program and the corresponding code to work directly with the NumPy array.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The code execution failed at the input processing stage for all examples, preventing the generation of output. Therefore, metrics will be based on manual analysis of the input/output pairs to confirm the sorting rule (2 -> 0 -> 1).

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0 2 2 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1]`
    *   Counts: 0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4
    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]` (Matches 4x '2', 4x '0', 4x '1')
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[0 0 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 0]`
    *   Counts: 0: 6, 1: 4, 2: 2
    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]` (Matches 2x '2', 6x '0', 4x '1')
*   **Example 7:**
    *   Input: `[0 1 2 2 2 0 1 0 2 0 2 2]`
    *   Counts: 0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 6
    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1]` (Matches 6x '2', 4x '0', 2x '1')

Manual analysis confirms the pattern: the output is formed by concatenating all the '2's from the input, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's. The counts of each digit are preserved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12 based on examples
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,)
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
relationships:
  - type: permutation
    description: The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but rearranged.
  - type: element_counts_preserved
    description: The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in the input and output sequences.
actions:
  - name: sort_custom
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: Sort the elements of the input NumPy array based on the custom priority order 2 > 0 > 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input NumPy array containing 12 digits (0, 1, or 2).
2.  Count the number of times each digit (0, 1, 2) appears in the input array.
3.  Create a new, empty list to store the output sequence.
4.  Append the digit '2' to the output list as many times as it was counted in the input array.
5.  Append the digit '0' to the output list as many times as it was counted in the input array.
6.  Append the digit '1' to the output list as many times as it was counted in the input array.
7.  Convert the resulting list into a NumPy array.
8.  Return the output NumPy array.
