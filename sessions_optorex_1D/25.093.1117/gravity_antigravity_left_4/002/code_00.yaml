objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12 based on examples
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,)
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
relationships:
  - type: permutation
    description: The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but rearranged.
  - type: element_counts_preserved
    description: The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in the input and output sequences.
actions:
  - name: sort_custom
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: Sort the elements of the input NumPy array based on the custom priority order 2 > 0 > 1.
