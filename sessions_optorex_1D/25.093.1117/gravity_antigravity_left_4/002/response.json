            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the initial assumption about the input data format was incorrect. The input is not a space-separated string but a NumPy array. The core transformation logic (sorting the elements in the order 2, 0, 1) appears consistent with the examples, but the code needs modification to handle the NumPy array input correctly. The strategy is to revise the input processing step in the natural language program and the corresponding code to work directly with the NumPy array.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe code execution failed at the input processing stage for all examples, preventing the generation of output. Therefore, metrics will be based on manual analysis of the input/output pairs to confirm the sorting rule (2 -> 0 -> 1).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0 2 2 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1]`\n    *   Counts: 0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4\n    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]` (Matches 4x '2', 4x '0', 4x '1')\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[0 0 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 0]`\n    *   Counts: 0: 6, 1: 4, 2: 2\n    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1]` (Matches 2x '2', 6x '0', 4x '1')\n*   **Example 7:**\n    *   Input: `[0 1 2 2 2 0 1 0 2 0 2 2]`\n    *   Counts: 0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 6\n    *   Expected Output: `[2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1]` (Matches 6x '2', 4x '0', 2x '1')\n\nManual analysis confirms the pattern: the output is formed by concatenating all the '2's from the input, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's. The counts of each digit are preserved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
