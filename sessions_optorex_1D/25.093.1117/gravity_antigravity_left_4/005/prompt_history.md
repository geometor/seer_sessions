Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** A sequence of 12 single digits, where each digit is either 0, 1, or 2.
*   **Output Data:** A sequence of 12 single digits, also restricted to 0, 1, or 2.
*   **Transformation:** The output sequence appears to be a rearranged version of the input sequence. The digits present in the input are the same digits present in the output, and their counts are preserved.
*   **Pattern:** The rearrangement follows a specific, non-standard sorting order. Observing the outputs across all examples, the digits are consistently ordered with all the '2's appearing first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed on all examples with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`. This error occurred within the `collections.Counter` function call. `collections.Counter` builds a dictionary where keys are the items being counted. Dictionaries require keys to be hashable. NumPy arrays are mutable and therefore not hashable. This indicates that the `input_grid` passed to the `transform` function was likely a 2D NumPy array, and iterating over it (as `Counter` does) yielded NumPy array objects (likely rows or columns) instead of the expected individual integer elements.

The core transformation logic (sorting elements based on the priority 2 > 0 > 1) appears correct based on the input/output examples, but the implementation needs to handle the grid structure properly.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Acknowledge Grid Structure:** Modify the code to assume the input `input_grid` is a NumPy array (potentially 2D).
2.  **Flatten:** Extract all individual integer elements from the grid into a flat 1D sequence. The `flatten()` method of NumPy arrays is suitable for this.
3.  **Count/Sort:** Apply the counting and sorting logic (2s first, then 0s, then 1s) to this flattened sequence.
4.  **Reshape:** Reshape the sorted 1D sequence back into the original dimensions of the input grid. Store the original shape before flattening.
5.  **Return:** Return the reshaped NumPy array.

**Metrics:**

Based on the string representations and the error, we infer the following:

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Input Elements:** 0, 1, 2.
*   **Input Size:** 12 elements per example.
*   **Input Shape:** Consistent across examples, likely 2D (e.g., 1x12 or 12x1, based on the string format; could potentially be other 2D shapes like 3x4, 4x3, 2x6, 6x2, but 1x12 seems most plausible given the single line representation). The error confirms it's not 1D.
*   **Output Shape:** Same as the input shape for each corresponding example.
*   **Transformation:** Rearrangement (sorting) of elements based on a custom key (2 > 0 > 1). Element counts are preserved.

Let's verify element counts for `train_1` as an example:

*   Input `train_1`: `0 2 2 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1`
    *   Count(0): 4
    *   Count(1): 4
    *   Count(2): 4
*   Output `train_1`: `2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1`
    *   Count(0): 4
    *   Count(1): 4
    *   Count(2): 4

The counts match, supporting the sorting hypothesis.
