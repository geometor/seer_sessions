objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
relationships:
  - type: permutation
    description: The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but potentially in a different order.
  - type: element_counts_preserved
    description: The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in the input and output sequences.
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: Sort the elements based on the custom order: 2 comes first, then 0, then 1.
