The digits present in the input are the same digits present in the output, and their counts are preserved.\n*   **Pattern:** The rearrangement follows a specific, non-standard sorting order. Observing the outputs across all examples, the digits are consistently ordered with all the '2's appearing first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
