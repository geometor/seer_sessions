Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** A sequence of 12 single digits, where each digit is either 0, 1, or 2.
*   **Output Data:** A sequence of 12 single digits, also restricted to 0, 1, or 2.
*   **Transformation:** The output sequence appears to be a rearranged version of the input sequence. The digits present in the input are the same digits present in the output, and their counts are preserved.
*   **Pattern:** The rearrangement follows a specific, non-standard sorting order. Observing the outputs across all examples, the digits are consistently ordered with all the '2's appearing first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
relationships:
  - type: permutation
    description: The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but potentially in a different order.
  - type: element_counts_preserved
    description: The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in the input and output sequences.
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: Sort the elements based on the custom order: 2 comes first, then 0, then 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Count the number of times each digit (0, 1, 2) appears in the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence.
4.  Append the digit '2' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
5.  Append the digit '0' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
6.  Append the digit '1' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
