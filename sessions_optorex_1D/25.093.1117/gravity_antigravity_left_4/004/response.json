            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`. This error occurred within the `collections.Counter` function call. `collections.Counter` builds a dictionary where keys are the items being counted. Dictionaries require keys to be hashable. NumPy arrays are mutable and therefore not hashable. This indicates that the `input_grid` passed to the `transform` function was likely a 2D NumPy array, and iterating over it (as `Counter` does) yielded NumPy array objects (likely rows or columns) instead of the expected individual integer elements.\n\nThe core transformation logic (sorting elements based on the priority 2 > 0 > 1) appears correct based on the input/output examples, but the implementation needs to handle the grid structure properly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Grid Structure:** Modify the code to assume the input `input_grid` is a NumPy array (potentially 2D).\n2.  **Flatten:** Extract all individual integer elements from the grid into a flat 1D sequence. The `flatten()` method of NumPy arrays is suitable for this.\n3.  **Count/Sort:** Apply the counting and sorting logic (2s first, then 0s, then 1s) to this flattened sequence.\n4.  **Reshape:** Reshape the sorted 1D sequence back into the original dimensions of the input grid. Store the original shape before flattening.\n5.  **Return:** Return the reshaped NumPy array.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the string representations and the error, we infer the following:\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Input Elements:** 0, 1, 2.\n*   **Input Size:** 12 elements per example.\n*   **Input Shape:** Consistent across examples, likely 2D (e.g., 1x12 or 12x1, based on the string format; could potentially be other 2D shapes like 3x4, 4x3, 2x6, 6x2, but 1x12 seems most plausible given the single line representation). The error confirms it's not 1D.\n*   **Output Shape:** Same as the input shape for each corresponding example.\n*   **Transformation:** Rearrangement (sorting) of elements based on a custom key (2 > 0 > 1). Element counts are preserved.\n\nLet's verify element counts for `train_1` as an example:\n\n*   Input `train_1`: `0 2 2 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1`\n    *   Count(0): 4\n    *   Count(1): 4\n    *   Count(2): 4\n*   Output `train_1`: `2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1`\n    *   Count(0): 4\n    *   Count(1): 4\n    *   Count(2): 4\n\nThe counts match, supporting the sorting hypothesis.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
