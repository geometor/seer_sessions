objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
      - shape: variable (e.g., 1x12, but consistent within a single task example)
      - size: 12 elements
  - name: output_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: int
      - elements: integers 0, 1, or 2
      - shape: same as input_grid
      - size: 12 elements
relationships:
  - type: permutation
    description: The elements in output_grid are a rearrangement of the elements in input_grid.
  - type: element_counts_preserved
    description: The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in input_grid and output_grid.
  - type: shape_preserved
    description: output_grid has the same shape as input_grid.
actions:
  - name: custom_sort_grid_elements
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: Sort all elements within the grid based on the custom order (2 comes first, then 0, then 1), preserving the original grid shape.
