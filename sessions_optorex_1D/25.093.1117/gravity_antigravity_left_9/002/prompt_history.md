Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. Specifically, the digits observed are 0, 1, and 2.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is consistently 12 in all provided examples. The length of the output sequence is also consistently 12.
3.  **Element Conservation:** Comparing the counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) in the input and the corresponding output reveals that the counts are identical for every example pair. This strongly suggests the transformation is a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements, not an arithmetic or element-wise modification that changes the values themselves.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output sequences exhibit a clear ordering pattern. All the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements of an input sequence based on a specific numerical order.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) in the input sequence is identical to its count in the output sequence.
  - type: rearrangement
    description: The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: sort
    target: input sequence
    order: Custom - elements are ordered with '2' first, then '0', then '1'.
    result: output sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Count the number of occurrences of '2', '0', and '1' in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by:
    a.  Appending the digit '2' repeated by its count from the input.
    b.  Appending the digit '0' repeated by its count from the input.
    c.  Appending the digit '1' repeated by its count from the input.
4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.

*(Alternatively: Sort the elements of the input sequence using a custom comparison rule where '2' is considered the largest value, '0' is the middle value, and '1' is the smallest value.)*
```python
import collections

"""
Rearrange the elements of an input sequence such that all '2's appear first, followed by all '0's, and finally all '1's. The counts of each number (0, 1, 2) remain the same between input and output.
"""

def transform(input_sequence):
    """
    Transforms an input sequence of numbers (0, 1, 2) by rearranging them
    according to the specific order: 2s first, then 0s, then 1s.

    Args:
        input_sequence: A list of integers (expected to contain 0, 1, and 2).

    Returns:
        A new list of integers rearranged according to the rule.
    """

    # Count the occurrences of each number (0, 1, 2) in the input sequence.
    # Using collections.Counter is efficient for this.
    counts = collections.Counter(input_sequence)
    count_2 = counts.get(2, 0) # Get count of 2, default to 0 if not present
    count_0 = counts.get(0, 0) # Get count of 0, default to 0 if not present
    count_1 = counts.get(1, 0) # Get count of 1, default to 0 if not present

    # Construct the output sequence by concatenating lists of repeated elements
    # in the desired order (2s, then 0s, then 1s).
    output_sequence = [2] * count_2 + [0] * count_0 + [1] * count_1

    # Return the newly constructed sequence.
    return output_sequence

# Example usage (based on train_1)
# input_str = "1 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0"
# input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
# output_list = transform(input_list)
# print(output_list) # Expected: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
