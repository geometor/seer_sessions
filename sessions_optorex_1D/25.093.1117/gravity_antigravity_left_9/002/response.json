            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code failed across all training examples with the same error: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`. This error occurs within the `collections.Counter` function, which requires hashable elements (like integers or strings) to count occurrences. NumPy arrays, being mutable, are not hashable.\n\nThis strongly suggests that the input data is being passed to the `transform` function as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list as initially assumed. The core transformation logic (counting occurrences of 2, 0, and 1, and reconstructing the sequence in the order 2s, 0s, 1s) appears sound based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs. This can be achieved either by converting the input NumPy array to a Python list before counting or by using NumPy-native functions for counting and array construction. Given the context, assuming the environment uses NumPy, modifying the code to work directly with NumPy arrays seems most appropriate and potentially more efficient. The output should likely also be a NumPy array.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics about the examples themselves, as the core issue is identified as a type mismatch during execution, not a flaw in the pattern recognition. The key metric derived from the results is:\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** The execution environment passes the input sequence as a NumPy array.\n\nAll examples failed with the same type error, indicating the input format issue is consistent. The underlying pattern (sort 2s, then 0s, then 1s) identified previously still holds true for all visual examples.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
