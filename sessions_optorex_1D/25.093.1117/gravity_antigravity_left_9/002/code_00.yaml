task_description: Rearrange elements of an input sequence based on a specific numerical order (2s first, then 0s, then 1s).
elements:
  - type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on execution error
    role: input
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    shape: (12,) # Inferred from examples (1D array of length 12)
  - type: numpy.ndarray # Assumed output type matches input type environment
    role: output
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    shape: (12,) # Inferred from examples
relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) in the input array is identical to its count in the output array.
  - type: rearrangement
    description: The output array is a permutation of the input array.
actions:
  - name: sort/reconstruct
    target: input array
    order: Custom - elements are ordered with '2' first, then '0', then '1'.
    input_type: numpy.ndarray
    output_type: numpy.ndarray
    steps:
      - Count occurrences of 2, 0, and 1 in the input array.
      - Construct the output array by concatenating arrays containing the counted numbers in the order 2s, 0s, 1s.
    result: output array
