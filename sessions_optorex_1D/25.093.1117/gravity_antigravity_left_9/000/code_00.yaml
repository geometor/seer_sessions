task_description: Rearrange elements of an input sequence based on a specific numerical order.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) in the input sequence is identical to its count in the output sequence.
  - type: rearrangement
    description: The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: sort
    target: input sequence
    order: Custom - elements are ordered with '2' first, then '0', then '1'.
    result: output sequence
