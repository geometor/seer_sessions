Specifically, the digits observed are 0, 1, and 2.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is consistently 12 in all provided examples. The length of the output sequence is also consistently 12.\n3.  **Element Conservation:** Comparing the counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) in the input and the corresponding output reveals that the counts are identical for every example pair. This strongly suggests the transformation is a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements, not an arithmetic or element-wise modification that changes the values themselves.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output sequences exhibit a clear ordering pattern. All the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
