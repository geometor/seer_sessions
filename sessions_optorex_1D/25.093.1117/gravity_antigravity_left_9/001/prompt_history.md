Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. Specifically, the digits observed are 0, 1, and 2.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is consistently 12 in all provided examples. The length of the output sequence is also consistently 12.
3.  **Element Conservation:** Comparing the counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) in the input and the corresponding output reveals that the counts are identical for every example pair. This strongly suggests the transformation is a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements, not an arithmetic or element-wise modification that changes the values themselves.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output sequences exhibit a clear ordering pattern. All the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange elements of an input sequence based on a specific numerical order.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    contains: integers
    values_observed: [0, 1, 2]
    length: 12 (observed)
relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) in the input sequence is identical to its count in the output sequence.
  - type: rearrangement
    description: The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
actions:
  - name: sort
    target: input sequence
    order: Custom - elements are ordered with '2' first, then '0', then '1'.
    result: output sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Count the number of occurrences of '2', '0', and '1' in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by:
    a.  Appending the digit '2' repeated by its count from the input.
    b.  Appending the digit '0' repeated by its count from the input.
    c.  Appending the digit '1' repeated by its count from the input.
4.  Return the constructed sequence as the output.

*(Alternatively: Sort the elements of the input sequence using a custom comparison rule where '2' is considered the largest value, '0' is the middle value, and '1' is the smallest value.)*
