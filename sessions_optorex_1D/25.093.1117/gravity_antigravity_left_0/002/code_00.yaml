task_type: rearrangement
input_elements:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  dtype: integer
  possible_values: [0, 1, 2]
  shape: (12,) # A 1D array (vector) of length 12
output_elements:
  type: numpy.ndarray # Or potentially List[int] depending on environment expectation
  dtype: integer
  possible_values: [0, 1, 2]
  shape: (12,)
relationship:
  - The output array contains the same elements as the input array.
  - The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between input and output.
  - The output array is sorted based on a custom key: elements with value 2 come first, followed by elements with value 0, followed by elements with value 1.
