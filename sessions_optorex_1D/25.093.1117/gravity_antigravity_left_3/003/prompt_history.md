**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of digits (0, 1, and 2). Both the input and output are sequences of 12 digits. The core transformation appears to be a reordering of the digits present in the input sequence. The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) remain the same between the input and the output. The output sequence follows a specific sorting order: all the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: digits (0, 1, 2)
  length: 12
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: digits (0, 1, 2)
  length: 12
  property: preserves digit counts from input
Transformation:
  action: sort/reorder
  rule: Group digits based on value
  order:
    - group 1: all digits with value 2
    - group 2: all digits with value 0
    - group 3: all digits with value 1
  relationship: Output sequence is the concatenation of group 1, group 2, and group 3 in that order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Count the number of occurrences of the digit '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Count the number of occurrences of the digit '0' in the input sequence.
4.  Count the number of occurrences of the digit '1' in the input sequence.
5.  Construct the output sequence by:
    a.  Appending the digit '2' repeated by its count.
    b.  Appending the digit '0' repeated by its count.
    c.  Appending the digit '1' repeated by its count.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The provided information shows that the initial code failed on all examples due to a fundamental mismatch in the expected input data type. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array instead of the anticipated space-separated string.

The core transformation logic identified previously (reordering digits to place all '2's first, then all '0's, then all '1's while preserving counts) appears consistent across all provided training examples based on manual inspection.

The strategy for resolution is straightforward:
1.  Modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is compatible) as input.
2.  Remove the string splitting step (`input_str.split()`).
3.  Keep the counting and sequence reconstruction logic, applying it directly to the input array/list.
4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected output format (likely a NumPy array or list, not necessarily a string).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Since the code failed during input processing, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered via execution. However, manual verification confirms the pattern across all examples:

*   **Input Type:** Appears to be a sequence of integers (likely NumPy array based on the error).
*   **Output Type:** Appears to be a sequence of integers (likely NumPy array).
*   **Length Preservation:** Input and Output sequences consistently have 12 elements.
*   **Element Preservation:** The counts of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) are preserved between input and output in all examples.
*   **Transformation Rule:** The output sequence is formed by concatenating all '2's from the input, followed by all '0's, followed by all '1's. This rule holds for all 7 training examples.
