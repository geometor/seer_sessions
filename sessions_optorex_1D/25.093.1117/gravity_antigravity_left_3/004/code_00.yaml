Input:
  type: sequence (likely 1D NumPy array)
  elements: integers (0, 1, 2)
  length: 12
Output:
  type: sequence (1D NumPy array)
  elements: integers (0, 1, 2)
  length: 12
  property: preserves digit counts from input
Transformation:
  action: reorder/sort elements
  rule: Group digits based on value, maintaining counts from input.
  order:
    - group 1: all digits with value 2
    - group 2: all digits with value 0
    - group 3: all digits with value 1
  relationship: Output sequence is the concatenation of group 1, group 2, and group 3 in that specific order.
