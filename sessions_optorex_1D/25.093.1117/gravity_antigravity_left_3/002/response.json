            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided information shows that the initial code failed on all examples due to a fundamental mismatch in the expected input data type. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array instead of the anticipated space-separated string.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (reordering digits to place all '2's first, then all '0's, then all '1's while preserving counts) appears consistent across all provided training examples based on manual inspection.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is compatible) as input.\n2.  Remove the string splitting step (`input_str.split()`).\n3.  Keep the counting and sequence reconstruction logic, applying it directly to the input array/list.\n4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected output format (likely a NumPy array or list, not necessarily a string).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince the code failed during input processing, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic itself could be gathered via execution. However, manual verification confirms the pattern across all examples:\n\n*   **Input Type:** Appears to be a sequence of integers (likely NumPy array based on the error).\n*   **Output Type:** Appears to be a sequence of integers (likely NumPy array).\n*   **Length Preservation:** Input and Output sequences consistently have 12 elements.\n*   **Element Preservation:** The counts of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) are preserved between input and output in all examples.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The output sequence is formed by concatenating all '2's from the input, followed by all '0's, followed by all '1's. This rule holds for all 7 training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
