The core transformation appears to be a reordering of the digits present in the input sequence. The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) remain the same between the input and the output. The output sequence follows a specific sorting order: all the '2's appear first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
