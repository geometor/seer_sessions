Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Data:** Sequences of single digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces. The length of the sequence appears consistent (12 digits in all examples).
*   **Output Data:** Sequences of the same digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces, also with the same length as the input.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a rearrangement or sorting of the digits present in the input. The quantity of each digit (0, 1, 2) appears to be conserved between the input and output (except potentially in `train_4`, which might have a typo, as the input counts don't match the output counts based on the pattern observed in other examples). The output digits are grouped together based on their value, following a specific order: all the '2's come first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - digits: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: 12 (observed)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - digits: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: 12 (observed)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    values: [0, 1, 2]

actions:
  - name: count_digits
    input: input_sequence
    output: counts_per_digit (e.g., count_of_0, count_of_1, count_of_2)
  - name: construct_output
    input: counts_per_digit
    output: output_sequence
    steps:
      - append '2' repeated count_of_2 times
      - append '0' repeated count_of_0 times
      - append '1' repeated count_of_1 times

relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) in the input_sequence is preserved in the output_sequence.
  - type: ordering
    description: The digits in the output_sequence are ordered according to the rule 2 > 0 > 1. All instances of '2' appear first, followed by all instances of '0', followed by all instances of '1'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Determine the total count of '2's, '0's, and '1's within the input sequence.
3.  Create a new, empty output sequence.
4.  Append the digit '2' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
5.  Append the digit '0' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
6.  Append the digit '1' to the output sequence as many times as it was counted in the input.
7.  Format the output sequence with spaces between the digits.
