The length of the sequence appears consistent (12 digits in all examples).\n*   **Output Data:** Sequences of the same digits (0, 1, 2) separated by spaces, also with the same length as the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a rearrangement or sorting of the digits present in the input. The quantity of each digit (0, 1, 2) appears to be conserved between the input and output (except potentially in `train_4`, which might have a typo, as the input counts don't match the output counts based on the pattern observed in other examples). The output digits are grouped together based on their value, following a specific order: all the '2's come first, followed by all the '0's, and finally all the '1's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
