task_elements:
  - name: Input Array
    type: numpy.ndarray[Integer]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - element_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - name: Output Array
    type: numpy.ndarray[Integer]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - element_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - structure: Sorted groups (all 2s, then all 0s, then all 1s)
  - name: Integer '2'
    properties:
      - role: Priority element (placed first in output)
      - count_preservation: True (input count == output count)
  - name: Integer '1'
    properties:
      - role: Suffix element (placed last in output)
      - count_preservation: True (input count == output count)
  - name: Integer '0'
    properties:
      - role: Filler element (placed between 2s and 1s in output)
      - count_determination: Calculated (12 - count(2s) - count(1s))

relationships:
  - type: Transformation Rule
    description: Rearranges elements from the input NumPy array into the output NumPy array based on value.
    steps:
      - Count occurrences of '2' in the input array.
      - Count occurrences of '1' in the input array.
      - Calculate the required number of '0's.
      - Construct the output array by concatenating: all counted '2's, calculated number of '0's, all counted '1's.

actions:
  - action: Count
    target: Integers '1' and '2' in the Input Array
  - action: Calculate
    target: Number of '0's for the Output Array
    formula: 12 - count(input_array == 2) - count(input_array == 1)
  - action: Concatenate
    elements: Array of '2's, Array of '0's, Array of '1's
    result: Output Array
