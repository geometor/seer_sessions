Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output consist of sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
*   **Integer Values:** The integers present in both input and output sequences are restricted to 0, 1, and 2.
*   **Sequence Length:** Both input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12.
*   **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves rearranging the elements based on their values. The counts of '1's and '2's are preserved between input and output, while the count of '0's adjusts to maintain the total length of 12. The relative order of identical elements within the input doesn't seem relevant to the output structure. The output structure follows a specific pattern: all '2's appear first, followed by '0's, and finally all '1's appear at the end.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: Input Sequence
    type: List[Integer]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - element_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - name: Output Sequence
    type: List[Integer]
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - element_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - structure: Sorted groups (2s, then 0s, then 1s)
  - name: Integer '2'
    properties:
      - role: Priority element (placed first in output)
      - count_preservation: True (input count == output count)
  - name: Integer '1'
    properties:
      - role: Suffix element (placed last in output)
      - count_preservation: True (input count == output count)
  - name: Integer '0'
    properties:
      - role: Filler element (placed between 2s and 1s)
      - count_determination: Calculated (12 - count(2s) - count(1s))

    description: Rearranges input elements into output based on value.
    steps:
      - Count occurrences of '2' in the input.
      - Count occurrences of '1' in the input.
      - Construct output by concatenating: all counted '2's, calculated number of '0's, all counted '1's.

actions:
  - action: Count
    target: Integers '1' and '2' in the Input Sequence
  - action: Calculate
    target: Number of '0's for the Output Sequence
  - action: Concatenate
    elements: Sequence of '2's, Sequence of '0's, Sequence of '1's
    result: Output Sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input list of 12 integers.
2.  Count how many times the integer `2` appears in the input list; let this be `num_twos`.
3.  Count how many times the integer `1` appears in the input list; let this be `num_ones`.
4.  Determine the number of zeros needed for the output list by subtracting `num_twos` and `num_ones` from the total length (12); let this be `num_zeros = 12 - num_twos - num_ones`.
5.  Construct the output list by first placing `num_twos` copies of the integer `2`, followed by `num_zeros` copies of the integer `0`, and finally followed by `num_ones` copies of the integer `1`.
6.  The resulting list is the output.
