The counts of '1's and '2's are preserved between input and output, while the count of '0's adjusts to maintain the total length of 12. The relative order of identical elements within the input doesn't seem relevant to the output structure. The output structure follows a specific pattern: all '2's appear first, followed by '0's, and finally all '1's appear at the end.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
