## Perception

The input and output are both sequences of integers, specifically containing only the digits 0, 1, and 2. Each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence of the same length (12 elements in all provided examples).

Comparing the input and output sequences, the key observation is that the *counts* of each digit (0, 1, 2) are generally preserved between the input and output. For example, in `train_1`, the input has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s, and the output also has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s. This holds true for all examples except `train_2`, which might be an anomaly or error in the data (input has 5 zeros, 1 one, 6 twos; output has 6 zeros, 1 one, 5 twos). Assuming count preservation is the general rule, the transformation appears to be a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements.

Looking at the structure of the output sequences, a consistent pattern emerges:
1.  All the '2's appear first.
2.  All the '0's appear next.
3.  All the '1's appear last.

This suggests a custom sorting order: 2 > 0 > 1.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
relationship:
  - input sequence: contains elements [0, 1, 2]
  - output sequence: contains the same elements as the input sequence, but rearranged
transformation:
  - type: sorting
  - rule: rearrange elements based on a custom order
  - order:
      1. All '2's
      2. All '0's
      3. All '1's
preservation:
  - counts of each distinct element (0, 1, 2) are preserved from input to output (with potential exception noted in train_2).
  - sequence length is preserved.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Count the occurrences of the number '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Count the occurrences of the number '0' in the input sequence.
4.  Count the occurrences of the number '1' in the input sequence.
5.  Construct the output sequence by first concatenating '2' repeated by its count, followed by '0' repeated by its count, and finally followed by '1' repeated by its count.
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence.
