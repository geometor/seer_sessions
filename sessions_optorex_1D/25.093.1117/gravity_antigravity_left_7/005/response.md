"""
Transforms an input NumPy array containing a sequence of integers (0, 1, 2) 
by rearranging its elements according to a specific custom sorting order: 
all occurrences of '2' first, followed by all occurrences of '0', and finally 
all occurrences of '1'. The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) from the input sequence 
are strictly preserved in the output sequence, which is returned as a standard Python list.
The input NumPy array might have various dimensions (e.g., 1D or 2D like (1, N)), 
so the code extracts the underlying flat sequence first.
