task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
relationship:
  - input sequence: contains elements [0, 1, 2]
  - output sequence: contains the same elements as the input sequence, but rearranged
transformation:
  - type: sorting
  - rule: rearrange elements based on a custom order
  - order:
      1. All '2's
      2. All '0's
      3. All '1's
preservation:
  - counts of each distinct element (0, 1, 2) are preserved from input to output (with potential exception noted in train_2).
  - sequence length is preserved.
