Each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence of the same length (12 elements in all provided examples).\n\nComparing the input and output sequences, the key observation is that the *counts* of each digit (0, 1, 2) are generally preserved between the input and output. For example, in `train_1`, the input has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s, and the output also has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s. This holds true for all examples except `train_2`, which might be an anomaly or error in the data (input has 5 zeros, 1 one, 6 twos; output has 6 zeros, 1 one, 5 twos). Assuming count preservation is the general rule, the transformation appears to be a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements.\n\nLooking at the structure of the output sequences, a consistent pattern emerges:\n1.  All the '2's appear first.\n2.  All the '0's appear next.\n3.  All the '1's appear last.\n\nThis suggests a custom sorting order: 2 > 0 > 1.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
