            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe core issue appears to be a mismatch between the assumed input data structure in the previous code and the actual structure used by the testing environment. The error \"unhashable type: 'list'\" strongly suggests that `collections.Counter` was applied to a list containing unhashable elements (likely other lists), rather than a flat list of integers. This typically happens when processing nested list structures or multi-dimensional arrays incorrectly.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the input, while conceptually representing a sequence of 12 digits, is passed to the `transform` function as a 2D NumPy array with a shape like `(1, 12)` or potentially another structure that, when converted using `.tolist()`, results in a list containing a list (e.g., `[[0, 1, 2, ...]]`).\n\nThe strategy is:\n1.  **Verify Input Structure:** Assume the input is a NumPy array and potentially 2D. Modify the code to correctly extract the 1D sequence of integers (e.g., by accessing the first row if shape is `(1, N)`).\n2.  **Verify Counts:** Use code execution to systematically check the counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s in both the input and expected output for all examples. This will confirm the sorting rule and identify any inconsistencies like the one suspected in `train_2`.\n3.  **Refine Logic:** Adjust the input processing part of the code. The core sorting logic (count 2s, 0s, 1s, then reconstruct the sequence in that order) seems correct based on the visual inspection of most examples and should be retained. The discrepancy in `train_2`'s output will be noted, but the transformation logic will follow the pattern observed in the majority of examples, emphasizing count preservation.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect the updated understanding of the input structure and the refined transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the counts for each training example.\n\n"
