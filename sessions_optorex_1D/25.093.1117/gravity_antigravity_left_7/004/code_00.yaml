task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray (likely 2D with shape (1, N) or potentially N)
      - content: sequence of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
  - item: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - content: rearranged elements from input_sequence
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: same as input_sequence
relationship:
  - input_sequence: contains elements [0, 1, 2]
  - output_sequence: contains the same elements as the input_sequence, rearranged
transformation:
  - type: sorting
  - rule: rearrange elements based on a custom priority order
  - order:
      1. All '2's
      2. All '0's
      3. All '1's
preservation:
  - counts of each distinct element (0, 1, 2) are strictly preserved from input to output.
  - sequence length is preserved.
input_handling_issue:
  - cause: The previous code likely failed due to assuming a 1D list input, while the test environment provided a data structure (potentially a 2D numpy array) that resulted in an unhashable type error when used with collections.Counter.
  - resolution: The code must correctly extract the flat list of integers from the input numpy.ndarray before counting elements.
