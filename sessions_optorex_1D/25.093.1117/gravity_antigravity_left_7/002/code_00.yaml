task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or numpy array of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
relationship:
  - input sequence: contains a multiset of elements [0, 1, 2]
  - output sequence: contains the exact same multiset of elements as the input sequence, but rearranged
transformation:
  - type: sorting
  - rule: rearrange elements based on a custom sort order
  - order:
      1. All occurrences of '2'
      2. All occurrences of '0'
      3. All occurrences of '1'
preservation:
  - counts of each distinct element (0, 1, 2) are strictly preserved from input to output.
  - sequence length is preserved.
