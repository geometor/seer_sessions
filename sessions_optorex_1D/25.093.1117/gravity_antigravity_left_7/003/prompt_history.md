## Perception

The input and output are both sequences of integers, specifically containing only the digits 0, 1, and 2. Each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence of the same length (12 elements in all provided examples).

Comparing the input and output sequences, the key observation is that the *counts* of each digit (0, 1, 2) are generally preserved between the input and output. For example, in `train_1`, the input has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s, and the output also has six 0s, four 1s, and two 2s. This holds true for all examples except `train_2`, which might be an anomaly or error in the data (input has 5 zeros, 1 one, 6 twos; output has 6 zeros, 1 one, 5 twos). Assuming count preservation is the general rule, the transformation appears to be a rearrangement or sorting of the input elements.

Looking at the structure of the output sequences, a consistent pattern emerges:
1.  All the '2's appear first.
2.  All the '0's appear next.
3.  All the '1's appear last.

This suggests a custom sorting order: 2 > 0 > 1.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string) and the actual type provided during testing (a `numpy.ndarray`). This caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples.

The core logic derived previously (sorting the input sequence based on the custom order 2 > 0 > 1 while preserving element counts) appears largely correct, as evidenced by visual inspection of most examples. However, a discrepancy was noted in `train_2` where the counts of '0' and '2' differ between the input and output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or numpy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).
2.  **Verify Transformation Rule:** Systematically check the count preservation and the sorting order (2s, then 0s, then 1s) against all provided training examples using `tool_code`. Acknowledge the anomaly in `train_2` but proceed with the rule derived from the majority (Examples 1, 3-7). Assume the rule is sorting with count preservation, and `train_2` might be an outlier or contain a data error.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect the correct input type and the confirmed transformation rule.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the counts and the sorting rule for each example.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

My previous assessment of `train_2` was incorrect, likely due to a manual miscount. The code execution confirms:
1.  **Count Preservation:** The counts of elements {0, 1, 2} are strictly preserved between the input and output for *all* training examples, including `train_2`.
2.  **Sorting Rule:** The output sequence in *all* examples exactly matches the result of sorting the input sequence according to the custom order: all '2's first, then all '0's, then all '1's.

Therefore, the initial hypothesis about the transformation rule holds true for all provided examples without exceptions. The only necessary change is adapting the code to handle the correct input data type.

## Updated Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or numpy array of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
relationship:
  - input sequence: contains a multiset of elements [0, 1, 2]
  - output sequence: contains the exact same multiset of elements as the input sequence, but rearranged
transformation:
  - type: sorting
  - rule: rearrange elements based on a custom sort order
  - order:
      1. All occurrences of '2'
      2. All occurrences of '0'
      3. All occurrences of '1'
preservation:
  - counts of each distinct element (0, 1, 2) are strictly preserved from input to output.
  - sequence length is preserved.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (as a list or array) of numbers, which contains only 0s, 1s, and 2s.
2.  Count the total number of times '2' appears in the input sequence.
3.  Count the total number of times '0' appears in the input sequence.
4.  Count the total number of times '1' appears in the input sequence.
5.  Create a new empty list for the output sequence.
6.  Append the number '2' to the output sequence, repeated according to its count from step 2.
7.  Append the number '0' to the output sequence, repeated according to its count from step 3.
8.  Append the number '1' to the output sequence, repeated according to its count from step 4.
9.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.
