*   **Perception:** The task involves processing a one-dimensional sequence of 12 digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros ('0'). The transformation shifts this block of non-zero digits to the left. The amount of the shift appears to be determined by the length of the non-zero block itself. The rest of the sequence remains filled with zeros.

*   **Facts:**

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:** The primary error arises from an incorrect assumption about the input format. The code expected a space-separated string (`input_str`) and tried to call the `.split()` method on it. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the input is being provided as a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it leftwards by its length appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to modify the code to accept a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) directly, removing the string parsing step. The output format should also be confirmed, likely needing to be a NumPy array or list, not a formatted string.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   All 7 training examples failed with the same `AttributeError`.
    *   This confirms the input format mismatch is the universal problem.
    *   Let's re-verify the block identification and shift logic:
        *   train\_1: Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5]`. Block `[5 5 5]`, start=9, len=3. Shift=3. New start=9-3=6. Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_2: Input `[0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[7 7]`, start=2, len=2. Shift=2. New start=2-2=0. Output `[7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_3: Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0]`. Block `[4]`, start=8, len=1. Shift=1. New start=8-1=7. Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_4: Input `[0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[6 6 6 6]`, start=4, len=4. Shift=4. New start=4-4=0. Output `[6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_5: Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2]`. Block `[2 2 2]`, start=9, len=3. Shift=3. New start=9-3=6. Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_6: Input `[0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1]`, start=3, len=1. Shift=1. New start=3-1=2. Output `[0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Matches.
        *   train\_7: Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0]`. Block `[2 2 2]`, start=6, len=3. Shift=3. New start=6-3=3. Output `[0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Matches.
    *   The underlying transformation logic seems correct for all examples. The only required change is adapting to the correct input/output data types.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting the block's length from its original starting index.
    4.  Create a new sequence of 12 integers of the same type as the input (list or NumPy array), initialized with zeros.
    5.  Place the identified non-zero value into the new sequence, filling the positions from the calculated new starting index for the determined length of the block.
