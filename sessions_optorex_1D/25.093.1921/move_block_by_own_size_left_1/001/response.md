Shifts a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a list to the left by an amount equal to the length of the block.

1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2. Locate the contiguous block of non-zero numbers, its start index, and its elements.
3. Calculate the length of the non-zero block.
4. Calculate the new start index by subtracting the block length from the original start index.
5. Create an output list of the same size, initialized with zeros.
6. Place the non-zero block into the output list at the new start index.
7. Format the output list back into a space-separated string.
