Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers of the same length.
*   Each input list contains mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of one or more identical or different non-zero integers.
*   The output list also contains mostly zeros and the same contiguous block of non-zero integers as the input, but the block is located at a different position.
*   The action performed is a positional shift of the non-zero block within the list. The block moves to the left.
*   The amount of the leftward shift seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output reveals the shift distance. Testing reveals the shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.

Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified from the results is a type mismatch error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This occurred consistently across all examples, indicating that the `transform` function was expecting a string input (based on the presence of `_parse_input` and `.strip().split()`) but received a NumPy array instead from the testing environment.

The core logic derived previously (identifying a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by its length) appears sound based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The error prevents the execution of this logic.

The strategy is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to accept the input directly as a sequence of numbers (likely a list or NumPy array) rather than a string requiring parsing. The input parsing step (`_parse_input`) should be removed or adapted, and the output formatting (`_format_output`) might need adjustment depending on the expected output type from the `transform` function.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-verify the transformation parameters for each example, assuming the input is already parsed into a list/array.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (assume it's already parsed, e.g., a list or NumPy array). Let `N` be the length of the input sequence.
2.  Initialize `start_index` to -1.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence with index `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
    *   If the current element `input_sequence[i]` is not zero and `start_index` is -1, set `start_index` to `i`.
    *   If the current element `input_sequence[i]` is zero and `start_index` is not -1, the block ends at the previous index (`i-1`). Break the loop.
    *   If the loop finishes without breaking after finding a non-zero element, the block ends at the last index (`N-1`).
4.  If no non-zero block was found (`start_index` remains -1), return the original input sequence or a sequence of zeros of length `N`. (Based on examples, a block always exists).
5.  Extract the `non_zero_block` from the input sequence using the determined `start_index` and `end_index`.
6.  Calculate the `block_length` (number of elements in `non_zero_block`).
7.  Calculate the `shift_amount`, which is equal to `block_length`.
8.  Calculate the `new_start_index` = `start_index` - `shift_amount`.
9.  Ensure `new_start_index` is not negative by setting it to `max(0, new_start_index)`.
10. Create a new output sequence of length `N`, initialized with zeros.
11. Copy the elements from `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that copying stops if the index goes beyond `N-1`.
12. Return the resulting output sequence.
