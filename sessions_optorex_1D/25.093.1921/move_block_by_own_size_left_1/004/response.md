**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core logic derived from the initial examples—identifying a contiguous block of non-zero numbers in a 1D sequence and shifting it left by a distance equal to its length—correctly explains the transformation shown in all provided training examples when interpreted as 1D sequences.

However, the Python code (`code_00.py`) generated based on this logic fails during testing with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This strongly suggests a discrepancy between the format of the training examples (presented as 1D space-separated strings) and the actual data type/structure being passed to the `transform` function by the test harness. The error specifically points to NumPy array handling, likely occurring when a boolean condition (like `if element != 0:`) is evaluated on a multi-element array instead of a single scalar value.

The most plausible explanation is that the test harness provides the input as a 2D NumPy array (a grid), and the `transform` function, while designed to handle 1D lists or arrays, incorrectly processes the 2D input. Specifically, iterating through a 2D NumPy array often yields rows (which are 1D arrays), and applying a scalar comparison (`!= 0`) to such a row results in the ambiguity error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Assume Grid Input:** Assume the task operates on a 2D grid (represented as a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array).
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** The transformation rule observed in the 1D examples should be applied independently to each *row* of the input grid.
3.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the `transform` function to iterate through the rows of the input grid. For each row, apply the existing logic: find the non-zero block, calculate its length, and shift it left within that row by that length.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to explicitly state that the operation is performed row by row on a grid.

**Metrics**

Based on the interpretation of the examples as single rows:

The analysis confirms the 1D logic. The error implies the *context* of applying this logic is likely row-wise within a 2D grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input, which is expected to be a 2D grid of integers (e.g., a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array).
2.  Initialize an empty grid structure to store the output, matching the dimensions of the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  For the current row:
    a.  Find the starting index of the *first* contiguous sequence (block) of non-zero numbers. If no non-zero numbers exist in the row, skip to step 4g.
    b.  Determine the ending index of this block (the last non-zero number before a zero or the end of the row).
    c.  Extract the sequence of numbers forming this non-zero block.
    d.  Calculate the length of the non-zero block.
    e.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output row: `new_start_index = original_start_index - block_length`. Ensure `new_start_index` is not less than 0.
    f.  Create a new list (representing the output row) of the same length as the input row, filled with zeros.
    g.  Copy the extracted non-zero block into this new list, starting at the `new_start_index`. Ensure copying stops if the end of the row list is reached.
    h.  If no non-zero block was found in step 4a, the output row remains the list of zeros created in step 4f (or simply copy the original row if it was all zeros).
5.  Add the newly created or modified row to the output grid.
6.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
