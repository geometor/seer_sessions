            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core logic derived from the initial examples\u2014identifying a contiguous block of non-zero numbers in a 1D sequence and shifting it left by a distance equal to its length\u2014correctly explains the transformation shown in all provided training examples when interpreted as 1D sequences.\n\nHowever, the Python code (`code_00.py`) generated based on this logic fails during testing with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This strongly suggests a discrepancy between the format of the training examples (presented as 1D space-separated strings) and the actual data type/structure being passed to the `transform` function by the test harness. The error specifically points to NumPy array handling, likely occurring when a boolean condition (like `if element != 0:`) is evaluated on a multi-element array instead of a single scalar value.\n\nThe most plausible explanation is that the test harness provides the input as a 2D NumPy array (a grid), and the `transform` function, while designed to handle 1D lists or arrays, incorrectly processes the 2D input. Specifically, iterating through a 2D NumPy array often yields rows (which are 1D arrays), and applying a scalar comparison (`!= 0`) to such a row results in the ambiguity error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Assume Grid Input:** Assume the task operates on a 2D grid (represented as a list of lists or a 2D NumPy array).\n2.  **Row-wise Processing:** The transformation rule observed in the 1D examples should be applied independently to each *row* of the input grid.\n3.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the `transform` function to iterate through the rows of the input grid. For each row, apply the existing logic: find the non-zero block, calculate its length, and shift it left within that row by that length.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to explicitly state that the operation is performed row by row on a grid.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the interpretation of the examples as single rows:\n\n| Example | Input List                                | Non-Zero Block | Start Index | Block Length | Shift Amount | New Start Index | Output List                               | Matches |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[7,7,7]`      | 3           | 3            | 3            | 0               | `[7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`             | `[1]`          | 10          | 1            | 1            | 9               | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[4]`          | 2           | 1            | 1            | 1               | `[0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[9,9]`        | 3           | 2            | 2            | 1               | `[0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0]`             | `[9,9]`        | 8           | 2            | 2            | 6               | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | `[6]`          | 3           | 1            | 1            | 2               | `[0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0]`             | `[1,1,1,1]`    | 6           | 4            | 4            | 2               | `[0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]`             | Yes     |\n\nThe analysis confirms the 1D logic.
