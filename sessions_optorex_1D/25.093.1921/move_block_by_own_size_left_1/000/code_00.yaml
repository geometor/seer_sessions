task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a list.
elements:
  - name: list
    type: sequence of integers
    properties:
      - contains zeros
      - contains a single contiguous block of non-zero numbers
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence of integers
    properties:
      - elements: all non-zero
      - contiguous: appears as a single block in the input list
      - start_index: the index of the first element of the block in the input list
      - end_index: the index of the last element of the block in the input list
      - length: the number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1)
relationships:
  - input list and output list have the same length.
  - the non_zero_block in the output is identical to the non_zero_block in the input.
action:
  - name: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter: shift_amount
    constraint: shift_amount equals the length of the non_zero_block
transformation:
  - step: 1. Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input list.
  - step: 2. Determine the start index and the length of this block.
  - step: 3. Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the block.
  - step: 4. Calculate the new start index for the block in the output list by subtracting the shift amount from the original start index.
  - step: 5. Construct the output list of the same length as the input, filled initially with zeros.
  - step: 6. Place the identified non-zero block into the output list starting at the calculated new start index.
