The block moves to the left.\n*   The amount of the leftward shift seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output reveals the shift distance. Testing reveals the shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
