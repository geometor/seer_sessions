Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers of the same length.
*   Each input list contains mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of one or more identical or different non-zero integers.
*   The output list also contains mostly zeros and the same contiguous block of non-zero integers as the input, but the block is located at a different position.
*   The action performed is a positional shift of the non-zero block within the list. The block moves to the left.
*   The amount of the leftward shift seems related to the properties of the non-zero block itself. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output reveals the shift distance. Testing reveals the shift distance is equal to the length of the non-zero block.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a list.
elements:
  - name: list
    type: sequence of integers
    properties:
      - contains zeros
      - contains a single contiguous block of non-zero numbers
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence of integers
    properties:
      - elements: all non-zero
      - contiguous: appears as a single block in the input list
      - start_index: the index of the first element of the block in the input list
      - end_index: the index of the last element of the block in the input list
      - length: the number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1)
relationships:
  - input list and output list have the same length.
  - the non_zero_block in the output is identical to the non_zero_block in the input.
action:
  - name: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter: shift_amount
    constraint: shift_amount equals the length of the non_zero_block
transformation:
  - step: 1. Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input list.
  - step: 2. Determine the start index and the length of this block.
  - step: 3. Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the block.
  - step: 4. Calculate the new start index for the block in the output list by subtracting the shift amount from the original start index.
  - step: 5. Construct the output list of the same length as the input, filled initially with zeros.
  - step: 6. Place the identified non-zero block into the output list starting at the calculated new start index.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Locate the contiguous block of non-zero numbers within the input list. Record the sequence of numbers in the block, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Calculate the length of the non-zero block (number of elements).
4.  Determine the amount to shift the block to the left: this amount is equal to the length of the block.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list: subtract the shift amount (block length) from the original starting index.
6.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initially filled with zeros.
7.  Copy the sequence of numbers from the non-zero block into the new list, starting at the calculated new starting index.
8.  Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.
```python
import re
import numpy as np # Although numpy isn't strictly necessary for this list manipulation, it's often useful for grid-like tasks.
