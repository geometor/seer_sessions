**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified from the results is a type mismatch error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This occurred consistently across all examples, indicating that the `transform` function was expecting a string input (based on the presence of `_parse_input` and `.strip().split()`) but received a NumPy array instead from the testing environment.

The core logic derived previously (identifying a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by its length) appears sound based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The error prevents the execution of this logic.

The strategy is to modify the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to accept the input directly as a sequence of numbers (likely a list or NumPy array) rather than a string requiring parsing. The input parsing step (`_parse_input`) should be removed or adapted, and the output formatting (`_format_output`) might need adjustment depending on the expected output type from the `transform` function.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-verify the transformation parameters for each example, assuming the input is already parsed into a list/array.

def analyze_example(input_str, output_str):
    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.strip().split(' ')]
    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.strip().split(' ')]
    n = len(input_list)

    start_index = -1
    end_index = -1
    block = []

    # Find block in input
    for i, num in enumerate(input_list):

        block_length = len(block)
        shift_amount = block_length
        expected_new_start = start_index - shift_amount
        expected_new_start = max(0, expected_new_start) # Clamp at 0

        # Find actual new start in output
        actual_new_start = -1
        for i, num in enumerate(output_list):
            if num != 0 and output_list[i:i+block_length] == block:
                 actual_new_start = i

--- Summary ---
Rule (Shift Left by Block Length) holds for all examples: True

```
The metrics gathered confirm that the transformation rule (shift the non-zero block left by its length) holds true for all provided examples. The error encountered previously was solely due to incorrect input handling (expecting string, receiving NumPy array).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a sequence to the left by an amount equal to the length of the block.
input_type: Sequence of integers (List or NumPy array)
output_type: Sequence of integers (List or NumPy array, matching input type and length)
elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence of integers
    properties:
      - contains zeros
      - contains a single contiguous block of non-zero numbers
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence of integers
    properties:
      - elements: all non-zero
      - contiguous: appears as a single block in the input sequence
      - start_index: the index of the first element of the block in the input sequence
      - end_index: the index of the last element of the block in the input sequence
      - length: the number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1)
relationships:
  - input_sequence and output_sequence have the same length.
  - the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is identical to the non_zero_block in the input_sequence.
action:
  - name: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter: shift_amount
    constraint: shift_amount equals the length of the non_zero_block
transformation:
  - step: 1. Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers.
  - step: 2. Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
  - step: 3. Determine the start index and the length of this block.
  - step: 4. Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the block.
  - step: 5. Calculate the new start index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount (block length) from the original start index. Ensure the new start index is not less than 0.
  - step: 6. Construct the output sequence of the same length as the input, filled initially with zeros.
  - step: 7. Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure placement does not exceed the sequence bounds.
  - step: 8. Return the resulting sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (assume it's already parsed, e.g., a list or NumPy array). Let `N` be the length of the input sequence.
2.  Initialize `start_index` to -1.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence with index `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
    *   If the current element `input_sequence[i]` is not zero and `start_index` is -1, set `start_index` to `i`.
    *   If the current element `input_sequence[i]` is zero and `start_index` is not -1, the block ends at the previous index (`i-1`). Break the loop.
    *   If the loop finishes without breaking after finding a non-zero element, the block ends at the last index (`N-1`).
4.  If no non-zero block was found (`start_index` remains -1), return the original input sequence or a sequence of zeros of length `N`. (Based on examples, a block always exists).
5.  Extract the `non_zero_block` from the input sequence using the determined `start_index` and `end_index`.
6.  Calculate the `block_length` (number of elements in `non_zero_block`).
7.  Calculate the `shift_amount`, which is equal to `block_length`.
8.  Calculate the `new_start_index` = `start_index` - `shift_amount`.
9.  Ensure `new_start_index` is not negative by setting it to `max(0, new_start_index)`.
10. Create a new output sequence of length `N`, initialized with zeros.
11. Copy the elements from `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that copying stops if the index goes beyond `N-1`.
12. Return the resulting output sequence.
