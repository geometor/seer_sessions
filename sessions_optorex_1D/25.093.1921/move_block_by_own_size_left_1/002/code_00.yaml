task_description: Shift a contiguous block of non-zero numbers within a sequence to the left by an amount equal to the length of the block.
input_type: Sequence of integers (List or NumPy array)
output_type: Sequence of integers (List or NumPy array, matching input type and length)
elements:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence of integers
    properties:
      - contains zeros
      - contains a single contiguous block of non-zero numbers
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence of integers
    properties:
      - elements: all non-zero
      - contiguous: appears as a single block in the input sequence
      - start_index: the index of the first element of the block in the input sequence
      - end_index: the index of the last element of the block in the input sequence
      - length: the number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1)
relationships:
  - input_sequence and output_sequence have the same length.
  - the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is identical to the non_zero_block in the input_sequence.
action:
  - name: shift_left
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter: shift_amount
    constraint: shift_amount equals the length of the non_zero_block
transformation:
  - step: 1. Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers.
  - step: 2. Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
  - step: 3. Determine the start index and the length of this block.
  - step: 4. Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the block.
  - step: 5. Calculate the new start index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount (block length) from the original start index. Ensure the new start index is not less than 0.
  - step: 6. Construct the output sequence of the same length as the input, filled initially with zeros.
  - step: 7. Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence starting at the calculated new start index. Ensure placement does not exceed the sequence bounds.
  - step: 8. Return the resulting sequence.
