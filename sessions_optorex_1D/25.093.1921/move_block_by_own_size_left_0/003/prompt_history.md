**Perception of the elements of the task:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single-digit integers. Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The output sequence is also a sequence of the same length, containing the same block of non-zero digits but shifted to the left within the sequence, surrounded by zeros. The key elements are:

1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length (12 elements in the examples) list of integers.
2.  **Background:** The digit `0`, which fills most of the sequence.
3.  **Object/Block:** A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1 1`, `4 4 4`, `5 5`).
4.  **Properties of the Block:**
    *   Value: The non-zero digit itself (e.g., 1, 4, 5).
    *   Length: The number of times the digit repeats in the block.
    *   Position: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.
5.  **Transformation:** The block is moved (shifted) to a new position within the sequence to produce the output. The amount of the shift seems dependent on a property of the block.

Analysis reveals that the amount of the leftward shift applied to the block is equal to the length of the block itself.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - contains: background_digit, object_block
  - item: background_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - item: object_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - value: the non-zero integer (e.g., 1, 4, 5)
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - start_index_input: the starting position (0-based index) in the input sequence
      - start_index_output: the starting position (0-based index) in the output sequence
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    target: object_block
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: derived from object_block properties
derivation_rules:
  - rule: calculate_shift_amount
    input: object_block.length
    output: shift_amount
    formula: shift_amount = object_block.length
  - rule: calculate_output_position
    input:
      - object_block.start_index_input
      - shift_amount
    output: object_block.start_index_output
    formula: object_block.start_index_output = object_block.start_index_input - shift_amount
constraints:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one object_block.
  - The object_block consists of identical non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation does not wrap around; elements shifted past index 0 are effectively placed starting at index 0. (Observed in train_1 and train_6). However, the calculation `start_index - shift_amount` correctly places the block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note the non-zero digit value, the starting index of the block, and the length of the block.
3.  Determine the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount (block length) from the original starting index of the block in the input sequence.
6.  Copy the block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the testing environment is passing the input data as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists, which the `transform` function expects based on its type hints (`List[int]`). The error likely occurs within the `find_block` function during comparisons (e.g., `val != 0`, `val == block_value`) when `val` is an element from a NumPy array, leading to ambiguous boolean results for array comparisons.

The core transformation logic identified previously (find the non-zero block, shift it left by its length) appears consistent across all examples. The strategy is to:

1.  Confirm the transformation logic holds for all provided examples by simulating the process, assuming correct input parsing (string -> list of integers).
2.  Refine the understanding of the task elements and transformation rules based on this confirmation.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed logic and specify the expected data structures (lists of integers). The focus remains on the *logic*, assuming the type mismatch is an execution environment issue that the coder phase will handle.

**Metrics and Logic Confirmation**

Let's manually apply the logic to each training example to verify the transformation rule.

The simulation confirms that the core logic (find block, calculate shift = block length, calculate new start index = old start index - shift, place block in new sequence) correctly transforms the input to the output for all provided training examples when the input is treated as a list of integers. The runtime errors encountered previously are indeed separate from the correctness of the transformation rule itself.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    description: A fixed-length 1D sequence (list) of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - type: list[int]
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: background_digit, object_block
  - item: output_sequence
    description: A fixed-length 1D sequence (list) of single-digit integers derived from the input.
    properties:
      - type: list[int]
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - contains: background_digit, shifted_object_block
  - item: background_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Fills the sequence outside the object_block.
  - item: object_block
    description: A contiguous subsequence within the input_sequence.
    properties:
      - type: subsequence
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - value: the non-zero integer (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7)
      - length: number of elements in the block (L)
      - start_index_input: the starting position (0-based index) in the input_sequence (S_in)
  - item: shifted_object_block
    description: The object_block placed at a new location in the output_sequence.
    properties:
      - type: subsequence
      - elements: identical to object_block elements
      - value: same as object_block.value
      - length: same as object_block.length (L)
      - start_index_output: the starting position (0-based index) in the output_sequence (S_out)

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    source: object_block (from input_sequence)
    target: shifted_object_block (in output_sequence)
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: Derived from object_block.length.

derivation_rules:
  - rule: calculate_shift_amount
    input: object_block.length (L)
    output: shift_amount
    formula: shift_amount = L
  - rule: calculate_output_start_index
    input:
      - object_block.start_index_input (S_in)
      - shift_amount (L)
    output: shifted_object_block.start_index_output (S_out)
    formula: S_out = S_in - L
  - rule: construct_output_sequence
    steps:
      - Initialize output_sequence with background_digit (0).
      - Copy object_block (value and length L) into output_sequence starting at index S_out. Ensure placement respects sequence boundaries (indices 0 to length-1).

constraints:
  - Each input_sequence contains exactly one object_block.
  - The object_block consists of identical non-zero digits.
  - The background is always 0.
  - The shift operation is purely based on the block's properties (length and starting position).
  - Elements are placed within the bounds [0, length-1]; shifting beyond index 0 results in placement starting at index 0.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive an input sequence (list) of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers within the input sequence. Record its value, its starting index (`start_index_input`), and its length (`block_length`).
3.  Determine the amount to shift the block leftwards: `shift_amount` is equal to `block_length`.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: `start_index_output` = `start_index_input` - `shift_amount`.
5.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initializing all its elements to zero.
6.  Place the identified block (using its value and `block_length`) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated `start_index_output`. Ensure that elements are only placed at valid indices within the output sequence (from 0 up to length-1).
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
