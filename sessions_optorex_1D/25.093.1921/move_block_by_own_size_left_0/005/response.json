Identify a single contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers within the input sequence.\n2. Determine the value (V), starting index (S_in), and length (L) of this block.\n3. Calculate a shift amount equal to the block's length (shift = L).\n4. Calculate the target starting index (S_out) for the block in the output sequence: S_out = S_in - shift.\n5. Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros.\n6. Place the identified block (value V, length L) into the output sequence starting at index S_out. \n   Elements are placed only if their target index is within the valid bounds [0, N-1] of the sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_block(sequence: List[int]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (block_value, start_index, block_length),\n        or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    block_value = 0\n    block_length = 0\n    n = len(sequence)\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence to find the start of a non-zero block\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = sequence[i]\n        # Check if the element is non-zero to start or identify a block\n        if val != 0:\n            # This is the start of the block we are looking for\n            start_index = i\n            block_value = val\n            block_length = 1\n            # Continue from the next element to find the end of the block\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                if sequence[j] == block_value:\n                    block_length += 1\n                else:\n                    # End of block (different value or zero encountered)\n                    break\n            # Found the block and its length, we can stop searching\n            break\n\n    # Return block details if one was found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        return block_value, start_index, block_length\n    else:\n        # No non-zero block found in the sequence\n        return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid: Union[List[int], np.ndarray]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the block shifting transformation to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input sequence, potentially a list or a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a standard Python list to avoid potential numpy ambiguity errors\n    # and work with standard list indexing.\n    if isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray):\n        # If it's a numpy array, flatten it (if needed, though examples are 1D)\n        # and convert to a list.\n        input_list = input_grid.flatten().tolist()\n    else:\n        # Assume it's already list-like (list, tuple, etc.) and convert to list\n        input_list = list(input_grid)\n\n    n = len(input_list)\n\n    # Initialize output_grid with zeros, same size as input\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n\n    # Find the non-zero block details (value, start index, length)\n    block_info = find_block(input_list)\n\n    # If a block was found, proceed with the transformation\n    if block_info:\n        block_value, start_index_input, block_length = block_info\n\n        # Calculate the shift amount (equal to block length)\n        shift_amount = block_length\n\n        # Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output\n        start_index_output = start_index_input - shift_amount\n\n        # Place the block into the output grid at the calculated position\n        # Iterate for the length of the block\n        for i in range(block_length):\n            # Calculate the target index in the output grid\n            target_index = start_index_output + i\n\n            # Ensure the target index is within the valid bounds [0, n-1] of the output grid\n            if 0 <= target_index < n:\n                # Place the block's value at the target index\n                output_grid[target_index] = block_value\n            # else: Elements shifted outside the grid bounds are implicitly handled\n            # because output_grid is initialized with zeros.\n\n    # Return the resulting transformed grid as a list\n    return output_grid\n```"
