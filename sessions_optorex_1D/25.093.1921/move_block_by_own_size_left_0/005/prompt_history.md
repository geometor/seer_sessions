**Perception of the elements of the task:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single-digit integers. Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The output sequence is also a sequence of the same length, containing the same block of non-zero digits but shifted to the left within the sequence, surrounded by zeros. The key elements are:

1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length (12 elements in the examples) list of integers.
2.  **Background:** The digit `0`, which fills most of the sequence.
3.  **Object/Block:** A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1 1`, `4 4 4`, `5 5`).
4.  **Properties of the Block:**
    *   Value: The non-zero digit itself (e.g., 1, 4, 5).
    *   Length: The number of times the digit repeats in the block.
    *   Position: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.
5.  **Transformation:** The block is moved (shifted) to a new position within the sequence to produce the output. The amount of the shift seems dependent on a property of the block.

Analysis reveals that the amount of the leftward shift applied to the block is equal to the length of the block itself.

**Facts:**

  - rule: calculate_output_position
    input:
      - object_block.start_index_input
      - shift_amount
    output: object_block.start_index_output
    formula: object_block.start_index_output = object_block.start_index_input - shift_amount
constraints:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one object_block.
  - The object_block consists of identical non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation does not wrap around; elements shifted past index 0 are effectively placed starting at index 0. (Observed in train_1 and train_6). However, the calculation `start_index - shift_amount` correctly places the block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note the non-zero digit value, the starting index of the block, and the length of the block.
3.  Determine the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount (block length) from the original starting index of the block in the input sequence.
6.  Copy the block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to implement the observed transformation rule: identify a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in a 1D sequence and shift it left by an amount equal to its length. The execution results show a consistent error (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) across all examples. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data is being handled or compared within the function, likely related to the data type (e.g., NumPy array vs. standard Python list) rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic itself.

The logical steps derived (find block value, start index, length; calculate shift amount = length; calculate new start index = old start index - shift amount; place block in new zero-filled list) appear correct based on manually verifying the examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  Acknowledge the likely type mismatch issue encountered during execution. The code was written expecting Python lists, but the error indicates array-like behavior during boolean comparisons.
2.  Refine the code (specifically the comparison parts within `find_block` and potentially the initial conversion in `transform`) to be more robust against potential NumPy array inputs, perhaps by explicitly casting compared elements to standard Python integers.
3.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples. Since manual verification confirms the logic, the focus remains on implementation details causing the runtime error.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise about the process, assuming the type issue is resolved in the Coder phase.

The intended logic correctly transforms all provided training examples. The execution failure needs to be addressed in the Coder phase, likely by ensuring correct handling of input data types.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (or structure behaving like one, e.g., 1D NumPy array)
      - length: N (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: background_digit, object_block
  - item: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: N (same as input)
      - contains: background_digit, shifted_object_block
  - item: background_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - item: object_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence in input_sequence
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - value: the non-zero integer (V)
      - length: number of elements in the block (L)
      - start_index_input: the starting position (0-based index) in the input_sequence (S_in)
  - item: shifted_object_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence in output_sequence
      - elements: identical non-zero integers (same value V as object_block)
      - length: same length L as object_block
      - start_index_output: the starting position (0-based index) in the output_sequence (S_out)
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    source: object_block
    target: shifted_object_block
    parameter: shift_amount
derivation_rules:
  - rule: identify_object_block
    input: input_sequence
    output: object_block properties (value V, start_index_input S_in, length L)
    method: Scan the input sequence for the first non-zero element. Record its value (V) and index (S_in). Continue scanning while subsequent elements equal V to determine the length (L).
  - rule: calculate_shift_amount
    input: object_block.length (L)
    output: shift_amount
    formula: shift_amount = L
  - rule: calculate_output_start_index
    input:
      - object_block.start_index_input (S_in)
      - shift_amount (L)
    output: shifted_object_block.start_index_output (S_out)
    formula: S_out = S_in - L
  - rule: construct_output_sequence
    input:
      - input_sequence.length (N)
      - shifted_object_block (properties V, L, S_out)
    output: output_sequence
    method: Create a list of length N initialized with the background_digit (0). Place the shifted_object_block (value V) into this list starting at index S_out for L elements, ensuring placement respects list boundaries (indices 0 to N-1).
constraints:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one object_block.
  - The object_block consists of identical non-zero digits.
  - The background is consistently the digit 0.
  - The shift operation places the block based on the calculated start index; elements that would fall outside the sequence bounds (index < 0 or index >= N) are omitted.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (length N).
2.  Initialize an output sequence of length N, filling it entirely with zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. Let its value be V and its index be S_in.
4.  Determine the length (L) of the contiguous block of integers equal to V starting at S_in.
5.  Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the block length (L).
6.  Calculate the target starting index (S_out) for the block in the output sequence using the formula: S_out = S_in - L.
7.  Iterate L times, from i = 0 to L-1:
    a. Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_idx = S_out + i`.
    b. Check if `target_idx` is a valid index within the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= target_idx < N`).
    c. If the index is valid, set the element at `output_sequence[target_idx]` to the block value V.
8.  Return the constructed output sequence.
