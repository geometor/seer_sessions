Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The output sequence is also a sequence of the same length, containing the same block of non-zero digits but shifted to the left within the sequence, surrounded by zeros. The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length (12 elements in the examples) list of integers.\n2.  **Background:** The digit `0`, which fills most of the sequence.\n3.  **Object/Block:** A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1 1`, `4 4 4`, `5 5`).\n4.  **Properties of the Block:**\n    *   Value: The non-zero digit itself (e.g., 1, 4, 5).\n    *   Length: The number of times the digit repeats in the block.\n    *   Position: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.\n5.  **Transformation:** The block is moved (shifted) to a new position within the sequence to produce the output. The amount of the shift seems dependent on a property of the block.\n\nAnalysis reveals that the amount of the leftward shift applied to the block is equal to the length of the block itself.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
