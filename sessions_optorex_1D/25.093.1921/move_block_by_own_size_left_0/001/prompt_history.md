**Perception of the elements of the task:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single-digit integers. Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The output sequence is also a sequence of the same length, containing the same block of non-zero digits but shifted to the left within the sequence, surrounded by zeros. The key elements are:

1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length (12 elements in the examples) list of integers.
2.  **Background:** The digit `0`, which fills most of the sequence.
3.  **Object/Block:** A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `1 1 1`, `4 4 4`, `5 5`).
4.  **Properties of the Block:**
    *   Value: The non-zero digit itself (e.g., 1, 4, 5).
    *   Length: The number of times the digit repeats in the block.
    *   Position: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.
5.  **Transformation:** The block is moved (shifted) to a new position within the sequence to produce the output. The amount of the shift seems dependent on a property of the block.

Analysis reveals that the amount of the leftward shift applied to the block is equal to the length of the block itself.

**Facts:**

      - length: number of elements in the block

  - type: transformation
    action: shift_left
    target: object_block
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: derived from object_block properties
derivation_rules:
  - rule: calculate_shift_amount
    input: object_block.length
    output: shift_amount
    formula: shift_amount = object_block.length
  - rule: calculate_output_position
    input:
      - object_block.start_index_input
      - shift_amount
    output: object_block.start_index_output
    formula: object_block.start_index_output = object_block.start_index_input - shift_amount
constraints:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one object_block.
  - The object_block consists of identical non-zero digits.
  - The shift operation does not wrap around; elements shifted past index 0 are effectively placed starting at index 0. (Observed in train_1 and train_6). However, the calculation `start_index - shift_amount` correctly places the block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note the non-zero digit value, the starting index of the block, and the length of the block.
3.  Determine the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount (block length) from the original starting index of the block in the input sequence.
6.  Copy the block of non-zero digits from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
