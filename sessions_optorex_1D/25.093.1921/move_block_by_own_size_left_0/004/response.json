            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to implement the observed transformation rule: identify a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in a 1D sequence and shift it left by an amount equal to its length. The execution results show a consistent error (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`) across all examples. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data is being handled or compared within the function, likely related to the data type (e.g., NumPy array vs. standard Python list) rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic itself.\n\nThe logical steps derived (find block value, start index, length; calculate shift amount = length; calculate new start index = old start index - shift amount; place block in new zero-filled list) appear correct based on manually verifying the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Acknowledge the likely type mismatch issue encountered during execution. The code was written expecting Python lists, but the error indicates array-like behavior during boolean comparisons.\n2.  Refine the code (specifically the comparison parts within `find_block` and potentially the initial conversion in `transform`) to be more robust against potential NumPy array inputs, perhaps by explicitly casting compared elements to standard Python integers.\n3.  Re-verify the core transformation logic against the examples. Since manual verification confirms the logic, the focus remains on implementation details causing the runtime error.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise about the process, assuming the type issue is resolved in the Coder phase.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on manual application of the intended logic (since code execution failed):\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                               | Block Value | Block Start Index (Input) | Block Length | Shift Amount | Block Start Index (Output) | Expected Output                             | Matches Logic? |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 1           | 3                         | 3            | 3            | 0                          | `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]`                  | 4           | 5                         | 3            | 3            | 2                          | `[0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]`                  | 5           | 8                         | 2            | 2            | 6                          | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]`                  | 3           | 8                         | 1            | 1            | 7                          | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5]`                  | 5           | 7                         | 5            | 5            | 2                          | `[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0]`                  | 6           | 5                         | 5            | 5            | 0                          | `[6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 7           | 4                         | 2            | 2            | 2                          | `[0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                 | Yes            |\n\nThe intended logic correctly transforms all provided training examples.
