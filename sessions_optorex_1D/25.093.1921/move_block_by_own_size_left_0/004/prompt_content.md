"""
Transforms an input sequence (list) of integers by finding a single contiguous 
block of identical, non-zero integers and shifting this block leftwards by an 
amount equal to its own length. The output sequence has the same length as the 
input, with the shifted block placed at its new position and the remaining 
positions filled with zeros.

Example Logic:
Input:  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
Block: value=1, start_index=3, length=3
Shift amount = length = 3
New start index = start_index - shift_amount = 3 - 3 = 0
Output: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
