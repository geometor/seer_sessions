*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.
    *   Each sequence consists primarily of zeros (0).
    *   Within each input sequence, there is a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by repositioning this block of non-zero integers.
    *   The block of non-zero integers in the output is identical to the block in the input (same digits, same length).
    *   The block appears to be shifted to the left.
    *   The magnitude of the left shift seems related to the length of the non-zero block itself. Specifically, the block is shifted left by a number of positions equal to its length.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: sequence
        description: A list of 12 integers.
        properties:
          - length: 12
          - contains: primarily zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
      - object: block
        description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers within the main sequence.
        properties:
          - value: The non-zero integer comprising the block.
          - length: The count of elements in the block.
          - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - action: shift_left
        description: The block is moved to an earlier position in the sequence.
        properties:
          - amount: The number of positions the block is shifted left.
            relationship: Equal to the 'length' property of the 'block'.
      - relationship: transformation
        description: The output sequence is generated by applying the shift_left action to the block found in the input sequence.
        details:
          - Find the block in the input.
          - Determine the block's length (L).
          - Determine the block's start index (S_in).
          - Calculate the new start index (S_out) = S_in - L.
          - Create the output sequence by placing the block starting at S_out and filling the rest with zeros.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence.
    2.  Determine the length (number of digits) of this block. Let this length be L.
    3.  Shift the entire block L positions to the left.
    4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the shifted block in its new position and filling all other positions with zeros.
