Identifies a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence.\n2. Determines the value (V), length (L), and starting index (S_in) of this block.\n3. Calculates a new starting index (S_out) by shifting the block left by its length: S_out = S_in - L.\n4. Creates an output sequence of 12 zeros.\n5. Places the block (value V repeated L times) into the output sequence starting at index S_out.\n6.
