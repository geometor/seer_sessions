*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers.
    *   Each sequence consists primarily of zeros (0).
    *   Within each input sequence, there is a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by repositioning this block of non-zero integers.
    *   The block of non-zero integers in the output is identical to the block in the input (same digits, same length).
    *   The block appears to be shifted to the left.
    *   The magnitude of the left shift seems related to the length of the non-zero block itself. Specifically, the block is shifted left by a number of positions equal to its length.

*   **Facts:**

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: locate a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers and shift it left by a number of positions equal to its length. All provided training examples adhere to this rule. The execution errors reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggest an issue with how the input data was processed by the execution environment (likely parsing the input string into a NumPy array incorrectly or passing an unexpected array type to the function) rather than a flaw in the proposed transformation logic itself. The strategy is to reaffirm the logic based on the examples, assuming the input is correctly parsed as a flat list of integers, and to document this assumption clearly.

*   **Metrics:**
    The following metrics were calculated for each training example based on the input sequences:

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Assume the input is a list of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output list of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input list to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the block.
    4.  Record the value of this non-zero integer (let it be `V`) and its starting index (let it be `S_in`).
    5.  Continue iterating from `S_in` to count how many consecutive elements have the value `V`. Let this count be the block length `L`.
    6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list: `S_out = S_in - L`.
    7.  Place the block into the output list: for `i` from 0 to `L-1`, set the element at index `S_out + i` in the output list to the value `V`.
    8.  Return the modified output list.
