Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are one-dimensional lists (or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Content:** Each list primarily consists of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-zero block within the list. The block moves to the left.
4.  **Shift Magnitude:** The amount of the leftward shift seems directly related to the length of the non-zero block itself. Specifically, the block shifts left by a number of positions equal to its length.
5.  **Padding:** Zeros act as padding or background, filling the space before and after the non-zero block. The overall length of the list remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
input_data_type: list_of_integers
output_data_type: list_of_integers
elements:
  - type: background
    value: 0
    role: padding
  - type: object
    identifier: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - contiguity: True
      - homogeneity: True (all digits within the block are identical)
      - count: 1 (only one such block per list)
      - value: variable (e.g., 6, 9, 8, 3, 2, 5)
      - length: variable (number of digits in the block)
      - position: variable (start index in the list)
action:
  type: shift
  target: non_zero_block
  direction: left
  magnitude: equal_to_length_of_non_zero_block
relationship:
  - input_non_zero_block_position determines output_non_zero_block_position
  - input_non_zero_block_length determines shift_magnitude
constraints:
  - list_length_is_constant
  - only_one_non_zero_block_exists
  - non_zero_block_elements_are_identical
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input list.
2.  Determine the starting index (`start_idx`) of this block.
3.  Determine the length (`length`) of this block (number of non-zero digits).
4.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_start_idx`) for the block in the output list by subtracting the block's length from its original starting index: `new_start_idx = start_idx - length`.
5.  Create a new output list of the same length as the input list, initially filled with zeros.
6.  Copy the identified non-zero block from the input list into the output list, starting at the calculated `new_start_idx`.
