**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided test results indicate that the previously generated Python code fails for all training and testing examples. The reported "Transformed Output: 0" and "Size Correct: False" suggest a fundamental issue where the function is not returning a list of the correct length, possibly due to an error during execution (like an undeclared dependency if `numpy` wasn't available) or a flaw in the core logic causing it to return an unexpected value (though simulation suggested the logic was sound).

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the core transformation rule by analyzing the input/output pairs again.
2.  Use code execution (`tool_code`) to calculate the expected parameters (block start, length, value, new start position) for each example based on the assumed correct logic.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise and unambiguous about the transformation, ensuring the core logic (find block, shift left by length) is clearly stated. This will guide the next coding attempt.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze each example to confirm the block properties and the expected shift.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_list):
    """Analyzes an input list to find the block and calculate expected output."""

            if in_block: break
            else: continue
        if not in_block:
            start_index = i; value = element; length = 1; in_block = True
        elif in_block:
            if element == value: length += 1
            else: break # Should not happen based on task description
            
    if start_index == -1:
        return {"error": "No block found"}

         block_content = [value] * length
         # Ensure slicing doesn't go out of bounds (though not expected)
         actual_end_index = min(new_end_index, grid_length)
         actual_length = actual_end_index - new_start_index
         output_grid[new_start_index:actual_end_index] = block_content[:actual_length]

The analysis confirms the initial understanding of the transformation rule is consistent across all examples: the single block of non-zero identical digits shifts left by a number of positions equal to its length. The calculated expected outputs match the provided outputs in the task description.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_type: array_transformation
input_data_type: list_of_integers
output_data_type: list_of_integers
array_length: 12 # Constant across examples seen
elements:
  - type: background
    value: 0
    role: padding
  - type: object
    identifier: contiguous_non_zero_block
    properties:
      - count: 1 # Exactly one such block per input list
      - contiguity: True # Digits form a continuous sequence
      - homogeneity: True # All digits within the block are identical and non-zero
      - value: Any digit from 1-9 (observed: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
      - length: Variable (observed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
      - start_index: Variable (position of the first digit of the block)
transformation:
  action: shift_left
  target: contiguous_non_zero_block
  parameter:
    source: length # The length property of the target block
    value_computation: shift_amount = block_length
  process:
    1_find_block: Identify start_index, length, and value of the contiguous_non_zero_block.
    2_calculate_new_position: new_start_index = start_index - length.
    3_construct_output: Create a new list of the same length filled with the background value (0).
    4_place_block: Copy the block (value repeated length times) into the new list starting at new_start_index.
constraints:
  - list_length_is_constant (input length = output length).
  - Exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits exists in the input.
  - The calculated new_start_index is always >= 0 (the block does not shift off the left edge).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input list of integers.
2.  Create an output list of the same length as the input list, initialized entirely with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input list to find the first occurrence of a non-zero integer. This marks the `start_index` of the non-zero block. Record the `value` of this integer.
4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to determine the `length` of the contiguous block of digits identical to `value`. Stop counting when a different digit or a zero is encountered, or the end of the list is reached.
5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` for the block in the output list by subtracting the determined `length` from the original `start_index` (`new_start_index = start_index - length`).
6.  Fill the segment of the output list starting at `new_start_index` for a duration of `length` positions with the determined block `value`.
7.  Return the modified output list.
