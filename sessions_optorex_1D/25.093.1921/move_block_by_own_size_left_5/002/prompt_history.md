*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are lists of integers, always of length 12.
    *   Each list consists predominantly of zeros (0).
    *   Within each input list, there is a single, contiguous sequence (block) of identical non-zero digits.
    *   The transformation involves relocating this block of non-zero digits within the list.
    *   The non-zero digits themselves and the length of the block remain unchanged.
    *   The block appears to be shifted to the left. The amount of the shift seems related to the properties of the block itself.

*   **YAML facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: list_transformation
    list_length: 12
    background_element: 0
    objects:
      - type: contiguous_block
        properties:
          - value: non-zero_integer (constant within block)
          - length: variable (integer > 0)
          - start_index: variable (integer >= 0)
          - end_index: variable (integer < 12)
    action:
      - type: shift_left
        target: contiguous_block
        parameters:
          - shift_amount: equal_to_block_length
    relationship:
      - The distance the block is shifted left is numerically equal to the length of the block.
    output_structure:
      - The output list has the same length (12).
      - The shifted block retains its original values and length.
      - All other positions in the output list are filled with the background element (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input list.
    2.  Determine the starting index (`start_index`) and the length (`block_length`) of this block.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list as `new_start_index = start_index - block_length`.
    4.  Create a new list of length 12, initially filled with zeros.
    5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero digits from the input list into the new list, starting at the `new_start_index`.
