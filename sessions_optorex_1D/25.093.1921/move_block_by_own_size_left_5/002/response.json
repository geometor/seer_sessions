Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that during testing, the input `input_grid` was treated as a NumPy array, not a standard Python list as specified by the type hint (`list[int]`). Comparisons like `val != 0` or `val == block_value` within the `find_non_zero_block` function likely failed because `val` was an array element or slice behaving differently than a simple integer in a boolean context.\n    *   The transformation logic itself, as described in the initial natural language program and YAML, appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  **Verify the Transformation Rule:** Use code execution to systematically check the rule (find block, calculate shift, predict output) against all training examples to confirm its validity.\n    2.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the verified rule, maintaining clarity and precision.\n    3.  **Address the Error Context:** While the dreamer's role focuses on the *rule*, it's important to note the likely cause of the execution error (NumPy array handling) so the coder phase can address it, either by ensuring the input is converted to a list or by modifying the code to handle NumPy arrays explicitly if required by the execution environment. The current analysis will assume the function *should* operate on lists as intended.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Let's verify the rule parameters for each training example.\n\n"
