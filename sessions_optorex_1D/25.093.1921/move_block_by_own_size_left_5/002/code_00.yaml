task_description: Transform a list by shifting a specific block of elements.
input_type: list[int]
output_type: list[int]
list_properties:
  length: 12
  background_element: 0
object_definitions:
  - object: primary_block
    description: The single contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits within the input list.
    identification:
      - Iterate through the list.
      - Find the first element that is not the background_element (0). This marks the start.
      - Record the value of this element (block_value).
      - Continue iterating as long as the elements match block_value. This determines the length.
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: int
        description: The non-zero integer value repeated within the block.
        example_values: [9, 6, 4, 1, 5, 7]
      - name: start_index
        type: int
        description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the input list.
        range: [0, 11]
      - name: length
        type: int
        description: The number of elements in the block.
        range: [1, 12] # Theoretically up to 12, observed up to 4.
transformation_rule:
  - action: identify
    target: primary_block
    details: Determine its start_index, length, and value.
  - action: calculate_shift
    parameter: shift_amount
    value: primary_block.length
    direction: left
  - action: calculate_new_position
    parameter: new_start_index
    value: primary_block.start_index - shift_amount
  - action: generate_output
    steps:
      - Create a new list of the same length as the input, filled with the background_element (0).
      - Place the identified primary_block into the new list, starting at the calculated new_start_index.
      - Ensure block elements are placed within the bounds [0, list_length - 1]. Elements shifted outside these bounds are omitted.
consistency_checks:
  - The length of the output list is always the same as the input list (12).
  - Only one primary_block exists in each input example.
  - The value and length of the primary_block remain unchanged in the output.
  - All elements in the output list not part of the shifted primary_block are the background_element (0).
potential_edge_cases: (Not observed in training data)
  - Input list contains no non-zero elements. (Expected output: all zeros).
  - Input list contains multiple distinct non-zero blocks. (Rule unclear based on examples).
  - Calculated new_start_index is negative. (Elements shifted before index 0 are omitted).
