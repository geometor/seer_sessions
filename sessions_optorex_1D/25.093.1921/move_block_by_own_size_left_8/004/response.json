            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message \"ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly indicates that the `transform` function, or the testing harness calling it, encountered a situation where a NumPy array was used in a boolean context that expects a single True/False value (e.g., `if numpy_array:`). This typically happens with element-wise comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, etc.) that produce boolean arrays, which are then implicitly used in conditional statements.\n\nGiven that the core logic derived from the examples (find non-zero block, shift left by block length) appears consistent across all provided training cases, the error is likely related to the *implementation's interaction with the data type* (specifically, assuming Python lists when NumPy arrays might be provided by the execution environment) rather than a flaw in the *understanding of the transformation rule*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Data Type:** Assume the input `input_grid` might be a NumPy array.\n2.  **Review Logic:** Re-examine the natural language program and the previous code attempt to ensure no steps implicitly rely on list-specific behavior that would break with NumPy arrays in a way that causes this specific error. The previous code's element-wise iteration and comparison *should* theoretically handle NumPy arrays correctly element by element. This reinforces the idea that the error might originate in the testing comparison or a subtle interaction.\n3.  **Refine NL Program:** Keep the core transformation logic but ensure clarity. The NL program describes the *intent*, and the intent derived from the examples seems correct. The implementation needs fixing, but the description of the task's goal remains valid.\n4.  **Focus on Core Task:** The primary goal is to define the transformation rule. The NL program and facts should reflect this rule accurately based on the examples. Implementation robustness is a separate (coder phase) concern, although awareness of potential NumPy usage is relevant context.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nSince the code failed execution due to the type error, we cannot gather runtime metrics. However, we can re-analyze the examples manually to confirm the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                           | Non-Zero Digit | Block Start Index | Block Length | Shift Amount (Block Length) | Target Start Index | Expected Output                      |\n| :------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]`              | 8              | 5                 | 5            | 5                           | 0                  | `[8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | 3              | 3                 | 2            | 2                           | 1                  | `[0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | 6              | 2                 | 1            | 1                           | 1                  | `[0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0]`              | 9              | 5                 | 5            | 5                           | 0                  | `[9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]`              | 1              | 5                 | 4            | 4                           | 1                  | `[0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]`              | 4              | 11                | 1            | 1                           | 10                 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0]`          |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0]`              | 2              | 7                 | 4            | 4                           | 3                  | `[0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]`          |\n\n**Observations:**\n*   All inputs are 1D sequences of length 12.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit.\n*   The output sequence has the same length as the input.\n*   The non-zero block from the input is present in the output.\n*   The block is shifted leftwards.\n*   The shift distance is precisely equal to the length of the non-zero block.\n*   Positions in the output not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.\n\nThe pattern holds consistently across all examples.
