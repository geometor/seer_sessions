Task: Sequence Transformation (Left Shift by Block Length)

Input_Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers (potentially represented as a Python list or NumPy array).
  Characteristics:
    - Primarily composed of zeros ('0').
    - Contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (1-9).
    - Fixed length within a given task instance (e.g., 12 in the examples).

Output_Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers (matching the input type representation).
  Characteristics:
    - Same length as the input sequence.
    - Contains the same non-zero block as the input, but repositioned.
    - Positions outside the repositioned block are filled with zeros ('0').

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Sequence: The ordered list/array of digits.
    - Property: Length (e.g., 12).
  - Zero_Element: The digit 0.
  - Non_Zero_Block:
    - Property: Digit_Value (the non-zero integer, e.g., 8, 3, 6).
    - Property: Input_Start_Index (index where the block begins in the input).
    - Property: Length (number of digits in the block).
  - Output_Start_Index: The calculated index where the block begins in the output.

Actions_and_Transformation:
  1. Identify_Block: Locate the Non_Zero_Block in the Input_Data, determining its Digit_Value, Input_Start_Index, and Length.
  2. Calculate_Shift: Determine the shift distance, which is equal to the Non_Zero_Block's Length.
  3. Calculate_New_Position: Compute the Output_Start_Index by subtracting the shift distance from the Input_Start_Index (Output_Start_Index = Input_Start_Index - Length).
  4. Construct_Output:
     a. Initialize a new sequence of the same length as the Input_Data, filled with Zero_Elements.
     b. Place the Non_Zero_Block (composed of Digit_Value repeated Length times) into the new sequence starting at the calculated Output_Start_Index.

Relationships:
  - The shift distance applied to the Non_Zero_Block is solely determined by its own Length.
  - The position of the block in the output depends on its original position and its length.
  - All elements in the output sequence that are not part of the shifted Non_Zero_Block are Zero_Elements.
