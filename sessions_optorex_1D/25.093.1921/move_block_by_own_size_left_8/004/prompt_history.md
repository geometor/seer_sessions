Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single digits. Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros (`0`) and contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., `8 8 8 8 8`, `3 3`, `6`). The transformation rule seems to involve repositioning this non-zero block within the sequence while maintaining the overall sequence length. The core operation appears to be a leftward shift of the non-zero block. The magnitude of this shift is consistently equal to the number of elements (length) within that non-zero block. The rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit.
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed for each example pair (e.g., 12 in the examples).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block as the input, shifted left.
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as the corresponding input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of digits.
  - Zero_Element: The digit 0.
  - Non_Zero_Block:
      Properties:
        - Digit: The non-zero integer value (1-9).
        - Start_Index: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
        - Length: The number of digits in the block.

Action:
  - Identify: Locate the Non_Zero_Block (its digit, start index, and length) in the input sequence.
  - Calculate_Shift: Determine the shift amount, which equals the Length of the Non_Zero_Block.
  - Calculate_New_Position: Compute the new starting index for the block in the output sequence (Input_Start_Index - Shift_Amount).
  - Construct_Output: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled with Zero_Elements. Place the identified Non_Zero_Block into this new sequence starting at the calculated New_Position.

Relationships:
  - The shift distance is directly determined by the length of the Non_Zero_Block.
  - The elements outside the shifted Non_Zero_Block in the output sequence are always Zero_Elements.
  - Input and Output sequences have identical lengths.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, filling it entirely with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block.
3.  Determine the value of the non-zero digit, the starting index of the block, and count the number of consecutive occurrences of this digit to find the length of the block.
4.  Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the non-zero block found in step 3.
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the block's original starting index in the input sequence.
6.  Copy the sequence of non-zero digits (the block) from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.
