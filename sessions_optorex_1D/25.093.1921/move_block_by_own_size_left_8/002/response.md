**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous execution attempt resulted in errors across all examples. The error message ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()") suggests a data type mismatch during testing, likely passing a NumPy array where a list or element-wise comparison was expected. The core transformation logic derived previously (identify the non-zero block, shift it left by its length) appears sound when manually checked against the input/output pairs.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the input/output pairs to confirm the transformation rule.
2.  Use code execution (`tool_code`) to systematically extract key metrics (block start, length, required shift, target start position) for each example to rigorously verify the hypothesized rule.
3.  Refine the structured facts (YAML) and the natural language program based on this verified understanding, ignoring the previous execution error as likely external to the core logic.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` by parsing the input strings, identifying the non-zero block, calculating the required shift (equal to block length), and determining the expected output start position. The actual start position in the provided output was also extracted for verification.

The analysis confirms that the transformation consistently involves shifting the single non-zero block leftward by a distance exactly equal to the block's length. The `expected_start_index_output` matches the `actual_start_index_output` in all provided training examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Left Shift by Block Length)

Input:
  Type: Sequence (List) of single integers.
  Length: Constant within a given example pair (e.g., 12).
  Content: Primarily composed of zeros (`0`), containing exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (1-9).

Output:
  Type: Sequence (List) of single integers.
  Length: Identical to the input sequence length.
  Content: Primarily composed of zeros (`0`), containing the same non-zero block from the input, shifted to a new position.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The ordered list of integers (input or output).
    Properties:
      - elements: The list of integers [0-9].
      - length: The total number of elements.
  - Zero_Element: The integer `0`.
  - Non_Zero_Block: A contiguous sub-sequence within the input sequence consisting of identical non-zero digits.
    Properties:
      - digit_value: The non-zero integer (1-9) comprising the block.
      - start_index_input: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
  - Shift_Operation: The core action performed on the Non_Zero_Block.
    Properties:
      - direction: Leftward.
      - distance: Equal to the `length` of the `Non_Zero_Block`.

Derived_Properties:
  - target_start_index_output: The calculated 0-based index where the `Non_Zero_Block` should begin in the output sequence.
    Calculation: `start_index_input` - `length`.

Action:
  1. Identify_Block: Scan the input `Sequence` to find the `Non_Zero_Block`, determining its `digit_value`, `start_index_input`, and `length`.
  2. Calculate_Target_Position: Compute the `target_start_index_output` by subtracting the block's `length` from its `start_index_input`.
  3. Construct_Output: Create a new `Sequence` of the same `length` as the input, initially filled with `Zero_Element`s.
  4. Place_Block: Copy the `Non_Zero_Block` (repeating the `digit_value` for `length` times) into the output `Sequence`, starting at the `target_start_index_output`.

Constraints:
  - The input contains exactly one non-zero block.
  - All digits within the non-zero block are identical.
  - The shift operation results in a valid start index within the sequence bounds (as observed in all examples).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length, initializing all its elements to zero.
4.  Scan the input sequence to locate the contiguous block of non-zero digits. Record the non-zero digit itself, the index where the block starts, and the number of digits in the block (its length).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: subtract the block's length from its starting index in the input sequence.
6.  Iterate from 0 up to (but not including) the block's length. In each iteration `i`:
    a. Calculate the index in the output sequence: `target starting index + i`.
    b. Place the recorded non-zero digit at this calculated index in the output sequence.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
