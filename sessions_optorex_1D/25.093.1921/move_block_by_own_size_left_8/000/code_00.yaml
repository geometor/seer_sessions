Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit.
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed for each example pair (e.g., 12 in the examples).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block as the input, shifted left.
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as the corresponding input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of digits.
  - Zero_Element: The digit 0.
  - Non_Zero_Block:
      Properties:
        - Digit: The non-zero integer value (1-9).
        - Start_Index: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
        - Length: The number of digits in the block.

Action:
  - Identify: Locate the Non_Zero_Block (its digit, start index, and length) in the input sequence.
  - Calculate_Shift: Determine the shift amount, which equals the Length of the Non_Zero_Block.
  - Calculate_New_Position: Compute the new starting index for the block in the output sequence (Input_Start_Index - Shift_Amount).
  - Construct_Output: Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, filled with Zero_Elements. Place the identified Non_Zero_Block into this new sequence starting at the calculated New_Position.

Relationships:
  - The shift distance is directly determined by the length of the Non_Zero_Block.
  - The elements outside the shifted Non_Zero_Block in the output sequence are always Zero_Elements.
  - Input and Output sequences have identical lengths.
