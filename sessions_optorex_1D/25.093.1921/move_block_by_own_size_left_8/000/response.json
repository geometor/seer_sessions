Each input sequence consists primarily of zeros (`0`) and contains exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., `8 8 8 8 8`, `3 3`, `6`). The transformation rule seems to involve repositioning this non-zero block within the sequence while maintaining the overall sequence length. The core operation appears to be a leftward shift of the non-zero block. The magnitude of this shift is consistently equal to the number of elements (length) within that non-zero block. The rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. This marks the beginning of the non-zero block.\n3.  Determine the value of the non-zero digit, the starting index of the block, and count the number of consecutive occurrences of this digit to find the length of the block.\n4.  Calculate the shift amount, which is equal to the length of the non-zero block found in step 3.\n5.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift amount from the block's original starting index in the input sequence.\n6.  Copy the sequence of non-zero digits (the block) from the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index.\n7.  Return the modified output sequence."
