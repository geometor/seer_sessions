Task: Sequence Transformation (Left Shift by Block Length)

Input:
  Type: List or 1D NumPy array of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains predominantly zeros and exactly one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit.
  Properties:
    - Fixed_Length: The length of the sequence is consistent within a task instance (e.g., 12).

Output:
  Type: List of integers (0-9)
  Structure: Contains zeros and the same non-zero block as the input, shifted left.
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as the corresponding input sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The 1D list/array of digits.
  - Zero_Element: The digit 0.
  - Non_Zero_Block:
      Properties:
        - Digit: The integer value (1-9) of the block elements.
        - Input_Start_Index: The index where the block begins in the input sequence.
        - Length: The number of consecutive digits in the block.

Action:
  - Identify_Block: Iterate through the input sequence to find the Non_Zero_Block, determining its Digit, Input_Start_Index, and Length. Handle potential edge cases like all-zero inputs.
  - Calculate_Shift: The shift amount is equal to the identified Block Length.
  - Calculate_Output_Position: Compute the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: Output_Start_Index = Input_Start_Index - Shift_Amount.
  - Construct_Output:
      1. Create a new sequence (list) of the same length as the input, filled with Zero_Elements.
      2. If a Non_Zero_Block was found:
         - Iterate from 0 up to (Block Length - 1). For each iteration `i`:
           - Calculate the target index in the output: `target_idx = Output_Start_Index + i`.
           - If `target_idx` is within the valid bounds (0 to Sequence_Length - 1), place the Block's Digit at `output_sequence[target_idx]`.
      3. Return the constructed output sequence.

Relationships:
  - Shift distance = Block Length.
  - Output sequence length = Input sequence length.
  - Elements outside the shifted Non_Zero_Block in the output are Zero_Elements.
  - Assumes only one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit exists per input.
