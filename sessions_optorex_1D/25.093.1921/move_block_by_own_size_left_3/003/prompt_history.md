**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional list of single-digit integers. Each input list contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output list is the result of shifting this block of non-zero digits to the left. The magnitude of the shift appears to be directly related to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the list remains constant throughout the transformation.

**YAML Fact Document:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input list.
2.  **Determine** the starting index and the length of this identified block.
3.  **Calculate** the new starting index for the block by subtracting the block's length from its original starting index.
4.  **Create** a new output list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with zeros.
5.  **Place** the identified non-zero block into the new output list, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  **Return** the modified output list.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the execution environment provided NumPy arrays. This caused a `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` on the first line attempting to process the input.

The strategy is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
2.  The core logic for identifying the non-zero block, calculating its length, determining the shift amount (which is equal to the length), and creating the output list seems conceptually correct based on the examples. This logic should remain largely unchanged but will now operate directly on the list/array data structure.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML, natural language program) to reflect the correct input type (list/array of integers) and the refined understanding of the process.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Data Type:** NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`) of integers.
*   **Input Structure:** 1D array containing mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
*   **Output Data Type:** Expected to be a NumPy array (or list) of integers with the same dimensions/length as the input.
*   **Transformation:** Leftward shift of the non-zero block.
*   **Shift Amount:** Equal to the length of the non-zero block.
*   **Error Cause:** Type mismatch - function expected `str`, received `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Logical Correctness (Pre-Error):** The intended logic (find block, shift left by block length) appears consistent across all 7 training examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Accept** the input as a 1D list or NumPy array of integers.
2.  **Initialize** variables to track the block's start index, length, and value. Iterate through the input array to **identify** the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
3.  **Record** the starting index (`start_index`), the length (`block_length`), and the value (`block_value`) of the identified block.
4.  **Calculate** the new starting index (`new_start_index`) for the block by subtracting the `block_length` from the original `start_index`.
5.  **Create** a new output list/array of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with zeros.
6.  **Populate** the output list/array by placing the `block_value` at indices from `new_start_index` up to `new_start_index + block_length - 1`.
7.  **Return** the resulting output list/array.
