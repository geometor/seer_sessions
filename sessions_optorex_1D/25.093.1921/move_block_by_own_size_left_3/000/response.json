Each input list contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output list is the result of shifting this block of non-zero digits to the left. The magnitude of the shift appears to be directly related to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the list remains constant throughout the transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
