task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a list to the left."
data_representation:
  input: "List of single-digit integers."
  output: "List of single-digit integers, same length as input."
objects:
  - name: list
    properties:
      - type: "1D sequence of integers"
      - length: "Constant (12 in examples)"
      - content: "Mostly zeros with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits."
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: "Sub-sequence of the list"
      - content: "Consists of identical non-zero digits."
      - length: "Variable (1 to 4 in examples)"
      - position: "Starting index within the list."
relationships:
  - type: "Transformation"
    applies_to: "non_zero_block"
    action: "Shift position within the list."
    direction: "Left"
    magnitude: "Equal to the length of the non_zero_block."
constraints:
  - "Input contains exactly one non-zero block."
  - "Digits within the block are identical."
  - "List length remains unchanged."
  - "The block does not wrap around; sufficient space exists for the left shift."
