**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional list of single-digit integers. Each input list contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output list is the result of shifting this block of non-zero digits to the left. The magnitude of the shift appears to be directly related to the length of the non-zero block itself. The overall length of the list remains constant throughout the transformation.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a list to the left."
data_representation:
  input: "List of single-digit integers."
  output: "List of single-digit integers, same length as input."
objects:
  - name: list
    properties:
      - type: "1D sequence of integers"
      - length: "Constant (12 in examples)"
      - content: "Mostly zeros with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits."
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: "Sub-sequence of the list"
      - content: "Consists of identical non-zero digits."
      - length: "Variable (1 to 4 in examples)"
      - position: "Starting index within the list."
relationships:
  - type: "Transformation"
    applies_to: "non_zero_block"
    action: "Shift position within the list."
    direction: "Left"
    magnitude: "Equal to the length of the non_zero_block."
constraints:
  - "Input contains exactly one non-zero block."
  - "Digits within the block are identical."
  - "List length remains unchanged."
  - "The block does not wrap around; sufficient space exists for the left shift."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input list.
2.  **Determine** the starting index and the length of this identified block.
3.  **Calculate** the new starting index for the block by subtracting the block's length from its original starting index.
4.  **Create** a new output list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with zeros.
5.  **Place** the identified non-zero block into the new output list, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  **Return** the modified output list.
