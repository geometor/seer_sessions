            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core logic derived previously, which involves identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it left by its own length, appears correct based on manual inspection of the input/output pairs. However, the consistent error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" across all examples strongly indicates a data type mismatch between the `transform` function's expectations and the format provided by the testing environment. The error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a boolean context where a single True/False value is expected (e.g., `if my_array:`). This suggests the testing framework might be passing the input as a 2D NumPy array (possibly 1xN) instead of the expected 1D list or array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle a 2D NumPy array input. Assume the relevant data is in the first (and likely only) row. Extract this row into a 1D structure (list or 1D NumPy array) that the existing `find_non_zero_block_info` function can process correctly.\n2.  **Output Handling:** Ensure the function returns the data in the format expected by the testing environment (likely a 1D list, based on the original code's return type, but confirm if it needs to be wrapped back into a 2D structure). The current code returns a list, which might be acceptable.\n3.  **Refine Logic (if needed):** Although the core shifting logic seems correct, ensure edge cases (like the block shifting entirely off the left edge, which doesn't happen in examples but is theoretically possible if `start_index < block_length`) are handled gracefully (the current code seems implicitly correct as `new_start_index` would be negative, and the placement loop would only write within valid indices `0 <= target_index < grid_length`).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the code execution failed due to the input type error, metrics are derived from manual analysis of the provided examples, assuming a 1D interpretation for the core logic:\n\n| Example | Input (1D)                      | Block Value | Block Start | Block Length | Shift Amount | New Start | Output (1D)                     | Matches Expected |\n| :------ | :------------------------------ | :---------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | 2           | 4           | 2            | 2            | 2         | `[0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_2 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0]`     | 8           | 7           | 3            | 3            | 4         | `[0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_3 | `[0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | 9           | 3           | 1            | 1            | 2         | `[0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0]`     | 3           | 7           | 4            | 4            | 3         | `[0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0]`     | 2           | 8           | 3            | 3            | 5         | `[0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_6 | `[0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | 5           | 2           | 2            | 2            | 0         | `[5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`     | 1           | 4           | 4            | 4            | 0         | `[1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`     | Yes              |\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule: find the single block of identical non-zero digits and shift it left by a distance equal to its length. The consistent error indicates the primary issue lies in adapting to the data format used by the testing environment.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
