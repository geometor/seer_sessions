task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a sequence to the left by a distance equal to its own length."
data_representation:
  input: "Potentially a 2D NumPy array (e.g., 1xN) containing single-digit integers, representing a 1D sequence conceptually."
  output: "A 1D list of single-digit integers, representing the transformed sequence."
objects:
  - name: sequence # Represents the core data structure being manipulated
    properties:
      - type: "Effectively 1D sequence of integers, possibly stored in the first row of a 2D array."
      - length: "Constant (e.g., 12 in examples)."
      - content: "Mostly zeros with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits."
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: "Sub-sequence within the main sequence."
      - content: "Consists of identical non-zero digits."
      - length: "Variable (1 to 4 in examples)."
      - position: "Starting index within the 1D sequence."
      - value: "The non-zero digit comprising the block."
relationships:
  - type: "Transformation"
    applies_to: "non_zero_block"
    action: "Shift position within the sequence."
    direction: "Left"
    magnitude: "Equal to the length of the non_zero_block."
constraints:
  - "Input sequence contains exactly one non-zero block."
  - "Digits within the block are identical and non-zero."
  - "Sequence length remains unchanged."
  - "The block shift does not require wrapping; the new starting position is always non-negative based on examples (`original_start_index >= block_length`)."
input_format_handling:
  - "Assume input might be a 2D NumPy array (e.g., 1xN)."
  - "Extract the first row as the 1D sequence to operate on."
output_format_handling:
  - "Return the result as a standard 1D Python list."
