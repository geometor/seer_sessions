            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the execution environment provided NumPy arrays. This caused a `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` on the first line attempting to process the input.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).\n2.  The core logic for identifying the non-zero block, calculating its length, determining the shift amount (which is equal to the length), and creating the output list seems conceptually correct based on the examples. This logic should remain largely unchanged but will now operate directly on the list/array data structure.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML, natural language program) to reflect the correct input type (list/array of integers) and the refined understanding of the process.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`) of integers.\n*   **Input Structure:** 1D array containing mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.\n*   **Output Data Type:** Expected to be a NumPy array (or list) of integers with the same dimensions/length as the input.\n*   **Transformation:** Leftward shift of the non-zero block.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Equal to the length of the non-zero block.\n*   **Error Cause:** Type mismatch - function expected `str`, received `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Logical Correctness (Pre-Error):** The intended logic (find block, shift left by block length) appears consistent across all 7 training examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
