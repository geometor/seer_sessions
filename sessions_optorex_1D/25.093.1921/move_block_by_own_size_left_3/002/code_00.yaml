task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 1D array/list to the left by a distance equal to its own length."
data_representation:
  input: "1D NumPy array (or list) of integers."
  output: "1D NumPy array (or list) of integers, same length as input."
objects:
  - name: input_array
    properties:
      - type: "1D sequence of integers (list or NumPy array)"
      - length: "Constant for a given task instance (e.g., 12 in examples)"
      - content: "Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits."
  - name: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - type: "Sub-sequence within the input_array"
      - content: "Consists of identical non-zero digits."
      - value: "The non-zero integer value."
      - length: "Number of elements in the block (variable)."
      - start_index: "Index of the first element of the block in the input_array."
relationships:
  - type: "Transformation"
    input: "input_array"
    output: "output_array"
    action: "Shift non_zero_block position within the array."
    direction: "Left"
    magnitude_calculation: "Shift distance equals the length of the non_zero_block."
    new_start_index_calculation: "original start_index - block length"
constraints:
  - "Input contains exactly one non-zero block."
  - "Digits within the block are identical and non-zero."
  - "Array length remains unchanged."
  - "The block shift does not wrap around; the new start index will be >= 0."
  - "Input format is a list or NumPy array of integers, not a string."
