task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers leftwards within a sequence of zeros.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A fixed-length list (length 12) of integers.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list of integers
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence composed of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer composing the block (e.g., 1, 7, 8, 5, 6).
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - content: A list of identical non-zero integers.
  - object: background
    description: Elements in the sequence that are not part of the non-zero block.
    properties:
      - value: Always 0.

  - type: contains
    subject: sequence

  - type: contains
    subject: sequence
    object: background
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Find the start index, value, and length of the non-zero block in the input sequence.
  - action: calculate_shift
    description: Determine the amount to shift the block leftwards.
    rule: shift_amount = block.length
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the new start index for the block in the output sequence.
    rule: new_start_index = block.start_index - shift_amount
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence by placing the identified block at the new position and filling the rest with zeros.
input_state:
  - sequence: contains one block and background zeros.
output_state:
  - sequence: contains the same block shifted left by its length, surrounded by background zeros.
