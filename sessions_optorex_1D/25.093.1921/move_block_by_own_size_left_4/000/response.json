            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.\n*   **Content:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `1 1`, `7 7`, `8 8 8 8`).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. The block moves towards the left (beginning) of the sequence.\n*   **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts seems related to the block itself. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output:\n    *   `train_1`: `1 1` (len 2) moves from index 2 to 0 (shift 2).\n    *   `train_2`: `7 7` (len 2) moves from index 8 to 6 (shift 2).\n    *   `train_3`: `8 8 8 8` (len 4) moves from index 5 to 1 (shift 4).\n    *   `train_4`: `8 8 8 8 8 8` (len 6) moves from index 6 to 0 (shift 6).\n    *   `train_5`: `7` (len 1) moves from index 5 to 4 (shift 1).\n    *   `train_6`: `5 5 5 5 5` (len 5) moves from index 5 to 0 (shift 5).\n    *   `train_7`: `6 6 6 6 6` (len 5) moves from index 7 to 2 (shift 5).\n*   **Rule:** The amount of leftward shift is equal to the *length* of the contiguous non-zero block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
