            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently appeared across all examples. This strongly indicates that the input data, assumed to be a simple list of integers, is instead being passed to the `transform` function as a data type (likely a NumPy array or similar structure) where direct boolean evaluation of element-wise comparisons (`val != 0`, `val == block_value`) within an `if` statement is disallowed. The underlying transformation logic identified previously (shifting a non-zero block left by its length) appears correct based on the input/output pairs, but the implementation needs adjustment to handle the actual data types encountered in the testing environment.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe primary strategy is to modify the `find_non_zero_block` helper function to robustly handle comparisons involving potential NumPy numeric types or single-element arrays. This involves ensuring that comparisons are made between scalar values. We can achieve this by explicitly extracting the scalar value from each element being iterated over before performing the comparison. The rest of the transformation logic (calculating shift distance and constructing the output) seems sound and consistent with the examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe core issue lies in the comparison logic within the `find_non_zero_block` function when encountering NumPy array elements or types.\n\nLet's trace `train_1` assuming the input is a NumPy array `np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])` and the comparison issue is addressed:\n\n1.  **Input:** `[0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (length 12)\n2.  **Find Block:**\n    *   Iterate through elements. Assume `val` might be `np.int64(0)`, `np.int64(1)`, etc.\n    *   Modify comparisons: Instead of `if val != 0`, use logic that correctly evaluates the condition for numpy types (e.g., ensure scalar comparison).\n    *   Block identified: `value=1`, `start_index=2`, `length=2`.\n3.  **Calculate Shift:** `shift_distance = length = 2`.\n4.  **Calculate New Position:** `new_start_index = start_index - shift_distance = 2 - 2 = 0`.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a list of 12 zeros: `[0, 0, ..., 0]`. Place the block (value 1, length 2) starting at index 0.\n6.  **Result:** `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This matches the expected output.\n\nThis analysis applies similarly to all other examples, confirming the transformation rule holds once the type/comparison issue is resolved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
