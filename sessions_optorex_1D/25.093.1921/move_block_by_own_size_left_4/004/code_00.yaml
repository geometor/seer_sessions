task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers leftwards within a sequence, where the shift distance equals the block's length.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A fixed-length (12) 1D sequence of numbers, potentially represented as a list or NumPy array.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: List or 1D NumPy array of numeric types (integers).
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence composed of identical non-zero numbers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero scalar number composing the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
      - content: A sequence of identical non-zero numbers.
  - object: background
    description: Elements in the sequence that are not part of the non-zero block.
    properties:
      - value: Effectively 0.
relations:
  - type: contains
    subject: sequence
    object: block
  - type: contains
    subject: sequence
    object: background
actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Scan the input sequence to find the start index, scalar value, and length of the first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers. Handle potential NumPy types during comparison.
  - action: calculate_shift
    description: Determine the amount to shift the block leftwards.
    rule: shift_amount = block.length
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the new start index for the block in the output sequence.
    rule: new_start_index = max(0, block.start_index - shift_amount) # Ensure index is non-negative
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence (same length as input, initialized to zeros) by placing the identified block (using its value and length) at the new position.
input_state:
  - sequence: Contains one non-zero block and background zeros.
output_state:
  - sequence: Contains the same block shifted left by its length, surrounded by background zeros. Output format should match input format expectations (e.g., list of integers).
