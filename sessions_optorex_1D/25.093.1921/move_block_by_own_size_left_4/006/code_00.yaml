task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers leftwards within a sequence of zeros. The shift amount equals the block's length.
elements:
  - object: input_data
    description: The raw input provided to the transform function, likely a 2D NumPy array with one row.
    properties:
      - format: NumPy array
      - dimensions: 2 (e.g., shape (1, N))
      - N: 12 (based on examples)
  - object: sequence
    description: The effective 1D sequence of integers to be processed, extracted from the input_data (e.g., the first row).
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: sequence of integers
      - structure: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence composed of identical non-zero integers.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer composing the block (e.g., 1, 7, 8, 5, 6).
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the 1D sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
  - object: background
    description: Elements in the sequence that are not part of the non-zero block.
    properties:
      - value: Always 0.

    object: input_data # The 1D sequence is extracted from the input data structure
actions:
  - action: extract_1d_sequence
    description: Obtain the 1D sequence data from the potentially 2D input_data structure (e.g., select the first row).
  - action: identify_block
    description: Scan the extracted 1D sequence to find the start index, value, and length of the non-zero block.
  - action: calculate_shift
    description: Determine the amount to shift the block leftwards.
    rule: shift_amount = block.length
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the new start index for the block in the output sequence.
    rule: new_start_index = block.start_index - shift_amount
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence (as a 1D list of integers) by placing the identified block at the new position and filling the rest with zeros.
input_state:
  - input_data: A 2D NumPy array containing the sequence information in its first row.
output_state:
  - sequence: A 1D list containing the same block shifted left by its length, surrounded by background zeros.
