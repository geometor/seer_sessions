            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This error typically occurs in Python when a boolean check (like `if condition:`) is performed on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, as NumPy doesn't know whether to evaluate the condition based on *any* element being true or *all* elements being true.\n\nBased on the error message and the code structure (specifically the iteration within `find_non_zero_block`), it is highly probable that the `input_sequence` being passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment is not a 1D list or array, but rather a 2D NumPy array (likely with shape (1, 12)). When the code iterates through `input_sequence`, it gets the entire row (a 1D array) as `val`, leading to the ambiguous truth value error during comparisons like `val != 0`.\n\nThe core logic of identifying the non-zero block, calculating the shift based on its length, and constructing the output sequence appears sound based on the initial analysis. The strategy to resolve the error is to ensure the code operates on a 1D sequence. This involves adding a pre-processing step to extract the 1D data from the assumed 2D input array before passing it to the `find_non_zero_block` function or modifying the loop to access elements correctly.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nThe consistent error across all examples points to a structural mismatch between the expected input format (assumed 1D) and the actual input format (likely 2D NumPy array).\n\n*   **Input Data Structure:** Assumed to be a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, 1, 1, ...]])`).\n*   **Error Location:** The error occurs within the `find_non_zero_block` function during the loop `for i, val in enumerate(sequence):`, specifically at the boolean comparisons (`val != 0` or `val == block_value`) because `val` is an array (a row from the input) instead of a scalar number.\n*   **Core Logic Validity:** The underlying algorithm (find block -> calculate shift = length -> apply shift) seems correct for the task based on the input/output pairs. The failure is in data handling, not the transformation logic itself.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
