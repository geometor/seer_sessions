**General Assessment**

The previous code failed on all examples with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error typically occurs in Python when a boolean check (like `if condition:`) is performed on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, as NumPy doesn't know whether to evaluate the condition based on *any* element being true or *all* elements being true.

Based on the error message and the code structure (specifically the iteration within `find_non_zero_block`), it is highly probable that the `input_sequence` being passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment is not a 1D list or array, but rather a 2D NumPy array (likely with shape (1, 12)). When the code iterates through `input_sequence`, it gets the entire row (a 1D array) as `val`, leading to the ambiguous truth value error during comparisons like `val != 0`.

The core logic of identifying the non-zero block, calculating the shift based on its length, and constructing the output sequence appears sound based on the initial analysis. The strategy to resolve the error is to ensure the code operates on a 1D sequence. This involves adding a pre-processing step to extract the 1D data from the assumed 2D input array before passing it to the `find_non_zero_block` function or modifying the loop to access elements correctly.

**Gather Metrics**

The consistent error across all examples points to a structural mismatch between the expected input format (assumed 1D) and the actual input format (likely 2D NumPy array).

*   **Input Data Structure:** Assumed to be a 2D NumPy array (e.g., `np.array([[0, 0, 1, 1, ...]])`).
*   **Error Location:** The error occurs within the `find_non_zero_block` function during the loop `for i, val in enumerate(sequence):`, specifically at the boolean comparisons (`val != 0` or `val == block_value`) because `val` is an array (a row from the input) instead of a scalar number.
*   **Core Logic Validity:** The underlying algorithm (find block -> calculate shift = length -> apply shift) seems correct for the task based on the input/output pairs. The failure is in data handling, not the transformation logic itself.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input data, which is expected to be a 2D NumPy array containing the sequence in its first row.
2.  Extract the first row from the input data to get the 1D sequence of integers that needs processing. Let the length of this sequence be N.
3.  Initialize an output sequence (as a standard Python list) of length N, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the extracted 1D sequence to identify the contiguous block of identical, non-zero numbers. Record its non-zero value, its starting index within the 1D sequence, and its length (number of elements).
5.  If no such block is found, return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
6.  If a block is found, calculate the shift distance, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift distance from the block's original starting index. Ensure the new starting index is not less than 0 (it should be `max(0, original_start_index - shift_distance)`).
8.  Copy the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index. Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`, setting `output_sequence[new_start_index + i]` to `block_value`.
9.  Return the final output sequence (the 1D list).
