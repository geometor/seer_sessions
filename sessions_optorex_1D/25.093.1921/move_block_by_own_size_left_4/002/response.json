            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers leftwards by a distance equal to the block's length. The provided Python code implements this logic. However, the execution results show a consistent error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") across all examples. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data is being handled or compared within the code, likely related to interacting with NumPy arrays in boolean contexts where single values are expected. The transformation logic itself seems sound based on the examples, so the focus should be on correcting the implementation detail causing the error, likely within the `find_non_zero_block` function's comparison logic or assuming the input format passed to the function might be different than a simple list (e.g., a multi-dimensional array).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Use `tool_code` to re-examine the input structure and confirm the block properties (value, start, length) and the shift calculation for each example. This ensures the underlying transformation rule is correctly understood.\n2.  **Pinpoint Error Cause:** The error message points to comparing a multi-element array where a boolean is needed. Re-inspect the `find_non_zero_block` function, specifically the conditions `val != 0` and `val == block_value`. Ensure `val` is guaranteed to be a single integer element. If the input `sequence` received by the function is unexpectedly multi-dimensional, adjust the iteration or access method.\n3.  **Refine Implementation:** Modify the code to avoid the ambiguity error, ensuring comparisons are performed on scalar values.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the facts and natural language program to reflect any refined understanding, although the core logic is likely unchanged.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
