task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers leftwards within a fixed-length sequence of zeros. The magnitude of the shift is equal to the length of the block.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A fixed-length list (length 12) of integers. Passed as input and expected as output.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - type: list of integers (assumed, based on examples)
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the main sequence composed of identical, non-zero integers. There is assumed to be exactly one such block per input sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer composing the block (e.g., 1, 7, 8, 5, 6).
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of elements (cells) in the block.
      - content: A list of identical non-zero integers.
  - object: background
    description: Elements in the sequence that are not part of the non-zero block.
    properties:
      - value: Always 0.

actions:
  - action: identify_block
    description: Scan the input sequence to find the start index, value, and length of the single contiguous non-zero block.
  - action: calculate_shift_distance
    description: Determine the amount to shift the block leftwards.
    rule: shift_distance = block.length
  - action: calculate_new_start_index
    description: Determine the target starting index for the block in the output sequence.
    rule: new_start_index = block.start_index - shift_distance
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence by initializing it with zeros, then placing the identified block at the calculated new start index.
input_state:
  - sequence: contains exactly one non-zero block and background zeros.
output_state:
  - sequence: contains the same block shifted left by its length, surrounded by background zeros.
potential_issues:
  - Implementation_Error: Previous code execution failed with a NumPy ambiguity error, suggesting the input data type or comparison logic needs adjustment despite the core transformation logic being correct. The code needs to ensure it operates on scalar integers during comparisons.
