"""
Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers leftwards within a sequence. 
The input is assumed to be a 2D NumPy array where the sequence data is in the 
first row. The magnitude of the leftward shift is equal to the length of the 
non-zero block itself. The output should be a standard Python list of integers.
