Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
*   **Content:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros (0), with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `1 1`, `7 7`, `8 8 8 8`).
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. The block moves towards the left (beginning) of the sequence.
*   **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts seems related to the block itself. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output:
    *   `train_1`: `1 1` (len 2) moves from index 2 to 0 (shift 2).
    *   `train_2`: `7 7` (len 2) moves from index 8 to 6 (shift 2).
    *   `train_3`: `8 8 8 8` (len 4) moves from index 5 to 1 (shift 4).
    *   `train_4`: `8 8 8 8 8 8` (len 6) moves from index 6 to 0 (shift 6).
    *   `train_5`: `7` (len 1) moves from index 5 to 4 (shift 1).
    *   `train_6`: `5 5 5 5 5` (len 5) moves from index 5 to 0 (shift 5).
    *   `train_7`: `6 6 6 6 6` (len 5) moves from index 7 to 2 (shift 5).
*   **Rule:** The amount of leftward shift is equal to the *length* of the contiguous non-zero block.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers. Record its value, its starting index, and its length.
3.  Calculate the shift distance, which is equal to the length of the identified block.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting the shift distance from the original starting index.
5.  Copy the identified block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Return the modified output sequence.
