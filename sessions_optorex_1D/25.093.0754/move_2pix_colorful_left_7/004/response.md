**General Assessment:**

The execution results consistently show a `ValueError` related to NumPy array dimensions during concatenation. The error message `all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)` indicates that the input (`input_grid`) provided to the `transform` function is a 2D array (likely shape 1x12, based on the original data format), not a 1D array as initially assumed. The slicing operation `input_grid[shift_amount:]` on a 2D array preserves the 2D structure (resulting in a shape like 1x10), while the padding `np.full(shift_amount, pad_value, ...)` creates a 1D array (shape `(2,)`). Concatenating a 2D array and a 1D array horizontally (axis=1 implied by column operations) causes this error.

The strategy to resolve this is to ensure both parts being concatenated are 2D arrays. The padding needs to be created as a 2D array (shape 1x2) before concatenation. The core logic of shifting left by 2 and padding with zeros remains valid, but needs to be applied correctly to the 2D structure.

**Metrics:**

Based on the error message `array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s)` (referring to `shifted_part`) and `array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)` (referring to `padding`):

*   **Input Dimensionality:** The `input_grid` passed to the function is consistently 2D.
*   **Inferred Input Shape:** Given the original data (12 numbers), the most probable shape is (1, 12).
*   **`shifted_part` Dimensionality:** 2D (e.g., shape (1, 10) when shift_amount=2).
*   **`padding` Dimensionality (as created):** 1D (e.g., shape (2,)).
*   **Error Cause:** Attempting to concatenate a 2D array with a 1D array using `np.concatenate` without specifying an axis or when the dimensions mismatch for the intended axis.

actions:
  - name: shift_columns_left
    parameters:
      - target: input_grid
      - amount: 2 columns
    details:
      - Select all columns from the input_grid starting from index 2 (the third column).
      - Create a 2D padding array of shape (1, 2) filled with zeros.
      - Concatenate the selected columns and the padding array along the column axis (axis=1).
      - The result is the output_sequence.

  - name: format_as_string
    parameters:
      - target: output_sequence
    details:
      - Convert the elements of the 2D output_sequence (specifically, its single row) into strings.
      - Join these strings with spaces.
      - The result is the formatted_output.

relationship:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid (2D numpy array)
    output: formatted_output (string)
    rule: apply shift_columns_left to input_grid, then apply format_as_string to the result.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a two-dimensional grid (assumed shape 1 row, 12 columns) containing integers.
2.  Select the portion of the grid starting from the third column up to the last column.
3.  Create a new two-dimensional grid containing one row and two columns, filled with the integer 0.
4.  Concatenate the selected portion (from step 2) and the new zero-filled grid (from step 3) horizontally (along the columns), keeping the selected portion on the left and the zero-filled grid on the right. This forms the resulting 1x12 grid.
5.  Format the single row of the resulting grid into a string, with elements separated by single spaces.
6.  Output the formatted string.
