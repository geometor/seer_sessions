            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution results consistently show a `ValueError` related to NumPy array dimensions during concatenation. The error message `all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)` indicates that the input (`input_grid`) provided to the `transform` function is a 2D array (likely shape 1x12, based on the original data format), not a 1D array as initially assumed. The slicing operation `input_grid[shift_amount:]` on a 2D array preserves the 2D structure (resulting in a shape like 1x10), while the padding `np.full(shift_amount, pad_value, ...)` creates a 1D array (shape `(2,)`). Concatenating a 2D array and a 1D array horizontally (axis=1 implied by column operations) causes this error.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to ensure both parts being concatenated are 2D arrays. The padding needs to be created as a 2D array (shape 1x2) before concatenation. The core logic of shifting left by 2 and padding with zeros remains valid, but needs to be applied correctly to the 2D structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the error message `array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s)` (referring to `shifted_part`) and `array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)` (referring to `padding`):\n\n*   **Input Dimensionality:** The `input_grid` passed to the function is consistently 2D.\n*   **Inferred Input Shape:** Given the original data (12 numbers), the most probable shape is (1, 12).\n*   **`shifted_part` Dimensionality:** 2D (e.g., shape (1, 10) when shift_amount=2).\n*   **`padding` Dimensionality (as created):** 1D (e.g., shape (2,)).\n*   **Error Cause:** Attempting to concatenate a 2D array with a 1D array using `np.concatenate` without specifying an axis or when the dimensions mismatch for the intended axis.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
