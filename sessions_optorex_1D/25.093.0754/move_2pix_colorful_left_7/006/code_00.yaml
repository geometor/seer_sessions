input_object:
  type: grid # Assuming 2D NumPy array based on error context and common practices
  properties:
    shape: [1, 12] # Single row, 12 columns
    data_type: integer
    elements: Non-negative integers (0-9 observed)
output_object:
  type: grid # Corresponding output grid
  properties:
    shape: [1, 12]
    data_type: integer
    elements: Non-negative integers (0-9 observed)
transformation:
  action: column_shift_left
  parameters:
    shift_amount: 2 # Number of columns to shift/discard from the left
  details:
    - Select columns from index 2 (inclusive) to the end of the input grid.
    - Create a padding grid of shape [1, 2] filled with the integer 0.
    - Concatenate the selected columns and the padding grid along the column axis (axis=1).
output_format: string # Final output required by the task seems to be a string
properties:
  - space_separated: yes
  - elements: integers derived from the output grid's single row
relationship:
  - Input grid is transformed into the output grid using the column_shift_left action.
  - The output grid is then formatted into a space-separated string.
