Zeros appear frequently, often at the beginning or end.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs suggests a consistent positional shift. The content of the sequence seems to move towards the beginning (left shift).\n4.  **Shift Magnitude:** By comparing the position of identical non-zero numbers or patterns (e.g., `6` in train_1, `3 3` in train_2, `1 6` in train_6), the shift appears to be consistently 2 positions to the left.\n5.  **Handling Boundaries:** The first two elements of the input sequence are consistently absent from the start of the output sequence. The end of the output sequence is consistently padded with two zeros (`0 0`).\n6.  **Length Preservation:** Both input and output sequences maintain a length of 12.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
