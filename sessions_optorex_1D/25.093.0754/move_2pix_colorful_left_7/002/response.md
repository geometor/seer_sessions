**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function was designed to accept a string input (`input_str: str`) and parse it internally. However, the test environment provided the input directly as a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred within the `parse_input` function when it tried to call the string method `.strip()` on the NumPy array.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list-like object) directly, eliminating the need for string parsing. The core transformation logic—shifting elements left by two positions and padding with two zeros—remains the same but will operate directly on the input array/list. The output formatting step will convert the resulting list back to the required space-separated string format.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

The failed execution confirms the input data type issue but doesn't invalidate the core transformation pattern observed previously. All examples consistently show the first two elements being removed and two zeros being appended.

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (as inferred from the error).
*   **Input Shape:** (12,) for all examples.
*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a string of space-separated integers.
*   **Transformation Consistency:** A left shift by 2 positions with zero padding at the end holds true for all provided training examples based on visual inspection.

    parameters:
      - sequence: processed_sequence (list or array)
    details:
      - Convert the sequence elements to strings.
      - Join the string elements with a single space separator.
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence (numpy array)

    rule:
      - Apply shift_left_and_pad action to input_sequence.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Create a new sequence by taking all elements from the input sequence *starting from the third element* (index 2) up to the end.
3.  Append two integer zeros (`0`, `0`) to the end of this new sequence.
4.  Convert each integer in the resulting sequence to its string representation.
5.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces, to form the final output string.
