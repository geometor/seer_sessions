            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous execution failed because the `transform` function was designed to accept a string input (`input_str: str`) and parse it internally. However, the test environment provided the input directly as a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred within the `parse_input` function when it tried to call the string method `.strip()` on the NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list-like object) directly, eliminating the need for string parsing. The core transformation logic\u2014shifting elements left by two positions and padding with two zeros\u2014remains the same but will operate directly on the input array/list. The output formatting step will convert the resulting list back to the required space-separated string format.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nThe failed execution confirms the input data type issue but doesn't invalidate the core transformation pattern observed previously. All examples consistently show the first two elements being removed and two zeros being appended.\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (as inferred from the error).\n*   **Input Shape:** (12,) for all examples.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a string of space-separated integers.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** A left shift by 2 positions with zero padding at the end holds true for all provided training examples based on visual inspection.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"
