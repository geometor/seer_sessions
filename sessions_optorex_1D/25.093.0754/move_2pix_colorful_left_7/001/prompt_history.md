Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of a sequence of 12 integers, separated by spaces.
2.  **Content:** The sequences contain single-digit non-negative integers (0-9). Zeros appear frequently, often at the beginning or end.
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs suggests a consistent positional shift. The content of the sequence seems to move towards the beginning (left shift).
4.  **Shift Magnitude:** By comparing the position of identical non-zero numbers or patterns (e.g., `6` in train_1, `3 3` in train_2, `1 6` in train_6), the shift appears to be consistently 2 positions to the left.
5.  **Handling Boundaries:** The first two elements of the input sequence are consistently absent from the start of the output sequence. The end of the output sequence is consistently padded with two zeros (`0 0`).
6.  **Length Preservation:** Both input and output sequences maintain a length of 12.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers
      - length: 12
      - items: non-negative_integers (0-9 observed)
actions:
  - name: shift_left
    parameters:
      - amount: 2 positions
    details:
      - discard first 2 elements of the input sequence
      - append 2 zero elements to the end of the sequence
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: apply shift_left action to input_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Discard the first two integers from the sequence.
3.  Append two integers with the value 0 to the end of the remaining sequence.
4.  The resulting sequence of 12 integers is the output.
