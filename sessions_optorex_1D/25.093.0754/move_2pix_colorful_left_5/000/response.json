Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero numbers surrounded by zeros. The transformation shifts this block of non-zero numbers two positions to the left within the sequence. The overall length of the sequence remains constant. Zeros are used to fill the space vacated by the shift and maintain the sequence length. If shifting the block two positions left would move its start position before the beginning of the sequence (index 0), the block starts at index 0 instead.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the `end_index` of the non-zero block:\n    *   If a zero is found after the start of the block, the `end_index` is the index immediately preceding that zero.\n    *   If no zero is found after the start of the block (meaning the block runs to the end of the list), the `end_index` is the index of the last element in the list.\n5.  Extract the sub-list containing the non-zero block from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).\n6.  Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output list: `new_start_index = max(0, start_index - 2)`.\n7.  Construct the output list:\n    a.  Start with `new_start_index` zeros.\n    b.  Append the extracted non-zero block sub-list.\n    c.  Append enough trailing zeros so that the total length of the output list equals the length of the original input list.\n8.  Convert the output list back into a space-separated string and return it."
