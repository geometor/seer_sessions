objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The input and output data structures. Fixed length. Contains zeros and a single contiguous block of non-zero integers.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence (list of integers)
    description: The first contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
properties:
  - object: sequence
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The total number of elements in the sequence. Remains constant between input and output.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the first element of the non_zero_block in the input sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the last element of the non_zero_block in the input sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: content
    type: list of integers
    description: The actual non-zero integer values comprising the block.
actions:
  - name: find_block
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [non_zero_block, start_index, end_index]
    description: Identify the first contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero numbers and its start/end indices. Handles cases with no non-zero numbers.
  - name: calculate_new_position
    inputs: [start_index]
    outputs: [new_start_index]
    description: Calculate the target starting index for the non_zero_block in the output sequence by subtracting 2 from the original start_index, ensuring the result is not less than 0.
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    inputs: [original_length, new_start_index, non_zero_block_content]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    description: Create the output sequence by placing zeros up to the new_start_index, appending the non_zero_block_content, and padding with zeros to match the original_length.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output sequence is generated by shifting the non_zero_block from the input sequence two positions to the left (clamped at index 0) and padding with zeros.
