objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array
    description: A grid with shape (1, N), containing integers. The single row holds zeros and typically one contiguous block of non-zero integers.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array
    description: A grid with the same shape as input_grid, representing the transformed state.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: 1D NumPy array
    description: A sequence of contiguous non-zero integers extracted from the input_grid's first row.
properties:
  - object: input_grid
    name: shape
    type: tuple (integer, integer)
    description: The dimensions of the grid, typically (1, N). N=12 in examples.
  - object: input_grid
    name: row
    type: 1D NumPy array
    description: The first (and only) row of the input grid (input_grid[0]).
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: start_col_index
    type: integer
    description: The column index where the non_zero_block begins in the input_grid's row. -1 if no block exists.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: end_col_index
    type: integer
    description: The column index where the non_zero_block ends in the input_grid's row. -1 if no block exists.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the non_zero_block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: content
    type: 1D NumPy array
    description: The actual non-zero integer values comprising the block.
  - object: output_grid
    name: shape
    type: tuple (integer, integer)
    description: The dimensions of the output grid, identical to the input_grid shape.
actions:
  - name: find_block_in_row
    inputs: [grid_row (1D array)]
    outputs: [start_col_index, end_col_index, block_content (1D array)]
    description: Identify the first contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero numbers within the given row and return its start/end column indices and content. Returns (-1, -1, empty_array) if no non-zero numbers are found.
  - name: calculate_new_start_column
    inputs: [start_col_index]
    outputs: [new_start_col_index]
    description: Calculate the target starting column index for the non_zero_block in the output_grid by subtracting 2 from the original start_col_index, ensuring the result is not less than 0.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    inputs: [original_shape (tuple), new_start_col_index, non_zero_block_content (1D array)]
    outputs: [output_grid (2D array)]
    description: Create the output_grid of the original_shape, filled with zeros. Place the non_zero_block_content into the first row of the output_grid, starting at the new_start_col_index. Ensure the block placement respects the grid boundaries.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output_grid is generated by taking the non_zero_block from the input_grid's first row, shifting it two column positions to the left (clamped at column index 0), and placing it into the first row of an otherwise zero-filled grid of the same shape.
