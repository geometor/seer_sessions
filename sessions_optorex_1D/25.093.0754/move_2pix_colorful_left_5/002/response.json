            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input `transform` function would be a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the function is actually receiving a NumPy array as input in the execution environment.\n\nThe core logic of the transformation (identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shifting it left by two positions, clamped at index 0) appears correct based on the input/output examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the program to accept a NumPy array (or a list-like structure) directly, removing the initial string parsing step. The subsequent steps of finding the block, calculating the new position, and reconstructing the output array need to operate on this array/list input.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples:\n\n| Example | Input Length | Output Length | Input Block      | Input Start Index | Output Start Index | Calculated Shift | Block Content Preserved? |\n| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------- |\n| 1       | 12           | 12            | `[4, 5]`         | 3                 | 1                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 2       | 12           | 12            | `[5]`            | 3                 | 1                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 3       | 12           | 12            | `[5 6 3 4 1 4 7]`| 4                 | 2                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 4       | 12           | 12            | `[5 4 8]`        | 2                 | 0                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 5       | 12           | 12            | `[3 1]`          | 10                | 8                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 6       | 12           | 12            | `[4 7 7 7]`      | 7                 | 5                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n| 7       | 12           | 12            | `[5 2 5 6 8]`    | 3                 | 1                  | -2               | Yes                      |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n*   All input and output sequences have a length of 12.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero integers.\n*   The non-zero block's content is preserved in the output.\n*   The block is shifted left by 2 positions.\n*   If shifting left by 2 would result in a negative start index, the block starts at index 0 (as seen in example 4).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Record the length of the input sequence (`original_length`).\n3.  Find the index of the first non-zero integer (`start_index`). If no non-zero integers are found in the sequence, return a sequence of the same length containing only zeros (or return the input sequence as is, assuming it would already be all zeros).\n4.  Starting from `start_index`, find the index (`end_index`) of the last contiguous non-zero integer in the block. This can be done by iterating from `start_index` until either a zero is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached. The `end_index` is the index of the last non-zero number found in this contiguous block.\n5.  Extract the sub-sequence containing the non-zero block (`non_zero_block_content`) from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).\n6.  Calculate the new starting position for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = max(0, start_index - 2)`.\n7.  Create a new sequence (`output_sequence`) of the `original_length`, initialized with zeros.\n8.  Place the `non_zero_block_content` into the `output_sequence` starting at `new_start_index`. Iterate through the `non_zero_block_content` and assign its elements to the `output_sequence` at indices `new_start_index`, `new_start_index + 1`, and so on, up to the length of the block.\n9.  Return the `output_sequence`."
