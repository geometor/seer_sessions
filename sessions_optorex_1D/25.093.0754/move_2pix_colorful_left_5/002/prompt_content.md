"""
Transforms an input sequence of space-separated integers by finding the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shifting it two positions to the left. The shift is clamped at the beginning of the sequence (index 0). The sequence length is maintained by padding with zeros. If no non-zero block exists, the original sequence is returned.
