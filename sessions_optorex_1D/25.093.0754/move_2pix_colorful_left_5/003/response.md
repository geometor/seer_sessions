"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or array) of integers by finding the first 
contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shifting it two positions to the left. 
The shift is clamped at the beginning of the sequence (index 0). The sequence 
length is maintained, and vacated positions are filled with zeros. If no 
non-zero block exists, a sequence of zeros of the same length is returned.
