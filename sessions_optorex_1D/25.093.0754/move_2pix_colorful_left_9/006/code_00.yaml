Task: NumPy Array Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Dimension: 1D
    - dtype: Integer
    - Variable length (across different examples, but fixed within an example pair)
    - Order matters

Output:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Properties:
    - Dimension: 1D
    - dtype: Integer
    - Same length as the corresponding input array
    - Contains the same integer elements as the input array

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: >
    Perform a left cyclic shift on the input 1D NumPy array by 2 positions.
    The first two elements of the input array are moved to the end of the array,
    maintaining their relative order. The subsequent elements shift two positions
    to the left to fill the vacated spots.
  Implementation Notes: Can be achieved using NumPy slicing and concatenation. For an array `arr`, the transformation is equivalent to `np.concatenate((arr[2:], arr[:2]))`, provided the array has at least 2 elements. If the array has fewer than 2 elements, it remains unchanged.
