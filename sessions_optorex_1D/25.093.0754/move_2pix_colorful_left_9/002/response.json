            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic as a left cyclic shift (rotation) by two positions. However, it incorrectly assumed the input format was a space-separated string. The execution errors (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) across all examples consistently indicate that the input data type is actually a NumPy array (or an object behaving like one, such as a list, that gets converted before processing by the execution environment).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the understanding of the input data type to be a sequence-like object (like a list or NumPy array) rather than a string.\n2.  Maintain the core transformation logic (left cyclic shift by 2).\n3.  Update the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to use list/array indexing, slicing, and concatenation instead of string methods.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** Consistently identified as `numpy.ndarray` by the execution environment error messages across all 7 training examples and the test example.\n*   **Output Data Type:** Assumed to be the same type as the input (NumPy array or similar sequence).\n*   **Transformation Rule Consistency:** Visual inspection confirms that in all provided examples, the output is formed by taking the first two elements of the input sequence and appending them to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining elements. This holds true regardless of the specific digit values or their distribution (e.g., number of leading zeros).\n*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant from input to output in all examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
