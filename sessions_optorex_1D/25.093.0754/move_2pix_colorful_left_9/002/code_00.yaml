Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence (likely NumPy array or list)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear sequence/array
  Properties:
    - Order matters
    - Fixed length (within a single example pair)

Output:
  Type: Sequence (same type as input)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear sequence/array
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same elements as input, but reordered

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: The sequence undergoes a left cyclic shift by two positions. The first two elements are moved to the end of the sequence, maintaining their relative order, while the remaining elements shift two positions towards the beginning.
