"""
Performs a left cyclic shift (rotation) of a sequence of elements by two positions.
The input is assumed to be a sequence-like object (e.g., list or NumPy array).
The first two elements are moved to the end of the sequence, maintaining their 
relative order, and the remaining elements shift left. The output is the 
transformed sequence of the same type.
