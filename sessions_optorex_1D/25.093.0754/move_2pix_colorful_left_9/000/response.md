Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences of single digits, presented as space-separated strings.
*   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence for all examples.
*   The digits themselves are preserved; no digits are added, removed, or changed in value.
*   The relative order of most digits seems preserved, but their positions shift.
*   Comparing inputs and outputs, it appears the first two digits of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence in the output, maintaining their order relative to each other. This constitutes a left cyclic shift (or rotation) by two positions.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Fixed length (within a single example pair)
    - Order matters

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same digits as input

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: The first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, preserving their relative order, to form the output sequence. The remaining elements shift two positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Take the first element from the input sequence.
3.  Take the second element from the input sequence.
4.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the input sequence starting from the third element up to the last element.
5.  Append the first element (saved in step 2) to the end of the new sequence.
6.  Append the second element (saved in step 3) to the end of the new sequence.
7.  The resulting sequence is the output.
