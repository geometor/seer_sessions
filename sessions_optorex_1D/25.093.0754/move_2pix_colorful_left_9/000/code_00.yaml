Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Fixed length (within a single example pair)
    - Order matters

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer (single digit)
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Contains the same digits as input

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: The first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, preserving their relative order, to form the output sequence. The remaining elements shift two positions to the left.
