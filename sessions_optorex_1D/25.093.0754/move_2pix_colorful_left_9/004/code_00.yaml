Task: Sequence Cyclic Shift

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Format: String, space-separated
  Elements:
    Type: Character (representing single digits '0'-'9')
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Fixed length within a single example (all observed examples have length 12).
    - Order is significant.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Format: String, space-separated
  Elements:
    Type: Character (representing single digits '0'-'9')
  Structure: Linear list
  Properties:
    - Same length as the corresponding input sequence.
    - Contains the exact same elements (digits) as the input, but rearranged.
    - Order is significant.

Transformation:
  Name: Left Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Object: The entire input sequence.
  Action:
    1. Identify the first two elements of the input sequence.
    2. Identify the remaining elements of the input sequence (from the third element to the end).
    3. Construct the output sequence by concatenating the remaining elements (from step 2) followed by the first two elements (from step 1), preserving the internal order of both subsequences.
  Input-Output Element Mapping:
    - Input element at index `i` (where `i >= 2`) maps to output element at index `i - 2`.
    - Input element at index `0` maps to output element at index `n - 2` (where `n` is sequence length).
    - Input element at index `1` maps to output element at index `n - 1`.

Example (train_1):
  Input:  ['0', '0', '0', '9', '6', '7', '5', '1', '5', '7', '5', '0']
  Step 1 (First Two): ['0', '0']
  Step 2 (Remaining): ['0', '9', '6', '7', '5', '1', '5', '7', '5', '0']
  Step 3 (Concatenate): ['0', '9', '6', '7', '5', '1', '5', '7', '5', '0'] + ['0', '0']
  Output: ['0', '9', '6', '7', '5', '1', '5', '7', '5', '0', '0', '0']
