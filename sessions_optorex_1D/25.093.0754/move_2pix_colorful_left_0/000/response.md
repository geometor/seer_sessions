Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.
2.  **Key Feature:** The inputs contain sequences of zeros, typically at the beginning and sometimes at the end. There is a contiguous "block" of interest within the list which starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit. This block can contain zeros within it.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a shift of this identified "content block". By comparing the position of this block in the input and output, it seems the block is moved two positions to the left. The relative order of elements within the block remains unchanged. The remaining positions in the output list are filled with zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input list of integers.
2.  Initialize the output list as a list of zeros with the same length as the input list.
3.  Find the index of the first non-zero element in the input list. If no non-zero element exists, return the initialized output list (all zeros). Let this index be `first_nz_index`.
4.  Find the index of the last non-zero element in the input list. Let this index be `last_nz_index`.
5.  Extract the sub-sequence (the "content block") from the input list starting at `first_nz_index` and ending at `last_nz_index` (inclusive).
6.  Calculate the target starting index for this content block in the output list by subtracting 2 from `first_nz_index`. Let this be `target_start_index`. Ensure `target_start_index` is not less than 0 (although based on examples, it seems the minimum `first_nz_index` encountered is 2, resulting in a minimum `target_start_index` of 0).
7.  Place the extracted content block into the output list, starting at the calculated `target_start_index`. The elements of the content block overwrite the zeros at those positions in the output list.
8.  Return the modified output list.
