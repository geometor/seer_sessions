The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.\n2.  **Key Feature:** The inputs contain sequences of zeros, typically at the beginning and sometimes at the end. There is a contiguous \"block\" of interest within the list which starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit. This block can contain zeros within it.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a shift of this identified \"content block\". By comparing the position of this block in the input and output, it seems the block is moved two positions to the left. The relative order of elements within the block remains unchanged. The remaining positions in the output list are filled with zeros.\n\n**Fact Analysis:**\n\n"

Ensure `target_start_index` is not less than 0 (although based on examples, it seems the minimum `first_nz_index` encountered is 2, resulting in a minimum `target_start_index` of 0).\n7.
