objects:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: list of integers
      - name: length
        value: constant (12 in examples)
        constraints: must be >= 2 for rotation to be distinct
      - name: element_types
        values: [zero, non-zero] # Note: element values don't affect the operation
actions:
  - name: rotate_left
    target: sequence
    properties:
      - name: shift_amount
        value: 2
        type: integer
    description: Performs a circular shift of all elements to the left by a fixed amount.
    details:
      - The element at index `i` moves to index `(i - shift_amount) % length`.
      - The first `shift_amount` elements wrap around to the end of the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: input_output_relation
    rule: output is the input sequence rotated left by 2 positions.
  - type: element_preservation
    description: All elements from the input are present in the output.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative cyclical order of elements is preserved.
