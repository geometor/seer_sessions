Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

*   The input and output are both single-line sequences of integers separated by spaces.
*   The sequences contain both zero (0) and non-zero digits (1-9).
*   The length of the input sequence seems to be consistent (12 elements in all examples). The output sequence also has the same length.
*   Comparing input and output, the non-zero elements and some of the zero elements maintain their relative order, but their absolute positions shift.
*   Specifically, it appears that the first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the very end of the sequence to produce the output. In all provided examples, these first two elements happen to be zeros.

    details:
      - Move the element at index 0 of the input sequence to the end of the output sequence.
      - Move the element at index 1 of the input sequence to the new end of the output sequence (after the previously moved element).
      - Preserve the relative order of the remaining elements (from index 2 onwards) from the input sequence in the beginning of the output sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the first element (at index 0) and the second element (at index 1).
3.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the third element (index 2) to the end of the original input sequence, preserving their order.
4.  Append the first element identified in step 2 to the end of the new sequence.
5.  Append the second element identified in step 2 to the end of the new sequence.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
