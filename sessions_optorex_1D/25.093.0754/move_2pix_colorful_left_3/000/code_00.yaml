objects:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: list of integers
      - name: length
        value: constant (12 in examples)
      - name: element_types
        values: [zero, non-zero]
actions:
  - name: move_elements
    source: sequence
    target: sequence
    details:
      - Move the element at index 0 of the input sequence to the end of the output sequence.
      - Move the element at index 1 of the input sequence to the new end of the output sequence (after the previously moved element).
      - Preserve the relative order of the remaining elements (from index 2 onwards) from the input sequence in the beginning of the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    description: The first two elements are relocated to the end.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of elements starting from the third element (index 2) is maintained.
