The output sequence also has the same length.\n*   Comparing input and output, the non-zero elements and some of the zero elements maintain their relative order, but their absolute positions shift.\n*   Specifically, it appears that the first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the very end of the sequence to produce the output. In all provided examples, these first two elements happen to be zeros.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
