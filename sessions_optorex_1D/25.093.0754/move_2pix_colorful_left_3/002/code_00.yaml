objects:
  - type: sequence # Represented as a NumPy array
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: numpy.ndarray
        dtype: integer
      - name: length
        value: 12 # Based on examples
      - name: element_types
        values: [zero, non-zero integers]
actions:
  - name: move_elements
    source: input NumPy array
    target: output NumPy array
    details:
      - Identify the elements at index 0 and index 1 of the input array.
      - Create a new sequence (array or list) containing elements from index 2 to the end of the input array, preserving their order.
      - Append the element originally at index 0 to the end of the new sequence.
      - Append the element originally at index 1 to the end of the new sequence.
      - Convert the final sequence back to a NumPy array if necessary (depending on intermediate steps).
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    description: The first two elements of the input array are relocated to the end of the output array.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of elements starting from the third element (index 2) is maintained in the output array.
