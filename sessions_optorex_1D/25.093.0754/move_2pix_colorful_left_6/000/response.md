Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of sequences of integers, presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** All examples show sequences of length 12. The output sequence maintains the same length as the input.
*   **Core Transformation:** The primary operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the left.
*   **Shift Amount:** Comparing the positions of identical numbers (especially the non-zero blocks) between input and output reveals a consistent left shift by 2 positions.
*   **Handling Boundaries:**
    *   The first two elements of the input sequence are effectively discarded.
    *   The last two positions of the output sequence are always filled with zeros, regardless of the input values that were shifted out from the end.
*   **Element Preservation:** The relative order and values of the elements *after* the first two positions in the input are preserved in the output, just shifted two places earlier.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: InputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: elements to be transformed
  - object: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: same as InputSequence
      - contains: transformed elements
  - object: Zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding element
actions:
  - name: ShiftLeft
    parameters:
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - amount: 2 positions
    description: Moves elements starting from the 3rd position (index 2) of the InputSequence to the beginning (index 0) of the OutputSequence.
  - name: PadEnd
    parameters:
      - sequence: OutputSequence
      - element: Zero
      - count: 2
    description: Fills the last two positions of the OutputSequence with the Zero element.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: InputSequence
    to: OutputSequence
    rule: Apply ShiftLeft by 2, then PadEnd with 2 Zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Create a new sequence, initially empty, which will become the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the element at index 2 (the third element) up to the last element.
4.  For each element considered in step 3, append it to the new output sequence.
5.  Append two zeros to the end of the new output sequence.
6.  Return the completed output sequence.
