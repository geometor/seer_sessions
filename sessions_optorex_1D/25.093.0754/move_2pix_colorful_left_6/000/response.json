The output sequence maintains the same length as the input.\n*   **Core Transformation:** The primary operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the left.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Comparing the positions of identical numbers (especially the non-zero blocks) between input and output reveals a consistent left shift by 2 positions.\n*   **Handling Boundaries:**\n    *   The first two elements of the input sequence are effectively discarded.\n    *   The last two positions of the output sequence are always filled with zeros, regardless of the input values that were shifted out from the end.\n*   **Element Preservation:** The relative order and values of the elements *after* the first two positions in the input are preserved in the output, just shifted two places earlier.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
