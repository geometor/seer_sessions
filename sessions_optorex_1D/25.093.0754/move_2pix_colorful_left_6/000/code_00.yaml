task_elements:
  - object: InputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: elements to be transformed
  - object: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: same as InputSequence
      - contains: transformed elements
  - object: Zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding element
actions:
  - name: ShiftLeft
    parameters:
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - amount: 2 positions
    description: Moves elements starting from the 3rd position (index 2) of the InputSequence to the beginning (index 0) of the OutputSequence.
  - name: PadEnd
    parameters:
      - sequence: OutputSequence
      - element: Zero
      - count: 2
    description: Fills the last two positions of the OutputSequence with the Zero element.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: InputSequence
    to: OutputSequence
    rule: Apply ShiftLeft by 2, then PadEnd with 2 Zeros.
