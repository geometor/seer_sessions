Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of sequences of integers, presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** All examples show sequences of length 12. The output sequence maintains the same length as the input.
*   **Core Transformation:** The primary operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the left.
*   **Shift Amount:** Comparing the positions of identical numbers (especially the non-zero blocks) between input and output reveals a consistent left shift by 2 positions.
*   **Handling Boundaries:**
    *   The first two elements of the input sequence are effectively discarded.
    *   The last two positions of the output sequence are always filled with zeros, regardless of the input values that were shifted out from the end.
*   **Element Preservation:** The relative order and values of the elements *after* the first two positions in the input are preserved in the output, just shifted two places earlier.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
**General Assessment:**

The execution results consistently show a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This error occurs because the provided `transform` function expects a string input (`input_str`) which it then parses. However, the testing environment appears to be passing the input directly as a NumPy array.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`parse_input_string`) and string formatting (`format_output_list`) within the core transformation logic. The fundamental transformation rule (left shift by 2, append two zeros) observed previously seems correct and doesn't need revision based on this error type.

**Gather Metrics:**

The errors occurred before any transformation logic could be applied, specifically during the input parsing phase. This indicates a mismatch between the expected input format (string) and the actual input format (NumPy array) in the testing environment for all examples.

To confirm the input type:

All inputs are numpy.ndarray: True

```
**Findings:**

*   The input format provided by the execution environment is consistently `numpy.ndarray`.
*   All provided input examples have a length of 12.
*   All provided output examples also have a length of 12.
*   The transformation preserves the sequence length.
