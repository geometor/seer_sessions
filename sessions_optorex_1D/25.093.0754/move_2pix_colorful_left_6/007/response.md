"""
Transforms an input sequence (NumPy array of integers) by:
1. Selecting elements starting from the third element (index 2) to the end.
2. Appending two integer zeros (0, 0) to the end of this selection.
3. Returning the resulting sequence as a list of integers. The output sequence will have the same length as the input sequence (assuming input length >= 2).
