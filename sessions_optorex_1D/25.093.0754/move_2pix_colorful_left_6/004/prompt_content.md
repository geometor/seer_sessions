"""
Takes an input sequence (list or array of integers), creates a new sequence by selecting elements starting from the third element (index 2) of the input sequence to the end, and then appends two integer zeros (0) to the end of this new sequence. The resulting sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
"""

def transform(input_sequence):
    """
    Applies a left shift of 2 positions to the input sequence, padding the end with two zeros.

    Args:
        input_sequence: A list or NumPy array of integers representing the input sequence.

    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the transformed output sequence.
