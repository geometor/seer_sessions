task_elements:
  - object: InputString
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: space-separated integers
      - length: variable sequence of digits, examples show 12 integers
      - role: data to be transformed
  - object: OutputString
    properties:
      - type: string
      - format: space-separated integers
      - length: same number of integers as InputString (12 in examples)
      - role: result of transformation
  - object: IntegerSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - role: intermediate representation derived from InputString
  - object: SubSequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - role: extracted portion of IntegerSequence
      - source: elements from index 2 to the end of IntegerSequence
  - object: PaddingZeros
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - value: [0, 0]
      - role: elements to append
actions:
  - name: ParseString
    parameters:
      - input: InputString
    output: IntegerSequence
    description: Convert the space-separated string of integers into a list of integers.
  - name: ExtractSubsequence
    parameters:
      - sequence: IntegerSequence
      - start_index: 2
    output: SubSequence
    description: Create a new sequence containing elements from the input sequence starting at index 2 (the third element) up to the end.
  - name: AppendPadding
    parameters:
      - sequence: SubSequence
      - padding: PaddingZeros
    output: TransformedSequence (list of integers)
    description: Concatenate the SubSequence with the PaddingZeros list.
  - name: FormatString
    parameters:
      - sequence: TransformedSequence
    output: OutputString
    description: Convert the list of integers back into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation_pipeline
    steps:
      - ParseString(InputString) -> IntegerSequence
      - ExtractSubsequence(IntegerSequence) -> SubSequence
      - AppendPadding(SubSequence, PaddingZeros) -> TransformedSequence
      - FormatString(TransformedSequence) -> OutputString
    rule: The overall transformation involves parsing the input string, extracting a subsequence starting from the third element, appending two zeros, and formatting the result back into a string.
