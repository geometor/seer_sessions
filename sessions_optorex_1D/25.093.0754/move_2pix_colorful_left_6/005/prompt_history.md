Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output consist of sequences of integers, presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** All examples show sequences of length 12. The output sequence maintains the same length as the input.
*   **Core Transformation:** The primary operation appears to be a shift of the sequence elements to the left.
*   **Shift Amount:** Comparing the positions of identical numbers (especially the non-zero blocks) between input and output reveals a consistent left shift by 2 positions.
*   **Handling Boundaries:**
    *   The first two elements of the input sequence are effectively discarded.
    *   The last two positions of the output sequence are always filled with zeros, regardless of the input values that were shifted out from the end.
*   **Element Preservation:** The relative order and values of the elements *after* the first two positions in the input are preserved in the output, just shifted two places earlier.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided results indicate a complete failure of the previous code (`code_00.py`) across all training and test examples. The transformed output was consistently `0 0`, which is drastically different from the expected outputs.

*   **Observation:** The expected outputs consistently show a pattern where the input sequence, starting from the third element (index 2), forms the beginning of the output sequence, followed by two zeros (`0 0`) appended at the end. The total length of the sequence remains 12.
*   **Hypothesis:** The core logic identified previously (left shift by 2, pad with two zeros) appears correct based on visually comparing inputs and expected outputs. The failure likely stems from an implementation error in `code_00.py`, specifically related to how the output sequence was constructed or returned. The code returned a list `[0, 0]` instead of the correctly shifted and padded sequence formatted as a string.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Confirm the transformation rule by re-analyzing the input/output pairs.
    2.  Generate metrics quantifying the discrepancy caused by the incorrect code output.
    3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be precise about the transformation steps and the required input/output *format* (space-separated strings).
    4.  The next step (coder phase) will require correcting the implementation to properly perform the sequence slicing, concatenation, and string formatting.

**Metrics Summary:**

The code execution confirms the observations:
*   **Match:** All examples failed (`match: false`).
*   **Size Correct:** All examples produced outputs of the wrong size (`size_correct: false`).
*   **Length:** Expected length was consistently 12, while the actual output length was consistently 2. The `length_difference` was 10 for all examples.

This strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation logic was sound, but the implementation failed to produce the full sequence and format it correctly.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the **input string**, which contains a sequence of space-separated integers.
2.  **Parse** the input string into a **list of integers**.
3.  Create a **new list** by taking a **slice** of the integer list, starting from the element at **index 2** (the third element) and continuing to the **end** of the list.
4.  **Append** two integer zeros (`0`, `0`) to the end of this new list.
5.  **Format** the resulting list of integers back into a **space-separated string**.
6.  Return the formatted output string.
