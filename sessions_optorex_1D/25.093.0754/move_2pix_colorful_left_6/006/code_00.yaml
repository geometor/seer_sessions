task_elements:
  - object: InputSequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray # Updated type
      - dtype: integer
      - length: 12
      - contains: elements to be transformed
  - object: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list # Output type expected by coder phase often a list
      - dtype: integer
      - length: 12
      - contains: transformed elements
  - object: Zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding element
actions:
  - name: SliceSequence
    parameters:
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - start_index: 2 # Corresponds to the third element
    description: Creates a new sequence containing elements from the InputSequence starting from the element at index 2 up to the end.
  - name: AppendPadding
    parameters:
      - sequence: Result of SliceSequence
      - element: Zero
      - count: 2
    description: Appends two Zero elements to the end of the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: InputSequence
    to: OutputSequence
    rule: Apply SliceSequence (start_index=2), then AppendPadding (element=Zero, count=2). The result is the OutputSequence.
