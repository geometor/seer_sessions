task_elements:
  - object: InputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list or array of integers # Updated based on error
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - contains: elements to be transformed
  - object: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - type: list or array of integers # Assuming consistent type
      - length: 12 (same as InputSequence)
      - contains: transformed elements
  - object: Zero
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0
      - role: padding element
actions:
  - name: SelectSubsequence
    parameters:
      - sequence: InputSequence
      - start_index: 2 # 0-based index
    description: Extracts elements from the InputSequence starting from the third element (index 2) to the end.
  - name: PadEnd
    parameters:
      - sequence: Result of SelectSubsequence
      - element: Zero
      - count: 2
    description: Appends two Zero elements to the end of the selected subsequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: InputSequence
    to: OutputSequence
    rule: Apply SelectSubsequence (start_index=2), then PadEnd with 2 Zeros. The final OutputSequence has the same length as the InputSequence.
