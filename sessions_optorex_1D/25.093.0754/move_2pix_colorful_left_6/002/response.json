However, the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array, causing the string manipulation methods (`strip`, `split`) to fail.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (a left shift by 2 positions, discarding the first two elements, and appending two zeros at the end) appears consistent across all examples.\n\nThe strategy is to adjust the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to directly handle the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers, eliminating the unnecessary string parsing steps.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe execution errors prevent metrics generation from the failed code. However, visual analysis and simulation confirm the transformation pattern:\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (inferred from error message).\n*   **Output Type Requirement:** Assumed to be NumPy array or list of integers for the testing environment.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.\n*   **Transformation:** Left shift by 2 positions.\n*   **Elements Removed:** The first 2 elements of the input sequence.\n*   **Elements Added:** 2 zero elements appended to the end.\n\nLet's simulate the intended logic on `train_2` using `tool_code`:\nInput: `[0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 6, 1, 6, 7, 8, 0]`\nExpected Output: `[1, 3, 3, 2, 6, 1, 6, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0]`\n"
