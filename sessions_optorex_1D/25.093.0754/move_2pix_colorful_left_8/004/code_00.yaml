Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string or 1D numpy array
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string or 1D numpy array
Transformation:
  type: positional_shift
  subtype: circular_rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 2 # Constant shift value
Relationships:
  - conservation_of_elements: All elements from the input are present in the output with the same frequency.
  - fixed_length: Input and output sequences have the same length (12).
  - rule: The output sequence is generated by performing a left circular rotation of the input sequence by 2 positions. The elements originally at indices 0 and 1 are moved to indices 10 and 11, respectively, and all other elements shift two positions to the left.
