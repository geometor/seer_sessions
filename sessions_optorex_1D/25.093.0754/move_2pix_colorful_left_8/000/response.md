Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces. It's helpful to think of these as lists or arrays of numbers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, the input and output sequences have the same length (12 elements).
3.  **Element Conservation:** All the numbers present in the input sequence are also present in the output sequence, and their counts remain the same. No numbers are added or removed.
4.  **Positional Changes:** The positions of the numbers change between the input and output. Comparing the sequences, it looks like elements from the beginning of the input sequence have moved to the end of the output sequence.
5.  **Consistent Shift:** Observing the shift across multiple examples (e.g., comparing where the first non-zero element starts in the input vs. the output, or just tracking the first few elements), there appears to be a consistent pattern. In `train_1`, `0 0` moves from the start to the end. In `train_2`, `0 0` moves from the start to the end. In `train_4`, `0 0` moves from the start to the end. This suggests a fixed shift amount. Testing this across all examples confirms that the first two elements consistently move to the end.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string
Transformation:
  type: positional_shift
  subtype: rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 2
Relationships:
  - conservation_of_elements: All elements from the input are present in the output with the same frequency.
  - fixed_length: Input and output sequences have the same length.
  - rule: The output sequence is generated by rotating the input sequence 2 positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Take the first two numbers from the beginning of the sequence.
3.  Take the remaining numbers (from the third number to the end) of the sequence.
4.  Concatenate the remaining numbers followed by the first two numbers.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
