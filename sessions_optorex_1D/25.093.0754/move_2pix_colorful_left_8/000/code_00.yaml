Input:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string
Output:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: space-separated string
Transformation:
  type: positional_shift
  subtype: rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 2
Relationships:
  - conservation_of_elements: All elements from the input are present in the output with the same frequency.
  - fixed_length: Input and output sequences have the same length.
  - rule: The output sequence is generated by rotating the input sequence 2 positions to the left.
