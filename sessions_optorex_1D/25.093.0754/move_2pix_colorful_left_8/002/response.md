**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation rule: a left rotation of the input sequence by two positions. However, it incorrectly assumed the input and output format was a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function receives a NumPy array as input, not a string.

The strategy for resolving the error is to modify the implementation to handle NumPy arrays directly, removing the string parsing and formatting steps. The underlying rotation logic remains the same but will be implemented using NumPy array slicing and concatenation.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The error occurs at the very beginning of the `transform` function within the `parse_input_string` helper. This prevents the execution of the core rotation logic and the gathering of metrics related to the transformation itself using the previous code.

However, we can deduce the following from the error and the problem description:

*   **Input Type:** The input to the `transform` function is consistently a NumPy array.
*   **Output Type:** Although not directly observed due to the error, the comparison framework likely expects the output to also be a NumPy array, consistent with the input type.
*   **Sequence Length:** Based on the visual inspection of the examples provided initially, all input sequences have a length of 12. This is assumed to remain constant.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** Visual inspection confirms that in all examples, the first two elements of the input array are moved to the end to produce the output array. This corresponds to a left rotation by 2 positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: numpy_array
  element_type: integer
  shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12
Output:
  type: numpy_array
  element_type: integer
  shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12
Transformation:
  type: positional_shift
  subtype: rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 2
Relationships:
  - conservation_of_elements: All elements from the input array are present in the output array with the same frequency.
  - fixed_length: Input and output arrays have the same length (12).
  - rule: The output array is generated by rotating the input array 2 positions to the left. Elements at index 0 and 1 are moved to the end of the array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Identify the first two elements of the input array (at indices 0 and 1).
3.  Identify the remaining elements of the input array (from index 2 to the end).
4.  Construct the output array by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first two elements.
5.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
