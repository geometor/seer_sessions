Input:
  type: numpy_array
  element_type: integer
  shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12
Output:
  type: numpy_array
  element_type: integer
  shape: (12,) # Assuming a 1D array of length 12
Transformation:
  type: positional_shift
  subtype: rotation
  direction: left
  amount: 2
Relationships:
  - conservation_of_elements: All elements from the input array are present in the output array with the same frequency.
  - fixed_length: Input and output arrays have the same length (12).
  - rule: The output array is generated by rotating the input array 2 positions to the left. Elements at index 0 and 1 are moved to the end of the array.
