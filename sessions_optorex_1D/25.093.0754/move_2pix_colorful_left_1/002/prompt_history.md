*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a fixed-length sequence of single digits. The core operation appears to be identifying the contiguous subsequence that starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit. This subsequence is then shifted left within the sequence. Specifically, it seems to be shifted left by two positions relative to its original start, but it never shifts past the beginning of the sequence (index 0). The original length of the sequence is maintained by padding the end with zeros as needed. If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output is identical to the input.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list_of_integers
          - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
          - elements: digits 0-9
      - name: output_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list_of_integers
          - length: same as input_sequence
          - elements: digits 0-9
      - name: core_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list_of_integers
          - derived_from: input_sequence
          - definition: The contiguous subsequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending at the last non-zero digit in the input_sequence.
          - exists: Only if input_sequence contains at least one non-zero digit.

    actions:
      - name: identify_core_sequence
        inputs: input_sequence
        outputs: core_sequence, first_nonzero_index, last_nonzero_index
        description: Find the indices of the first and last non-zero digits. Extract the subsequence between these indices (inclusive). Handle the case where no non-zero digits exist.
      - name: calculate_shift
        inputs: first_nonzero_index
        outputs: output_start_index
        description: Determine the starting index for the core_sequence in the output. This is calculated as the maximum of 0 and (first_nonzero_index - 2).
      - name: construct_output
        inputs: core_sequence, output_start_index, original_length
        outputs: output_sequence
        description: Create the output sequence by placing leading zeros (count = output_start_index), followed by the core_sequence, and finally padding with trailing zeros to match the original_length. If no core_sequence exists, the output is identical to the input.

    relationships:
      - type: length_conservation
        entities: [input_sequence, output_sequence]
        description: The output_sequence always has the same length as the input_sequence.
      - type: element_preservation
        entities: [input_sequence, core_sequence, output_sequence]
        description: The non-zero digits and their relative order within the core_sequence are preserved in the output_sequence. Zeros within the core_sequence are also preserved.
      - type: positional_shift
        entities: [core_sequence]
        property: start_index
        description: The core_sequence is shifted left by 2 positions, but its starting index in the output cannot be less than 0.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence. If no non-zero digit exists, return the original input sequence.
    3.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the input sequence.
    4.  Extract the 'core sequence', which is the subsequence from the first non-zero index to the last non-zero index (inclusive).
    5.  Calculate the starting index for the core sequence in the output: take the index of the first non-zero digit found in step 2 and subtract 2. If the result is negative, use 0 instead.
    6.  Construct the output sequence:
        a.  Start with a number of leading zeros equal to the calculated starting index from step 5.
        b.  Append the core sequence extracted in step 4.
        c.  Append trailing zeros until the total length of the output sequence matches the length of the original input sequence.
    7.  Return the constructed output sequence.
