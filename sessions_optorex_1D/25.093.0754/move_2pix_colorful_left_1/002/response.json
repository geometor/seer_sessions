            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The core logic identified in the initial analysis (finding the non-zero core subsequence, shifting it left by 2 positions clamped at index 0, and padding with zeros) appears consistent with the input/output pairs. However, the provided code failed because it assumed the input was a space-separated string (`input_str`), while the execution environment evidently passed a NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` confirms this type mismatch. The strategy is to revise the understanding of the input format and adjust the natural language program and subsequent code implementation accordingly. The transformation logic itself seems sound, but its implementation needs to operate on a numerical sequence (list or array) directly.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The primary metric derived from the execution results is the consistent failure across all examples due to the input type mismatch.\n    *   Input Type Assumption: `str`\n    *   Actual Input Type (based on error): `numpy.ndarray`\n    *   Result: Code failed during input processing (`.split()` method) for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example shown.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
