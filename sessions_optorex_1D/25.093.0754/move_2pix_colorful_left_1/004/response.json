            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic for a 1D sequence of digits: identify the subsequence between the first and last non-zero digits (the \"core sequence\") and shift it left by 2 positions (clamped at index 0), padding with zeros to maintain the original length.\n\nThe errors encountered (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly indicate that the `transform` function, when executed in the test environment, received its input not as a simple 1D list or array, but likely as a 2D NumPy array with a shape like (1, N), where N is the sequence length. Iterating over such a structure yields the inner array(s), causing the comparison `val != 0` to fail because `val` is an array, not a scalar.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to first explicitly extract the 1D sequence data from the potentially nested input structure (e.g., taking the first row if the input is `numpy.array([[...]])`) before applying the previously determined 1D transformation logic. The logic itself appears sound based on manual re-verification against all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo complex calculations are required via `tool_code` for this analysis. The relevant metrics were manually derived during the thought process and confirm the 1D logic holds:\n\n| Example | Input (N=12)                               | First NZ Idx | Last NZ Idx | Core Sequence         | Output Start Idx (max(0, FirstIdx-2)) | Calculated Output                      | Expected Output                        | Match |\n| :------ | :----------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,9,7,4,8,3,4,7,0,0]`                | 3            | 9           | `[9,7,4,8,3,4,7]`     | 1                                     | `[0,9,7,4,8,3,4,7,0,0,0,0]`            | `[0,9,7,4,8,3,4,7,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,7,8,2,4,3,0,0,0,0]`                | 3            | 7           | `[7,8,2,4,3]`         | 1                                     | `[0,7,8,2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[0,7,8,2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,2,4,5,1,0,0,0,0,0]`                | 3            | 6           | `[2,4,5,1]`           | 1                                     | `[0,2,4,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[0,2,4,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0]`                | 7            | 8           | `[4,2]`               | 5                                     | `[0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0]`                | 8            | 8           | `[9]`                 | 6                                     | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,4,3,3,1,6,5,9,0,0,0]`                | 2            | 8           | `[4,3,3,1,6,5,9]`     | 0                                     | `[4,3,3,1,6,5,9,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[4,3,3,1,6,5,9,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,4,3,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                | 2            | 5           | `[4,3,1,9]`           | 0                                     | `[4,3,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | `[4,3,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`            | Yes   |\n\n## Facts\n\n"
