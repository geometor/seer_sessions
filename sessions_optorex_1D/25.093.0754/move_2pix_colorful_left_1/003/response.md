"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or array) of integers.
It identifies the contiguous subsequence starting with the first non-zero
integer and ending with the last non-zero integer. This subsequence ('core sequence')
is then shifted left by two positions relative to its original starting position,
but its new starting index cannot be less than 0. The output sequence is constructed
by placing the appropriate number of leading zeros, followed by the core sequence,
and then padded with trailing zeros to maintain the original length of the input sequence.
If the input sequence contains only zeros, it is returned unchanged.
