The core operation appears to be identifying the contiguous subsequence that starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit. This subsequence is then shifted left within the sequence. Specifically, it seems to be shifted left by two positions relative to its original start, but it never shifts past the beginning of the sequence (index 0). The original length of the sequence is maintained by padding the end with zeros as needed. If the input sequence contains only zeros, the output is identical to the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
