*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of integers, consistently of length 12.
    *   The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs reveals a pattern of shifting elements to the left. Specifically, the first two elements of the input sequence seem to be moved to the end of the sequence in the output. The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - input_sequence:
          type: list
          subtype: integer
          properties:
            - length: 12
      - output_sequence:
          type: list
          subtype: integer
          properties:
            - length: 12
      - elements:
          type: integer
    actions:
      - name: cyclic_left_shift
        parameters:
          - sequence: input_sequence
          - shift_amount: 2
        produces: output_sequence
    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is a version of the input_sequence where the first two elements have been moved to the end, maintaining the relative order of all elements.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Take the elements from the third position through the twelfth position of the input sequence.
    3.  Take the first two elements of the input sequence.
    4.  Concatenate the sequence from step 2 followed by the sequence from step 3.
    5.  Return the resulting concatenated sequence as the output.
