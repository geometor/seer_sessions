*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (or lists) of digits, specifically integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The core operation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence.
    *   The relative order of the non-zero digits appears preserved.
    *   The transformation seems to be a consistent positional shift of the input sequence elements to the right.
    *   New elements (zeros) are introduced at the beginning of the sequence during the shift.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - length: 12
          - role: input
      - object: sequence
        properties:
          - type: list of integers
          - length: 12
          - role: output
      - object: digit
        properties:
          - type: integer
          - range: 0-9
    transformation:
      type: positional shift
      action: shift elements right
      details:
        - shift_amount: 4 positions
        - vacated_positions: filled with 0
        - elements_shifted_out: discarded (implicitly, due to fixed length)
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
      - The first 4 elements of the output sequence are always 0.
      - The elements from index 4 to 11 in the output sequence correspond to the elements from index 0 to 7 in the input sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 digits, initially filled with zeros.
    3.  Copy the first 8 digits (from index 0 to 7) of the input sequence into the output sequence, starting at index 4.
    4.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
    (Alternatively: Shift the entire input sequence 4 positions to the right, filling the first 4 positions with zeros and discarding the last 4 elements of the input that are shifted beyond the 12th position.)
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Takes an input sequence (list) of 12 digits and shifts the first 8 digits
4 positions to the right, placing them starting at index 4 in the output sequence.
The first 4 positions of the output sequence are filled with zeros. The last 4
digits of the input sequence are effectively discarded.

# No external libraries are strictly needed for this list manipulation,
# but numpy can be useful for array operations if the input/output were grids.
# For this specific task, standard list operations are sufficient.
