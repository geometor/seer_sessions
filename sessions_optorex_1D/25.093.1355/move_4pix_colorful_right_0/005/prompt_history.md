*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (or lists) of digits, specifically integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The core operation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence.
    *   The relative order of the non-zero digits appears preserved.
    *   The transformation seems to be a consistent positional shift of the input sequence elements to the right.
    *   New elements (zeros) are introduced at the beginning of the sequence during the shift.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    relationships:
      - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
      - The first 4 elements of the output sequence are always 0.
      - The elements from index 4 to 11 in the output sequence correspond to the elements from index 0 to 7 in the input sequence.

    4.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
    (Alternatively: Shift the entire input sequence 4 positions to the right, filling the first 4 positions with zeros and discarding the last 4 elements of the input that are shifted beyond the 12th position.)

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue is a discrepancy between the expected input type in the Python function (`str`) and the actual type provided during testing (`numpy.ndarray`). The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this. The core transformation logic (shifting elements right by 4 positions) identified previously appears correct based on the examples, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch. The strategy is to rewrite the Python code to directly handle NumPy arrays (or lists, if the environment converts arrays to lists before calling the function) instead of performing string parsing and formatting.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).
    *   **Input Shape:** Based on the examples, the input is consistently a 1D array of length 12.
    *   **Output Type:** Expected to be the same type and shape as the input (NumPy array, 1D, length 12).
    *   **Data Type:** Elements are integers.
    *   **Transformation:** Right shift.
    *   **Shift Amount:** 4 positions.
    *   **Padding:** First 4 elements of the output are zeros.
    *   **Source for Output Elements [4:]:** Input elements [0:8].
    *   **Discarded Elements:** Input elements [8:].

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Create a new 1D NumPy array of 12 integers, initialized with zeros (this will be the output array).
    3.  Select the first 8 elements (indices 0 through 7) from the input array.
    4.  Place these selected 8 elements into the output array starting at index 4 (occupying indices 4 through 11).
    5.  Return the resulting output array.
