```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input 1D NumPy array of 12 integers by performing a right shift.
Specifically, it takes the first 8 elements of the input array and places them
into a new array of the same size, starting at index 4. The first 4 elements
of the output array are filled with zeros. The last 4 elements of the input
array are effectively discarded.
