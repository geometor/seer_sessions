            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error messages (`all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions...`) strongly indicate that the initial assumption of the input/output being flat 1D sequences of 12 integers was incorrect, despite their string representation. The NumPy code failed because it attempted to concatenate a 1D array (`prefix`) with what was likely expected to be a 2D array slice. The consistent \"shift by 4\" pattern observed in the 1D interpretation corresponds perfectly to a downward shift by 1 row when the 12 elements are arranged in a 3x4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns). This 2D grid interpretation resolves the dimensionality issue and explains the observed transformation consistently across all examples. The strategy is to revise the understanding of the data structure from a 1D sequence to a 3x4 grid and redefine the transformation as a row-wise downward shift.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's represent the input/output pairs as 3x4 grids to verify the downward shift hypothesis.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    Input Grid:\n    "
