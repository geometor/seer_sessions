objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - dimensions: [3, 4]  # 3 rows, 4 columns
      - source_format: potentially flattened sequence of 12 integers
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - dimensions: [3, 4]
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - target_format: potentially flattened sequence of 12 integers
actions:
  - name: reshape_to_grid
    target: flattened input sequence
    properties:
      - result_dimensions: [3, 4]
  - name: downward_shift_rows
    target: input_grid
    properties:
      - shift_amount: 1 # Shift by 1 row
      - fill_value: 0   # Fill the new top row with zeros
      - discard: bottom row of input_grid
  - name: flatten_grid
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      - result_format: sequence of 12 integers (row-major order)
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: The output_grid is generated by shifting the rows of the input_grid down by one position. The first row of the output_grid is filled entirely with zeros. The content of the last row of the input_grid is discarded.
