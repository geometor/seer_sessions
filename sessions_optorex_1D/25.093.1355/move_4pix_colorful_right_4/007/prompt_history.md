**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Observing the input and output pairs, the core operation appears to be a positional shift of the sequence elements. The numbers themselves remain unchanged, but their positions within the sequence are altered. Specifically, the entire sequence seems to be shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions. The empty positions created at the beginning of the sequence due to the shift are filled with zeros. The number of positions shifted appears constant across all examples. Comparing input `train_1` (`6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0 0 0 0 0`) with output `train_1` (`0 0 0 0 6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0`), the element `6` moves from index 0 to index 4, indicating a shift of 4 positions. This shift magnitude (4) is consistent across all provided training examples.

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new sequence of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Copy the integers from the input sequence, starting from the first integer (index 0) up to the eighth integer (index 7), into the new sequence, placing them starting at the fifth position (index 4) up to the twelfth position (index 11).
4.  The resulting new sequence is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt incorrectly interpreted the 1D sequence of 12 integers as a 2D grid (likely 3x4) and applied a row-shifting operation. The results clearly show this was the wrong approach, as the output was consistently all zeros, failing to replicate the expected rightward shift of the 1D sequence. The core misunderstanding was the dimensionality and structure of the input data.

The correct interpretation, based on all provided examples, is that the input is a flat list or sequence of 12 integers. The transformation involves shifting the entire sequence 4 positions to the right. The first 4 positions in the output sequence are filled with the integer 0, and the last 4 elements of the original input sequence are discarded. The strategy is to revise the understanding of the input object and the action performed on it, focusing on a 1D array/list manipulation rather than a 2D grid operation.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's analyze the relationship between input and output sequences to confirm the shift amount and padding.

*   **Input/Output Length:** All input and output sequences consistently contain 12 elements.
*   **Shift Amount:**
    *   `train_1`: `6` at index 0 moves to index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   `train_2`: `7` at index 2 moves to index 6. Shift = 4.
    *   `train_3`: `2` at index 2 moves to index 6. Shift = 4.
    *   `train_4`: `5` at index 0 moves to index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   `train_7`: `1` at index 0 moves to index 4. Shift = 4.
    The shift amount is consistently 4 positions to the right.
*   **Padding:** The first 4 elements of every output sequence are 0. This confirms the fill value is 0 and it's applied to the positions vacated by the right shift.
*   **Discarded Elements:** The last `shift_amount` (4) elements of the input sequence do not appear in the output sequence.
    *   `train_1`: Input ends `... 7 0 0 0 0 0`. Output ends `... 3 2 7 0`. The last 4 zeros are discarded.
    *   `train_4`: Input ends `... 6 3 5 0 0 0 0 0`. Output ends `... 6 3 5 0`. The last 4 zeros are discarded.
*   **Element Preservation:** Non-zero elements maintain their relative order in the output, just shifted.

We can use code to verify the index mapping and padding.

3.  Create a prefix sequence containing the fill value repeated `shift_amount` times (i.e., `[0, 0, 0, 0]`).
4.  Select the elements from the input sequence starting from the first element (index 0) up to, but not including, the element at index `12 - shift_amount` (i.e., select the first 8 elements).
5.  Concatenate the prefix sequence created in step 3 with the subsequence selected in step 4. This combined sequence is the output sequence.
6.  Return the output sequence.
