  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the first 8 elements of the input_sequence and prepending 4 zeros to them. This effectively shifts the first 8 elements of the input_sequence 4 positions to the right, fills the first 4 positions with 0, and discards the last 4 elements of the input_sequence.
