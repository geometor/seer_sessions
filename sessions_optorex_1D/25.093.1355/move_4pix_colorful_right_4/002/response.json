            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not a string as was assumed in the previous code version and type hints. The core transformation logic (right-shifting the sequence by 4 positions and padding the beginning with zeros) appears correct based on the initial analysis and comparison of input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the understanding of the input data type to be a NumPy array.\n2.  Adjust the data processing step within the function to work directly with the NumPy array, removing the erroneous string splitting operation.\n3.  Re-validate the core shift logic using the examples.\n4.  Update the YAML documentation and natural language program to accurately reflect the input type and the confirmed transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nBased on the examples and the error messages:\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 integers.\n*   **Output Type:** NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 integers.\n*   **Transformation:** Right shift.\n*   **Shift Amount:** 4 positions. This is confirmed by comparing the position of the first non-zero element (or any element) in the input vs. the output across multiple examples (e.g., `train_1`: `6` moves from index 0 to 4; `train_2`: `7` moves from index 2 to 6; `train_6`: `5` moves from index 0 to 4).\n*   **Padding:** The first 4 elements of the output are always 0.\n*   **Discarded Elements:** The last 4 elements of the input sequence are discarded during the shift.\n\nThe code simulation performed in the thought process confirmed that applying a right shift of 4, padding with 0s, and taking the first 8 elements of the input produces the correct output for `train_1` and `train_2`. This strongly suggests the logic is sound, and only the input handling needs correction.\n\n**YAML Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
