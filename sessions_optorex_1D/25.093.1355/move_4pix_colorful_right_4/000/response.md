**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Observing the input and output pairs, the core operation appears to be a positional shift of the sequence elements. The numbers themselves remain unchanged, but their positions within the sequence are altered. Specifically, the entire sequence seems to be shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions. The empty positions created at the beginning of the sequence due to the shift are filled with zeros. The number of positions shifted appears constant across all examples. Comparing input `train_1` (`6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0 0 0 0 0`) with output `train_1` (`0 0 0 0 6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0`), the element `6` moves from index 0 to index 4, indicating a shift of 4 positions. This shift magnitude (4) is consistent across all provided training examples.

**YAML Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - length: 12
      - derived_from: input_sequence
actions:
  - name: right_shift
    target: input_sequence
    properties:
      - shift_amount: 4
      - fill_value: 0
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by shifting the elements of the input_sequence 4 positions to the right. The first 4 positions of the output_sequence are filled with 0. Elements shifted beyond the 12th position of the input_sequence are discarded.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new sequence of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Copy the integers from the input sequence, starting from the first integer (index 0) up to the eighth integer (index 7), into the new sequence, placing them starting at the fifth position (index 4) up to the twelfth position (index 11).
4.  The resulting new sequence is the output.
