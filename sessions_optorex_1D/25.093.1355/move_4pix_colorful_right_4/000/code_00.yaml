      - shift_amount: 4
      - fill_value: 0
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by shifting the elements of the input_sequence 4 positions to the right. The first 4 positions of the output_sequence are filled with 0. Elements shifted beyond the 12th position of the input_sequence are discarded.
