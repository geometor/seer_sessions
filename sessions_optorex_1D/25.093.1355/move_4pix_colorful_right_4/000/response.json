            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Observing the input and output pairs, the core operation appears to be a positional shift of the sequence elements. The numbers themselves remain unchanged, but their positions within the sequence are altered. Specifically, the entire sequence seems to be shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions. The empty positions created at the beginning of the sequence due to the shift are filled with zeros. The number of positions shifted appears constant across all examples. Comparing input `train_1` (`6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0 0 0 0 0`) with output `train_1` (`0 0 0 0 6 1 4 2 3 2 7 0`), the element `6` moves from index 0 to index 4, indicating a shift of 4 positions. This shift magnitude (4) is consistent across all provided training examples.\n\n**YAML Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
