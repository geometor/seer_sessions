import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Shifts the rows of a 3x4 input grid down by one position.

    Args:
        input_grid: A NumPy array representing the 3x4 input grid. 
                     Note: Even if the input is provided flat, it's treated 
                     as 3x4 conceptually and potentially reshaped if needed 
                     by the calling context (though this function assumes it 
                     receives a 3x4 array). The error messages from the 
                     previous attempt suggest the testing environment handles 
                     the reshaping implicitly or expects the function to handle it.
                     Based on the error `ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions`, 
                     it's likely the test harness provides the input as a 2D (3x4) array.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array representing the transformed 3x4 grid.
