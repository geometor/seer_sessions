objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list # or 1D array
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - length: 12
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list # or 1D array
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - length: 12
      - derived_from: input_sequence
actions:
  - name: right_shift_and_pad
    target: input_sequence
    properties:
      - shift_amount: 4
      - fill_value: 0
      - direction: right
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by taking the first (length - shift_amount) elements (i.e., first 12 - 4 = 8 elements) of the input_sequence and placing them into the output_sequence starting at index shift_amount (i.e., index 4). The first shift_amount (i.e., first 4) positions of the output_sequence are filled with the fill_value (0). The last shift_amount (i.e., last 4) elements of the input sequence are discarded.
