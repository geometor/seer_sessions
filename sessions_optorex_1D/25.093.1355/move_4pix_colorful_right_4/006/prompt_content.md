"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Shifts the rows of a 3x4 input grid down by one position.

    Args:
        input_grid: A NumPy array representing the 3x4 input grid. 
                     Note: Even if the input is provided flat, it's treated 
                     as 3x4 conceptually and potentially reshaped if needed 
                     by the calling context (though this function assumes it 
                     receives a 3x4 array). The error messages from the 
                     previous attempt suggest the testing environment handles 
                     the reshaping implicitly or expects the function to handle it.
                     Based on the error `ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions`, 
                     it's likely the test harness provides the input as a 2D (3x4) array.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array representing the transformed 3x4 grid.

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape 
    
    # Define the shift amount (number of rows to shift down)

    # Define the fill value for the new top row(s)

    # Calculate the range of rows to copy from the input grid
    # We need to copy rows from index 0 up to (but not including) rows - row_shift_amount

    # Copy the relevant rows from the input grid to the shifted positions in the output grid

    # The first 'row_shift_amount' rows of the output_grid are already filled with 'fill_value'
    # due to the np.full_like initialization.
