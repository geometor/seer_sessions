**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Each input consists of a list of numbers, primarily zeros, containing a single contiguous block of non-zero integers. The output is a sequence of the same length where the non-zero block from the input has been moved to a different position. The core elements are:
1.  The input sequence (a list of integers).
2.  The output sequence (a list of integers of the same length as the input).
3.  A contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
4.  Zero padding surrounding the non-zero block.
5.  A consistent spatial shift applied to the non-zero block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Example_Object: The non-zero block (e.g., `[7, 4]` in train_1, `[7, 6, 8]` in train_2).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the same non-zero block as the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift the non-zero block.
  Direction: Right.
  Magnitude: Constant (4 positions in examples).
  Relationship:
    - The non-zero block in the output is identical to the non-zero block in the input.
    - The starting position of the non-zero block in the output is the starting position in the input plus 4.
    - All other elements in the output sequence are zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence composed entirely of non-zero integers. Determine its starting index and length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initialized with all zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero subsequence by adding 4 to its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified non-zero subsequence into the output sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Output the modified sequence.

Error: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous attempt failed because it assumed the input was a 1D list, while the execution environment provided a 2D NumPy array. The error "only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars" confirms this mismatch, arising from trying to apply `int()` to an entire row array. Analysis of the examples formatted as 3x4 grids reveals a consistent transformation: the entire pattern of non-zero numbers is shifted down by exactly one row.

The strategy is to adapt the approach to handle 2D NumPy arrays:
1.  Modify the code to correctly interpret the input as a 2D grid.
2.  Iterate through the cells of the 2D grid.
3.  For each non-zero cell, calculate its new position by adding 1 to the row index.
4.  Place the non-zero value in the calculated new position within a new, zero-initialized grid of the same dimensions, ensuring boundary checks are performed.

Shift Analysis (Train 1): (+1 row, +0 col)

```
**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation (Downward Shift)

Input:
  Type: 2D NumPy Array
  Shape: (3, 4)
  Datatype: Integers
  Structure: Contains non-zero integers scattered on a background of zeros.
  Object: The input grid itself.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3 rows, 4 columns.
    - Elements: Integers (0 and non-zero).

Output:
  Type: 2D NumPy Array
  Shape: (3, 4) (Same as input)
  Datatype: Integers
  Structure: Represents the input grid's non-zero elements shifted down by one row.
  Object: The output grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift non-zero elements downwards.
  Rule: For every non-zero element at `input[r][c]`, move its value to `output[r+1][c]`.
  Parameters:
    - Row Shift: +1
    - Column Shift: 0
  Constraints:
    - Grid boundaries apply: Elements shifted beyond the last row (row index 2) are discarded.
    - Zero elements remain zero unless overwritten by a shifted non-zero element.
    - Relative positions of non-zero elements are preserved in the shift.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input 3x4 grid (a 2D NumPy array).
2.  Create a new 3x4 output grid and initialize all its cells to zero.
3.  Iterate through each row (`r`) of the input grid, from row 0 up to (but not including) row 3.
4.  Within each row `r`, iterate through each column (`c`), from column 0 up to (but not including) column 4.
5.  Check the value of the cell at `input_grid[r, c]`.
6.  If the value is not zero:
    a.  Calculate the target row index: `target_r = r + 1`.
    b.  The target column index remains the same: `target_c = c`.
    c.  Check if the `target_r` is still within the grid's row boundaries (i.e., `target_r < 3`).
    d.  If `target_r` is valid (less than 3), copy the non-zero value from `input_grid[r, c]` to the output grid at `output_grid[target_r, target_c]`.
7.  After iterating through all cells of the input grid, return the completed output grid.
