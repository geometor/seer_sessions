Task: Sequence Transformation (Right Shift)

Input:
  Type: List or 1D Array of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Object:
    Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Content: Sequence of non-zero integers (e.g., `[7, 4]`, `[7, 6, 8]`)
      - Location: Defined by its starting index in the input sequence.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block.

Output:
  Type: List or 1D Array of Integers (same type as expected by validation)
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the identical NonZeroBlock from the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Spatially shift the NonZeroBlock within the sequence boundary.
  Parameters:
    - Direction: Right
    - Magnitude: 4 positions
  Process:
    1. Identify the NonZeroBlock (content and start index) in the input.
    2. Create an output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
    3. Calculate the target start index in the output sequence: `input_start_index + 4`.
    4. Copy the NonZeroBlock content into the output sequence starting at the target index.
  Constraint: If the shift would place part of the block beyond the sequence boundary, that part is truncated (though this does not occur in the provided examples).
