**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Each input consists of a list of numbers, primarily zeros, containing a single contiguous block of non-zero integers. The output is a sequence of the same length where the non-zero block from the input has been moved to a different position. The core elements are:
1.  The input sequence (a list of integers).
2.  The output sequence (a list of integers of the same length as the input).
3.  A contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
4.  Zero padding surrounding the non-zero block.
5.  A consistent spatial shift applied to the non-zero block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Example_Object: The non-zero block (e.g., `[7, 4]` in train_1, `[7, 6, 8]` in train_2).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the same non-zero block as the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift the non-zero block.
  Direction: Right.
  Magnitude: Constant (4 positions in examples).
  Relationship:
    - The non-zero block in the output is identical to the non-zero block in the input.
    - The starting position of the non-zero block in the output is the starting position in the input plus 4.
    - All other elements in the output sequence are zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence composed entirely of non-zero integers. Determine its starting index and length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initialized with all zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero subsequence by adding 4 to its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified non-zero subsequence into the output sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Output the modified sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code execution failed across all examples with the same error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` provided by the testing environment is a NumPy array, and the comparison `if val != 0:` within the `find_non_zero_block` function is causing issues because it's operating on NumPy array elements or slices which don't have a single boolean truth value in this context.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input type and structure using `tool_code`.
2.  Ensure the code explicitly handles NumPy arrays, likely by converting the input array to a standard Python list at the beginning of the `transform` function, as was attempted before, but perhaps ensuring this conversion is robust or modifying the comparison logic. The original code already included `input_list = list(input_grid)`, so the error might stem from how iteration or indexing interacts with the converted list if it retains some NumPy properties, or perhaps the error message is slightly misleading and the issue is elsewhere. Let's ensure the core logic correctly iterates and compares standard Python numbers after conversion.
3.  Verify the core transformation logic (finding the block, shifting by +4) against all examples using metrics gathered via `tool_code`.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on confirmed details and the necessary input handling.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the structure and transformation for each training example.

**Analysis Findings:**

The metrics confirm the initial observations:
1.  **Input/Output Length:** Consistently 12 for all examples.
2.  **Non-Zero Block:** Each input has exactly one contiguous block of non-zero integers.
3.  **Block Content:** The non-zero block in the output is identical to the block in the input (`blocks_equal` is True for all).
4.  **Shift Magnitude:** The starting index of the non-zero block consistently shifts right by 4 positions (`shift` is 4 for all).
5.  **Padding:** The space not occupied by the non-zero block is filled with zeros.
6.  **Input Type:** The metric gathering code implicitly used NumPy, reinforcing the likelihood that the test harness uses NumPy arrays. The results show NumPy integer types (e.g., `np.int64`) for indices, confirming NumPy's involvement.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Right Shift)

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence (likely NumPy array, treat as List of Integers)
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers
  Property: Contains exactly one contiguous sub-sequence (block) of non-zero integers.
  Property: Remaining elements are zero.

Output_Object:
  Type: Sequence (List of Integers)
  Length: Same as Input_Object (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers
  Property: Contains the same non-zero block as the Input_Object.
  Property: Remaining elements are zero.

Transformation:
  Action: Locate the non-zero block within the Input_Object.
  Action: Determine the starting index of this block.
  Action: Create a new sequence (Output_Object) of the same length, initialized with zeros.
  Action: Calculate the target starting index for the block in the Output_Object by adding 4 to the original starting index.
  Action: Copy the non-zero block from the Input_Object into the Output_Object starting at the calculated target index.
  Constraint: Ensure indices stay within the bounds of the sequence length (though not explicitly tested by examples, it's good practice).
  Constraint: Handle potential NumPy array input by converting to a standard Python list for processing.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (potentially a NumPy array).
2.  Convert the input sequence into a standard Python list of integers.
3.  Initialize an output list of the same length as the input list, filled with zeros.
4.  Iterate through the input list to find the first non-zero element. Record its index as `start_index`. If no non-zero element is found, return the zero-filled output list.
5.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous non-zero block (the index after the last non-zero element in the block).
6.  Extract the non-zero block (sublist) from the input list using the identified start and end indices.
7.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 4 to the original `start_index`.
8.  Iterate through the extracted non-zero block. For each element in the block at index `i` (relative to the block's start):
    a.  Calculate the corresponding index `output_index` in the output list: `new_start_index + i`.
    b.  Check if `output_index` is within the valid range (0 to length-1) of the output list.
    c.  If it is valid, place the element from the non-zero block into the `output_list` at `output_index`.
9.  Return the final output list.
