Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Example_Object: The non-zero block (e.g., `[7, 4]` in train_1, `[7, 6, 8]` in train_2).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the same non-zero block as the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift the non-zero block.
  Direction: Right.
  Magnitude: Constant (4 positions in examples).
  Relationship:
    - The non-zero block in the output is identical to the non-zero block in the input.
    - The starting position of the non-zero block in the output is the starting position in the input plus 4.
    - All other elements in the output sequence are zeros.
