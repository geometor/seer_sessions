Each input consists of a list of numbers, primarily zeros, containing a single contiguous block of non-zero integers. The output is a sequence of the same length where the non-zero block from the input has been moved to a different position. The core elements are:\n1.  The input sequence (a list of integers).\n2.  The output sequence (a list of integers of the same length as the input).\n3.  A contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.\n4.  Zero padding surrounding the non-zero block.\n5.  A consistent spatial shift applied to the non-zero block.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
