Creates a new sequence of the same length \ninitialized with zeros. Calculates a new starting index for the non-zero \nsubsequence by adding 4 to its original starting index. Places the \nidentified non-zero subsequence into the output sequence beginning at the \nnew starting index, handling potential boundary conditions. Outputs the \nmodified sequence as a standard Python list.\n\"\"\"\n\n# No external libraries needed for this logic\n\n# Helper function to find the contiguous non-zero block\ndef find_non_zero_block(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start index and content of the first contiguous non-zero block.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: A list of numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (start_index, block_content).\n        Returns (-1, []) if no non-zero block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_index = -1\n    non_zero_block = []\n    in_block = False\n    for i, val in enumerate(sequence):\n        # If we find a non-zero value\n        if val != 0:\n            # If this is the start of the block, record the index\n            if not in_block:\n                start_index = i\n                in_block = True\n            # Append the value to our block content\n            non_zero_block.append(val)\n        # If we encounter a zero *after* the block has started\n        elif in_block:\n            # The block has ended\n            return start_index, non_zero_block\n            \n    # If we reached the end of the sequence and a block was active, return it\n    if in_block:\n        return start_index, non_zero_block\n        \n    # If no non-zero value was ever found\n    return -1, []\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input sequence by shifting the non-zero block right by 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a list (in case it's a numpy array from test harness)\n    input_list = list(input_grid) \n    \n    # Determine the size of the input sequence\n    grid_size = len(input_list)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid with all zeros, same size as input\n    output_grid = [0] * grid_size\n\n    # Identify the non-zero block and its start index\n    start_index, non_zero_block = find_non_zero_block(input_list)\n\n    # Proceed only if a non-zero block was actually found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the new starting index by shifting 4 positions to the right\n        new_start_index = start_index + 4\n        \n        # Determine the length of the non-zero block\n        block_len = len(non_zero_block)\n\n        # Place the non-zero block into the output grid at the new position\n        # Iterate through the elements of the found block\n        for i in range(block_len):\n            # Calculate the corresponding index in the output grid\n            output_index = new_start_index + i\n            \n            # Check if the calculated index is within the bounds of the output grid\n            if 0 <= output_index < grid_size:\n                 # Place the element from the non-zero block into the output grid\n                 output_grid[output_index] = non_zero_block[i]\n            # else: If the shift would place elements outside the grid, they are ignored (truncated)\n\n    # Return the resulting output grid (as a standard list)\n    return output_grid\n```"
