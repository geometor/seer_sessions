**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Each input consists of a list of numbers, primarily zeros, containing a single contiguous block of non-zero integers. The output is a sequence of the same length where the non-zero block from the input has been moved to a different position. The core elements are:
1.  The input sequence (a list of integers).
2.  The output sequence (a list of integers of the same length as the input).
3.  A contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence.
4.  Zero padding surrounding the non-zero block.
5.  A consistent spatial shift applied to the non-zero block.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Example_Object: The non-zero block (e.g., `[7, 4]` in train_1, `[7, 6, 8]` in train_2).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the same non-zero block as the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift the non-zero block.
  Direction: Right.
  Magnitude: Constant (4 positions in examples).
  Relationship:
    - The non-zero block in the output is identical to the non-zero block in the input.
    - The starting position of the non-zero block in the output is the starting position in the input plus 4.
    - All other elements in the output sequence are zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence composed entirely of non-zero integers. Determine its starting index and length.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initialized with all zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the non-zero subsequence by adding 4 to its original starting index in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified non-zero subsequence into the output sequence, beginning at the calculated new starting index.
6.  Output the modified sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: locate the single contiguous block of non-zero integers and shift it 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence, padding with zeros. The provided Python code implements this logic.

The execution results show a consistent error across all examples: `Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests a type mismatch issue related to NumPy arrays, likely occurring in the testing environment when comparing the function's output (a Python list) with the expected output (potentially represented as a NumPy array) using an operator like `==`. The comparison `list == numpy_array` yields an element-wise boolean array, which cannot be evaluated as a single boolean truth value in contexts like `if` statements used by the test harness.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the transformation logic (shift right by 4) holds for all examples.
2.  Assume the error originates from the interaction between the function's list output and the test harness's potential use of NumPy arrays for comparison.
3.  Refine the natural language program and facts if any discrepancies are found (though none are expected based on the error type).
4.  Advise the coder phase to ensure the function consistently handles input types (e.g., by converting potential NumPy array inputs to lists) and returns a standard Python list, which is generally safer for comparison unless the specific requirements mandate a NumPy array return type. Removing the unused NumPy import would also be good practice.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's verify the "shift right by 4" rule against each example.

*   **Train 1:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 7 4 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[7, 4]` at index 5. Shifted start: 5 + 4 = 9. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 4 0]`. Matches.
*   **Train 2:** Input `[0 0 0 7 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[7, 6, 8]` at index 3. Shifted start: 3 + 4 = 7. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 8 0 0]`. Matches.
*   **Train 3:** Input `[0 3 2 5 8 1 1 4 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[3 2 5 8 1 1 4]` at index 1. Shifted start: 1 + 4 = 5. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 3 2 5 8 1 1 4]`. Matches.
*   **Train 4:** Input `[0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[5, 5]` at index 3. Shifted start: 3 + 4 = 7. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0]`. Matches.
*   **Train 5:** Input `[0 0 1 9 8 7 9 8 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1 9 8 7 9 8]` at index 2. Shifted start: 2 + 4 = 6. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 9 8 7 9 8]`. Matches.
*   **Train 6:** Input `[3 5 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[3 5 2 4 3]` at index 0. Shifted start: 0 + 4 = 4. Output: `[0 0 0 0 3 5 2 4 3 0 0 0]`. Matches.
*   **Train 7:** Input `[0 0 0 8 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[8 7 8]` at index 3. Shifted start: 3 + 4 = 7. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 8 0 0]`. Matches.

**Conclusion:** The core transformation logic (find the non-zero block, shift it right by 4) is consistent and correctly understood. The failure mode points to a technical issue in the execution/validation phase, likely related to comparing Python lists and NumPy arrays.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Right Shift)

Input:
  Type: List or 1D Array of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros.
  Object:
    Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Content: Sequence of non-zero integers (e.g., `[7, 4]`, `[7, 6, 8]`)
      - Location: Defined by its starting index in the input sequence.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block.

Output:
  Type: List or 1D Array of Integers (same type as expected by validation)
  Length: Same as input (12 in examples)
  Structure: Contains the identical NonZeroBlock from the input, shifted, surrounded by zeros.

Transformation:
  Action: Spatially shift the NonZeroBlock within the sequence boundary.
  Parameters:
    - Direction: Right
    - Magnitude: 4 positions
  Process:
    1. Identify the NonZeroBlock (content and start index) in the input.
    2. Create an output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
    3. Calculate the target start index in the output sequence: `input_start_index + 4`.
    4. Copy the NonZeroBlock content into the output sequence starting at the target index.
  Constraint: If the shift would place part of the block beyond the sequence boundary, that part is truncated (though this does not occur in the provided examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (potentially as a list or NumPy array).
2.  Identify the contiguous subsequence composed entirely of non-zero integers (the "NonZeroBlock"). Determine its content and its starting index within the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence (as a standard Python list) of the same length as the input sequence, initializing all elements to zero.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the NonZeroBlock by adding 4 to its original starting index.
5.  Iterate through the content of the identified NonZeroBlock. For each element, calculate its corresponding index in the output sequence (new starting index + element's position within the block).
6.  If the calculated output index is within the bounds of the output sequence, place the element at that index.
7.  Return the completed output sequence (as a standard Python list).
