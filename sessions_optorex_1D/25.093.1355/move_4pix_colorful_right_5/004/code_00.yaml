Task: Sequence Transformation (Right Shift)

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence (likely NumPy array, treat as List of Integers)
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers
  Property: Contains exactly one contiguous sub-sequence (block) of non-zero integers.
  Property: Remaining elements are zero.

Output_Object:
  Type: Sequence (List of Integers)
  Length: Same as Input_Object (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers
  Property: Contains the same non-zero block as the Input_Object.
  Property: Remaining elements are zero.

Transformation:
  Action: Locate the non-zero block within the Input_Object.
  Action: Determine the starting index of this block.
  Action: Create a new sequence (Output_Object) of the same length, initialized with zeros.
  Action: Calculate the target starting index for the block in the Output_Object by adding 4 to the original starting index.
  Action: Copy the non-zero block from the Input_Object into the Output_Object starting at the calculated target index.
  Constraint: Ensure indices stay within the bounds of the sequence length (though not explicitly tested by examples, it's good practice).
  Constraint: Handle potential NumPy array input by converting to a standard Python list for processing.
