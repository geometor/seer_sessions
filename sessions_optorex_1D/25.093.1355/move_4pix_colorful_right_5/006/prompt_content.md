"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) containing a single 
contiguous block of non-zero integers surrounded by zeros. The transformation 
involves shifting this non-zero block exactly 4 positions to the right within 
a sequence of the same length, padding with zeros. If the shift causes any part 
of the block to extend beyond the sequence boundaries, that part is truncated.
