Task: Grid Transformation (Downward Shift)

Input:
  Type: 2D NumPy Array
  Shape: (3, 4)
  Datatype: Integers
  Structure: Contains non-zero integers scattered on a background of zeros.
  Object: The input grid itself.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 3 rows, 4 columns.
    - Elements: Integers (0 and non-zero).

Output:
  Type: 2D NumPy Array
  Shape: (3, 4) (Same as input)
  Datatype: Integers
  Structure: Represents the input grid's non-zero elements shifted down by one row.
  Object: The output grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Shift non-zero elements downwards.
  Rule: For every non-zero element at `input[r][c]`, move its value to `output[r+1][c]`.
  Parameters:
    - Row Shift: +1
    - Column Shift: 0
  Constraints:
    - Grid boundaries apply: Elements shifted beyond the last row (row index 2) are discarded.
    - Zero elements remain zero unless overwritten by a shifted non-zero element.
    - Relative positions of non-zero elements are preserved in the shift.
