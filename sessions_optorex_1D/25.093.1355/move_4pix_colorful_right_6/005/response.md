```python
"""
Takes a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers (potentially passed as a 
(1, 12) 2D array). Performs a right shift operation on the sequence by 4 
positions. Fills the first 4 vacated positions with zeros. Discards the 
elements shifted beyond the original length of 12. Returns the resulting 
1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
