*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code execution results consistently show an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a mismatch between the function's expected input type (`str`) and the actual input type provided during execution (`numpy.ndarray`). The function attempts to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array, causing the error. The core transformation logic (right shift by 4, padding with zeros) described in the previous natural language program appears sound based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs, but the implementation failed due to incorrect input handling. The strategy is to modify the function to accept a NumPy array directly, removing the string parsing step, and implement the shift logic using array operations or list conversions compatible with NumPy arrays.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Number of training examples: 7
    *   Number of successful executions: 0
    *   Number of failed executions: 7
    *   Common Error Type: `AttributeError`
    *   Error Message: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`
    *   Point of Failure: Input parsing (`input_sequence_str.split()`) in all failed cases.
    *   Consistency: The error is identical across all examples, confirming a systematic input type issue rather than data-specific problems.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: sequence_transformation
    input:
      data_type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on execution error
      element_type: integer
      shape: (12,) # Explicitly mentioning shape for a 1D array
      properties:
        - contains zeros and non-zero integers
    output:
      data_type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should also be an array for consistency
      element_type: integer
      shape: (12,)
      properties:
        - derived from input sequence
    transformation:
      action: right_shift
      parameters:
        shift_amount: 4
        fill_value: 0
      constraints:
        - preserve original sequence length (12)
        - prepend fill_value for vacated positions
        - truncate elements shifted beyond original length
    relationship:
      - output is the result of applying a fixed right shift of 4 positions to the input array, padding with zeros at the start and truncating at the end.
    execution_context: # Added based on error analysis
      input_passing_method: direct numpy.ndarray object
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Create a new NumPy array of the same size (12 elements), initialized with zeros (the `fill_value`).
    3.  Identify the elements from the input array that will be kept after the shift: these are the first `12 - 4 = 8` elements (from index 0 to 7).
    4.  Place these 8 elements into the new array, starting at index 4 (the `shift_amount`). The elements originally at input indices `0..7` will now be at output indices `4..11`.
    5.  The first 4 elements of the new array remain zeros, acting as the padding.
    6.  Return the new NumPy array as the output.
