```python
"""
Takes a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers. Performs a right shift 
operation on the entire sequence by 4 positions. Prepends 4 zeros to the 
beginning of the shifted sequence. Keeps only the first 12 elements of the 
resulting sequence, discarding any elements shifted beyond the 12th position. 
The resulting NumPy array of 12 integers is the output.
