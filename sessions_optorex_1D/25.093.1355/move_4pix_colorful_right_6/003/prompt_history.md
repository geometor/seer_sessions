*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers. Observing the input and output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of numbers in the input is shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions. The positions vacated at the beginning of the sequence are filled with zeros, and elements shifted beyond the end of the sequence are discarded, maintaining the original length of 12. Across all examples, the magnitude of the right shift is consistently 4 positions.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: sequence_transformation
    input:
      data_type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      length: 12
      properties:
        - contains zeros and non-zero integers
    output:
      data_type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      length: 12
      properties:
        - derived from input sequence
    transformation:
      action: right_shift
      parameters:
        shift_amount: 4
        fill_value: 0
      constraints:
        - preserve original sequence length (12)
        - prepend fill_value for vacated positions
        - truncate elements shifted beyond original length
    relationship:
      - output is the result of applying a fixed right shift of 4 positions to the input sequence, padding with zeros at the start and truncating at the end.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Perform a right shift operation on the entire sequence by 4 positions.
    3.  Prepend 4 zeros to the beginning of the shifted sequence.
    4.  Keep only the first 12 elements of the resulting sequence, discarding any elements shifted beyond the 12th position.
    5.  The resulting sequence of 12 integers is the output.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code execution results consistently show an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a mismatch between the function's expected input type (`str`) and the actual input type provided during execution (`numpy.ndarray`). The function attempts to call the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array, causing the error. The core transformation logic (right shift by 4, padding with zeros) described in the previous natural language program appears sound based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs, but the implementation failed due to incorrect input handling. The strategy is to modify the function to accept a NumPy array directly, removing the string parsing step, and implement the shift logic using array operations or list conversions compatible with NumPy arrays.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Number of training examples: 7
    *   Number of successful executions: 0
    *   Number of failed executions: 7
    *   Common Error Type: `AttributeError`
    *   Error Message: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`
    *   Point of Failure: Input parsing (`input_sequence_str.split()`) in all failed cases.
    *   Consistency: The error is identical across all examples, confirming a systematic input type issue rather than data-specific problems.

*   **Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Create a new NumPy array of the same size (12 elements), initialized with zeros (the `fill_value`).
    3.  Identify the elements from the input array that will be kept after the shift: these are the first `12 - 4 = 8` elements (from index 0 to 7).
    4.  Place these 8 elements into the new array, starting at index 4 (the `shift_amount`). The elements originally at input indices `0..7` will now be at output indices `4..11`.
    5.  The first 4 elements of the new array remain zeros, acting as the padding.
    6.  Return the new NumPy array as the output.
