Observing the input and output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of numbers in the input is shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions. The positions vacated at the beginning of the sequence are filled with zeros, and elements shifted beyond the end of the sequence are discarded, maintaining the original length of 12. Across all examples, the magnitude of the right shift is consistently 4 positions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
