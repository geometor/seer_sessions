task_type: sequence_manipulation
input_description:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: 1D NumPy array (potentially passed as (1, 12) or (12,))
output_description:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  representation: 1D NumPy array (shape (12,))
transformation_description:
  name: fixed_right_shift_with_padding
  parameters:
    shift_amount: 4
    padding_value: 0
    sequence_length: 12
  steps:
    - Identify the first `sequence_length - shift_amount` elements of the input sequence (first 8 elements).
    - Create a new sequence of length `sequence_length` (12).
    - Fill the first `shift_amount` positions (first 4 positions) of the new sequence with the `padding_value` (0).
    - Place the identified elements from step 1 into the remaining positions of the new sequence (positions 4 through 11).
error_analysis:
  type: NumPy Broadcasting Error
  message: "could not broadcast input array from shape (0,12) into shape (0,)"
  location: Array assignment operation (`output_grid[shift_amount:] = elements_to_shift`)
  potential_causes:
    - Input array `input_grid` might have unexpected dimensions (e.g., (1, 12) instead of (12,)).
    - Slicing `input_grid` might produce an array with incompatible dimensions for assignment.
    - The input array might be empty or malformed in the testing environment.
