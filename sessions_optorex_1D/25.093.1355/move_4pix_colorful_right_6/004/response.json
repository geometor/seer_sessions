            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement a right shift of 4 positions on a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers, padding with zeros. The core logic aligns with the transformation observed in all training examples. However, the code consistently fails with a NumPy broadcasting error: `could not broadcast input array from shape (0,12) into shape (0,)`.\n\nThis specific error message is unusual given the intended operation on a 1D array of length 12. A shape like `(0, 12)` represents an empty 2D array, while `(0,)` represents an empty 1D array. This suggests a potential mismatch between the expected input shape (likely `(12,)` or maybe `(1, 12)`) and the shape being processed within the function, or possibly an issue with how the data is loaded or sliced by the testing framework before being passed to the `transform` function. The error occurs during the assignment `output_grid[shift_amount:] = elements_to_shift`. If `input_grid` were unexpectedly empty or had incompatible dimensions (e.g., 2D), slicing it (`input_grid[:elements_to_keep_count]`) could result in an array whose shape cannot be broadcast into the target slice `output_grid[shift_amount:]`.\n\nThe strategy is to assume the underlying logic (right shift by 4) is correct based on the examples and focus on making the NumPy implementation robust to potential variations in input array dimensions (e.g., handling both `(12,)` and `(1, 12)` shapes) or ensuring the slicing and assignment operations correctly align shapes.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input:** Sequence of 12 integers. Represented as a string initially, assumed to be converted to a NumPy array for the `transform` function. The expected shape is `(12,)` or possibly `(1, 12)`.\n*   **Output:** Sequence of 12 integers, derived from the input.\n*   **Transformation:** Right shift by 4 positions.\n*   **Padding:** 4 zeros prepended at the start.\n*   **Truncation:** Elements shifted beyond the 12th position are discarded.\n*   **Consistency:** The right shift of 4 positions is consistent across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Error:** NumPy broadcasting error `could not broadcast input array from shape (0,12) into shape (0,)` occurs in all examples, pointing to a shape mismatch during array assignment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
