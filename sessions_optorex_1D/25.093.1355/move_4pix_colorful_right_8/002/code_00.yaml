task_elements:
  - item: input_array
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray (or list) of integers
      - length: 12
      - content: digits (0-9)
  - item: output_array
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray (or list) of integers
      - length: 12
      - content: digits (0-9) derived from input_array
  - item: non_zero_segment
    properties:
      - definition: The contiguous sub-array starting from the first non-zero element and ending with the last non-zero element in the input_array.
      - derivation: Extracted using the indices of the first and last non-zero elements.
      - may_contain_zeros: true
  - item: shift_operation
    properties:
      - type: right shift
      - amount: 4 positions
      - target: non_zero_segment
      - behavior: Places the segment into a zero-initialized array of the same length as the input.
  - item: zero_padding
    properties:
      - description: Positions in the output_array not occupied by the shifted segment are filled with zeros.
      - mechanism: Achieved by initializing the output_array with zeros before placing the segment.
  - item: boundary_handling
    properties:
      - type: truncation
      - description: Elements of the non_zero_segment whose target index after shifting (original_index + 4) is >= 12 are discarded.
relationships:
  - input_array is transformed into output_array by:
      1. Identifying the non_zero_segment.
      2. Applying the shift_operation to this segment within a zero-padded array of length 12.
      3. Applying boundary_handling (truncation).
  - If input_array contains only zeros, the non_zero_segment is considered empty, and the output_array is identical to the input_array.
