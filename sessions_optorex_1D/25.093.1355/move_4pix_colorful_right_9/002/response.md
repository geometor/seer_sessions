**Assessment and Strategy**

The execution results show a consistent `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples. This indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not a space-separated string as initially assumed. The `parse_input` function, designed to handle string input, is therefore causing the error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is directly provided as a sequence of numbers (likely a list or NumPy array).
2.  Remove the string parsing step (`parse_input`) from the core transformation logic.
3.  Adjust the transformation logic to work directly with this numerical sequence.
4.  Assume the output should also be a numerical sequence (list or array), and remove the string formatting step (`format_output`) unless explicitly required by the execution environment later.
5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this direct handling of numerical sequences.

**Metrics Gathering**

The error occurred during input parsing, before the core transformation logic was executed. Therefore, the previously observed metrics regarding the transformation itself remain valid:

*   **Input Sequence Length:** 12
*   **Output Sequence Length:** 12
*   **Shift Amount:** +4 positions (to the right)
*   **Padding:** 4 leading zeros are introduced.
*   **Truncation:** Elements originally at indices 8, 9, 10, 11 of the input are effectively lost.

The critical new metric is:
*   **Input Data Type:** NumPy array (or potentially a standard Python list behaving similarly).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new output sequence containing 12 zeros.
3.  Identify the elements to be shifted from the input sequence: these are the elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 8 (i.e., `sequence_length - shift_amount`).
4.  Determine the target indices in the output sequence: these start at index 4 (`shift_amount`) and end at index 11.
5.  Copy the identified elements from the input sequence (step 3) into the target positions of the output sequence (step 4).
6.  Return the modified output sequence.
