            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results show a consistent `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` across all examples. This indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not a space-separated string as initially assumed. The `parse_input` function, designed to handle string input, is therefore causing the error.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input is directly provided as a sequence of numbers (likely a list or NumPy array).\n2.  Remove the string parsing step (`parse_input`) from the core transformation logic.\n3.  Adjust the transformation logic to work directly with this numerical sequence.\n4.  Assume the output should also be a numerical sequence (list or array), and remove the string formatting step (`format_output`) unless explicitly required by the execution environment later.\n5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this direct handling of numerical sequences.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe error occurred during input parsing, before the core transformation logic was executed. Therefore, the previously observed metrics regarding the transformation itself remain valid:\n\n*   **Input Sequence Length:** 12\n*   **Output Sequence Length:** 12\n*   **Shift Amount:** +4 positions (to the right)\n*   **Padding:** 4 leading zeros are introduced.\n*   **Truncation:** Elements originally at indices 8, 9, 10, 11 of the input are effectively lost.\n\nThe critical new metric is:\n*   **Input Data Type:** NumPy array (or potentially a standard Python list behaving similarly).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
