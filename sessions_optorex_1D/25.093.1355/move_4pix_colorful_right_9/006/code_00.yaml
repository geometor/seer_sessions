task_description: "Shift the content of a 12-element integer sequence 4 positions to the right, padding the beginning with zeros and truncating elements shifted beyond the end."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - role: input
      - type: list or array
      - data_type: integer
      - length: 12
      - name: input_sequence
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - role: output
      - type: list or array
      - data_type: integer
      - length: 12
      - name: output_sequence
constants:
  - name: sequence_length
    value: 12
  - name: shift_amount
    value: 4
  - name: padding_value
    value: 0
relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    details: "Input element at index `i` (where 0 <= i < 8) maps to output element at index `i + 4`."
actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    target: output_sequence
    using:
      length: sequence_length
      value: padding_value
    details: "Create a sequence of length 12 filled with 0."
  - action: copy_slice
    source: input_sequence
    source_start_index: 0
    source_end_index: "sequence_length - shift_amount" # index 8 (exclusive)
    destination: output_sequence
    destination_start_index: shift_amount # index 4
    destination_end_index: sequence_length # index 12 (exclusive)
    details: "Copies elements from input[0:8] to output[4:12]."
constraints:
  - type: truncation
    details: "Input elements at indices 8 through 11 are implicitly discarded as they are not included in the source slice."
  - type: padding
    details: "Output elements at indices 0 through 3 remain at their initial padding_value (0) because they are not part of the destination slice."
