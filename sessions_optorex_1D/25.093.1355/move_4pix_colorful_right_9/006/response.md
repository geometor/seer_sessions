**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code implementation failed across all examples with a broadcast error: `could not broadcast input array from shape (12,) into shape (8,)`. This error typically occurs in NumPy when trying to assign an array of one shape into a slice of an incompatible shape. In this specific case, it implies that the code attempted to assign a 12-element array into an 8-element slice.

Reviewing the previous code's logic:
`output_sequence[destination_start_index:destination_end_index] = source_slice`
where `destination_start_index = 4`, `destination_end_index = 12` (slice length 8), and `source_slice = input_sequence[0:8]` (slice length 8).

Logically, the shapes match (8 elements assigned to an 8-element slice). The simulation using `tool_code` confirmed this logic works correctly in isolation. Therefore, the error likely arises from an unexpected state of the `source_slice` variable within the execution environment where the tests were run, possibly holding the entire 12-element input array instead of the intended 8-element slice.

**Strategy:**

1.  Reaffirm the core transformation rule: Shift the first 8 elements of the 12-element input sequence 4 positions to the right, placing them in the last 8 positions of the output sequence. Pad the first 4 positions of the output with zeros.
2.  Simplify the implementation to directly perform the slice assignment without potentially problematic intermediate variables.
3.  Verify this refined logic against all examples.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's confirm the parameters for each example based on the shift rule.
`sequence_length = 12`
`shift_amount = 4`
`elements_to_copy = sequence_length - shift_amount = 8`
`source_indices = range(0, 8)`
`destination_indices = range(4, 12)`

| Example | Input Slice (idx 0-7)       | Output Slice (idx 4-11)     | Matches Expected Output? |
| :------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| train_1 | `[6 8 4 0 0 0 0 0]`       | `[6 8 4 0 0 0 0 0]`       | Yes                      |
| train_2 | `[0 0 0 3 1 2 2 1]`       | `[0 0 0 3 1 2 2 1]`       | Yes                      |
| train_3 | `[0 5 4 4 9 2 9 0]`       | `[0 5 4 4 9 2 9 0]`       | Yes                      |
| train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 6 9 6 0]`       | `[0 0 0 0 6 9 6 0]`       | Yes                      |
| train_5 | `[0 0 6 5 8 5 4 0]`       | `[0 0 6 5 8 5 4 0]`       | Yes                      |
| train_6 | `[0 0 4 8 8 0 0 0]`       | `[0 0 4 8 8 0 0 0]`       | Yes                      |
| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 1 8 3 0]`       | `[0 0 0 0 1 8 3 0]`       | Yes                      |

The analysis confirms that taking the first 8 elements of the input and placing them into the output starting at index 4 consistently produces the desired result for all training examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Establish the fixed parameters: the total sequence length is 12, and the right shift amount is 4.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initializing all elements to 0. This handles the required padding at the beginning.
3.  Copy the elements from the input sequence starting at index 0 and ending just before index (12 - 4) = 8.
4.  Place these copied elements into the output sequence, starting at index 4 and ending just before index 12.
5.  Return the resulting output sequence.
