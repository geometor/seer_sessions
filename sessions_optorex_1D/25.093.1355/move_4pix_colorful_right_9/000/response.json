They also contain a contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits (or potentially zeros within that block, e.g., `train_6`).\n*   **Transformation:** The core operation appears to be a positional shift of the entire sequence content to the right. The non-zero block maintains its relative structure but changes its starting position.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Comparing the start index of the non-zero block (or the first non-zero digit if easier to track) in the input versus the output reveals a consistent shift.\n    *   train\\_1: `6` at index 0 -> index 4 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_2: `3` at index 3 -> index 7 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_3: `5` at index 1 -> index 5 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_4: `6` at index 4 -> index 8 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_5: `6` at index 2 -> index 6 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_6: `4` at index 2 -> index 6 (shift +4)\n    *   train\\_7: `1` at index 4 -> index 8 (shift +4)\n    The shift is consistently 4 positions to the right.\n*   **Handling Boundaries:** Elements shifted beyond the end of the 12-element sequence are truncated (lost). The positions vacated at the beginning of the sequence are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
