"""
Transforms an input 1x12 grid (2D NumPy array) by shifting the elements 
within the single row 4 positions to the right. The first 4 positions 
(columns 0-3) of the output row are filled with 0s. The elements originally 
in columns 0-7 of the input row are moved to columns 4-11 of the output row, 
maintaining their relative order. Elements from columns 8-11 of the input
