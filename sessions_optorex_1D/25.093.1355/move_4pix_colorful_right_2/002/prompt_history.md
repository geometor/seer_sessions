**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of single digits. Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (12 digits). The core operation appears to be a positional shift of the entire sequence to the right. The digits themselves are preserved, but their positions change. Zeros act as padding elements, filling the spaces created at the beginning of the sequence due to the shift.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation
Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits
  Length: 12
  Elements: Digits (0-9)
Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits
  Length: 12
  Elements: Digits (0-9)
Transformation:
  Action: Right Shift
  Object: Entire input sequence
  Magnitude: 4 positions
  Padding:
    Character: '0'
    Location: Left end (positions 0 through 3)
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is the input sequence shifted 4 positions to the right.
  - The first 4 positions of the output sequence are filled with '0'.
  - The relative order of the digits from the input sequence is maintained in the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Treat the input string as a sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Shift the entire sequence 4 positions to the right.
3.  Fill the first 4 positions (indices 0, 1, 2, 3) of the resulting sequence with the digit '0'.
4.  The digits originally at indices 0 through 7 in the input will now occupy indices 4 through 11 in the output.
5.  Digits originally at indices 8 through 11 in the input are discarded (though this case isn't explicitly shown in the examples provided, it's implied by a fixed-length right shift).
6.  Format the resulting sequence as a string of space-separated digits.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 space-separated digits by shifting the 
entire sequence 4 positions to the right. The first 4 positions of the 
output sequence are filled with '0'. Digits originally at indices 0-7 of 
the input occupy indices 4-11 of the output. Digits originally at 
indices 8-11 are effectively discarded due to the fixed length and shift.

    # Split the input string into a list of digit characters
    input_digits = input_str.split(' ')

        # Or raise an error, depending on desired strictness
