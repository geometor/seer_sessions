**General Assessment:**

The provided code execution results indicate a consistent failure across all examples. The `transform` function, intended to perform a right shift by 4 positions on a sequence of 12 integers, produced an output sequence of all zeros (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) for every input.

The discrepancy arises because the previous code included an `_unwrap_input` helper function with error handling that defaulted to returning an all-zero list upon encountering an unexpected input format. The test environment likely passed the input in a format (potentially `List[List[int]]` representing a 1x12 grid, common in ARC tasks) that triggered this error handling.

The core logic observed across all input/output pairs remains consistent: a rightward shift of the sequence elements by 4 positions, with the leftmost 4 positions being filled with zeros, and any elements shifted beyond the 12th position being truncated.

**Strategy:**

1.  Assume the standard ARC input format for a 1D sequence is a nested list representing a grid, specifically `List[List[int]]` with shape `(1, 12)`.
2.  Modify the transformation logic to directly access the single row (the inner list) from the input.
3.  Remove or simplify the potentially problematic `_unwrap_input` function and its error handling that produced the all-zero default.
4.  Reaffirm the transformation rule (right shift by 4) in the documentation and natural language program.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics summarize the deviation between the *expected* output and the *actual* (all zeros) output generated by the previous code attempt:

| Example       | Input Sequence                | Expected Output                 | Actual Output (Previous Code) | Pixels Off | Notes                                     |
| :------------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| train\_1      | `3 2 8 6 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 3 2 8 6 1 1 1 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 7          | 7 non-zero elements missing in output.    |
| train\_2      | `0 9 1 3 4 9 1 2 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 9 1 3 4 9 1 2`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 7          | 7 non-zero elements missing in output.    |

| train\_4      | `7 4 3 3 2 8 9 0 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 7 4 3 3 2 8 9 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 7          | 7 non-zero elements missing in output.    |
| train\_5      | `0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 1          | 1 non-zero element missing in output.     |
| train\_6      | `7 4 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 7 4 3 4 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 4          | 4 non-zero elements missing in output.    |
| train\_7      | `0 2 3 4 2 8 7 4 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 2 8 7 4`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 7          | 7 non-zero elements missing in output.    |
| test\_1       | `0 0 0 4 1 7 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 7 0 0`     | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`     | 3          | 3 non-zero elements missing in output.    |

The 'Pixels Off' count directly corresponds to the number of elements that should have been non-zero in the correctly transformed sequence but were instead zero in the actual output. This confirms the code failed to perform the shift and instead defaulted to zeros, likely due to input format issues.

      value: 12

Actions:
  - Extract_Sequence:
      actor: System
      object: Input_Grid
      result: Input_Sequence (Input_Grid[0])
  - Initialize_Output:
      actor: System
      length: Sequence_Length

      actor: System
      source: Input_Sequence
      destination: Output_Sequence
      shift: Shift_Amount
      length: Sequence_Length
      details: For each index `i` from 0 to `Sequence_Length - Shift_Amount - 1`, copy `Input_Sequence[i]` to `Output_Sequence[i + Shift_Amount]`.
      truncation: Elements from `Input_Sequence` at indices `Sequence_Length - Shift_Amount` or greater are implicitly discarded.
      padding: Leftmost `Shift_Amount` positions in `Output_Sequence` retain their initial Zero value.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: `Input_Sequence[i]` maps to `Output_Sequence[i + Shift_Amount]` if `i + Shift_Amount < Sequence_Length`.
  - Constraint: The length of `Input_Sequence` and `Output_Sequence` is fixed at `Sequence_Length` (12).
  - Structure: The effective `Input_Sequence` is the first (and only) element of the `Input_Grid`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Assume the input is provided as a grid (list of lists) with one row containing 12 integers. Extract this single row as the primary `input_sequence`.
2.  Define a constant shift amount `S` equal to 4.
3.  Define the fixed sequence length `L` equal to 12.
4.  Create a new `output_sequence` of length `L`, initially filled entirely with zeros.
5.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i`, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = L - S - 1` (inclusive, i.e., indices 0 through 7).
6.  For each element `input_sequence[i]` within this range:
    *   Calculate the target index `t` in the `output_sequence` as `t = i + S`.
    *   Assign the value `input_sequence[i]` to the element at index `t` in the `output_sequence` (`output_sequence[t] = input_sequence[i]`).
7.  Elements of the `input_sequence` at indices `L - S` (index 8) and higher are not copied, effectively truncating them.
8.  The first `S` (4) elements of the `output_sequence` retain their initial zero values, providing the left padding.
9.  Return the final `output_sequence`.
