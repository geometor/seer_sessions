Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[Integer]
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers (including 0)
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[Integer]
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers (including 0)
  - Element:
      type: Integer
  - Zero:
      type: Integer
      value: 0
  - Shift_Amount:
      type: Integer
      value: 4

Actions:
  - Shift_Right:
      actor: System
      object: Input_Sequence
      amount: Shift_Amount (4)
      result: Intermediate shifted sequence (potentially longer than 12)
  - Pad_Left:
      actor: System
      object: Intermediate shifted sequence
      padding_element: Zero
      count: Shift_Amount (4)
      result: Padded sequence (potentially longer than 12)
  - Truncate:
      actor: System
      object: Padded sequence
      position: Right end
      target_length: 12
      result: Output_Sequence

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each element `Input_Sequence[i]` maps to `Output_Sequence[i + Shift_Amount]` if `i + Shift_Amount < 12`.
  - Initialization: `Output_Sequence` starts conceptually as all Zeros.
  - Constraint: The length of both `Input_Sequence` and `Output_Sequence` is fixed at 12.
