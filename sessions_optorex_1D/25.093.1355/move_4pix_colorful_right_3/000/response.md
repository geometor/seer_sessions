**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on sequences of 12 integers. Each input sequence is transformed into an output sequence of the same length. The transformation appears to involve shifting the elements of the input sequence to the right by a fixed number of positions. The leftmost positions vacated by the shift are filled with zeros, and any elements shifted beyond the rightmost boundary (index 11) are discarded (truncated). Observing the examples, the shift amount seems consistently 4 positions to the right. Leading zeros in the input are treated the same as any other number during the shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[Integer]
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers (including 0)
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[Integer]
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers (including 0)
  - Element:
      type: Integer
  - Zero:
      type: Integer
      value: 0
  - Shift_Amount:
      type: Integer
      value: 4

Actions:
  - Shift_Right:
      actor: System
      object: Input_Sequence
      amount: Shift_Amount (4)
      result: Intermediate shifted sequence (potentially longer than 12)
  - Pad_Left:
      actor: System
      object: Intermediate shifted sequence
      padding_element: Zero
      count: Shift_Amount (4)
      result: Padded sequence (potentially longer than 12)
  - Truncate:
      actor: System
      object: Padded sequence
      position: Right end
      target_length: 12
      result: Output_Sequence

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each element `Input_Sequence[i]` maps to `Output_Sequence[i + Shift_Amount]` if `i + Shift_Amount < 12`.
  - Initialization: `Output_Sequence` starts conceptually as all Zeros.
  - Constraint: The length of both `Input_Sequence` and `Output_Sequence` is fixed at 12.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define a constant shift amount `S` equal to 4.
2.  Define the fixed length `L` equal to 12.
3.  Receive the input sequence of `L` integers.
4.  Create a new output sequence of length `L`, initially filled with zeros.
5.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 up to `L - 1`.
6.  For each element `input[i]` at index `i`:
    *   Calculate the target index `t` in the output sequence as `t = i + S`.
    *   If the target index `t` is less than the length `L`:
        *   Assign the value of `input[i]` to the element at index `t` in the output sequence (`output[t] = input[i]`).
7.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
