            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task operates on sequences of 12 integers. Each input sequence is transformed into an output sequence of the same length. The transformation appears to involve shifting the elements of the input sequence to the right by a fixed number of positions. The leftmost positions vacated by the shift are filled with zeros, and any elements shifted beyond the rightmost boundary (index 11) are discarded (truncated). Observing the examples, the shift amount seems consistently 4 positions to the right. Leading zeros in the input are treated the same as any other number during the shift.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
