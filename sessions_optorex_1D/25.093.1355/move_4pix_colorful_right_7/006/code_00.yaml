task_type: sequence_manipulation
input_type: list_of_integers (fixed length)
output_type: list_of_integers (fixed length)
sequence_length: 12
elements:
  - type: zero
    role: background/padding
  - type: non_zero_block
    description: The first contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers found when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - content: the sequence of non-zero integers within the block
      - start_index_input: the index where the block begins in the input sequence
      - length: the number of elements in the block
action:
  type: shift_and_replace
  details:
    - Identify the 'non_zero_block' in the input sequence.
    - If no block is found, the output is all zeros.
    - If a block is found:
        - Initialize an output sequence of the same length with all zeros.
        - Calculate a 'target_start_index' = 'start_index_input' + 4.
        - Place the 'content' of the 'non_zero_block' into the output sequence, starting at the 'target_start_index'.
        - Handle boundary conditions: If the shifted block extends beyond the sequence length, only the part that fits within the sequence boundaries is placed.
relationship: The output sequence contains the first non-zero block from the input, shifted 4 positions to the right, within a background of zeros. The relative order of elements within the block is preserved.
constraints:
  - Assumes only the *first* contiguous non-zero block matters if multiple exist.
  - Assumes sequence length is fixed at 12.
  - Shift amount is constant (4).
