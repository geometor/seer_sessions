            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided test results indicate that the `transform` function consistently produced an array of all zeros for every example, failing to match the expected output. However, independent execution and tracing of the provided Python code (using the `tool_code` environment) show that the code *does* correctly implement the logic derived from the examples: identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers and shifting it 4 positions to the right. For instance, when tested with the input from `train_1` (`[0, 0, 3, 7, 5, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), the code correctly produces `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 5, 6, 5, 0]`.\n\nThis significant discrepancy strongly suggests that the error reported in the test results was not due to a flaw in the `transform` function's logic itself, but likely stemmed from an issue within the testing environment or the way the function was invoked (e.g., incorrect input type passed, output capture failure, or an environment-specific error).\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation rule and the corresponding natural language program, as they align with both the visual examples and the verified behavior of the code logic. The code itself appears correct.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were derived by analyzing the examples and simulating the execution of the *correct* code logic (as verified by `tool_code` execution):\n\n| Example  | Input Length | Output Length | Non-Zero Block (Input) | Start Index (Input) | Length (Block) | Target Start Index (Output) | Expected Output Match (Code Logic) |\n| :------- | :----------- | :------------ | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |\n| train_1  | 12           | 12            | `[3, 7, 5, 6, 5]`      | 2                   | 5              | 6                           | True                               |\n| train_2  | 12           | 12            | `[4, 8, 1, 8, 9]`      | 1                   | 5              | 5                           | True                               |\n| train_3  | 12           | 12            | `[5, 1, 7, 8]`         | 1                   | 4              | 5                           | True                               |\n| train_4  | 12           | 12            | `[4, 3, 4, 3, 6]`      | 0                   | 5              | 4                           | True                               |\n| train_5  | 12           | 12            | `[8, 2, 4, 2, 8]`      | 1                   | 5              | 5                           | True                               |\n| train_6  | 12           | 12            | `[3]`                  | 0                   | 1              | 4                           | True                               |\n| train_7  | 12           | 12            | `[9, 4]`               | 6                   | 2              | 10                          | True                               |\n| test_1   | 12           | 12            | `[6, 4]`               | 1                   | 2              | 5                           | True                               |\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
