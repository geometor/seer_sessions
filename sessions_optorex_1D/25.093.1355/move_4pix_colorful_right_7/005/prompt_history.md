*   **Perception:** The task operates on fixed-length sequences of 12 integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The transformation involves relocating this non-zero block within the sequence while preserving the block itself and the surrounding zeros. The core action is a rightward shift of the non-zero block by a fixed amount.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_manipulation
    input_type: list_of_integers
    output_type: list_of_integers
    sequence_length: 12
    elements:
      - type: zero
        role: padding/background
      - type: non_zero_block
        description: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers.
        properties:
          - content: the sequence of non-zero integers
          - start_index_input: the index where the block begins in the input
          - length: the number of elements in the block
    action:
      type: shift
      direction: right
      amount: 4
      target: non_zero_block
    relationship: The output sequence is constructed by taking the input sequence, identifying the non_zero_block, and placing it in a new sequence (initially all zeros) starting at `start_index_input + 4`. The relative order of elements within the non_zero_block is preserved.
    constraints: Assumes only one contiguous non-zero block exists in the input. Assumes the shifted block fits within the sequence length of 12.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output sequence of length 12 with all zeros.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. Record its index as `start_index`.
    3.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero integers. Record this block of numbers as the `payload`.
    4.  Calculate the `target_start_index` by adding 4 to the `start_index`.
    5.  Place the `payload` into the output sequence, starting at the `target_start_index`.
    6.  Return the output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code, intended to shift a contiguous block of non-zero integers four positions to the right within a 12-element array, consistently fails across all training and test examples, producing an output array containing only zeros. The natural language program and the initial code logic correctly identified the core transformation rule (find non-zero block, shift right by 4). However, the implementation failed, suggesting a possible bug in either the function identifying the non-zero block (`find_non_zero_block_np`) or, more likely, the slicing and assignment logic within the main `transform` function. The manual trace suggests the logic *should* work, pointing towards a potential subtle implementation error or an issue within the testing environment not reflected in the code itself.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the understanding of the transformation rule by analyzing the examples computationally.
2.  Refine the factual description (YAML) to accurately capture the objects, properties, and actions based *only* on the input/output examples.
3.  Refine the natural language program to be precise about the intended transformation steps, ensuring clarity for the coder phase to reimplement or debug the function correctly.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's analyze each training example to confirm the expected start index, payload, and target start index for the shift.

**Findings from Metrics:**

The analysis using the `find_non_zero_block_np` logic confirms the expected start indices and payloads for the first contiguous non-zero block in each example. The calculated `Target Start` index (Input Start + 4) precisely matches the starting position of the non-zero block in the corresponding output examples. This reinforces the initial hypothesis that the transformation rule is indeed a rightward shift of the non-zero block by 4 positions. The failure observed in the previous execution was therefore due to an implementation error in the `transform` function's assignment logic, not an error in understanding the rule or in the `find_non_zero_block_np` logic itself.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_manipulation
input_type: list_of_integers
output_type: list_of_integers
sequence_length: 12
elements:
  - type: background
    value: 0
    role: padding
  - type: non_zero_block
    description: The first contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers found when scanning from left to right.
    properties:
      - content: The sequence of non-zero integers comprising the block.
      - start_index_input: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of integers in the block.
action:
  type: shift_and_replace
  target: non_zero_block
  details:
    - Create an output sequence of the same length as the input, initialized entirely with the background value (0).
    - Identify the `non_zero_block` (content and start_index_input) in the input sequence.
    - If no `non_zero_block` is found, the output remains the initialized background sequence.
    - Calculate the `target_start_index` for the output sequence by adding 4 to the `start_index_input`.
    - Place the `content` of the `non_zero_block` into the output sequence, starting at the `target_start_index`. Ensure the placement respects the bounds of the output sequence (length 12); if the shifted block would extend beyond index 11, only the part of the block that fits within the bounds [target_start_index, 11] is placed.
relationship: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by relocating the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers 4 positions to the right, preserving the block's content and replacing the original positions and shifted-over positions with zeros.
constraints:
  - Input sequences have a fixed length of 12.
  - Assumes at most one contiguous block of non-zero integers needs processing (or focuses only on the first one found).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initializing all elements to 0.
3.  Scan the input sequence from left to right (index 0 to 11) to find the first non-zero integer.
4.  If no non-zero integer is found, return the initialized output sequence (all zeros).
5.  If a non-zero integer is found at `start_index`, identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers starting from this index. Store this block of numbers as the `payload`.
6.  Calculate the target starting position for the `payload` in the output sequence: `target_start_index = start_index + 4`.
7.  Copy the integers from the `payload` into the output sequence, starting at `target_start_index`. Continue copying for the entire length of the `payload`, but stop if the index reaches the end of the output sequence (index 11).
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
