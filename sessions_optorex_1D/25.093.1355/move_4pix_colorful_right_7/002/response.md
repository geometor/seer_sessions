*   **General Assessment:** The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this. The core transformation logic (identifying a non-zero block and shifting it right by 4 positions) appears consistent with the examples based on visual inspection, but could not be validated by the code execution due to the type error.

*   **Strategy:** The primary strategy is to correct the input handling in the `transform` function. It should accept a NumPy array directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`.strip().split()`). The helper function `find_non_zero_block` should also be adjusted to work with a NumPy array or a list derived directly from it. Once the input type handling is fixed, the existing logic for finding and shifting the non-zero block can be applied and re-evaluated.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Execution Status: Failure on all 7 training examples.
    *   Error Type: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.
    *   Cause: The `transform` function was designed to process a space-separated string, but received a NumPy array.
    *   Logic Validation (Pre-computation): The core logic of shifting the first contiguous non-zero block right by 4 positions appears visually consistent across all 7 examples.
        *   Example 1: Block `[3 7 5 6 5]` at index 2 shifts to index 6.
        *   Example 2: Block `[4 8 1 8 9]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 3: Block `[5 1 7 8]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 4: Block `[4 3 4 3 6]` at index 0 shifts to index 4.
        *   Example 5: Block `[8 2 4 2 8]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 6: Block `[3]` at index 0 shifts to index 4.
        *   Example 7: Block `[9 4]` at index 6 shifts to index 10.

```yaml
    task_type: sequence_manipulation
    input_type: numpy_array_of_integers  # Corrected input type
    output_type: numpy_array_of_integers # Output should match input format
    sequence_length: 12
    elements:
      - type: zero
        role: padding/background
      - type: non_zero_block
        description: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero integers.
        properties:
          - content: the sequence of non-zero integers
          - start_index_input: the index where the block begins in the input array
          - length: the number of elements in the block
    action:
      type: shift
      direction: right
      amount: 4
      target: non_zero_block
    relationship: The output array is constructed by taking the input array, identifying the non_zero_block, and placing it in a new array (initially all zeros) starting at `start_index_input + 4`. The relative order of elements within the non_zero_block is preserved.
    constraints:
      - Assumes only one contiguous non-zero block exists in the input.
      - Assumes the shifted block fits within the sequence length of 12.
      - Input is provided as a NumPy array.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input sequence as a NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output NumPy array of length 12 with all zeros.
    3.  Scan the input array to find the first non-zero integer. Record its index as `start_index`. If no non-zero integer is found, return the initialized zero array.
    4.  Continue scanning from `start_index` to identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers (the `payload`). Determine its length.
    5.  Calculate the `target_start_index` by adding 4 to the `start_index`.
    6.  Copy the `payload` from the input array into the output array, starting at the `target_start_index`.
    7.  Return the output array.
