"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by identifying a single contiguous block of non-zero integers and shifting this block 4 positions to the right, preserving the block's content and the surrounding zeros.

1. Initialize an output sequence of length 12 with all zeros.
2. Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. Record its index as `start_index`.
3. Continue scanning from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of non-zero integers. Record this block of numbers as the `payload`.
4. Calculate the `target_start_index` by adding 4 to the `start_index`.
5. Place the `payload` into the output sequence, starting at the `target_start_index`.
6. Return the output sequence.
