*   **Perception:** The task operates on fixed-length sequences of 12 integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The transformation involves relocating this non-zero block within the sequence while preserving the block itself and the surrounding zeros. The core action is a rightward shift of the non-zero block by a fixed amount.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
*   **General Assessment:** The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this. The core transformation logic (identifying a non-zero block and shifting it right by 4 positions) appears consistent with the examples based on visual inspection, but could not be validated by the code execution due to the type error.

*   **Strategy:** The primary strategy is to correct the input handling in the `transform` function. It should accept a NumPy array directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`.strip().split()`). The helper function `find_non_zero_block` should also be adjusted to work with a NumPy array or a list derived directly from it. Once the input type handling is fixed, the existing logic for finding and shifting the non-zero block can be applied and re-evaluated.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Execution Status: Failure on all 7 training examples.
    *   Error Type: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`.
    *   Cause: The `transform` function was designed to process a space-separated string, but received a NumPy array.
    *   Logic Validation (Pre-computation): The core logic of shifting the first contiguous non-zero block right by 4 positions appears visually consistent across all 7 examples.
        *   Example 1: Block `[3 7 5 6 5]` at index 2 shifts to index 6.
        *   Example 2: Block `[4 8 1 8 9]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 3: Block `[5 1 7 8]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 4: Block `[4 3 4 3 6]` at index 0 shifts to index 4.
        *   Example 5: Block `[8 2 4 2 8]` at index 1 shifts to index 5.
        *   Example 6: Block `[3]` at index 0 shifts to index 4.
        *   Example 7: Block `[9 4]` at index 6 shifts to index 10.
