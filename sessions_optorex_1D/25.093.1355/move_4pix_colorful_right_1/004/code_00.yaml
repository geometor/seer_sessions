task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of numbers, defined by the first and last non-zero elements, within a fixed-length sequence."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    type: integer_sequence
    properties:
      length: 12
      role: input/output
      representation_note: "Visually appears as 1D, but implementation may need to handle framework-specific structures (e.g., 1x12 or 12x1 array) to avoid runtime errors."
  - object: segment
    type: sub_sequence
    definition: "The contiguous part of the input sequence starting from the index of the first non-zero element and ending at the index of the last non-zero element (inclusive)."
    properties:
      content: integers (including any zeros between the first and last non-zero element)
      relative_order: preserved
      existence: "Only defined if the input sequence contains at least one non-zero element."
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
  - type: transformation
    action: identify_segment_bounds
    input: input_sequence
    outputs: first_nz_index, last_nz_index
    condition: "Returns indicators (e.g., None) if no non-zero elements exist."
  - type: conditional_transformation
    condition: "Non-zero elements exist in input_sequence."

      - action: construct_output_sequence
        inputs: sequence_length, segment, target_start_index
        process: "Create a sequence of zeros of the defined length, then place the extracted segment starting at the target_start_index."
