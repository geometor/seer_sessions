"""
Identify the contiguous segment of the input NumPy array (length 12) starting from 
the index of the first non-zero integer and ending at the index of the last 
non-zero integer. Shift this entire segment exactly 4 positions to the right 
within a new NumPy array of the same shape and dtype, filling the remaining 
positions with zeros. If the input array contains only zeros, the output is 
identical to the input.
