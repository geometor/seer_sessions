All examples show lists of length 12.\n*   **Core Transformation:** The primary operation seems to be a spatial shift or relocation of a specific segment of the input list.\n*   **Identifying the Segment:** The segment being moved consists of the non-zero numbers and any zeros located between the first and last non-zero number.\n*   **Shift Characteristics:** The identified segment is moved to the right. The relative order of the numbers within the segment remains unchanged. The magnitude of the shift appears constant across all examples.\n*   **Padding:** The positions in the output list not occupied by the shifted segment are filled with zeros.\n\n**Analysis of the Shift:**\n\nLet's determine the exact shift amount.\n*   In `train_1`, the segment `[4, 6, 7]` starts at index 4 in the input and index 8 in the output. Shift = 8 - 4 = +4.\n*   In `train_2`, the segment `[4, 5, 6, 4, 5]` starts at index 0 in the input and index 4 in the output. Shift = 4 - 0 = +4.\n*   In `train_3`, the segment `[4, 7, 1, 7]` starts at index 3 in the input and index 7 in the output. Shift = 7 - 3 = +4.\n*   In `train_4`, the segment `[1, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8]` starts at index 0 in the input and index 4 in the output. Shift = 4 - 0 = +4.\n\nThe pattern holds: the segment containing all non-zero numbers (from the first non-zero to the last non-zero) is shifted exactly 4 positions to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
