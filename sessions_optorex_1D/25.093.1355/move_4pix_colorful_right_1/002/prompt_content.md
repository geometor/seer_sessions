Identify the contiguous segment of the input list starting from the first non-zero 
integer and ending at the last non-zero integer. Shift this entire segment exactly 
4 positions to the right within a list of the same total length (12), filling 
the remaining positions with zeros. If the input list contains only zeros, the
