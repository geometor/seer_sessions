            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement the hypothesized transformation rule: \"move the last non-zero element to the position of the first zero element\". However, the test results indicate that the transformation function consistently returned the original input sequence, failing all test cases. This suggests either a flaw in the implementation's conditional logic (causing it to always bypass the transformation steps) or an issue with type handling/comparison within the testing environment (e.g., comparing a list output to a NumPy array input incorrectly).\n\nThe core hypothesis derived from the examples\u2014moving the last non-zero element to the position just before the first block of zeros (i.e., at the index of the first zero)\u2014appears consistent across all provided input/output pairs upon manual re-inspection. Therefore, the strategy is to refine the description of this rule and its conditions, assuming the rule itself is correct but the previous implementation was flawed. We will ensure the natural language program is unambiguous.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nBased on manual inspection of the input/output pairs and the presumed correct transformation rule:\n\n*   **Consistency:** The transformation rule appears consistent across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Element Type:** All elements are single-digit non-negative integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged in all examples.\n    *   Example 1: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 2: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 3: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 4: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 5: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 6: 12 -> 12\n    *   Example 7: 12 -> 12\n*   **Element Conservation:** The multiset of elements (the count of each distinct number) is conserved between input and output in all examples.\n*   **Key Indices:**\n    *   **First Zero Index (Input):** 3, 4, 3, 6, 1, 1, 4\n    *   **Last Non-Zero Index (Input):** 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11\n    *   **Last Non-Zero Value (Input):** 5, 8, 2, 1, 2, 7, 2\n*   **Transformation Condition:** In all examples, the index of the last non-zero element is greater than or equal to the index of the first zero element, satisfying the condition for the move.\n*   **Result Mismatch (Reported):** The previous code execution reported a mismatch in all cases, consistently showing the original input as the transformed output, with \"Pixels Off: 2\". This suggests the moved element and the element originally at the insertion point were considered mismatched.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
