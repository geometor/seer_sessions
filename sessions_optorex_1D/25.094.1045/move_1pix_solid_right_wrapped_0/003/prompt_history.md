*   **Perception:** The task involves rearranging a sequence of single-digit numbers. The input and output sequences generally contain the same numbers but in a different order. The core operation seems to be moving a specific non-zero number from the end of the sequence to a position earlier in the sequence, specifically just before the first block of zeros. The identity of the non-zero number being moved seems consistently to be the last non-zero digit appearing in the input sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - sequence: a list of single-digit integers.
      - element: an integer within the sequence.
      - zero_element: an element with the value 0.
      - non_zero_element: an element with a value other than 0.
    properties:
      - position: the index of an element in the sequence.
      - value: the numerical value of an element.
      - is_last_non_zero: boolean property indicating if a non_zero_element is the last one encountered when scanning from the beginning or end of the sequence. (Specifically, the one with the highest index).
      - is_first_zero: boolean property indicating if a zero_element is the first one encountered when scanning from the beginning of the sequence.
    actions:
      - identify: locate elements based on properties (e.g., find the first zero, find the last non-zero).
      - remove: delete an element from the sequence at a specific position.
      - insert: add an element into the sequence at a specific position.
    relationships:
      - order: elements appear in a specific sequence.
      - location_relative_to_zeros: a non-zero element can be before, after, or within a block of zeros.
    transformation:
      - condition: The transformation occurs only if there is at least one zero and at least one non-zero element in the sequence.
      - step_1: Identify the value and original position (index) of the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
      - step_2: Identify the position (index) of the first zero element in the input sequence.
      - step_3: If the original position of the last non-zero element is already before the position of the first zero element, no change is made.
      - step_4: Otherwise, remove the identified last non-zero element from its original position.
      - step_5: Insert the removed element at the position identified as the first zero's location.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:** The primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is that the previous assumption about the input format was incorrect. The `transform` function expected a space-separated string, while the actual input appears to be a NumPy array or a similar list-like structure. The core transformation logic (moving the last non-zero element to the position of the first zero) seems consistent across the examples when manually applied. The strategy is to modify the input handling part of the transformation logic to accept a list or array directly, while keeping the core manipulation logic the same.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    The core logic was manually verified against each training example:
    *   **train_1:** Input `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. First 0 at index 3. Last non-zero (5) at index 11. 11 > 3. Move 5 from index 11 to index 3. Result: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_2:** Input `[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. First 0 at index 4. Last non-zero (8) at index 11. 11 > 4. Move 8 from index 11 to index 4. Result: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_3:** Input `[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. First 0 at index 3. Last non-zero (2) at index 11. 11 > 3. Move 2 from index 11 to index 3. Result: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_4:** Input `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`. First 0 at index 6. Last non-zero (1) at index 11. 11 > 6. Move 1 from index 11 to index 6. Result: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_5:** Input `[2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. First 0 at index 1. Last non-zero (2) at index 11. 11 > 1. Move 2 from index 11 to index 1. Result: `[2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_6:** Input `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]`. First 0 at index 1. Last non-zero (7) at index 11. 11 > 1. Move 7 from index 11 to index 1. Result: `[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches output.
    *   **train_7:** Input `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`. First 0 at index 4. Last non-zero (2) at index 11. 11 > 4. Move 2 from index 11 to index 4. Result: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`. Matches output.

    The logic holds for all provided training examples. The only necessary change is adapting to the correct input data type.
