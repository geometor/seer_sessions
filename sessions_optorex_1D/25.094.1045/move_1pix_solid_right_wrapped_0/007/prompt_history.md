*   **Perception:** The task involves rearranging a sequence of single-digit numbers. The input and output sequences generally contain the same numbers but in a different order. The core operation seems to be moving a specific non-zero number from the end of the sequence to a position earlier in the sequence, specifically just before the first block of zeros. The identity of the non-zero number being moved seems consistently to be the last non-zero digit appearing in the input sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - sequence: a list of single-digit integers.
      - element: an integer within the sequence.
      - zero_element: an element with the value 0.
      - non_zero_element: an element with a value other than 0.
    properties:
      - position: the index of an element in the sequence.
      - value: the numerical value of an element.
      - is_last_non_zero: boolean property indicating if a non_zero_element is the last one encountered when scanning from the beginning or end of the sequence. (Specifically, the one with the highest index).
      - is_first_zero: boolean property indicating if a zero_element is the first one encountered when scanning from the beginning of the sequence.
    actions:
      - identify: locate elements based on properties (e.g., find the first zero, find the last non-zero).
      - remove: delete an element from the sequence at a specific position.
      - insert: add an element into the sequence at a specific position.
    relationships:
      - order: elements appear in a specific sequence.
      - location_relative_to_zeros: a non-zero element can be before, after, or within a block of zeros.
    transformation:
      - condition: The transformation occurs only if there is at least one zero and at least one non-zero element in the sequence.
      - step_1: Identify the value and original position (index) of the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
      - step_2: Identify the position (index) of the first zero element in the input sequence.
      - step_3: If the original position of the last non-zero element is already before the position of the first zero element, no change is made.
      - step_4: Otherwise, remove the identified last non-zero element from its original position.
      - step_5: Insert the removed element at the position identified as the first zero's location.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Find the index of the *first* occurrence of the number 0 in the sequence. If no 0 is found, return the original sequence unchanged.
    3.  Find the index and value of the *last* non-zero number in the sequence. If no non-zero number is found, return the original sequence unchanged.
    4.  If the index of the last non-zero number is less than the index of the first 0, return the original sequence unchanged.
    5.  Otherwise, remove the last non-zero number from its original position.
    6.  Insert the removed number into the sequence at the index where the first 0 was found.
    7.  Return the modified sequence.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt's code failed across all examples, consistently returning the input sequence unchanged. Analysis using `tool_code` confirmed that for all provided examples, the conditions intended to trigger the transformation (presence of both zero and non-zero elements, and the last non-zero element not appearing before the first zero) were met. This indicates the core transformation logic (`pop` and `insert`) *should* have executed. The discrepancy between the expected code behavior (based on logic and traced examples) and the reported execution results (no change) suggests a potential issue outside the algorithm's core logic, possibly related to the execution environment, input/output handling, or a subtle implementation detail missed in the review.

However, adhering to the task of refining the understanding based on the provided examples and results, the most consistent hypothesis derived directly from comparing inputs and outputs remains: the element located at the index of the *last non-zero number* is moved to the index of the *first zero number*. The elements originally between the first zero index (inclusive) and the last non-zero index (exclusive) are shifted one position to the right to accommodate the inserted element.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** In all examples, a transformation *should* occur according to the previously defined logic (`pop` last non-zero, `insert` at first zero) because a first zero (`fzi`) and a last non-zero (`lnzi`) exist, and `lnzi` is never less than `fzi`.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - element: An integer within the sequence.
  - zero_element: An element with the value 0.
  - non_zero_element: An element with a value other than 0.

properties:
  - position: The zero-based index of an element in the sequence.
  - value: The numerical value of an element.
  - is_first_zero: Boolean property indicating if a zero_element has the lowest index among all zero_elements.
  - is_last_non_zero: Boolean property indicating if a non_zero_element has the highest index among all non_zero_elements.

actions:
  - find_first_zero_index: Locate the index of the first zero_element. Returns -1 if none exist.
  - find_last_non_zero: Locate the index and value of the non_zero_element with the highest index. Returns (-1, None) if none exist.
  - remove: Delete an element from the sequence at a specific index.
  - insert: Add an element into the sequence at a specific index, shifting subsequent elements to the right.

relationships:
  - order: Elements exist in a defined sequence based on their index.
  - relative_position: The index of the last non-zero element compared to the index of the first zero element.

transformation:
  - precondition_1: The sequence must contain at least one zero_element.
  - precondition_2: The sequence must contain at least one non_zero_element.
  - precondition_3: The index of the last non-zero element must be greater than or equal to the index of the first zero element.
  - step_1: Identify the index of the first zero element (`first_zero_index`).
  - step_2: Identify the index (`last_non_zero_index`) and value (`value_to_move`) of the last non-zero element.
  - step_3: If any precondition is not met, return the original sequence unchanged.
  - step_4: Otherwise, remove the element currently at `last_non_zero_index`.
  - step_5: Insert `value_to_move` into the sequence at `first_zero_index`.
  - step_6: Return the modified sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Find the index of the *first* occurrence of the number 0 (`first_zero_index`).
3.  Find the index (`last_non_zero_index`) and value (`value_to_move`) of the *last* non-zero number in the sequence.
4.  Check the conditions for performing a transformation:
    *   If no 0 was found (`first_zero_index` is -1), return the original sequence.
    *   If no non-zero number was found (`last_non_zero_index` is -1), return the original sequence.
    *   If the index of the last non-zero number is less than the index of the first 0 (`last_non_zero_index < first_zero_index`), return the original sequence.
5.  If none of the above conditions for returning early are met:
    a.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
    b.  Remove the element from the copy at the `last_non_zero_index`.
    c.  Insert the `value_to_move` into the copy at the `first_zero_index`.
    d.  Return the modified sequence copy.
