"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by finding the last non-zero element 
and moving it to the position of the first zero element, provided the last 
non-zero element's index is not already less than the first zero's index. 
If no zeros or no non-zero elements are found, or if the last non-zero 
element is already before the first zero, the original sequence is returned 
unchanged.
