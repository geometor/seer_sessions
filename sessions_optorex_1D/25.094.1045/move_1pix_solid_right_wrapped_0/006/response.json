            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt's code failed across all examples, consistently returning the input sequence unchanged. Analysis using `tool_code` confirmed that for all provided examples, the conditions intended to trigger the transformation (presence of both zero and non-zero elements, and the last non-zero element not appearing before the first zero) were met. This indicates the core transformation logic (`pop` and `insert`) *should* have executed. The discrepancy between the expected code behavior (based on logic and traced examples) and the reported execution results (no change) suggests a potential issue outside the algorithm's core logic, possibly related to the execution environment, input/output handling, or a subtle implementation detail missed in the review.\n\nHowever, adhering to the task of refining the understanding based on the provided examples and results, the most consistent hypothesis derived directly from comparing inputs and outputs remains: the element located at the index of the *last non-zero number* is moved to the index of the *first zero number*. The elements originally between the first zero index (inclusive) and the last non-zero index (exclusive) are shifted one position to the right to accommodate the inserted element.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to verify the conditions for transformation in the provided examples:\n\n"
