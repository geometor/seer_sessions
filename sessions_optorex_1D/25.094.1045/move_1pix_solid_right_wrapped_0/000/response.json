The core operation seems to be moving a specific non-zero number from the end of the sequence to a position earlier in the sequence, specifically just before the first block of zeros. The identity of the non-zero number being moved seems consistently to be the last non-zero digit appearing in the input sequence.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
