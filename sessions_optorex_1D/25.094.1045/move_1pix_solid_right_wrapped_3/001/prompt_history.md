*   **Perception of task elements:**
    *   The input and output are both 1-dimensional sequences (lists) of single digits.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant between input and output.
    *   The transformation appears to involve a localized shift or rearrangement of elements based on adjacent values.
    *   Specifically, the transformation seems triggered by the first instance where an element differs from the element immediately following it.
    *   The element triggering the change (the first element in the differing pair) seems to be inserted just after its original position, causing a rightward shift of subsequent elements, and the very last element of the original sequence is discarded.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - sequence:
          description: A 1-dimensional list of single-digit integers.
          properties:
            - length: The number of digits in the sequence.
            - elements: The individual digits.
      - digit:
          description: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - index:
          description: The position of a digit within the sequence (zero-based).
    actions:
      - find_first_difference:
          description: Iterate through the sequence to find the first index 'i' where the digit at 'i' is not equal to the digit at 'i+1'.
          inputs: sequence
          output: index 'i' or indication none found.
      - remove_last_element:
          description: Delete the digit at the final index of the sequence.
          inputs: sequence
          output: modified sequence.
      - insert_element:
          description: Place a given digit into the sequence at a specified index.
          inputs:
            - sequence
            - digit_to_insert
            - target_index
          output: modified sequence.
    relationships:
      - inequality: Used to compare adjacent digits to trigger the transformation.
    transformation_trigger:
      - condition: Existence of an index 'i' such that sequence[i] != sequence[i+1].
      - location: The first such index 'i' encountered when scanning from left to right.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Scan the sequence from left to right, comparing each digit (`current_digit` at index `i`) with the next digit (`next_digit` at index `i+1`).
    3.  Find the first index `i` where `current_digit` is different from `next_digit`.
    4.  If no such index `i` is found (i.e., all digits in the sequence are identical, or the sequence has fewer than two digits), return the original sequence unchanged.
    5.  If such an index `i` is found:
        a.  Make a copy of the input sequence.
        b.  Remember the `current_digit` (the digit at the identified index `i`).
        c.  Remove the last digit from the copied sequence.
        d.  Insert the remembered `current_digit` into the copied sequence at index `i+1`.
        e.  Return the modified copied sequence.
