The position of this swap seems determined by the first encountered boundary between a zero and a non-zero element when scanning from left to right.\n4.  **Zero Blocks:** Contiguous blocks of zeros are treated as units in relation to adjacent non-zeros. The specific zero involved in the swap depends on whether the non-zero element precedes or succeeds the zero block.\n5.  **Conservation:** The number of elements and the counts of each specific digit remain the same between input and output; only their positions change.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
