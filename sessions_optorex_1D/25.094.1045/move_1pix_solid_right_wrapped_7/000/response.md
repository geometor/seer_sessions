Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

## Perception

1.  **Data Type:** The input and output are both sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences contain zeros (`0`) and non-zero digits (e.g., `4`, `6`, `7`, `8`).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve a single swap operation between a zero and an adjacent non-zero digit. The position of this swap seems determined by the first encountered boundary between a zero and a non-zero element when scanning from left to right.
4.  **Zero Blocks:** Contiguous blocks of zeros are treated as units in relation to adjacent non-zeros. The specific zero involved in the swap depends on whether the non-zero element precedes or succeeds the zero block.
5.  **Conservation:** The number of elements and the counts of each specific digit remain the same between input and output; only their positions change.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Transform a sequence of integers based on the first zero/non-zero boundary.

Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The input and output data structure.
  - name: Element
    type: int
    description: Individual integer within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (e.g., 0, 4, 6, 7, 8).
      - type: derived property - either 'zero' or 'non-zero'.
      - index: Position within the sequence.
  - name: Zero Block
    type: List[Element]
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence of zero elements.
    properties:
      - start_index: Index of the first zero in the block.
      - end_index: Index of the last zero in the block.
  - name: Boundary
    type: Tuple[int, int]
    description: The pair of adjacent indices (i, i+1) where the zero/non-zero status changes between elements.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Elements at index `i` and `i+1` are adjacent.
  - Boundary Type:
    - Type 1: Non-zero element at index `i` followed by a zero element at index `i+1`.
    - Type 2: Zero element at index `i` followed by a non-zero element at index `i+1`.

Actions:
  - Scan: Iterate through the sequence from left to right (index `i` from 0 to length-2).
  - Find Boundary: Identify the first index `i` where `sequence[i]` and `sequence[i+1]` differ in their zero/non-zero status.
  - Identify Block Start (for Type 2 Boundary): Find the starting index `k` of the contiguous zero block ending at index `i`.
  - Swap: Exchange the values of two elements at specified indices based on the identified boundary type.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Iterate through the sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element, examining pairs of adjacent elements at indices `i` and `i+1`.
3.  Find the *first* index `i` where the element at `i` and the element at `i+1` have different zero/non-zero statuses (one is zero, the other is non-zero). This is the "boundary".
4.  Once the first boundary at index `i` is found, determine the type of boundary:
    a.  **If the element at `i` is non-zero and the element at `i+1` is zero (Type 1 Boundary):** Swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `i+1`.
    b.  **If the element at `i` is zero and the element at `i+1` is non-zero (Type 2 Boundary):**
        i.  Find the starting index `k` of the contiguous block of zeros that ends at the current index `i
