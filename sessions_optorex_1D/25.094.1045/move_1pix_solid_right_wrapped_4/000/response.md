Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both lists (or sequences) of integers, always of the same length (12 in the examples). The core transformation seems to involve the number `0`. The positions of the `0`s in the input dictate the structure of the output. Specifically, the locations where `0`s were present seem to shift one position to the right, wrapping around from the last position to the first. The non-zero numbers fill the remaining positions, maintaining their original relative order.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12)
      - elements: integers
  - name: output_list
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - length: same as input_list
      - elements: integers derived from input_list
  - name: zero_element
    type: int
    value: 0
    role: marker for positional shift
  - name: non_zero_element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: != 0
      - role: preserves value, position determined by zero_element shifts

actions:
  - name: identify_zero_indices
    input: input_list
    output: list of indices where input_list element is 0
  - name: identify_non_zero_elements
    input: input_list
    output: ordered list of (value, original_index) pairs for non-zero elements
  - name: calculate_target_zero_indices
    input: list of zero indices, length of input_list
    process: map each index `i` to `(i + 1) % length`
    output: list of target indices for zeros in the output_list
  - name: determine_non_zero_target_indices
    input: list of target zero indices, length of input_list
    process: find all indices not present in the target zero indices list
    output: sorted list of target indices for non-zero elements
  - name: construct_output_list
    inputs:
      - target_zero_indices
      - non_zero_elements (ordered list of values)
      - non_zero_target_indices (sorted)
      - length of list
    process: |
      1. Create an empty list of the specified length.
      2. Place the non_zero_elements into the output list at the non_zero_target_indices, maintaining their relative order.
      3. Place the zero_element (0) into the output list at the target_zero_indices.
    output: output_list

relationships:
  - The set of indices occupied by `zero_element` in `output_list` is a right-shifted (by 1, with wrap-around) version of the set of indices occupied by `zero_element` in `input_list`.
  - The relative order of `non_zero_element` values is preserved between `input_list` and `output_list`.
  - The `output_list` is a permutation of the `input_list` elements, constrained by the shift rule for `zero_element`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output list of the same size as the input list.
2.  Create a list of the indices where the input list contains the value `0`.
3.  Create an ordered list of the values of all non-zero elements from the input list, maintaining their original relative sequence.
4.  Calculate the target indices for the `0`s in the output list: for each index `i` found in step 2, compute the target index `j` as `(i + 1) modulo L`, where `L` is the length of the input list.
5.  Determine the available indices for the non-zero elements in the output list: these are all indices from `0` to `L-1` that are *not* included in the target indices calculated in step 4. Sort these available indices in ascending order.
6.  Populate the output list:
    a.  Place the ordered non-zero values (from step 3) into the output list at the corresponding available indices (from step 5).
    b.  Place the value `0` into the output list at each of the target indices calculated in step 4.
7.  Return the fully populated output list.
