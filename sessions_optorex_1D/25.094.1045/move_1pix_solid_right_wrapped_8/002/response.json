            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified from the previous execution results is the incorrect assumption about the input data type. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the input is a NumPy array (or a similar list-like structure), not a space-separated string.\n\nThe strategy is to correct this assumption:\n1.  Modify the initial step to accept the input as a list or NumPy array of integers directly, eliminating the string parsing (`.split()`).\n2.  Re-verify the core transformation logic (finding the difference, identifying the segment boundaries, rotating the segment) with the understanding that the data is already in a sequence format. Based on a manual review of the examples (as detailed in the thought process), the core logic seems robust and correctly explains the transformation in all provided training cases.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the correct input type and maintain the established transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nThe code execution failed due to a type error before the core logic could be tested. However, a manual walkthrough confirms the segment identification and rotation logic for each training example:\n\n| Example | Input Array                                  | First Diff Idx (i) | Anchor Value | Segment Start (i+1) | Segment End (j) | Segment                     | Rotated Segment             | Expected Output                              | Matches |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------ |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 2                  | 0            | 3                     | 6               | `[6,6,6,0]`                 | `[0,6,6,6]`                 | `[0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0]`                  | 7                  | 0            | 8                     | 10              | `[9,9,0]`                   | `[0,9,9]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_3 | `[0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 0                  | 0            | 1                     | 4               | `[6,6,6,0]`                 | `[0,6,6,6]`                 | `[0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_4 | `[4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]`                  | 4                  | 4            | 5                     | 8               | `[0,0,0,4]`                 | `[4,0,0,0]`                 | `[4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_5 | `[5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5]`                  | 5                  | 5            | 6                     | 7               | `[0,5]`                     | `[5,0]`                     | `[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0]`                  | 6                  | 0            | 7                     | 9               | `[4,4,0]`                   | `[0,4,4]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0]`                  | Yes     |\n| train_7 | `[5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]`                  | 2                  | 5            | 3                     | 11              | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5]`       | `[5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`       | `[5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | Yes     |\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule holds across all examples once the input type is correctly handled.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
