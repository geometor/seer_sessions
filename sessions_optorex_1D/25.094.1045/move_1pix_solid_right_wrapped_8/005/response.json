Find the first index `i` where an element differs from its immediate successor.\n2. If no such difference exists or the sequence is too short, return the original sequence.\n3. Identify the value at index `i` as the `anchor_value`.\n4. Define a segment starting from the index `i + 1` (`start_index`).\n5. Find the first index `j` (`end_index`), where `j >= start_index`, such that the element's value equals the `anchor_value`.\n6. Extract this segment (from `start_index` to `end_index`, inclusive).\n7. Perform a right rotation on the extracted segment (move the last element to the front, shifting others right).\n8. Reconstruct the sequence by concatenating the part before the segment, the rotated segment, and the part after the segment.\n9.
