objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The input sequence of numbers.
  - name: anchor_value
    type: integer
    description: The value of the element at the first index where a difference with the next element occurs.
  - name: segment
    type: sub-list of integers
    description: The contiguous portion of the sequence identified for rotation. It starts immediately after the first differing element and ends at the next element matching the anchor_value.
properties:
  - name: index
    type: integer
    description: Position of an element in the sequence (0-based).
  - name: value
    type: integer
    description: The numerical value of an element.
  - name: first_difference_index
    type: integer
    description: The index 'i' where sequence[i] != sequence[i+1] first occurs. -1 if no difference exists.
  - name: segment_start_index
    type: integer
    description: The index where the segment to be rotated begins (equals first_difference_index + 1).
  - name: segment_end_index
    type: integer
    description: The index where the segment to be rotated ends (the first index >= segment_start_index where sequence[index] == anchor_value).
relationships:
  - type: adjacent_difference
    description: Comparing sequence[i] and sequence[i+1] to find the first inequality.
  - type: value_match
    description: Finding the next occurrence of anchor_value starting from segment_start_index.
actions:
  - name: find_first_difference
    input: sequence
    output: first_difference_index, anchor_value
    description: Identifies the index and value of the first element that differs from its successor. Returns -1 for index if no difference is found.
  - name: find_segment_end
    input: sequence, segment_start_index, anchor_value
    output: segment_end_index
    description: Finds the index of the first element, at or after segment_start_index, whose value matches the anchor_value.
  - name: extract_segment
    input: sequence, segment_start_index, segment_end_index
    output: segment
    description: Creates a new list containing elements from sequence[segment_start_index] up to and including sequence[segment_end_index].
  - name: rotate_segment_right
    input: segment
    output: rotated_segment
    description: Moves the last element of the segment to the first position, shifting others one step right.
  - name: replace_segment
    input: sequence, segment_start_index, segment_end_index, rotated_segment
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Rebuilds the sequence using the elements before the segment, the rotated_segment, and the elements after the segment.
