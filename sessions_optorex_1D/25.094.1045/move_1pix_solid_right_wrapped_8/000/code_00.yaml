objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents the input and output data.
  - name: segment
    type: sub-list of integers
    description: A contiguous portion of the main sequence identified for transformation.
properties:
  - name: index
    type: integer
    description: The position of an element within the sequence.
  - name: value
    type: integer
    description: The numerical value of an element (0-9).
  - name: length
    type: integer
    description: The total number of elements in the sequence.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Comparing the value of an element at index `i` with the element at index `i+1`.
  - type: equality_comparison
    description: Comparing the value of an element at one index with the value of an element at another index.
actions:
  - name: find_first_difference_index
    input: sequence
    output: index `i`
    description: Finds the smallest index `i` such that sequence[i] != sequence[i+1].
  - name: find_first_matching_value_index
    input: sequence, index `start`, value `val`
    output: index `j`
    description: Finds the smallest index `j` (j >= start) such that sequence[j] == val.
  - name: extract_segment
    input: sequence, start_index, end_index
    output: segment (sub-list)
    description: Creates a new list containing elements from the sequence between start_index and end_index (inclusive).
  - name: rotate_right
    input: segment
    output: rotated_segment
    description: Moves the last element of the segment to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.
  - name: replace_segment
    input: sequence, start_index, end_index, rotated_segment
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Replaces the elements in the original sequence from start_index to end_index with the elements from the rotated_segment.
