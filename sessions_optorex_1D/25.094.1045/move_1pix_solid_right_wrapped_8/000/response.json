These represent sequences or lists of integers.\n2.  **Consistency:** The length of the sequence remains the same between input and output. The set of unique digits present might change locally but appears globally consistent in most cases (except for the shifted values).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** Observing the changes between input and output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: a specific contiguous sub-sequence (segment) within the list undergoes a right rotation by one position.\n4.  **Identifying the Segment:** The segment to be rotated seems to be defined by the first location where adjacent elements differ. Specifically:\n    *   Find the first index `i` where `element[i]` is not equal to `element[i+1]`.\n    *   The segment starts at index `i+1`.\n    *   The segment ends at the first index `j` (where `j >= i+1`) such that `element[j]` is equal to `element[i]`.\n5.  **Rotation Mechanism:** The segment identified (from index `i+1` to `j` inclusive) is rotated rightwards. This means the element originally at index `j` moves to index `i+1`, and all other elements within the segment shift one position to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
