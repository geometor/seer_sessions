If no such difference exists or the sequence is too short, return the original sequence.\n3. Identify the value at index `i` as the `anchor_value`.\n4. Define a segment starting from the index `i + 1` (`start_index`).\n5. Find the first index `j` (`end_index`), where `j >= start_index`, such that the element's value equals the `anchor_value`.\n6. Extract this segment (from `start_index` to `end_index`, inclusive).\n7. Perform a right rotation on the extracted segment (move the last element to the front, shifting others right).\n8. Reconstruct the sequence by concatenating the part before the segment, the rotated segment, and the part after the segment.\n9. Return the modified sequence as a numpy array.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Helper function to find the first index where adjacent elements differ\ndef _find_first_difference_index(sequence: list) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the first index i where sequence[i] != sequence[i+1].\"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(sequence) - 1):\n        if sequence[i] != sequence[i+1]:\n            return i\n    return -1 # Indicate no difference found\n\n# Helper function to find the first index >= start_index matching a given value\ndef _find_first_matching_value_index(sequence: list, start_index: int, value_to_match: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Finds the first index j >= start_index where sequence[j] == value_to_match.\"\"\"\n    for j in range(start_index, len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[j] == value_to_match:\n            return j\n    # This case should ideally not be reached based on task description/examples,\n    # but returning -1 indicates it wasn't found.\n    return -1\n\n# Helper function to perform a right rotation on a list segment\ndef _rotate_right(segment: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Performs a right rotation on the segment (list).\"\"\"\n    if not segment or len(segment) <= 1:\n        return segment # No rotation needed for empty or single-element lists\n    # Moves the last element to the first position\n    return [segment[-1]] + segment[:-1]\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a segment rotation transformation to the input sequence.\n    Accepts a list or numpy array as input and returns a numpy array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a list for consistent manipulation, handle numpy arrays\n    if isinstance(input_sequence, np.ndarray):\n        sequence = input_sequence.tolist()\n    else:\n        # Assume it's already list-like, ensure it's a mutable list\n        sequence = list(input_sequence)\n\n    # Rule 2 (part 1): Handle sequences too short for comparison\n    if len(sequence) < 2:\n        return np.array(sequence) # Return as numpy array\n\n    # Rule 1: Find the first index `i` where the element differs from its successor\n    first_diff_index = _find_first_difference_index(sequence)\n\n    # Rule 2 (part 2): If no difference is found, return the original sequence\n    if first_diff_index == -1:\n        return np.array(sequence)\n\n    # Rule 3: Get the value at index `i`\n    anchor_value = sequence[first_diff_index]\n\n    # Rule 4: Define the start of the target segment\n    start_index = first_diff_index + 1\n\n    # Rule 5: Find the first index `j` >= start_index where the element matches anchor_value\n    end_index = _find_first_matching_value_index(sequence, start_index, anchor_value)\n\n    # Defensive check: handle case where matching anchor value isn't found\n    # (This shouldn't occur based on the problem's examples)\n    if end_index == -1:\n        # This indicates an unexpected input pattern or flaw in understanding\n        print(f\"Warning: Could not find matching anchor value {anchor_value} >= index {start_index}.
