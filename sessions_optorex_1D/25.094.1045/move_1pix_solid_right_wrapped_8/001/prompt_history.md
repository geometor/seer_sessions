Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings containing space-separated single digits (0-9). These represent sequences or lists of integers.
2.  **Consistency:** The length of the sequence remains the same between input and output. The set of unique digits present might change locally but appears globally consistent in most cases (except for the shifted values).
3.  **Core Transformation:** Observing the changes between input and output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: a specific contiguous sub-sequence (segment) within the list undergoes a right rotation by one position.
4.  **Identifying the Segment:** The segment to be rotated seems to be defined by the first location where adjacent elements differ. Specifically:
    *   Find the first index `i` where `element[i]` is not equal to `element[i+1]`.
    *   The segment starts at index `i+1`.
    *   The segment ends at the first index `j` (where `j >= i+1`) such that `element[j]` is equal to `element[i]`.
5.  **Rotation Mechanism:** The segment identified (from index `i+1` to `j` inclusive) is rotated rightwards. This means the element originally at index `j` moves to index `i+1`, and all other elements within the segment shift one position to the right.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Convert the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the first index `i` where the element at `i` is different from the element at `i + 1`. Store the value at index `i` as `anchor_value`.
3.  Define the start of the target segment as `start_index = i + 1`.
4.  Starting from `start_index`, find the first index `end_index` where the element's value is equal to `anchor_value`.
5.  Extract the sub-list (segment) from the main list, starting at `start_index` and ending at `end_index` (inclusive).
6.  Perform a right rotation on the extracted segment: move the last element of the segment to its beginning.
7.  Replace the elements in the original list from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive) with the elements of the rotated segment.
8.  Convert the modified list of integers back into a space-separated string for the output.
