objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single_digits (0-9)
actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_right
    input: sequence
    output: transformed_sequence
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 1
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: output_sequence is the result of applying a single cyclic shift to the right on the input_sequence.
  - type: element_mapping
    description: The element at index 'i' in the output sequence corresponds to the element at index '(i-1) mod length' in the input sequence. Specifically, output[0] = input[last_index], and output[i] = input[i-1] for i > 0.
