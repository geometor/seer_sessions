Each input is a list of 12 digits, containing varying numbers and arrangements of zeros and non-zero digits. The output is also a list of 12 digits, representing a rearrangement of the input digits. The core operation appears to be a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Observing the pairs, the last digit in the input sequence consistently appears as the first digit in the output sequence, and the remaining digits from the input shift one position to the right to fill the subsequent positions in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
