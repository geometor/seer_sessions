            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary reason for the errors across all examples is an input type mismatch. The previous code assumed the input `input_str` was a string and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array directly. The underlying logic for identifying the longest block of zeros and performing the conditional element move appears sound based on a manual review of the examples against the previously defined rules. The strategy is to correct the implementation to handle NumPy array inputs and operations, while keeping the core transformation logic intact.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    The provided code failed during the initial input processing step (`seq = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]`) for all examples due to the type mismatch. Therefore, execution did not reach the core logic to generate metrics about block finding or element moving. However, simulating the logic manually or with corrected code snippets confirms the intended transformation for each case:\n\n    *   **Example 1:** Input `[0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 7 (length 5). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 5 at index 2. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 7) to index 2. Expected: `[0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input `[3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0]` at index 5 (length 3). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 3 at index 8. Move this 3 to the start of the block (index 5). Expected: `[3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input `[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 7 (length 5). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 4 at index 1. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 7) to index 1. Expected: `[0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 4:** Input `[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0]` at index 8 (length 4). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 1 at index 3. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 8) to index 3. Expected: `[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 5:** Input `[2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` at index 1 (length 8). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 2 at index 9. Move this 2 to the start of the block (index 1). Expected: `[2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 6:** Input `[6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 6 (length 5). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 6 at index 11. Move this 6 to the start of the block (index 6). Expected: `[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.\n    *   **Example 7:** Input `[4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0]` at index 6 (length 2). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 4 at index 8. Move this 4 to the start of the block (index 6). Expected: `[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4]`. Logic matches output.\n\n    **Conclusion:** The errors were solely due to incorrect handling of the input type (NumPy array vs. String). The transformation logic itself seems correct for all provided examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
