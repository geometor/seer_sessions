The transformation rule depends on whether this longest block of zeros is located at the very end of the sequence or not. Based on its position, either an element following the block is moved to the start of the block, or the first zero of the block is moved to the position of the first non-zero element preceding the block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
