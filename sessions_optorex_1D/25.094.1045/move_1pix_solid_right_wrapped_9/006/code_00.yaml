objects:
  - sequence:
      type: list of integers
      properties:
        - elements: single digits (0-9)
        - length
  - block_of_zeros:
      type: contiguous subsequence
      properties:
        - value: all elements are 0
        - start_index
        - end_index
        - length
  - element:
      type: integer
      properties:
        - value
        - index: position in sequence
        - is_zero: boolean
        - is_first_preceding_non_zero: boolean property relative to a block_of_zeros
        - is_immediately_following: boolean property relative to a block_of_zeros
properties:
  - is_longest: boolean property of a block_of_zeros, compared to other blocks_of_zeros
  - is_first: boolean property of a block_of_zeros, relevant when multiple blocks share the maximum length (determined by start_index)
  - is_at_end: boolean property of a block_of_zeros, true if block_end_index == sequence_length - 1
actions:
  - find_zero_blocks: Identify all contiguous blocks of zeros.
  - find_longest_block: Determine the block(s) with the maximum length.
  - select_first_longest_block: Choose the block with the maximum length that starts at the earliest index.
  - check_if_at_end: Determine if the selected block ends at the last index of the sequence.
  - find_first_preceding_non_zero_index: Find the index of the first non-zero element before a given block's start index. Defaults to index 0 if none exist.
  - identify_element_to_move:
      logic: |
        if selected_block is at end:
          element is the first zero of the block (at block_start_index).
        else:
          element is the one immediately following the block (at block_end_index + 1).
  - identify_target_insertion_index:
      logic: |
        if selected_block is at end:
          index is the result of find_first_preceding_non_zero_index (or 0 if none found).
        else:
          index is the start_index of the selected_block.
  - remove_element: Delete the identified element_to_move from its original position.
  - insert_element: Insert the removed element at the identified target_insertion_index.
relationships:
  - longest: Relationship between a block of zeros and all other blocks based on length.
  - first: Relationship between blocks of the same maximum length based on start_index.
  - preceding: Relationship between an element/index and a block based on position (index < block_start_index).
  - following: Relationship between an element/index and a block based on position (index == block_end_index + 1).
