*   **Perception:** The task operates on sequences of single-digit integers. The core operation involves identifying the longest contiguous block of zeros within the sequence. The transformation rule depends on whether this longest block of zeros is located at the very end of the sequence or not. Based on its position, either an element following the block is moved to the start of the block, or the first zero of the block is moved to the position of the first non-zero element preceding the block.

    1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of zeros within the input sequence.

    3.  Determine if the selected block of zeros ends at the last index of the sequence.
    4.  **If the block is at the end of the sequence:**
        a.  Find the index of the first element *before* the start of the block that has a non-zero value. If all preceding elements are zero, use index 0 as the target index.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary reason for the errors across all examples is an input type mismatch. The previous code assumed the input `input_str` was a string and attempted to use the `.split()` method. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array directly. The underlying logic for identifying the longest block of zeros and performing the conditional element move appears sound based on a manual review of the examples against the previously defined rules. The strategy is to correct the implementation to handle NumPy array inputs and operations, while keeping the core transformation logic intact.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    The provided code failed during the initial input processing step (`seq = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]`) for all examples due to the type mismatch. Therefore, execution did not reach the core logic to generate metrics about block finding or element moving. However, simulating the logic manually or with corrected code snippets confirms the intended transformation for each case:

    *   **Example 1:** Input `[0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 7 (length 5). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 5 at index 2. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 7) to index 2. Expected: `[0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 2:** Input `[3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0]` at index 5 (length 3). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 3 at index 8. Move this 3 to the start of the block (index 5). Expected: `[3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 3:** Input `[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 7 (length 5). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 4 at index 1. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 7) to index 1. Expected: `[0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 4:** Input `[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0]` at index 8 (length 4). Block is at the end. First preceding non-zero is 1 at index 3. Move the first 0 from the block (at index 8) to index 3. Expected: `[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 5:** Input `[2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` at index 1 (length 8). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 2 at index 9. Move this 2 to the start of the block (index 1). Expected: `[2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 6:** Input `[6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0 0 0 0]` at index 6 (length 5). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 6 at index 11. Move this 6 to the start of the block (index 6). Expected: `[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0]`. Logic matches output.
    *   **Example 7:** Input `[4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4]`. Longest zero block: `[0 0]` at index 6 (length 2). Block is not at the end. Element after block is 4 at index 8. Move this 4 to the start of the block (index 6). Expected: `[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4]`. Logic matches output.

    **Conclusion:** The errors were solely due to incorrect handling of the input type (NumPy array vs. String). The transformation logic itself seems correct for all provided examples.

          type: numpy.ndarray (1D)
          properties:
            - elements: single digits (0-9) integers
            - length: size of the array
      - block_of_zeros:
          type: contiguous subarray or slice
          properties:
            - value: all elements are 0
            - start_index: integer
            - end_index: integer (inclusive)
            - length: integer
      - element:
          type: integer
          properties:
            - value: 0-9
            - index: position (integer) in the sequence array
    properties:
      - is_longest: boolean property of a block_of_zeros, compared to other blocks_of_zeros
      - is_first: boolean property of a block_of_zeros, relevant when multiple blocks share the maximum length (selected based on lowest start_index)
      - position: indicates location relative to the array bounds or other elements (e.g., 'at_end', 'not_at_end', 'preceding', 'following')
      - is_non_zero: boolean property of an element (value != 0)
    actions:
      - find_zero_blocks: identify all contiguous blocks (subarrays) of zeros within the input array
      - find_longest_block: determine the block(s) with the maximum length; select the first occurring block if tied
      - check_position_at_end: determine if the selected block's end_index is the last index of the array
      - find_first_preceding_non_zero_index: locate the index of the first non-zero element before the block's start_index (defaults to 0 if none exist)
      - find_element_after_block: get the element at index `block_end_index + 1`
      - remove_element_at_index: delete an element from the array at a specific index (e.g., using `numpy.delete`)
      - insert_element_at_index: insert an element into the array at a specific index (e.g., using `numpy.insert`)
    relationships:
      - longest: comparison between blocks of zeros based on length
      - first: ordering of blocks with the same maximum length based on start_index
      - preceding: relationship between an index and a block's start_index
      - following: relationship between an index and a block's end_index
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of integers.
    2.  Identify all contiguous subarrays containing only zeros within the input array. Record their start index, end index (inclusive), and length.
    3.  If no zero blocks are found, return the original input array.
    4.  Find the block(s) with the greatest length. If there is a tie in length, select the block that starts at the earliest index.
    5.  Determine if the selected block of zeros ends at the last index of the input array (i.e., `block_end_index == array_length - 1`).
    6.  **If the block is at the end of the array:**
        a.  Search the portion of the array *before* the block's start index (`array[:block_start_index]`). Find the index of the *first* element in this preceding portion that has a non-zero value. If all elements before the block are zero, the target insertion index is 0.
        b.  Identify the element to move: the first zero of the selected block (the element at `block_start_index`).
        c.  Create a new array by removing the element at `block_start_index` from the original array.
        d.  Create the final output array by inserting the removed zero into the array from step 6c at the target index found in step 6a.
    7.  **If the block is *not* at the end of the array:**
        a.  Identify the element to move: the element immediately following the selected block (the element at `block_end_index + 1`).
        b.  Create a new array by removing the element at index `block_end_index + 1` from the original array.
        c.  Create the final output array by inserting the removed element into the array from step 7b at the `block_start_index`.
    8.  Return the modified NumPy array.
