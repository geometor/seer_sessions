objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (N,) # 1-dimensional array
      - dtype: int # Contains integers
      - length: N # Where N=12 in the examples
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (N,) # Same shape as input
      - dtype: int # Same data type as input
      - length: N # Same length as input
actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_right
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    parameter: shift_amount (integer, value=1)
    output: output_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    description: Moves each element one position to the right along the array axis, with the last element wrapping around to become the first element. This can be achieved using numpy.roll(array, shift=1).
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: Apply cyclic_shift_right with shift_amount=1 to input_sequence.
