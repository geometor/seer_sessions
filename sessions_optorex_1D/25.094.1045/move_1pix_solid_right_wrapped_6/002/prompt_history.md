*   **Perception of Elements:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The digits themselves are not changed, only their positions within the sequence. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement operation applied uniformly to the entire sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list
        properties:
          - contains: single_digit_integers
          - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list
        properties:
          - contains: single_digit_integers
          - length: same as input_sequence
    actions:
      - name: cyclic_shift_right
        input: input_sequence
        parameter: shift_amount (integer, value=1)
        output: output_sequence
        description: Moves each element one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to become the first element.
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        from: input_sequence
        to: output_sequence
        rule: Apply cyclic_shift_right with shift_amount=1 to input_sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Perform a cyclic shift (rotation) of the entire sequence one position to the right. This means the element at the last position moves to the first position, and every other element moves one position to its right.
    3.  The resulting sequence after the shift is the output sequence.
```python
"""
Performs a cyclic shift (rotation) of the entire input sequence one position to the right.
The element at the last position moves to the first position, and every other element moves 
one position to its right.
"""

import collections

def transform(input_str: str) -> str:
    """

    Args:
        input_str: A string containing space-separated single-digit integers.

    Returns:

        space-separated.
    """
    # Split the input string into a list of elements (strings)
    input_list = input_str.split()

    # Handle empty or single-element lists (no shift possible/needed)
    if len(input_list) <= 1:
        return input_str

    # Perform the cyclic right shift
    # 1. Get the last element
    last_element = input_list[-1]
    
    # 2. Get all elements except the last one
    remaining_elements = input_list[:-1]
    
    # 3. Construct the output list by placing the last element at the beginning
    output_list = [last_element] + remaining_elements
    
    # Join the elements of the output list back into a space-separated string
    output_str = " ".join(output_list)
