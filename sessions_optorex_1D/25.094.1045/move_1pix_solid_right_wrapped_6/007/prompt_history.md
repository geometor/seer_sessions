*   **Perception of Elements:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The digits themselves are not changed, only their positions within the sequence. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement operation applied uniformly to the entire sequence.

## General Assessment

The provided results indicate that the previously generated code, which implemented `np.roll(input_grid, shift=1)`, failed to produce the expected output for all training examples. Specifically, the "Transformed Output" reported in the results seems identical to the original "Input" for each case, suggesting either the transformation wasn't applied or there was an error in the testing/reporting mechanism.

However, a manual re-analysis of the input/output pairs strongly suggests that the transformation rule *is* indeed a simple cyclic right shift of the entire sequence by one position. The `np.roll(input_grid, shift=1)` function correctly implements this logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify `np.roll`:** Use code execution to confirm that `np.roll(..., shift=1)` produces the correct output for the given examples. This will help determine if the issue was in the original code's logic or in the execution/reporting process.
2.  **Re-state Hypothesis:** If `np.roll` is confirmed to work correctly, maintain the original hypothesis: the transformation is a cyclic right shift of the entire sequence by 1.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on the confirmed hypothesis, ensuring clarity and accuracy. Assume the previous execution report was erroneous.

## Metrics Verification

Let's verify the output of `np.roll(..., shift=1)` for a few examples.

output_arr_1 = np.roll(input_arr_1, shift=1)
expected_arr_1 = np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0])

print(f"Example 1 Expected:       {expected_arr_1}")
print(f"Example 1 Match:          {match_1}\n")

# Example 2

Example 7 Match:          True


```
**Findings from Metrics:** The code execution confirms that `np.roll(input_array, shift=1)` correctly performs the transformation observed in the examples. The previously reported failures were likely due to an issue unrelated to the transformation logic itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Perform a single cyclic rotation (right shift) on the entire sequence.
3.  To achieve this, move the element currently at the last position to the first position.
4.  Shift every other element one position to the right (element at index `i` moves to index `i+1`).
5.  Return the resulting sequence.
