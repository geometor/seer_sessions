objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list or 1D_array
    properties:
      - contains: single_digit_integers
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - ordered: True
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list or 1D_array
    properties:
      - contains: single_digit_integers (same elements as input, potentially reordered)
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - ordered: True
actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_right
    input: input_sequence
    parameter: shift_amount (integer, value=1)
    output: output_sequence
    description: Moves each element in the input sequence one position to the right. The element originally at the last position wraps around to become the first element of the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: Apply the cyclic_shift_right action with shift_amount=1 to the entire input_sequence to generate the output_sequence.
constraints:
  - The transformation preserves the elements and the length of the sequence.
  - The transformation applies uniformly to the whole sequence.
