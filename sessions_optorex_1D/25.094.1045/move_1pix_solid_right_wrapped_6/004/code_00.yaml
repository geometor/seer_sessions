objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
      - elements: single_digit_integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: same integers as input_sequence, but rearranged
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by performing a cyclic shift (rotation) of all elements one position to the right.
actions:
  - name: cyclic_right_shift
    input: sequence (list_of_integers)
    parameter: shift_amount (integer, fixed value = 1)
    output: new_sequence (list_of_integers)
    description: Moves the element at the last index of the input sequence to the first index (index 0) of the output sequence. Moves every other element from index `i` in the input sequence to index `i+1` in the output sequence.
