*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input consists of a sequence of integers (specifically 0, 1, and 2) separated by spaces.
    *   The output also consists of a sequence of integers (0, 1, and 2) separated by spaces.
    *   The length of the input sequence and the output sequence is the same in all provided examples (12 elements).
    *   The core transformation appears to be related to the order of the elements.
    *   In almost all examples (1 through 6), the output sequence contains the exact same numbers as the input sequence, but sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
    *   Example `train_7` shows a discrepancy: the input has four 0s, four 1s, and four 2s, while the output has five 0s, four 1s, and three 2s. However, the output is still sorted. Given the consistency of the first six examples, this discrepancy might be an error in the example data itself. The dominant pattern is sorting.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Sort a sequence of integers.
    input_format: A string containing space-separated integers (0, 1, or 2).
    output_format: A string containing space-separated integers, sorted in non-decreasing order.
    elements:
      - object: sequence
        property: contains integers (0, 1, 2)
      - object: integer
        property: numerical value (0, 1, or 2)
    transformation:
      action: sort
      input: input sequence of integers
      output: sorted sequence of integers
    relationship:
      - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence (ignoring the potential anomaly in train_7).
      - The output sequence is ordered numerically (non-decreasing).
      - The number of elements in the input and output sequences is identical.
      - The count of each distinct integer (0, 1, 2) in the input generally matches the count in the output (holds true for examples 1-6).
    anomaly:
      example: train_7
      input_counts: {0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4}
      output_counts: {0: 5, 1: 4, 2: 3}
      note: This contradicts the pattern observed in other examples where element counts are preserved during sorting. Assuming the primary rule is sorting, this example might contain an error.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input string containing space-separated integers.
    2.  Parse the string into a list or array of integer values.
    3.  Sort this list/array of integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
    4.  Format the sorted list/array back into a string with integers separated by single spaces.
    5.  Output the resulting string.
