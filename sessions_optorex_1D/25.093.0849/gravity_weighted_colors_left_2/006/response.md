*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is a mismatch between the expected input type in the previous code (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array). The initial perception incorrectly assumed the input was a string based on its textual representation in the examples. The core logic of sorting the elements appears correct, but it needs to be applied directly to the NumPy array, not after attempting to parse a string. The anomaly previously noted in `train_7` seems to be resolved; recalculating based on the code execution confirms that sorting the *actual* input array for `train_7` produces the given output. The strategy is to modify the program to accept a NumPy array as input, sort it, and then format the sorted array into the required output string format.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` for all examples.
    *   **Input Shape:** 1-dimensional array (e.g., `(12,)` for `train_1`).
    *   **Input Data Type:** Integers (e.g., `int64`).
    *   **Transformation:** Sorting the input array numerically in non-decreasing order.
    *   **Consistency Check:** Applying `np.sort()` to the inferred NumPy array representation of each input example yields the corresponding output example, including `train_7`. The element counts are preserved through sorting in all cases.
    *   **Error Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method (a string method) on the input, which is a NumPy array, leading to the `AttributeError`.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Sort a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers and format the result as a space-separated string.
    input_format: A 1-dimensional NumPy array containing integers (specifically 0, 1, and 2 in examples).
    output_format: A string containing the integers from the input array, sorted in non-decreasing order and separated by single spaces.
    elements:
      - object: numpy_array
        property: 1-dimensional
        property: contains integers (0, 1, 2)
      - object: integer
        property: numerical value
    transformation:
      action: sort
      input: input NumPy array
      output: sorted NumPy array
    transformation_step_2:
      action: format
      input: sorted NumPy array
      output: space-separated string representation
    relationship:
      - The output string represents the elements of the input array sorted numerically (non-decreasing).
      - The number of elements is preserved.
      - The count of each distinct integer is preserved.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers.
    2.  Sort the elements of the input NumPy array numerically in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
    3.  Convert each integer element in the sorted NumPy array to its string representation.
    4.  Join these string representations together, separated by single spaces, to form a single output string.
    5.  Return the resulting string.
