            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified by the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) is a mismatch between the expected input type in the previous code (string) and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array). The initial perception incorrectly assumed the input was a string based on its textual representation in the examples. The core logic of sorting the elements appears correct, but it needs to be applied directly to the NumPy array, not after attempting to parse a string. The anomaly previously noted in `train_7` seems to be resolved; recalculating based on the code execution confirms that sorting the *actual* input array for `train_7` produces the given output. The strategy is to modify the program to accept a NumPy array as input, sort it, and then format the sorted array into the required output string format.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` for all examples.\n    *   **Input Shape:** 1-dimensional array (e.g., `(12,)` for `train_1`).\n    *   **Input Data Type:** Integers (e.g., `int64`).\n    *   **Transformation:** Sorting the input array numerically in non-decreasing order.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** Applying `np.sort()` to the inferred NumPy array representation of each input example yields the corresponding output example, including `train_7`. The element counts are preserved through sorting in all cases.\n    *   **Error Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method (a string method) on the input, which is a NumPy array, leading to the `AttributeError`.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
