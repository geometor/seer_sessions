*   **General Assessment:**
    The execution results consistently show an `invalid literal for int() with base 10` error when processing the examples. The specific error message `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]'` indicates that the function attempting the integer conversion (`int()`) received a string that looks like a Python list representation (e.g., `"[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2]"`) instead of a simple numeric string (e.g., `"0"` or `"1"`).

    This strongly suggests a problem occurred *before* the core sorting logic:
    1.  **Input Mismatch:** The code execution environment might be passing the input data in an unexpected format. Instead of the raw input string like `"2 1 0 2 2 2 1 0 2 0 1 1"`, it might be passing the *expected output* string (incorrectly), or perhaps a string representation of a list/array.
    2.  **Incorrect Code Version:** The execution environment might be running the *initial* version of the code which included a `parse_input` function using `int(x) for x in input_str.split()`. If this function received a string like `"[0 0 0...]"` instead of `"0 0 0..."`, the `split()` method would produce `["[0", "0", "0", ..., "2]"]`, and `int("[0")` would fail. The NumPy version (`code_00.py` provided) does *not* explicitly call `int()` in this way, further suggesting the error originates from a mismatch in how the input string is initially handled or that the wrong code version was tested.

    **Strategy:**
    The core transformation logic (sorting the sequence of numbers) appears correct based on the initial analysis of examples 1-6. The immediate priority is to resolve the input processing error. Assuming the task's fundamental input is a string of space-separated integers, the natural language program and subsequent code should reflect this, starting with parsing the string correctly. The anomaly in `train_7` (where element counts differ between input and output) needs to be noted but treated as a secondary issue or potential data error, given the consistency of the sorting pattern otherwise. The solution should proceed based on the primary pattern: parse the input string, sort the resulting numbers, and format the output string.

    **Metric Analysis:**
    *   All examples have input and output sequences of length 12.
    *   The output sequences are correctly sorted in non-decreasing order in all examples.
    *   Crucially, the element counts (`input_counts` vs `output_counts`) *do match* for *all* examples, including `train_7`. My initial perception of an anomaly in `train_7` was incorrect; the input for `train_7` is `"1 2 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 0"` which contains five 0s, four 1s, and three 2s, exactly matching the output counts.
    *   The output in every example exactly matches the result of sorting the input list.

    This confirms the transformation is consistently sorting the input sequence while preserving the count of each element. The execution errors reported previously are therefore definitively linked to how the input is being passed to or processed by the `transform` function in the testing environment, not an error in the core sorting logic itself or the example data.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Sort a sequence of integers provided as a space-separated string.
    input_format: A single string containing integers (0, 1, or 2) separated by single spaces.
    output_format: A single string containing the same integers as the input, sorted in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces.
    input_object:
      type: string
      constraints: Contains space-separated representations of integers 0, 1, or 2.
    output_object:
      type: string
      constraints: Contains space-separated representations of integers 0, 1, or 2, sorted numerically.

        constraint: The multiset of integers represented in the input string is identical to the multiset of integers represented in the output string.
      - Property: order
        output: output_string
        constraint: The sequence of integers represented in the output string is sorted non-decreasingly.
      - Property: length
        input: list_of_integers derived from input_string
        output: sorted_list_of_integers derived from output_string
        constraint: The length (number of elements) of the list is preserved.
    execution_error_context:
      error_type: ValueError
      message: "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]'"
      likely_cause: The function responsible for parsing the initial input string received data in an unexpected format (e.g., a string representation of a list like '[0 0 1...]' instead of '0 0 1...'), potentially due to misconfiguration in the execution environment or incorrect function invocation signature. The core sorting logic is validated by the examples.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a single string containing integers separated by spaces.
    2.  Split the input string into individual string components using the space character as a delimiter.
    3.  Convert each resulting string component into its corresponding integer value, creating a list of integers.
    4.  Sort this list of integers numerically in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
    5.  Convert each integer in the sorted list back into its string representation.
    6.  Join these string representations together into a single output string, using a single space as the separator between adjacent elements.
    7.  Return the final formatted string.
