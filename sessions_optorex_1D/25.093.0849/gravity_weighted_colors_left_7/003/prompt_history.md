## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers provided as a space-separated string into another sequence of the same length, also represented as a space-separated string. The core operation appears to be related to the order of the elements within the sequence. The numerical values themselves (0, 1, 2) are preserved, but their positions are rearranged. The output sequence consistently displays the integers in ascending order.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: Integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
  Properties:
    - Unordered sequence
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 elements in examples)
Output:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: The same set of integers as the input
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence (ascending)
    - Same length as the input
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The sequence of integers derived from the input string
  Rule: Arrange the integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence contains exactly the same integers as the input sequence.
  - The count of each unique integer is preserved between input and output.
  - The output sequence is the sorted version of the input sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

2.  Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
3.  Format the sorted list of integers back into a space-separated string.
4.  Return the formatted string as the output.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as sorting the input sequence numerically in ascending order. However, the implementation assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array. This mismatch caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples.

The strategy to resolve this is straightforward:
1.  Adjust the code to accept a NumPy array as input.
2.  Perform the sorting operation directly on the array (or convert it to a list first).
3.  Return the sorted sequence in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array, based on typical ARC/data transformation frameworks). The previous code returned a string, which might also need adjustment depending on the test harness expectations. We will assume the function should return the sorted sequence as a list of integers for now.

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on the provided examples and the error messages:

*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently a NumPy array of integers, not a string.
*   **Output Type:** The expected output, based on the examples, is a sequence of integers sorted in ascending order. The exact return type required by the environment (list, NumPy array, string) isn't explicitly stated by the error, but returning a list or array is a reasonable assumption.
*   **Transformation:** Sorting the elements of the input array in ascending order correctly produces the output for all provided training examples.
*   **Data Preservation:** The number of elements and the frequency of each unique integer (0, 1, 2) are preserved between the input and the output in all examples.

Let's verify the sorting for `train_7`:
Input (as array): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
Sorted List: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
Expected Output (from example): `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2`
The sorted list, when formatted, matches the expected output. This pattern holds for all other examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input NumPy array containing integers.
2.  Convert the NumPy array to a Python list of integers (optional, but often convenient).
3.  Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
4.  Return the sorted list of integers.
