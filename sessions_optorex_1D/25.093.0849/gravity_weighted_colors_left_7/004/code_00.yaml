Task: SortSequenceNumerically
Input:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: Integers (observed values: 0, 1, 2)
  Properties:
    - Represents an unordered sequence of numbers.
    - Fixed length (12 in all examples).
Output:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: The same set of integers as the input.
  Properties:
    - Represents an ordered sequence of numbers (ascending).
    - Same length as the input.
    - Contains the same multiset of integers as the input.
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The sequence of integers derived from the input string.
  Rule: Arrange the sequence of integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The multiset of elements (integers and their counts) is preserved.
  - The output sequence is the numerically sorted version of the input sequence.
Execution_Note:
  - Previous execution attempts failed, potentially due to mismatches in expected function signature (input/output types: string vs. list vs. numpy array) or other testing framework issues. The core logic identified (sorting) appears correct based on input/output data comparison.
