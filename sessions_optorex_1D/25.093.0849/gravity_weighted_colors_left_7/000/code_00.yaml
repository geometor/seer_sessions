Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: Integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
  Properties:
    - Unordered sequence
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 elements in examples)
Output:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: The same set of integers as the input
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence (ascending)
    - Same length as the input
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The sequence of integers derived from the input string
  Rule: Arrange the integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence contains exactly the same integers as the input sequence.
  - The count of each unique integer is preserved between input and output.
  - The output sequence is the sorted version of the input sequence.
