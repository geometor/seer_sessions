## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers provided as a space-separated string into another sequence of the same length, also represented as a space-separated string. The core operation appears to be related to the order of the elements within the sequence. The numerical values themselves (0, 1, 2) are preserved, but their positions are rearranged. The output sequence consistently displays the integers in ascending order.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: Integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
  Properties:
    - Unordered sequence
    - Fixed length (e.g., 12 elements in examples)
Output:
  Type: string
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Elements: The same set of integers as the input
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence (ascending)
    - Same length as the input
Transformation:

  Rule: Arrange the integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence contains exactly the same integers as the input sequence.
  - The count of each unique integer is preserved between input and output.
  - The output sequence is the sorted version of the input sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided test results indicate a complete failure of the transformation function across all examples, with the "Transformed Output" consistently mirroring the "Input". However, a manual comparison of the `input` and `expected output` pairs strongly suggests that the underlying task *is* simply sorting the sequence of integers in ascending order. All `expected output` sequences are correctly sorted versions of their corresponding `input` sequences.

This discrepancy implies one of the following:

1.  **Execution Error:** The `transform` function (likely the sorting implementation previously developed) was not correctly executed by the testing framework. The framework might have defaulted to returning the input due to an error during function call or processing.
2.  **Incorrect Function Signature/Return Type:** The framework might expect the `transform` function to have a different signature (e.g., different input type like `list` or `numpy.ndarray` instead of `str`) or a different return type (e.g., `list` instead of `str`), causing a mismatch and failure. The presence of two different python function examples (one string-based, one numpy-based) hints at this possibility.
3.  **Misleading Result Reporting:** The "Transformed Output" field in the report might be incorrectly populated, perhaps showing the input erroneously, while the metrics ("Match: False", "Pixels Off", "Score") accurately reflect the comparison between the *actual* (but hidden) result of the sorting function and the expected output. Given that the expected outputs *are* sorted inputs, this seems unlikely unless there's a subtle detail missed.

**Strategy:**

Based on the strong evidence from comparing inputs and expected outputs, the core logic remains **sorting**. The strategy is to:

1.  Re-affirm the sorting hypothesis based on manual data analysis.
2.  Assume the reported test failures are due to execution or interface issues, not incorrect logic identification.
3.  Refine the documentation and natural language program to clearly state the task is sorting, while potentially acknowledging the need for careful implementation matching the framework's requirements during the coder phase.
4.  Use code execution to verify counts and sorted versions for clarity.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the counts and sorted versions for each example.

```
**Findings:**

*   **Length Preservation:** Input and output sequences consistently have the same length (12).
*   **Element Preservation:** The counts of each unique integer (0, 1, 2) are identical between the input and its corresponding expected output ("Counts Match: True" for all).
*   **Sorting Confirmation:** The calculated sorted version of the input perfectly matches the expected output for every single example ("Expected Output Matches Sorted Input: True" for all).

**Conclusion:** The analysis confirms that the transformation rule is indeed sorting the input sequence of integers in ascending order. The failures reported previously are highly likely due to execution context issues rather than flawed logic identification.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing space-separated integer values.
2.  Parse the input string to create a list or sequence of integer numbers.
3.  Sort this list/sequence of integers numerically in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
4.  Format the sorted list/sequence of integers back into a single string, with elements separated by spaces.
5.  Return the resulting formatted string.
