## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as sorting the input sequence numerically in ascending order. However, the implementation assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array. This mismatch caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples.

The strategy to resolve this is straightforward:
1.  Adjust the code to accept a NumPy array as input.
2.  Perform the sorting operation directly on the array (or convert it to a list first).
3.  Return the sorted sequence in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array, based on typical ARC/data transformation frameworks). The previous code returned a string, which might also need adjustment depending on the test harness expectations. We will assume the function should return the sorted sequence as a list of integers for now.

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on the provided examples and the error messages:

*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently a NumPy array of integers, not a string.
*   **Output Type:** The expected output, based on the examples, is a sequence of integers sorted in ascending order. The exact return type required by the environment (list, NumPy array, string) isn't explicitly stated by the error, but returning a list or array is a reasonable assumption.
*   **Transformation:** Sorting the elements of the input array in ascending order correctly produces the output for all provided training examples.
*   **Data Preservation:** The number of elements and the frequency of each unique integer (0, 1, 2) are preserved between the input and the output in all examples.

Let's verify the sorting for `train_7`:
Input (as array): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
Sorted List: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
Expected Output (from example): `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2`
The sorted list, when formatted, matches the expected output. This pattern holds for all other examples.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: SortSequenceArray
Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Format: 1-dimensional array of integers
  Elements: Integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
  Properties:
    - Unordered sequence
    - Variable length (though examples show length 12)
Output:
  Type: list # Assuming list output, could be numpy.ndarray
  Format: List of integers
  Elements: The same set of integers as the input
  Properties:
    - Ordered sequence (ascending)
    - Same length as the input
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The sequence of integers contained in the input NumPy array
  Rule: Arrange the integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence contains exactly the same integers as the input sequence.
  - The count of each unique integer is preserved between input and output.
  - The output sequence is the sorted version of the input sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input NumPy array containing integers.
2.  Convert the NumPy array to a Python list of integers (optional, but often convenient).
3.  Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
4.  Return the sorted list of integers.
