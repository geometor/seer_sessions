            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as sorting the input sequence numerically in ascending order. However, the implementation assumed the input was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided the input as a NumPy array. This mismatch caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is straightforward:\n1.  Adjust the code to accept a NumPy array as input.\n2.  Perform the sorting operation directly on the array (or convert it to a list first).\n3.  Return the sorted sequence in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array, based on typical ARC/data transformation frameworks). The previous code returned a string, which might also need adjustment depending on the test harness expectations. We will assume the function should return the sorted sequence as a list of integers for now.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on the provided examples and the error messages:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The input is consistently a NumPy array of integers, not a string.\n*   **Output Type:** The expected output, based on the examples, is a sequence of integers sorted in ascending order. The exact return type required by the environment (list, NumPy array, string) isn't explicitly stated by the error, but returning a list or array is a reasonable assumption.\n*   **Transformation:** Sorting the elements of the input array in ascending order correctly produces the output for all provided training examples.\n*   **Data Preservation:** The number of elements and the frequency of each unique integer (0, 1, 2) are preserved between the input and the output in all examples.\n\nLet's verify the sorting for `train_7`:\nInput (as array): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`\nSorted List: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\nExpected Output (from example): `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2`\nThe sorted list, when formatted, matches the expected output. This pattern holds for all other examples.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
