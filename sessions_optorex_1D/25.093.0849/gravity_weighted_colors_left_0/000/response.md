*   **Perception:**
    *   The input consists of a sequence of integers, specifically 0s, 1s, and 2s.
    *   The output is also a sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s) of the same length as the input.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences in each example reveals that the output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence, but arranged in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
    *   The transformation applied appears to be sorting the input sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - contains elements 0, 1, 2
          - variable length (observed length is 12 in examples)
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - contains elements 0, 1, 2
          - same length as input_sequence
          - elements are sorted in non-decreasing order
    actions:
      - name: sort
        input: input_sequence
        output: output_sequence
        description: Arranges the elements of the input sequence in ascending numerical order.
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        from: input_sequence
        to: output_sequence
        rule: The output_sequence is the sorted version of the input_sequence.
      - type: composition
        input: input_sequence
        output: output_sequence
        elements: The multiset of elements in the output_sequence is identical to the multiset of elements in the input_sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Sort the elements of the input sequence in ascending numerical order.
    3.  The resulting sorted sequence is the output.
