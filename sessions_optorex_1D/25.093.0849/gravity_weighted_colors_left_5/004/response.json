This error typically arises when attempting to convert a non-integer string into an integer using `int()`.\n\nHowever, the provided Python code (`code_00.py`), which was tested, accepts a NumPy array (`input_array: np.ndarray`) and uses `np.sort`. It does not perform an explicit `int()` conversion on the input data itself *within the function body*. This strongly suggests the error is occurring *outside* the `transform` function, likely within the testing harness or due to a mismatch between the data type the harness provides and the type the function expects.\n\nDespite the execution errors, the visual comparison between the input and output pairs across all training examples strongly supports the initial hypothesis: the transformation rule is to sort the input sequence of digits in ascending order. The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between input and output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The fundamental transformation identified (sorting) appears correct based on the visual data.\n2.  **Refine Data Description:** Clarify the expected input and output formats based on the visual representation in the examples (space-separated strings).\n3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the counts of each digit and the sorting relationship for specific examples.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the sorting transformation and the likely string-based input/output format. The execution errors should be noted as a potential integration issue for the coder phase, rather than a flaw in the discerned logic.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the sorting and element counts for `train_1` and `train_7`.\n"

Let me re-examine the first example provided in the prompt.\n\n**Input `train_1`**: `0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 1 2 0`\nCount:\n- 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12 (Count = 6)\n- 1: 2, 3, 9, 10 (Count = 4)\n- 2: 6, 11 (Count = 2)\nTotal = 12. Correct count: {0: 6, 1: 4, 2: 2}\n\n**Output `train_1`**: `0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2`\nCount:\n- 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Count = 5)\n- 1: 6, 7, 8, 9 (Count = 4)\n- 2: 10, 11 (Count = 2)\nTotal = 11. Correct count: {0: 5, 1: 4, 2: 2}\n\n**Finding:** The provided `output` for `train_1` has only 11 elements, while the `input` has 12. It seems one '0' is missing from the provided output string for `train_1`. Assuming this is a typo in the example data and the rule *is* sorting, the output *should* have been `0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2`.\n\nExample `train_7` was correctly analyzed by the code: counts match, and the output is the sorted input.\n\nGiven that 6 out of 7 examples provided visually match the sorting rule perfectly (and `train_1` likely has a typo in the output), the core hypothesis remains strong. The discrepancy in `train_1` should be noted, but the overall pattern points overwhelmingly to sorting. The execution error remains likely an external issue.\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"
