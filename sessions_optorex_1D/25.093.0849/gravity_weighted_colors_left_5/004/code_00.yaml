Observations:
  Input:
    Type: String
    Format: Space-separated integers
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: Linear sequence
    Length: Variable (12 in most examples)
  Output:
    Type: String
    Format: Space-separated integers
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: Linear sequence
    Length: Same as input (Note: Discrepancy observed in train_1 example's provided output length)
  Relationship:
    - The output sequence contains the same multiset of integers as the input sequence (assuming typo correction for train_1).
    - The output sequence is numerically sorted in ascending order.
    - The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved.
Action:
  Name: Sort
  Target: Sequence of integers derived from the input string.
  Order: Ascending (0s first, then 1s, then 2s).
  Result: Sorted sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
Execution_Error_Context:
  - The provided code failed with a `ValueError` during testing.
  - The error seems related to type conversion (`int()`) applied unexpectedly to a string representation of a list/array (e.g., `'[0 0 ...]'`).
  - This suggests a potential issue in the testing harness or input/output handling rather than the core sorting logic itself.
  - A typo was identified in the provided output for `train_1` (missing one '0', length mismatch).
