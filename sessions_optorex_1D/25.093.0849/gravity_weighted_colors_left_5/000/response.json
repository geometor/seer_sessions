The output is also a sequence of single-digit integers of the same length as the input. Comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples reveals that the output sequence contains the exact same digits as the input sequence, but they are arranged in non-decreasing (ascending) order. The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input and the output.\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"
