Observations:
  Input:
    Type: Sequence
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: Linear array/list
    Length: Constant (12 in examples)
  Output:
    Type: Sequence
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: Linear array/list
    Length: Same as input
  Relationship:
    - The output sequence contains the same multiset of integers as the input sequence.
    - The output sequence is a sorted version of the input sequence.
    - Sorting order: Ascending (non-decreasing).
Action:
  Name: Sort
  Target: Input sequence
  Order: Ascending (0s first, then 1s, then 2s)
  Result: Output sequence
