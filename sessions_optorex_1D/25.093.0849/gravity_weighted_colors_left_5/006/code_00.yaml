Observations:
  Input:
    Type: NumPy array (1-dimensional)
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: Linear sequence
    Length: Variable (12 in examples, but likely general)
  Output:
    Type: String
    Elements:
      Type: Character (representing digits '0', '1', '2' and space ' ')
    Structure: Space-separated sequence of digits
    Length: Variable (dependent on input length and digit values)
  Relationship:
    - The digits in the output string represent the same multiset of integers as in the input NumPy array.
    - The digits in the output string are ordered according to the numerical ascending order of the integers in the input array.
    - The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved.
Action:
  Name: Sort and Format
  Input_Source: Input NumPy array
  Steps:
    1. Sort the elements of the input NumPy array numerically in ascending order.
    2. Convert each integer element of the sorted array to its string representation.
    3. Join these string representations into a single string, using a space character as a separator.
  Output_Result: Formatted string
