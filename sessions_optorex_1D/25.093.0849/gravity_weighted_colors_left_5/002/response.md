## General Assessment

The previous code failed due to a type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str: str`) and use the `.split()` method. However, the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

The core logic identified previously – sorting the input sequence in ascending order – appears consistent with the input/output examples. The strategy is to modify the function signature and implementation to correctly handle NumPy array inputs while producing the desired string output format.

## Metrics

No successful transformations occurred due to the runtime error. The consistent error message across all examples confirms the input type issue.

*   **Input Type (Observed):** `numpy.ndarray`
*   **Expected Input Type (Code):** `str`
*   **Error:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`
*   **Result:** Code execution failed for all examples. The sorting logic was never reached.

## Factual Documentation


```yaml
Observations:
  Input:
    Type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on execution error
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: 1D array
  Output:
    Type: String # Based on example format
    Elements:
      Type: Character (representing integers 0, 1, 2)
      Separation: Space
    Structure: Linear sequence of characters
  Relationship:
    - The output string represents the same multiset of integers as the input array.
    - The integers represented in the output string are sorted in ascending order.
Action:
  Name: Sort and Format
  Target: Input NumPy array
  Process:
    1. Sort the elements of the input array numerically in ascending order.
    2. Convert each sorted integer element to its string representation.
    3. Join the resulting strings with a single space separator.
  Result: Output string
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input 1D NumPy array containing integers.
2.  Sort the elements of the input array in ascending numerical order.
3.  Convert each integer in the sorted array into its string representation.
4.  Concatenate these strings, separating each pair with a single space.
5.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
