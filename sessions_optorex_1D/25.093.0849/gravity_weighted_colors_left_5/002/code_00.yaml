Observations:
  Input:
    Type: numpy.ndarray # Updated based on execution error
    Elements:
      Type: Integer
      Values: [0, 1, 2]
    Structure: 1D array
  Output:
    Type: String # Based on example format
    Elements:
      Type: Character (representing integers 0, 1, 2)
      Separation: Space
    Structure: Linear sequence of characters
  Relationship:
    - The output string represents the same multiset of integers as the input array.
    - The integers represented in the output string are sorted in ascending order.
Action:
  Name: Sort and Format
  Target: Input NumPy array
  Process:
    1. Sort the elements of the input array numerically in ascending order.
    2. Convert each sorted integer element to its string representation.
    3. Join the resulting strings with a single space separator.
  Result: Output string
