Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers (represented as space-separated string or potentially NumPy array)
  Content: Consists of digits 0, 1, and 2.
  Properties:
    - Length: Constant (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Unordered sequence of digits.
Output:
  Type: Sequence of integers (represented as space-separated string)
  Content: Consists of the same digits 0, 1, and 2 as the input.
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as input length (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Digits are sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order.
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The sequence of input digits.
  Rule: Arrange the digits in ascending numerical order (0s first, then 1s, then 2s).
  Properties_Preserved:
    - The total number of digits (length of the sequence).
    - The count of each distinct digit (number of 0s, number of 1s, number of 2s).
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The output sequence is the numerically sorted version of the input sequence.
Metrics_Confirmation:
  - All examples have input_len = 12 and output_len = 12.
  - In all examples, the counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) are identical between the input and output sequences.
  - In all examples, the output sequence is verified to be the sorted version of the input sequence.
