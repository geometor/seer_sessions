**General Assessment:**

The execution results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the input type expected by the tested code (`code_00.py`, which expected `str`) and the actual data type provided during execution. The error `invalid literal for int() with base 10` strongly suggests that the input was not a simple space-separated string as initially assumed for `code_00.py`, but rather a more complex data structure (likely a list or, more probably given the context, a 1D NumPy array) whose string representation could not be parsed correctly by the string processing functions (`split`, `int`).

The transformation logic itself (sorting the digits) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the input/output pairs. The second code block provided previously (`code_01.py`), which explicitly typed the input as `np.ndarray`, correctly anticipates this scenario and implements the sorting logic appropriately for a NumPy array. Therefore, the strategy is to confirm the input type as a NumPy array and adopt the natural language program corresponding to the NumPy-based solution.

**Metrics:**

Based on the provided examples and error analysis:

*   **Input Type:** The execution errors strongly suggest the input is provided as a 1D NumPy array of integers, not a simple string.
*   **Input Data:** The array contains integers, specifically 0, 1, and 2.
*   **Input/Output Length:** The length of the input array and the number of elements in the output string are consistently the same (12 in the examples).
*   **Transformation:** The core operation remains sorting the numerical elements in ascending order.
*   **Element Preservation:** The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input array and the output string.

No further code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error messages and the structure of the second provided code block give sufficient information about the likely input format.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  Type: NumPy array (1D)
  DType: Integer
  Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2)
  Length: Variable (consistent within a single task example, e.g., 12)
Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated digits
  Content: Sequence of digits (0, 1, 2)
  Length: Same number of elements as the input array
Transformation:
  Action: Sorting
  Object: The elements of the input NumPy array
  Rule: Arrange elements in non-decreasing (ascending) numerical order
  Output_Format: Convert sorted integers to strings and join with spaces
Property_Preserved:
  - Count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2)
  - Total number of elements
Relationship:
  - The digits in the output string are the sorted version of the integers in the input NumPy array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1-dimensional NumPy array containing integers.
2.  Sort the elements of the NumPy array numerically in ascending order.
3.  Convert each integer element in the sorted array into its string representation.
4.  Join these string representations together, separated by a single space character.
5.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
