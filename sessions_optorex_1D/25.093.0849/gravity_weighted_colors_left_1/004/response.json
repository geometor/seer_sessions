            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution results indicate a fundamental mismatch between the input type expected by the tested code (`code_00.py`, which expected `str`) and the actual data type provided during execution. The error `invalid literal for int() with base 10` strongly suggests that the input was not a simple space-separated string as initially assumed for `code_00.py`, but rather a more complex data structure (likely a list or, more probably given the context, a 1D NumPy array) whose string representation could not be parsed correctly by the string processing functions (`split`, `int`).\n\nThe transformation logic itself (sorting the digits) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the input/output pairs. The second code block provided previously (`code_01.py`), which explicitly typed the input as `np.ndarray`, correctly anticipates this scenario and implements the sorting logic appropriately for a NumPy array. Therefore, the strategy is to confirm the input type as a NumPy array and adopt the natural language program corresponding to the NumPy-based solution.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples and error analysis:\n\n*   **Input Type:** The execution errors strongly suggest the input is provided as a 1D NumPy array of integers, not a simple string.\n*   **Input Data:** The array contains integers, specifically 0, 1, and 2.\n*   **Input/Output Length:** The length of the input array and the number of elements in the output string are consistently the same (12 in the examples).\n*   **Transformation:** The core operation remains sorting the numerical elements in ascending order.\n*   **Element Preservation:** The count of each distinct digit (0, 1, 2) is preserved between the input array and the output string.\n\nNo further code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error messages and the structure of the second provided code block give sufficient information about the likely input format.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
