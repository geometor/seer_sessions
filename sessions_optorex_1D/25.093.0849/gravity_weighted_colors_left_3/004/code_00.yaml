Task: Sort a sequence of numbers represented as a NumPy array.
Input Type: numpy.ndarray (1-dimensional array of integers, specifically 0, 1, or 2).
Output Type: str (space-separated string of sorted integers).

Objects:
  - InputArray:
      Type: numpy.ndarray
      Properties:
        - Contains integers 0, 1, or 2.
        - 1-dimensional.
  - OutputString:
      Type: str
      Properties:
        - Contains the same integers as InputArray, sorted in ascending order.
        - Integers are separated by single spaces.
        - Represents the sorted version of InputArray.

Relationships:
  - OutputString represents the elements of InputArray sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
  - The multiset of numbers in InputArray is identical to the multiset of numbers represented in OutputString.

Action:
  - Sort: Rearrange the elements of the InputArray in non-decreasing order.
  - Format: Convert the sorted numbers into strings and join them with spaces to produce the OutputString.
