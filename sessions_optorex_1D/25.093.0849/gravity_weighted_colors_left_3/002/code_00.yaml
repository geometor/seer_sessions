Task: Sort a sequence of numbers provided as a NumPy array and return as a formatted string.
Objects:
  - InputArray:
      Type: numpy.ndarray
      Properties:
        - Contains integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
        - Has a specific length (e.g., 12 in training examples).
        - Elements are not necessarily ordered.
  - OutputString:
      Type: String
      Properties:
        - Contains the same integers as InputArray, separated by spaces.
        - Elements are sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
        - Represents the sorted sequence.
Relationships:
  - OutputString represents the sorted version of the elements contained in InputArray.
Action:
  - Sort: Rearrange the elements of the InputArray in non-decreasing order.
  - Format: Convert the sorted numerical elements into a single string with elements separated by spaces.
