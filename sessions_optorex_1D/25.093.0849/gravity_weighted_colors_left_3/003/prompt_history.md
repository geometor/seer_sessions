*   **Perception:**
    *   The input consists of a sequence of integers (specifically 0, 1, and 2).
    *   The output is also a sequence of integers of the same length as the input.
    *   The integers present in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, just rearranged.
    *   Observing the output sequences across all examples, they appear to be sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Sort a sequence of numbers.
    Objects:
      - InputSequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Contains integers 0, 1, or 2.
            - Fixed length (12 in examples).
      - OutputSequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Contains the same integers as InputSequence.
            - Same length as InputSequence.

## General Assessment

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (sorting the input sequence) appears correct, as confirmed by the tool execution simulating the sorting process on the input data. The failure arises from a mismatch between the assumed input data type (string) in the previous code and the actual data type provided during execution (NumPy array), leading to the `AttributeError`. The strategy is to correct the understanding of the input data type and adapt the transformation process to handle NumPy arrays directly, while ensuring the output format matches the examples (space-separated string).

## Metrics

Based on the error messages and successful tool simulation:

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Input Elements:** Integers, specifically 0, 1, and 2 in the examples.
*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 in all training examples.
*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of integers.
*   **Output Elements:** The same integers as the input array.
*   **Output Length:** Same number of elements as the input (12 in examples), formatted as a string.
*   **Transformation:** Sorting the elements of the input NumPy array in ascending order.
*   **Error:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` confirms the input is a NumPy array, not a string as previously assumed by the code.
*   **Validation:** Tool simulation confirmed that sorting the inferred NumPy array input produces the correct sequence of numbers, which, when formatted as a string, matches the expected output for the examples.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Sort a sequence of numbers provided as a NumPy array and return as a formatted string.
Objects:
  - InputArray:
      Type: numpy.ndarray
      Properties:
        - Contains integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
        - Has a specific length (e.g., 12 in training examples).
        - Elements are not necessarily ordered.
  - OutputString:
      Type: String
      Properties:
        - Contains the same integers as InputArray, separated by spaces.
        - Elements are sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
        - Represents the sorted sequence.
Relationships:
  - OutputString represents the sorted version of the elements contained in InputArray.
Action:
  - Sort: Rearrange the elements of the InputArray in non-decreasing order.
  - Format: Convert the sorted numerical elements into a single string with elements separated by spaces.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Sort the elements of the input NumPy array in ascending order.
3.  Convert each integer in the sorted array to its string representation.
4.  Join the resulting strings with a single space separator.
5.  Return the final space-separated string.
