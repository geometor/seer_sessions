Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: 12 (based on examples)
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: Same as input length (12 based on examples)
  Property: Sorted in non-decreasing order
Relationship:
  - Action: Sorting
  - Constraint: The multiset of elements in the output sequence is identical to the multiset of elements in the input sequence.
  - Transformation: The output sequence is the result of sorting the input sequence in ascending order.
