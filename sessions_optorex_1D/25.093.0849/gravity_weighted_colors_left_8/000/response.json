The integers present in the sequences appear to be limited to 0, 1, and 2. The length of the input sequence and the output sequence is consistently 12 across all provided examples. A comparison of the input and output sequences reveals that the output sequence contains the same integers as the input sequence, but arranged in non-decreasing (ascending) order. The frequency of each integer (0, 1, and 2) remains the same between the input and its corresponding output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
