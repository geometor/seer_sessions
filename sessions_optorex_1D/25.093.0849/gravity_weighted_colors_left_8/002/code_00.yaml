Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2] # Based on examples
  Shape: (12,) # Based on examples, representing a 1D array (sequence)
Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Content: Represents the sorted sequence of integers from the input array.
Relationship:
  - Action: Sorting
  - Constraint: The multiset of elements represented in the output string is identical to the multiset of elements in the input array.
  - Transformation:
      1. Take the input NumPy array.
      2. Sort the elements of the array in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
      3. Convert the sorted elements into strings.
      4. Join the string elements with a single space delimiter.
