Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Representation: Assumed initially as a space-separated string or a 1D numerical array/list.
  Length: Variable (12 in examples).
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: Same as input length.
  Property: Elements are sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
  Representation: Assumed as a space-separated string or a 1D numerical array/list.
Relationship:
  - Action: Sorting
  - Constraint: The multiset (frequency of each number) of elements in the output sequence is identical to the multiset of elements in the input sequence.
  - Transformation: The output sequence is the result of sorting the input sequence elements in ascending order.
Execution_Issue:
  - Type: ValueError (invalid literal for int())
  - Probable_Cause: Mismatch between the string format encountered during testing (e.g., string representation of a list like `'[0 1 2]'`) and the format expected by an integer parsing function (e.g., expecting `'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`). This likely occurs in the test harness interaction, not the core sorting logic.
