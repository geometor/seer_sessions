**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers. Both input and output are sequences of integers. The integers present in the sequences appear to be limited to 0, 1, and 2. The length of the input sequence and the output sequence is consistently 12 across all provided examples. A comparison of the input and output sequences reveals that the output sequence contains the same integers as the input sequence, but arranged in non-decreasing (ascending) order. The frequency of each integer (0, 1, and 2) remains the same between the input and its corresponding output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: 12 (based on examples)
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: Same as input length (12 based on examples)
  Property: Sorted in non-decreasing order
Relationship:
  - Action: Sorting
  - Constraint: The multiset of elements in the output sequence is identical to the multiset of elements in the input sequence.
  - Transformation: The output sequence is the result of sorting the input sequence in ascending order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Sort the integers within the sequence in ascending order (0s first, then 1s, then 2s).
3.  Return the resulting sorted sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided results indicate that while the core sorting logic implemented in both Python scripts (list-based and NumPy-based) likely produces the correct sequence of numbers, there's a failure during execution within the testing environment. The specific error, `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[0 0 0 ...]'`, points strongly to an issue with string parsing. It appears that a string representation of a list or array (including brackets `[` and `]`) is being incorrectly passed to the `int()` function. This likely happens either because:

1.  The test harness is feeding the input to the `transform` function in an unexpected string format (e.g., `"[1 2 1 ...]"`) instead of a plain space-separated string or a NumPy array directly.
2.  More plausibly, the test harness is using the `parse_input` function (defined in the *first* script) internally to process the *expected output string* for comparison purposes, and this function fails because the expected output string in the error message (`'[0 0 0 ...]'`) contains brackets and spaces, not just digits.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Validate Core Logic:** Re-confirm that the fundamental transformation (sorting the input sequence) is correct based on the examples. This appears to be the case.
2.  **Isolate the Error:** Recognize the error is likely related to data type mismatch or incorrect function application within the testing framework, rather than the sorting algorithm itself.
3.  **Refine Description:** Maintain the description of the core task (sorting) while acknowledging the I/O format ambiguity suggested by the errors. The Natural Language program should describe the transformation assuming the intended input format (sequence of numbers).
4.  **Assume Standard I/O:** For the YAML and Natural Language Program, assume the standard interpretation of the task based on the initial examples: input is a sequence of numbers (represented as a string or list/array), and output is the sorted sequence (represented similarly). The error seems peripheral to the task definition itself.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Based on the examples and the error messages:

*   **Input Format (Intended):** Sequence of integers (0, 1, 2), likely represented as a space-separated string initially. Length is consistently 12 in examples.
*   **Output Format (Intended):** Sequence of integers (0, 1, 2), sorted non-decreasingly, represented as a space-separated string. Length matches input.
*   **Error Format:** The strings causing the `int()` error (`'[0 0 0 ...]'`, `'[0 0 0 ...]'`, etc.) match the *expected output* values, but enclosed in brackets, suggesting these strings were incorrectly fed into a parsing function expecting only digits.
*   **Transformation Correctness:** Manual verification confirms that sorting the input lists/arrays produces the expected output lists/arrays in all provided training examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: SortSequence
Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Representation: Assumed initially as a space-separated string or a 1D numerical array/list.
  Length: Variable (12 in examples).
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 1, 2]
  Length: Same as input length.
  Property: Elements are sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
  Representation: Assumed as a space-separated string or a 1D numerical array/list.
Relationship:
  - Action: Sorting
  - Constraint: The multiset (frequency of each number) of elements in the output sequence is identical to the multiset of elements in the input sequence.
  - Transformation: The output sequence is the result of sorting the input sequence elements in ascending order.
Execution_Issue:
  - Type: ValueError (invalid literal for int())
  - Probable_Cause: Mismatch between the string format encountered during testing (e.g., string representation of a list like `'[0 1 2]'`) and the format expected by an integer parsing function (e.g., expecting `'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`). This likely occurs in the test harness interaction, not the core sorting logic.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence containing integers (specifically 0s, 1s, and 2s).
2.  Determine the count of each distinct integer (0, 1, and 2) present in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence by first appending all the 0s, followed by all the 1s, and finally all the 2s, according to their counts from the input.
4.  Return the resulting sorted sequence in the required format (e.g., space-separated string or list/array).
