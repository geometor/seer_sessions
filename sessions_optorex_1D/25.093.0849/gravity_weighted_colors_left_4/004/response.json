            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously \u2013 sorting the input digits numerically \u2013 appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The counts of each digit (0, 1, 2) and the total length of the sequence are preserved between input and output, with the output sequence being the sorted version of the input sequence.\n\nThe errors reported (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[...]`) strongly indicate that the `transform` function, during testing, received its input not as the expected space-separated string (initial hypothesis) but as a Python list or NumPy array containing integers. The error itself suggests that somewhere *outside* the provided `transform` function's main logic (or perhaps due to an incorrect function signature assumption by the test harness), an attempt was made to convert the *string representation of the entire list/array* (e.g., `\"[0 1 0 ...]\"`) into a single integer, which is invalid.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding of the input format based on the error messages and reconfirm the transformation rule. The natural language program and facts will be updated to reflect that the input is a sequence of integers (list or array) and the output is a space-separated string of the sorted integers. The previously generated Python code (`code_00.py`) actually aligns with this revised understanding (it takes a list/array and outputs a sorted string), suggesting the error source might be external to that specific code block's logic (e.g., data loading, type casting before the function call).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the analysis of the training examples:\n\n*   **Input Format:** Appears to be a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.\n*   **Input Values:** Consist exclusively of the integers 0, 1, and 2.\n*   **Output Format:** A string containing 12 digits (0, 1, 2) separated by single spaces.\n*   **Transformation:** Sorting the input sequence numerically in non-decreasing (ascending) order.\n*   **Conservation:** The number of occurrences of each digit (0, 1, 2) is the same in the input and output. The length of the sequence (12 elements) is preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
