    #    If the original input was a NumPy array, returning a NumPy array is safer.
    #    If the original was a list, returning a list is fine.
    #    The previous error suggested NumPy, so returning a NumPy array seems prudent.
    #    However, the template implies grid manipulation, maybe the test harness converts 1D lists to arrays.
    #    Let's return the result of np.sort if input was np.ndarray, else the list from sorted().
    #    If we always return a list, it might also work. Let's stick to returning what np.sort gives for np.ndarray input
    #    and what sorted() gives for list input for now.
    #    Revisiting: The error 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split' strongly suggests the test harness *passes* a numpy array.
    #    Therefore, the function should handle a NumPy array input and ideally return a NumPy array.

    # Re-implementing assuming NumPy array input based on error
    # Ensure input is treated as a NumPy array if it isn't already (less likely given error)
    # input_array = np.array(input_sequence) # This might be redundant if input is always np.ndarray

    # Sort the array
    sorted_array = np.sort(input_sequence) # np.sort handles arrays directly

    # Return the sorted array
    return sorted_array
