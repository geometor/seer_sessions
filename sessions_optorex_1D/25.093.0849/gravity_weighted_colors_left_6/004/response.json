            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation as sorting the sequence of integers. However, the code implementation failed because it assumed the input `input_str` was a simple space-separated string of numbers (e.g., `\"0 2 0 2...\"`). The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '[0 0 ...]'`) reveal that the input provided to the function during execution was actually a *string representation of a list or array*, including brackets `[` and `]`. The previous code attempted to split this string representation directly and convert parts like `'[0'` or `'2]'` to integers, causing the `ValueError`.\n\n    The strategy is to adjust the input parsing step to correctly extract the numbers from this string representation before proceeding with the conversion, sorting, and formatting steps, which remain valid.\n\n*   **Metrics and Data Gathering:**\n\n    *   **Input Format Discrepancy:** The inputs provided in the initial prompt (e.g., `0 2 0 2 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0`) are sequences of numbers. The error logs show the `transform` function received inputs like `'[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2]'` (Note: This specific string in the error message actually matches the *expected output* for train_1, not the input. This suggests the testing framework might be passing the *expected output* string representation as input during some phase, or there's confusion in how the error was reported/interpreted. However, the fundamental issue is the code expects ` \"1 2 3\" ` but receives ` \"[1 2 3]\" ` or similar). Let's assume the *intended* input to the function is the string representation including brackets.\n    *   **Core Logic Confirmation:** Comparing the original numeric sequences (e.g., `0 2 0 2 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0` for train_1) with the target outputs (e.g., `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2` for train_1) confirms that sorting in ascending order is the correct transformation.\n    *   **Output Format Confirmation:** The desired output format remains a simple space-separated string of integers.\n    *   **Element Consistency:** The numbers involved (0, 1, 2) and the length of the sequences remain consistent between the logical input and output in each example.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
