            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: sorting the sequence of numbers.\n    *   The execution failed across all examples with a `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`. This indicates the input provided to the `transform` function during testing was a `bytes` object, not a standard Python `str` object as assumed.\n    *   The strategy is to modify the input handling part of the function to first decode the input `bytes` object into a `str` object before applying string-based operations like regular expressions or splitting. UTF-8 is a standard encoding to assume for decoding. The rest of the logic (extracting numbers, sorting, reformatting) remains valid.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** The runtime error confirms the input type is `bytes`.\n    *   **Output Type:** The expected output is consistently a `str`.\n    *   **Content:** Inputs and outputs contain sequences of integers 0, 1, and 2.\n    *   **Length Consistency:** In all examples, the number of integers in the input matches the number of integers in the output.\n    *   **Transformation:** The transformation is consistently sorting the input sequence numerically in ascending order.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
