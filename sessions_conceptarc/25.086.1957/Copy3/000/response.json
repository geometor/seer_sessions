            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both examples maintain the grid dimensions from input to output. The background color (white, 0) remains largely unchanged, except where new objects are placed.\n2.  **Conditional Behavior:** The transformation logic appears to depend on the presence or absence of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  **Example 1 (No Magenta):**\n    *   The input grid has several distinct objects (yellow, blue, green) primarily located in the left half.\n    *   The output grid retains these original objects and adds copies of them to the right half.\n    *   The copies appear to be shifted horizontally to the right. The shift amount seems related to the grid width. Specifically, objects starting in column `c` are copied starting in column `c + width // 2 - 1`. Let's verify: width = 16. `16 // 2 - 1 = 7`. An object at (0, 2) is copied to (0, 2+7) = (0, 9). This matches the output. All objects fully contained within the left half (columns 0 to `width // 2 - 1` = 0 to 7) are copied.\n4.  **Example 2 (Magenta Present):**\n    *   The input grid contains magenta (6) blocks, a complex object made of green/yellow/orange, and some isolated orange pixels.\n    *   The output grid shows that only the complex green/yellow/orange object has been copied. The original object and all other elements (magenta blocks, isolated orange pixels) remain untouched.\n    *   The copy is shifted both horizontally and vertically.\n    *   Identifying the largest non-white object: The complex object seems visually largest. Let's assume it is. Its top-left corner is at (2, 0).\n    *   Identifying the magenta blocks: There are four 2-pixel magenta blocks. Let's find their top-left coordinates: (0,0), (3,6), (8,2), (11,8).\n    *   Sorting these coordinates (row first, then column): (0,0), (3,6), (8,2), (11,8).\n    *   The copy of the largest object starts at (5, 6) in the output.\n    *   The shift vector is (delta_row, delta_col) = (5-2, 6-0) = (3, 6).\n    *   This shift vector (3, 6) matches the coordinates of the *second* magenta block in the sorted list.\n5.  **General Pattern:** The task involves conditionally copying objects. If magenta is absent, copy all objects from the left half with a specific horizontal shift `(0, width // 2 - 1)`. If magenta is present, copy only the largest object with a shift determined by the coordinates of the second magenta block (when sorted by position).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
