The output duplicates the input vertically, placing one copy above the other, separated by a single row of white pixels. The output dimensions are (2 * height + 1) x width = 7x11.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input is taller (9x4) than wide. The output duplicates the input horizontally, placing one copy next to the other, separated by a single column of white pixels. The output dimensions are height x (2 * width + 1) = 9x9.\n    *   The rule appears to be: if the input width is greater than or equal to its height, duplicate vertically with a white row separator. If the input height is greater than its width, duplicate horizontally with a white column separator.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
