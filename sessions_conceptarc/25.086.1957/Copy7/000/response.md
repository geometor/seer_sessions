Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Background:** The background color appears to be White (0).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct regions or shapes formed by contiguous pixels of non-background colors.
    *   Example 1: A Magenta (6) bordered region containing a Green (3) diagonal line, and an Orange (7) bordered region, separated by White (0).
    *   Example 2: A Yellow (4) region containing dispersed Blue (1) pixels, and a Red (2) square region.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying an internal pattern (specific colored pixels) within one object (the "source") and transferring or overlaying this pattern onto another object (the "target").
5.  **Pattern Transfer:**
    *   In Example 1, the Green (3) diagonal line pattern inside the Magenta (6) region is copied into the Orange (7) region.
    *   In Example 2, the pattern of Blue (1) pixels within the Yellow (4) region is copied onto the Red (2) region, changing the corresponding Red pixels to Blue.
6.  **Positional Correspondence:** The pattern seems to be transferred based on relative positioning. The location of the pattern pixels within the source object's bounding box dictates where they appear within the target object's bounding box.
7.  **Color Interaction:** The pattern pixels (Green in Ex1, Blue in Ex2) replace the original pixels of the target object at the corresponding locations. The main colors of the source and target objects (Magenta/Orange in Ex1, Yellow/Red in Ex2) remain largely unchanged, except where replaced by the pattern.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Transfer an internal color pattern from a source object to a target object based on relative position.

definitions:
  background_color: white
  object: A contiguous region of non-background colored pixels.
  source_object: An object containing pixels of at least two distinct non-background colors within its bounding box. One color forms the main body/border, and another forms the internal pattern.
  target_object: An object initially composed of only one non-background color.
  pattern_color: The color of the internal pattern pixels within the source_object.
  pattern_pixels: Pixels within the source_object's bounding box that have the pattern_color.
  relative_coordinates: The (row, column) offset of a pattern_pixel relative to the top-left corner of its object's bounding box.

example_1:
  input_grid_size: [6, 13]
  output_grid_size: [6, 13]
  objects:
    - id: source
      colors: [magenta, green] # Magenta border/fill, Green pattern
      pattern_color: green
      location: left side
    - id: target
      colors: [orange] # Orange border/fill
      pattern_color: null
      location: right side
  action:
    type: copy_pattern
    source_id: source
    target_id: target
    pattern_color: green
    result: Pixels in the target object corresponding to the relative positions of green pixels in the source object are changed to green.

example_2:
  input_grid_size: [10, 10]
  output_grid_size: [10, 10]
  objects:
    - id: source
      colors: [yellow, blue] # Yellow main body, Blue pattern
      pattern_color: blue
      location: top-left area
    - id: target
      colors: [red] # Red square
      pattern_color: null
      location: bottom-right area
  action:
    type: copy_pattern
    source_id: source
    target_id: target
    pattern_color: blue
    result: Pixels in the target object corresponding to the relative positions of blue pixels in the source object are changed to blue.

general_properties:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The background color remains unchanged.
  - The source object's structure remains unchanged.
  - The target object's structure changes only where the pattern is applied.
  - Pattern application respects the bounding boxes and relative coordinates.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects (regions of non-background color) in the input grid.
3.  Analyze the colors within the bounding box of each object.
4.  Identify the "source object": the object that contains pixels of at least two different non-background colors within its bounding box.
5.  Identify the "target object": the object that initially contains pixels of only one non-background color. (Assume there is only one source and one target per task based on examples).
6.  Determine the "pattern color": This is the color within the source object's bounding box that is *not* the primary color making up the bulk of the source object.
7.  Determine the primary color of the target object.
8.  Calculate the bounding box (top_row, left_col, height, width) for both the source object and the target object.
9.  Create a list to store the relative coordinates of the pattern pixels found in the source object.
10. Iterate through each pixel (`r`, `c`) within the source object's bounding box (from `source_top` to `source_top + source_height - 1` and `source_left` to `source_left + source_width - 1`).
11. If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid has the `pattern_color`, calculate its relative coordinates: `rel_r = r - source_top`, `rel_c = c - source_left`. Add (`rel_r`, `rel_c`) to the list of relative coordinates.
12. Iterate through the collected list of relative coordinates (`rel_r`, `rel_c`).
13. For each (`rel_r`, `rel_c`), calculate the corresponding target coordinates in the output grid: `target_r = target_top + rel_r`, `target_c = target_left + rel_c`.
14. Check if the calculated target coordinates (`target_r`, `target_c`) are within the bounds of the grid *and* if the pixel at (`target_r`, `target_c`) in the *input* grid had the primary color of the target object.
15. If both conditions in step 14 are true, update the pixel at (`target_r`, `target_c`) in the *output* grid to the `pattern_color`.
16. Return the modified output grid.
