task_description: Transfer an internal color pattern from a source object to a target object based on relative position.

definitions:
  background_color: white
  object: A contiguous region of non-background colored pixels.
  source_object: An object containing pixels of at least two distinct non-background colors within its bounding box. One color forms the main body/border, and another forms the internal pattern.
  target_object: An object initially composed of only one non-background color.
  pattern_color: The color of the internal pattern pixels within the source_object.
  pattern_pixels: Pixels within the source_object's bounding box that have the pattern_color.
  relative_coordinates: The (row, column) offset of a pattern_pixel relative to the top-left corner of its object's bounding box.

example_1:
  input_grid_size: [6, 13]
  output_grid_size: [6, 13]
  objects:
    - id: source
      colors: [magenta, green] # Magenta border/fill, Green pattern
      pattern_color: green
      location: left side
    - id: target
      colors: [orange] # Orange border/fill
      pattern_color: null
      location: right side
  action:
    type: copy_pattern
    source_id: source
    target_id: target
    pattern_color: green
    result: Pixels in the target object corresponding to the relative positions of green pixels in the source object are changed to green.

example_2:
  input_grid_size: [10, 10]
  output_grid_size: [10, 10]
  objects:
    - id: source
      colors: [yellow, blue] # Yellow main body, Blue pattern
      pattern_color: blue
      location: top-left area
    - id: target
      colors: [red] # Red square
      pattern_color: null
      location: bottom-right area
  action:
    type: copy_pattern
    source_id: source
    target_id: target
    pattern_color: blue
    result: Pixels in the target object corresponding to the relative positions of blue pixels in the source object are changed to blue.

general_properties:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant.
  - The background color remains unchanged.
  - The source object's structure remains unchanged.
  - The target object's structure changes only where the pattern is applied.
  - Pattern application respects the bounding boxes and relative coordinates.
