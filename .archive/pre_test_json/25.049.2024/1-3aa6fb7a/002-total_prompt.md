Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shaped structures, and, two azure singletons.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shaped structures, and, two azure singletons.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all the azure (color 8) colored cells in the input grid. In this example, there are two L shaped structures: one at top-left made of cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) and another at the bottom-right made of cells (4,4), (4,5), (5,4).

2. **Identify single azure objects.** Identify singletons (single instances of the same color).

3. **Change singletons color.** Replace single azure cells colors to blue (color 1)

**Elaboration and Refinement Notes (Mental Workspace)**
The transformation identifies singletons from a particular color and change it to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
