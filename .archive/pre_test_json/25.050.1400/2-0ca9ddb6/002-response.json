If the cell is red (color 2), its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the output grid are turned yellow (color 4). If the cell is blue (color 1), its orthogonal neighbors in the output grid are turned orange (color 7).  The original non-white cells and any white cells that are not neighbors of these colored cells remain unchanged in the output grid. Essentially, each colored cell in the input grid \"emanates\" a specific color to its immediate surroundings in the output grid, based on its own color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:\n    - Red (2) cells cause their orthogonal neighbors to become yellow (4).\n    - Blue (1) cells cause their orthogonal neighbors to become orange (7).\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Process only non-white cells\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                # Define orthogonal neighbors\n                neighbors = [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]\n\n                # Change neighbor colors based on the current cell's color\n                if input_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red cell\n                    for r, c in neighbors:\n                        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:  # Check boundaries\n                            output_grid[r, c] = 4  # Set to yellow\n                elif input_grid[i, j] == 1:  # Blue cell\n                    for r, c in neighbors:\n                        if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:  # Check boundaries\n                            output_grid[r, c] = 7  # Set to orange\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
