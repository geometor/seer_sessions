task_context: "ARC puzzle transformation"
transformation_rule: "For each 8-connected region of color 8, change the color of the cell to the right of the topmost cell and to the left of the bottommost cell to color 1, provided they are within the grid and are not already color 8."
objects:
  - color_8_regions: "8-connected components of cells with color 8"
predicates:
  - topmost_cell: "The cell with the minimum row index (and minimum column index in case of row index ties) within a region"
  - bottommost_cell: "The cell with the maximum row index (and minimum column index in case of row index ties) within a region"
actions:
  - find_connected_regions: "Identify all 8-connected regions of color 8"
  - determine_topmost_cell: "Find the topmost cell within each region"
  - determine_bottommost_cell: "Find the bottommost cell within each region"
  - conditional_color_change_right: "If conditions are met, change the color of the cell to the right of the topmost cell to 1"
  - conditional_color_change_left: "If conditions are met, change the color of the cell to the left of the bottommost cell to 1"
