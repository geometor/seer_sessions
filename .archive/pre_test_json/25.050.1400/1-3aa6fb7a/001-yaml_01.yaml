task_context: "ARC puzzle transformation"
transformation_rule: "For each connected component of color 8, modify the cell to the right of the topmost cell and the cell to the left of the bottommost cell to color 1, if they are within grid boundaries and not already color 8."
objects:
  - color_8_regions: "Connected components of cells with color 8"
predicates:
  - top_most_cell: "Cell in a region with the smallest row index (and smallest column index in case of ties)"
  - bottom_most_cell: "Cell in a region with the largest row index (and smallest column index in case of ties)"
actions:
  - identify_regions: "Find connected regions of color 8"
  - find_top_bottom_cells: "Locate the top-most and bottom-most cells within each region"
  - modify_cell_right: "Change color of the cell to the right of the top-most cell to 1 if conditions are met"
  - modify_cell_left: "Change color of the cell to the left of the bottom-most cell to 1 if conditions are met"
