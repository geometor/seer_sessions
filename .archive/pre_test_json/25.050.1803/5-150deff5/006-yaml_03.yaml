observations:
  - input_grid: |
      - The input grid is 8x9.
      - Contains digits '0' and '5'.
      - The digit '5' forms several distinct shapes, including horizontal lines and an L-shape.
  - output_grid: |
      - The output grid is also 8x9.
      - Contains digits '0', '8', and '2'.
      - The digit '8' replaces some of the '5's, and '2' replaces others, based on their shape and position.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: |
      Replace specific shapes formed by '5' with '8' or '2'. L-shaped structures of '5' are replaced by '8', while horizontal lines or other specific patterns are replaced by '2'. The rule distinguishes between different configurations of '5's to determine the replacement, prioritizing L-shapes for '8' replacement.
