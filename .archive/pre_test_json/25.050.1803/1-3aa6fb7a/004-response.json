The placement of the blue cell depends on whether the azure region is \"left-leaning\" or \"right-leaning\" based on its shape.\n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all connected components of cells with color 8 in the input grid. Each connected component is considered an independent azure region.\n2.  **Analyze Each Region:** For each identified azure region, perform the following steps:\n    a. **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle that encloses the azure region. This is defined by the minimum row (min_r), minimum column (min_c), maximum row (max_r), and maximum column (max_c) indices of the cells in the region.\n    b. **Calculate Centroid Column:** Calculate the average column index of all cells in the azure region.\n    c. **Calculate Bounding Box Center Column:** Calculate the average of the minimum column (min_c) and maximum column (max_c) of the bounding box.\n    d. **Compare Centroid Column and Bounding Box Center Column:**\n        - **If the Centroid Column is greater than the Bounding Box Center Column:** The region is considered \"right-leaning\". Place a blue cell (color 1) at the position with row index equal to the minimum row of the bounding box (min_r) and column index equal to the minimum column of the bounding box (min_c).\n        - **If the Centroid Column is less than or equal to the Bounding Box Center Column:** The region is considered \"left-leaning\" or centered. Place a blue cell (color 1) at the position with row index equal to the minimum row of the bounding box (min_r) and column index immediately to the right of the maximum column of the bounding box (max_c + 1).\n    e. **Preserve Azure Region:** Ensure that the azure region itself remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Maintain Background:** All cells in the input grid that are not part of any azure region and are not modified by step 2.d, remain white (color 0) in the output grid.\n\nThis process is applied independently to each connected azure region in the input grid to produce the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Find connected regions of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def bfs(start_r, start_c):\n        queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n        visited.add((start_r, start_c))\n        region = []\n\n        while queue:\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            region.append((r, c))\n\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if is_valid(nr, nc) and grid[nr, nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n        return region\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                objects.append(bfs(r, c))\n    return objects\n\ndef bounding_box(region):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the bounding box of a region.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c = float('inf'), float('inf')\n    max_r, max_c = float('-inf'), float('-inf')\n    for r, c in region:\n        min_r = min(min_r, r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, c)\n        max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        max_c = max(max_c, c)\n    return min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c\n\ndef centroid_column(region):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the average column index of a region.\"\"\"\n    sum_c = 0\n    for _, c in region:\n        sum_c += c\n    return sum_c / len(region)\n\ndef bounding_box_center_column(bbox):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the center column of the bounding box.\"\"\"\n    _, min_c, _, max_c = bbox\n    return (min_c + max_c) / 2\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    for region in azure_objects:\n        # Calculate bounding box\n        bbox = bounding_box(region)\n        # Calculate centroid column\n        cen_c = centroid_column(region)\n        # Calculate bounding box center column\n        bbox_center_c = bounding_box_center_column(bbox)\n\n        # Compare centroid column and bounding box center column\n        if cen_c > bbox_center_c:  # Right-leaning\n            # Place blue cell at (min_r, min_c)\n            output_grid[bbox[0], bbox[1]] = 1\n        else:  # Left-leaning or centered\n            # Place blue cell at (min_r, max_c + 1)\n             # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n            if bbox[0] < output_grid.shape[0] and bbox[3] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n                output_grid[bbox[0], bbox[3] + 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
