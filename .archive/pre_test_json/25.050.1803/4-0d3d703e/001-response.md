The transformation rule is a simple color replacement. For each cell in the input grid, perform the following color mapping: change color 3 (green) to color 4 (yellow), color 1 (blue) to color 5 (gray), and color 2 (red) to color 6 (magenta).  In essence, each distinct color present in the input grid is replaced by a new, distinct color in the output grid.
