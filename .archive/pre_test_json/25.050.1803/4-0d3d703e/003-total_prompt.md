**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color replacement. For each cell in the input grid, perform the following color mapping: change color 3 (green) to color 4 (yellow), color 1 (blue) to color 5 (gray), and color 2 (red) to color 6 (magenta).  In essence, each distinct color present in the input grid is replaced by a new, distinct color in the output grid.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
