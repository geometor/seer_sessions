  steps:
    - step_1: "Check for the existence of a gray column in the input grid."
    - step_2: "If a gray column is found, create a 3x3 grid."
    - step_3: "Fill the 3x3 grid with color 0 (white)."
    - step_4: "Set the center cell (1,1) of the 3x3 grid to color 2 (red)."
    - step_5: "Output the resulting 3x3 grid."
