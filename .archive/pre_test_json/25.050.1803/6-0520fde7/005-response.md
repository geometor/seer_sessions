**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is triggered by the presence of a 'gray column object' in the input grid. A 'gray column object' is defined as a column where every cell is gray (color 5).

**Condition:** 'gray column object' is present in the input grid.

**Action:** If the condition is met, generate a fixed 3x3 output grid object.

**Output Grid Object Definition:**
  - Dimensions: 3x3
  - Cell colors:
    - Cell at position (row 1, column 0): red (color 2)
    - Cell at position (row 2, column 2): red (color 2)
    - All other cells in the 3x3 grid: white (color 0)

In summary, the transformation checks for a gray column in the input. If found, it outputs a specific 3x3 grid pattern with red cells at positions (1,0) and (2,2), and white cells elsewhere.
