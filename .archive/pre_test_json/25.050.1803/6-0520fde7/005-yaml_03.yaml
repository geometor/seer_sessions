  steps:
    - step_1: "Detect the presence of a 'gray_column_object' in the input grid."
    - step_2: "If 'gray_column_object' is detected, initialize a 3x3 grid."
    - step_3: "Set cells at positions (1,0) and (2,2) of the 3x3 grid to red (color 2)."
    - step_4: "Fill all remaining cells of the 3x3 grid with white (color 0)."
    - step_5: "Output the resulting 3x3 grid."
