**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process begins by examining the input grid for a specific pattern: a column where all cells are of color gray (color 5). If such a column is found anywhere in the input grid, the transformation rule is triggered. This rule dictates the generation of a fixed 3x3 output grid.  In this output grid, the central cell (at row index 1, column index 1, using zero-based indexing) is set to red (color 2), and all other cells within this 3x3 grid are set to white (color 0). The presence of the gray column in the input grid serves as a condition to initiate this transformation, but its position or any other attributes do not further influence the resultant 3x3 output grid, which always remains the same once triggered.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
