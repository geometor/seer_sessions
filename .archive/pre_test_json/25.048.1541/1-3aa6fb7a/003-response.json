One in the top-right, one in the center-left and one in the bottom.\"\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n      shape: \"Same as in input_grid.\"\n    - color: 1\n      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]\n      shape: \"Three single blue pixels\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three disconnected azure (color 8) objects of various shapes.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:**  A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the highest azure pixel of *each* disconnected azure object.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** For each disconnected azure (color 8) object, place a blue pixel (color 1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel in that object. If that position is out of the grid bounds, do not apply the change for the object.\n\n**Elaboration and Justification:**\n\nThis description is nearly identical to the previous one. The core concept remains consistent: find each disconnected object of color 8, identify the topmost pixel within each object, and add a blue pixel to its right. The critical difference in this example, as requested, is to deal correctly with multiple separated components. The code provided already supports this and the validation in the previous round holds.\n"
