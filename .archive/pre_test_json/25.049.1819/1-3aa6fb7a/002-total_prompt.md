Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [1,2]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1(blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[4,4]]

  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Object Persistence:** Notice that the two azure L-shapes remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.

3. **Detect Change**: Comparing the input and the output, the color blue (1) is introduced.

4. **Specify Insertion Rule**: In the input, in the "empty" cell to the immediate right of an azure L-shape's corner of the "L" vertex, change the color to 1.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: Find the azure (8) colored L-shapes. For any azure L-shape, change the "empty" cell to its right (specifically, the cell to the right of the "L"'s vertex) to color blue (1). If a cell is not subject to modification according to this rule, it is left unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
