Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure regions, seems to be mirrored"
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure regions"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two single blue cells"
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is positioned at top-left corner and is formed by the cells (1, 1), (2, 1), (2,2). The other is located at the grid center-right and is formed by cells (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4).

2.  **Place a Blue Pixel:** For each separated azure object, find the cell next to the object: place a single blue pixel (color 1) adjacent to each azure region.
    - For the top-left azure object, a blue pixel is placed just on its right, in cell (1,2).
    - For the center-right object, a blue pixel is placed just on its left, in cell (5,4).

3. **No change for the rest:** Azure objects remain and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: Find all azure areas. For each distinct azure region, place a single blue pixel adjacent to it. The direction seems to be the opposite of the 'direction' of the azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
