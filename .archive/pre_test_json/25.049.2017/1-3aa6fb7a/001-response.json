There are no objects of color different that `0` or `8`.\n\n2.  **Preserve Some, Change Some:**\n    The object `8` remains at the same positions, there are 2 pixels of color `8` that changes to color `1`.\n    The color of two individual `8` cells are changed to `1` (blue).\n    The changed `8` are at positions next to color `8`.\n\n3. **Identify Changing Cells Position:** The cells that are changed are:\n    -   The single azure cell in the top left object, adjacent to another azure cell.\n    -   One azure cell in the bottom rigth object, adjacent to another azure cell.\n\n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**\n\nThe rule can be summarized as follows:\n\nLocate all of `8` colored pixels that forms a group (at least 2). For each group, find the pixel that have another pixel in the group adjacent to it. For all this cases, change color `8` by color `1`. Keep the rest of the grid equal.\n\n"
