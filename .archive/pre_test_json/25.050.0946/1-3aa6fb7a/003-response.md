Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'irregular'
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]  # Top-right cluster
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]  # Center-left cluster
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape mirrored'
      position: [(6,3),(6,4),(7,3)] # Bottom cluster
  grid_size: (7,7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'irregular'
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]  # Top-right cluster
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]  # Center-left cluster
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L-shape mirrored'
      position: [(6,3),(6,4),(7,3)] # Bottom cluster
    - color: 1
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [(1,4),(2,3),(6,3)]
  grid_size: (7,7)

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct objects of color 8. One at the top right, an L shape on the center-left, and a mirrored L-shape on the bottom.

2.  **Transformation:** The azure (color 8) objects are preserved in the output grid.

3. **Add color 1:** At the top-left corner, the starting point, of each of the azure (color 8) objects, a blue (color 1) pixel replaces the azure one.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The program scans the input grid, identifies the distinct azure objects, maintains them in the output and paints with blue (color 1) their top-left corner.

The python code provided before perfectly describes and executes this behaviour. It can be kept as it is.
