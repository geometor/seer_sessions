The first is a vertical 2x1 rectangle at the upper left and a horizontal 1x2 shape. The isolated azure pixel is near the bottom right.\n\n2.  **Introduce Blue Pixel**: We pain blue (color 1) the pixel on the right of any azure (color 8) pixel which has no pixel on its right.\n\n**Transformation Rule**\nThe transformation consists in painting in blue (color 1) the pixels at the right of those azure pixels (color 8) at the right edge of azure shapes.\n"
