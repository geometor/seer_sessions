            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this fourth example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description:\n  input_grid:\n    - \"Three rows, each containing the sequence of colors 9, 4, 2 (maroon, yellow, red).\"\n  output_grid:\n    - \"Three rows, each containing the sequence of colors 8, 3, 6 (azure, green, magenta).\"\n  objects_identified:\n    - \"Each row can be considered as a sequence of colored objects or simply individual colored cells.\"\n  relationships:\n    - \"The structure (three rows of three cells each) is preserved between input and output.\"\n    - \"Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output.\"\n  transformations:\n    - \"Color 9 (maroon) is transformed to 8 (azure).\"\n    - \"Color 4 (yellow) is transformed to 3 (green).\"\n    - \"Color 2 (red) is transformed to 6 (magenta).\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program Description**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Begin with the input grid, consisting of three rows, each with cells colored 9, 4, and 2, respectively.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Apply a direct color substitution to each cell:\n\n    *   Replace color 9 (maroon) with color 8 (azure).\n    *   Replace color 4 (yellow) with color 3 (green).\n    *   Replace color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).\n\n3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The grid's structure (3x3) and the relative positions of the cells remain unchanged.  The transformation is solely based on the defined color mapping. The actions are color substitutions and structure preservation.\n\n**Elaborated Reasoning**\n\nThis example follows the established pattern of direct color substitution.  Each number (color) in the input has a corresponding, predefined output number (color). There's no modification to the spatial arrangement; the transformation is purely a color change based on a one-to-one mapping. This confirms the general rule identified in the previous examples.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is a consistent color mapping across all examples:\n- 1 -> 5\n- 2 -> 6\n- 3 -> 4\n- 4 -> 3\n- 5 -> 1\n- 6 -> 2\n- 8 -> 9\n- 9 -> 8\nThe structure of the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by applying a comprehensive color mapping derived from all examples:\n        - 1 -> 5\n        - 2 -> 6\n        - 3 -> 4\n        - 4 -> 3\n        - 5 -> 1\n        - 6 -> 2\n        - 8 -> 9\n        - 9 -> 8\n    Maintains the original grid structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Apply the color mapping\n    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5  # Replace all occurrences of 1 with 5\n    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 6  # Replace all occurrences of 2 with 6\n    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4  # Replace all occurrences of 3 with 4\n    output_grid[input_grid == 4] = 3  # Replace all occurrences of 4 with 3\n    output_grid[input_grid == 5] = 1  # Replace all occurrences of 5 with 1\n    output_grid[input_grid == 6] = 2  # Replace all occurrences of 6 with 2\n    output_grid[input_grid == 8] = 9  # Replace all occurrences of 8 with 9\n    output_grid[input_grid == 9] = 8  # Replace all occurrences of 9 with 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
