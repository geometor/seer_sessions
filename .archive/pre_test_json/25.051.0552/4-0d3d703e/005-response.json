The transformation only affects the color of each cell based on the defined mapping. The actions are changing the colors and keeping the same grid layout.\n\n**Elaborated Reasoning**\n\nThis transformation is, again, a direct color substitution. Each number (representing a color) in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding, predetermined number (color) in the output grid. The spatial arrangement of the grid cells is preserved. The fundamental rule is a simple color mapping.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is a simple color mapping:\n- Color 5 (gray) becomes color 1 (blue).\n- Color 8 (azure) becomes color 9 (maroon).\n- Color 6 (magenta) becomes color 2 (red).\nThe structure of the grid remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by applying a color mapping:\n    - 5 (gray) -> 1 (blue)\n    - 8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon)\n    - 6 (magenta) -> 2 (red)\n    Maintains the original grid structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Apply the color mapping\n    output_grid[input_grid == 5] = 1  # Replace all occurrences of 5 with 1\n    output_grid[input_grid == 8] = 9  # Replace all occurrences of 8 with 9\n    output_grid[input_grid == 6] = 2  # Replace all occurrences of 6 with 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
