The transformation only affects the color of each cell based on the defined mapping.\n\n**Elaborated Reasoning**\nThis transformation, like the previous one, involves direct color substitution. Every instance of a specific color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output, maintaining the exact shape and size of the input array. There are no spatial operations involved.\n"
