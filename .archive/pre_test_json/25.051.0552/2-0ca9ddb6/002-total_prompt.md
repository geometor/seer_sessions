Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around red object.
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [ (5,6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7,6)]
        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around the blue object.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid that consist of a single cell. In this case, we have two such objects:
    *   A red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2).
    *   A blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Replicate and Preserve original cells:** These two cells are preserve in their original position in the output.

3. **Draw a cross around the original color cells**: For each single-cell object a cross pattern of 2 cells wide is drawn, of a specific color for each original cell.

4.  **Prescribed color for each cross**:
      * The cross around object of color 2 (red) is made of the color 4 (yellow).
      * The cross around object of color 1 (blue) is made of the color 7 (orange).

In summary, the transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
