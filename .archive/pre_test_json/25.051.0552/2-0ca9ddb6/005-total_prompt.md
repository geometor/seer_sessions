Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around red object.
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [ (5,6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7,6)]
        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around the blue object.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid that consist of a single cell. In this case, we have two such objects:
    *   A red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2).
    *   A blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Replicate and Preserve original cells:** These two cells are preserve in their original position in the output.

3. **Draw a cross around the original color cells**: For each single-cell object a cross pattern of 2 cells wide is drawn, of a specific color for each original cell.

4.  **Prescribed color for each cross**:
      * The cross around object of color 2 (red) is made of the color 4 (yellow).
      * The cross around object of color 1 (blue) is made of the color 7 (orange).

In summary, the transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input.

        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around red object.
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [ (2,2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
        shape: single cells forming a cross pattern around the blue object.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid that consist of a single cell. In this case, we have several such objects:
    *   Azure cell (color 8) at position (0, 3)
    *   Two red cells (color 2) at positions (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue cells (color 1) at positions (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Replicate and Preserve original cells:** All the single cells are preserve in their original position in the output.

3. **Draw a cross around the original color cells**: For each single-cell object (except the azure one) a cross pattern of 2 cells wide is drawn, of a specific color for each original cell.

4.  **Prescribed color for each cross**:
      * The cross around objects of color 2 (red) is made of the color 4 (yellow).
      * The cross around objects of color 1 (blue) is made of the color 7 (orange).

In summary, the transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input. The exception is the azure cell, that is preserved without any surrounding cross.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
