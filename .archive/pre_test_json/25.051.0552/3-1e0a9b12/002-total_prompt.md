Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2, 1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]      
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct single-cell objects of colors 1, 4, 6, and 9. The rest of the cells are background (color 0).

2.  **Describe Movement/Transformation:**
    *   The blue object (color 1) at (3, 0) remains in the same position in the output grid (3,0).
    * The yellow object (color 4) at (0,1) moved two rows down to (2,1).
    * The yellow object (color 4) at (2,1) moved one row down to (3,1).
     In the output we have just one object of colour 4, it seems that the two initial objects merged into one object.
    *   The magenta object (color 6) at (2, 2) moves one row down to (3, 2).
    *   The maroon object (color 9) at (0, 3) moves three rows down to (3, 3).

3.  **General Rule:** All the objects maintain their row except the objects with color 4, that are merged. Every object moves down a number of rows which matches its own row number. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
