Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2, 1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]      
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct single-cell objects of colors 1, 4, 6, and 9. The rest of the cells are background (color 0).

2.  **Describe Movement/Transformation:**
    *   The blue object (color 1) at (3, 0) remains in the same position in the output grid (3,0).
    * The yellow object (color 4) at (0,1) moved two rows down to (2,1).
    * The yellow object (color 4) at (2,1) moved one row down to (3,1).
     In the output we have just one object of colour 4, it seems that the two initial objects merged into one object.
    *   The magenta object (color 6) at (2, 2) moves one row down to (3, 2).
    *   The maroon object (color 9) at (0, 3) moves three rows down to (3, 3).

3.  **General Rule:** All the objects maintain their row except the objects with color 4, that are merged. Every object moves down a number of rows which matches its own row number. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.


```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
Every object in the input grid moves down a number of rows equal to its original row number. 
The background (color 0) remains unchanged. The two yellow objects merge.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)

    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(4, 2),(5,2)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of colors 4, 7, 8, and 9. The rest of the cells are background (color 0).

2.  **Describe Movement/Transformation:**
    *   Objects composed by cells with color 4 and 7 maintain its shape and position.
    * The object of color 9 moves from position (0,5) to (5,5)
    * The azure object composed by cells with color 8 at (1, 3) moves to (4,3) and (4,3) moves to (5,3).

3.  **General Rule:**. Every object in the input grid moves down a number of rows equal to its original row number. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
