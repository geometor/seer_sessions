The central red cell jumps to the corner positions. The gray cells occupy the center cross positions.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\nThe central red object exchanges its position type with the gray objects, becoming the corners.\nThe gray object moves to the center cross.\nThe background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and background color\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Define corner and cross positions\n    corners = [(0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2)]\n    cross = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)]\n\n    # Fill output grid based on input positions\n    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            if input_grid[r,c] == 2:\n                for corner in corners:\n                  output_grid[corner] = 2\n            if input_grid[r,c] == 5:\n                for cr in cross:\n                  output_grid[cr]=5\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
