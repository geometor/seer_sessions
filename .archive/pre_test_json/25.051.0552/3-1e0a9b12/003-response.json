The rest of the cells are background (color 0).\n\n2.  **Describe Movement/Transformation:**\n    *   Objects composed by cells with color 4 and 7 maintain its shape and position.\n    * The object of color 9 moves from position (0,5) to (5,5)\n    * The azure object composed by cells with color 8 at (1, 3) moves to (4,3) and (4,3) moves to (5,3).\n\n3.  **General Rule:**. Every object in the input grid moves down a number of rows equal to its original row number. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\nEvery object in the input grid moves down a number of rows equal to its original row number. \nThe background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and returns a list of objects in the grid.\n    Each object is a dictionary with color and positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                positions = [(r, c)]\n                objects.append({'color': color, 'positions': positions})\n                visited.add((r, c))\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    Each object moves down a number of rows equal to its original row number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and background color\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Move each object down by its original row number\n    for obj in objects:\n        color = obj['color']\n        for pos in obj['positions']:\n          row, col = pos\n          new_row = row + row  # Move down by the original row number\n          if new_row < output_grid.shape[0]:\n            output_grid[new_row, col] = color\n          else:\n            output_grid[row, col] = color # if row goes beyond boundary, object remains\n\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n"
