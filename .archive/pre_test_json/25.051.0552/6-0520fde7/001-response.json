The output grid is always the minimal size that includes all non-background colors.\n\n3. **Color Mapping**\n    The color 5 is transformed to color 2 (red). Other non-background colors are deleted.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The output is a 3x3 grid. Non-background colors are removed, except color 5 that is mapped to color 2.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule involves creating a new 3x3 grid. In this new grid only color 5, mapped to color 2, is copied. Other colors are transformed to the background color.\n"
