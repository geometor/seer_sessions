Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x7
    objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: irregular
        positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0)]
      - color: 5
        shape: vertical line
        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: single cell
        positions: [(1,1)]
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct types of objects based on color: objects of color 1 (blue), objects of color 5 (gray), and the background color 0 (white).

2.  **Focus Object:** The output grid is 3x3. The output grid is always the minimal size that includes all non-background colors.

3. **Color Mapping**
    The color 5 is transformed to color 2 (red). Other non-background colors are deleted.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The output is a 3x3 grid. Non-background colors are removed, except color 5 that is mapped to color 2.

**In Summary**

The transformation rule involves creating a new 3x3 grid. In this new grid only color 5, mapped to color 2, is copied. Other colors are transformed to the background color.

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find the positions of color 5 in the input grid
    positions_5 = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)

    # Find min and max row and col to map the positions to the output grid
    if positions_5.size > 0:

        min_col = np.min(positions_5[:, 1])

            col = pos[1] - min_col
            if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3:

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml

    size: 3x7
    objects:

      - color: 5

        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
      - color: 0

        positions: fills the rest
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:

    The color 5 is transformed to color 2 (red). Other non-background colors are deleted.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The output is a 3x3 grid. Non-background colors are removed, except color 5 that is mapped to color 2. The positions of color 5 objects in input grid is mapped to color 2 objects in output grid. The mapping adjusts positions using relative coordinates.

**In Summary**

The transformation rule involves creating a new 3x3 grid. In this new grid, only color 5, mapped to color 2, is copied. Other colors are transformed to the background color. The relative positions of color 5 in the minimal bounding box are maintained.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 005
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x7
    objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: irregular
        positions: [(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6)]
      - color: 5

        positions:  [(1, 0), (2,2)]
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct types of objects based on color: objects of color 1 (blue), objects of color 5 (gray), and the background color 0 (white).

2.  **Bounding Box:** The output grid dimensions (3x3) correspond to the minimal bounding box that encompasses all non-background colors in the input grid.

3.  **Color Mapping:** Within this bounding box, color 5 (gray) is transformed to color 2 (red). All other non-background colors (in this case, color 1 - blue) are removed, being replaced by the background color 0 (white).

4. **Relative Positioning:** The relative positions of the color 5 objects within the bounding box are preserved in the output grid after being mapped to color 2. The transformation translates the objects but keeps their spatial arrangement.

**In Summary**
The transformation extracts the smallest bounding box that contains all non-background colors. The color 5 is transformed to color 2.

```python

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find the positions of color 5 in the input grid
    positions_5 = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)

    # Find min and max row and col to map the positions to the output grid
    if positions_5.size > 0:
        min_row = np.min(positions_5[:, 0])
        min_col = np.min(positions_5[:, 1])
        
        # Copy and map color 5 to color 2 in the output grid, adjusting for position
        for pos in positions_5:
            row = pos[0] - min_row
            col = pos[1] - min_col
            if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3:
               output_grid[row, col] = 2

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
