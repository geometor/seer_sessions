It might not be a single contiguous object.\n\n2.  **Split and Replace (with neighbor check):**\n    *   Change the color of gray pixels to azure.\n    *   A gray pixel is changed to red if and only if its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are *all* gray in the input grid.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\n1. Find all the gray (color 5) pixels.\n2. Recolor each gray pixel to azure.\n3. During the recoloring, check the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each gray pixel *in the original input grid*.\n4. If all four neighbors are gray, replace the pixel in the output with red (color 2) instead of azure.\n```\n\nThe key here is that the neighbor check is performed against the *original* input grid, not the evolving output grid. This ensures the rule applies consistently, regardless of the order in which pixels are processed.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.\n2. Recolor them to azure (8).\n3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel *before* recoloring.\n4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red (2).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:\n    Gray (5) pixels are recolored to azure (8), and if a gray pixel has\n    all gray neighbors (up, down, left, right), it's replaced with red (2).\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                # Recolor gray pixels to azure\n                output_grid[i, j] = 8\n\n                # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid\n                up = i > 0 and input_grid[i - 1, j] == 5\n                down = i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i + 1, j] == 5\n                left = j > 0 and input_grid[i, j - 1] == 5\n                right = j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j + 1] == 5\n\n                # If all neighbors are gray, replace with red\n                if up and down and left and right:\n                    output_grid[i, j] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
