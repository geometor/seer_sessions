Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 5 (gray)
        shape: Irregular, but roughly a mirrored 'L' shape
        position: Centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
        size: 16 cells
  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Similar to input, but with some cells replaced
        position: Same as input
        size: 8
    - object_2:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: Replaces cells of gray object
      size: 8
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (5) object in the input grid.

2.  **Split and Replace:**
    *   The gray object is recolored with azure.
    *   When possible, cells in the gray object are replaced. When a gray pixel has up, down, left and right gray neighbors, it's replaced with a red pixel.

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.
2. Recolor them to azure.
3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel before recoloring.
4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red.
```

```python
"""
1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.
2. Recolor them to azure.
3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel before recoloring.
4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red.

    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 5 (gray)
        shape: Irregular, scattered, but with some contiguous regions
        position: Mostly centered, spanning multiple rows
        size: 19 cells
  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Corresponds to the original gray object, but with some replacements.
        position: Same as input
        size: 12 cells
    - object_2:
        color: 2 (red)
        shape: Fills in gaps and replaces some gray cells
        position: Interspersed within the azure object
        size: 7 cells
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation, which is the same rule determined from the first example:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (5) object(s) in the input grid. It might not be a single contiguous object.

2.  **Split and Replace (with neighbor check):**
    *   Change the color of gray pixels to azure.
    *   A gray pixel is changed to red if and only if its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are *all* gray in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

```
1. Find all the gray (color 5) pixels.
2. Recolor each gray pixel to azure.
3. During the recoloring, check the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each gray pixel *in the original input grid*.
4. If all four neighbors are gray, replace the pixel in the output with red (color 2) instead of azure.
```

The key here is that the neighbor check is performed against the *original* input grid, not the evolving output grid. This ensures the rule applies consistently, regardless of the order in which pixels are processed.

```python
"""
1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.
2. Recolor them to azure (8).
3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel *before* recoloring.
4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
