It might not be a single contiguous object.\n\n2.  **Split and Replace (with neighbor check):**\n    *   Change the color of gray pixels to azure.\n    *   A gray pixel is changed to red if and only if its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are *all* gray in the input grid.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\n1. Find all the gray (color 5) pixels.\n2. Recolor each gray pixel to azure.\n3. During the recoloring, check the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each gray pixel *in the original input grid*.\n4. If all four neighbors are gray, replace the pixel in the output with red (color 2) instead of azure.\n```\n\nThe key here is that the neighbor check is performed against the *original* input grid, not the evolving output grid. This ensures the rule applies consistently, regardless of the order in which pixels are processed.\n"
