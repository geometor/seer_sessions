When a gray pixel has up, down, left and right gray neighbors, it's replaced with a red pixel.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\n1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.\n2. Recolor them to azure.\n3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel before recoloring.\n4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red.\n```\n"
