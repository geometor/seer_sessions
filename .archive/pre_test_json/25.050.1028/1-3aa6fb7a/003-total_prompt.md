Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape, 2x1 block and 1x2 block
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5],[5,4]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape, 2x1 block and 1x2 block
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5],[5,4]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,3]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects composed of color 8 (azure). One is in the top-left corner, and the other is in the center-right area.

2.  **Detect Change:** Compare it with the output grid. We see that the azure (8) objects remain unchanged in their original size, shape and positions. We note the appearance of two new single-cell blue (1) objects.

3.  **Analyze Emergence**: If we look closely where the blue objects appear, it seems to be directly to the right of the uppermost azure pixel of each object.
    *   The top-left azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.
    *   The center-right azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.

4.  **Formulate the Rule**: The rule appears to be: For each separated azure (8) object, add a blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of its topmost azure (8) pixel.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

*   Iterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.
*   For each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).
*   Place a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the right of this topmost azure pixel.
*   All other cells keep its value.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
