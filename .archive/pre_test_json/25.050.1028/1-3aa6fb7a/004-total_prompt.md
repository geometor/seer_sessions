Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape, 2x1 block and 1x2 block
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5],[5,4]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape, 2x1 block and 1x2 block
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5],[5,4]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,3]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects composed of color 8 (azure). One is in the top-left corner, and the other is in the center-right area.

2.  **Detect Change:** Compare it with the output grid. We see that the azure (8) objects remain unchanged in their original size, shape and positions. We note the appearance of two new single-cell blue (1) objects.

3.  **Analyze Emergence**: If we look closely where the blue objects appear, it seems to be directly to the right of the uppermost azure pixel of each object.
    *   The top-left azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.
    *   The center-right azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.

4.  **Formulate the Rule**: The rule appears to be: For each separated azure (8) object, add a blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of its topmost azure (8) pixel.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

*   Iterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.
*   For each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).
*   Place a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the right of this topmost azure pixel.
*   All other cells keep its value.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Dispersed, various shapes and sizes.
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Same as input.
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1, 4], [2, 3], [5,3]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:**  The input grid contains multiple azure (8) objects of varying shapes and sizes, dispersed throughout the grid.

2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing with the output grid, the azure (8) objects remain in their original positions, shapes, and sizes. The difference is the addition of blue (1) single-cell objects.

3.  **Analyze Emergence:**  The blue (1) pixels appear to be added based on a specific rule related to the azure (8) objects. Let's examine their positions:
    *   A blue pixel is added at [1, 4], which is to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the object formed by [0,4] and [0,5].
    *   Another blue pixel is added at [2, 3], to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the object formed by [2,2], [3,2] and [3,3].
    *   A blue pixel appears at [5, 3], which is to the left of the topmost pixel of the object located at [5,4].

4.  **Formulate the Rule:**  The rule appears to be: For each separate azure (8) object, add a blue (1) pixel immediately to the *left* of its topmost azure (8) pixel. Note the change with respect the previous task.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

*   Iterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.
*   For each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).
*   Place a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the *left* of this topmost azure pixel.
*   All other cells keep their value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
