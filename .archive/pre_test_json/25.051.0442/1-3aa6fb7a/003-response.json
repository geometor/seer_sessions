These are \"reverse L-shape\", a \"L-shape\" and a \"reverse L-shape\".\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure shapes are preserved from input to output. The changes are single blue cells that were not present in input grid.\n\n3.  **Determine filling rule:** Find the cell to the immediate left of the top-right corner of each azure object and change the color of this cell to 1 (blue). It can be also seen as filling the cell to the right of top-left cell of the object.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\nFor each azure object in the input grid:\n    Locate the top-left corner of the object.\n    Move one cell to the right of the top-left corner.\n    Change the color of this cell to blue (1).\n    Preserve the initial objects.\n```\nThe code is correct.\n"
