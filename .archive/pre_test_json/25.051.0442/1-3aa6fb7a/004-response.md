Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [[1,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [[4,4]]      
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One is an "L-shape" in the top-left corner, and the other is a "reverse L-shape" in the bottom-right corner.

2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure shapes are preserved from input to output. The changes are single blue cells that were not present in input grid.

3. **Determine filling rule:** Find the cell to the immediate right of the top-left corner of each azure object and change the color of this cell to 1 (blue).

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each azure object in the input grid:
    Locate the top-left corner of the object.
    Move one cell to the right of the top-left corner.
    Change the color of this cell to blue (1).
    Preserve the initial objects.
```

```python
"""
For each azure object in the input grid:
    Locate the top-left corner of the object.
    Move one cell to the right of the top-left corner.
    Change the color of this cell to blue (1).
