Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
output_grid:
 objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'L-shape'
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: 'reverse L-shape'
      positions: [[5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [[1,4]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [[2,3]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 'single cell'
      positions: [[5,3]]
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see three distinct objects of color 8 (azure). These are "reverse L-shape", a "L-shape" and a "reverse L-shape".

2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure shapes are preserved from input to output. The changes are single blue cells that were not present in input grid.

3.  **Determine filling rule:** Find the cell to the immediate left of the top-right corner of each azure object and change the color of this cell to 1 (blue). It can be also seen as filling the cell to the right of top-left cell of the object.

**Natural Language Program**

```
For each azure object in the input grid:
    Locate the top-left corner of the object.
    Move one cell to the right of the top-left corner.
    Change the color of this cell to blue (1).
    Preserve the initial objects.
```
The code is correct.
