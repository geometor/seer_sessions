Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second set of input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: Three distinct objects
      count: 9
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: Three distinct objects
      count: 9
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixel
      count: 3
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct azure (color 8) objects.

    *   The first object is in the top right and is made of a horizontal 1x2 rectange with a 1 pixel extension on the bottom left.

    *   The second object is in the middle left, and is made of a vertical 1x2 rectange with a 1 pixel extension on the bottom right.

    *   The third object is at the bottom and is also made of a horizontal 1x2 rectange with a 1 pixel extension on the top left.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0) background.

2.  **Detect changes:**
    *   Identify azure-colored pixels, specifically at the position of the top-right corner of the shape.
    *   From those positions, substitute the color from azure to blue.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to change the color of the top-right azure pixel of each azure shape to blue.

**Summary**
The transformation is the same as in the previous example. The input azure shapes are detected. For each shape, the top-right pixel of the shape is found, and its color is changed from azure (8) to blue (1). The other parts of the azure shapes and the white background remain unchanged.

The provided Python code correctly implements this rule.
