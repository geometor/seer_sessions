Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[6,3], [6,4], [5,4]]
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
      - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[6,3], [6,4], [5,4]]
  background_color: 0 (white)
  changes:
     - position: [1,4]
       original_color: 0
       new_color: 1
     - position: [2,3]
       original_color: 0
       new_color: 1
    - position: [5,3]
       original_color: 0
       new_color: 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** All azure objects are preserved from input to output.

3.  **Detect Changes relative to objects**:
    *   The top right object has a new color to their left, in the bottom part of the L.
    *   The top left object has a new color to their right, in the top part of the L.
    *   The bottom object has a new color to their left, in the bottom part of the L.

4.  **Describe the new color**:
    * The added color is always 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The overall rule is to identify the azure L-shaped objects, maintain them, and place color 1 relative to them.

The code provided should work fine with this example.
