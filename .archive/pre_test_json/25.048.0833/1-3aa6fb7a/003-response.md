Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

output_grid:
 objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,4]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[2,3]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions:  [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[5,3]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Changes**:
    *   The L-shape `[[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]` has its corner at `[1,5]` in input changed to blue `[1,4]` in output.
    *   The L-shape `[[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]` has its corner at `[3,3]` changed to blue `[2,3]` in output.
    *  The L-shape `[[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]` has its corner at `[6,5]` to blue `[5,3]` in output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Locate all L-shaped objects of color 8.
    *   Each corner changes to color blue, one row before and, one row before.

**Step-by-step transformation description**

*   Locate all the L-shaped objects composed by cells of color 8.
*   For each L-shape group:
    *   Identify the corner cell.
    *   Change the color of a cell located one up and one to the left respect to the corner cell to blue (1).
*   Copy any other cell from the input to the output grid.

Transformation Rule:

1. **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).
2. **Detect Changes**: The corner cell of each L-shape with color 8 generates a blue cell one row before and one column before.
3. **Transformation:** Copy all cells. Change the upper left of identified corner to blue.
