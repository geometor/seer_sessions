Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]

output_grid:

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Single Changes:**
    *   The azure cell at `[1,1]` in Input is maintained in Output. The azure cell at `[1,2]` is transformed to cell `[1,2]` in Output with color blue (1).
    *   The azure cell at `[4,4]` in Input is transformed to the cell `[4,4]` in Output with color blue (1). The azure cell at `[4,5]` in Input is maintained in Output.

3. **Transformation Rule**
    *   The corner cell of the "L" shape changes to blue.

**Step-by-step transformation description**

*   Locate all the L-shaped objects composed by cells of color 8.
*   For each group, if it forms the particular shape, change to blue the corner cell.
*   Copy any other cell.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Each corner changes to color blue, one row before and, one row before.

**Step-by-step transformation description**

*   For each L-shape group:
    *   Identify the corner cell.
    *   Change the color of a cell located one up and one to the left respect to the corner cell to blue (1).
*   Copy any other cell from the input to the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
