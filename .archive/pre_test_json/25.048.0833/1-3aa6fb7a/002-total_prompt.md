Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2]]
        
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[4,4]]      
  grid_size: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Single Changes:**
    *   The azure cell at `[1,1]` in Input is maintained in Output. The azure cell at `[1,2]` is transformed to cell `[1,2]` in Output with color blue (1).
    *   The azure cell at `[4,4]` in Input is transformed to the cell `[4,4]` in Output with color blue (1). The azure cell at `[4,5]` in Input is maintained in Output.

3. **Transformation Rule**
    *   The corner cell of the "L" shape changes to blue.

**Step-by-step transformation description**

*   Locate all the L-shaped objects composed by cells of color 8.
*   For each group, if it forms the particular shape, change to blue the corner cell.
*   Copy any other cell.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
