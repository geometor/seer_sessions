The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Compare the input and output. The azure L-shaped objects remain unchanged. However, a single cell of color blue(1) appears next to the 'leg' of each L shape.\n\n3.  **Describe the rule:** For each azure object, the cell to the right of the bottom-most pixel of the object that is not part of that azure object gets colored blue (color 1).\n\n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**\n\nThe transformation rule can be stated as follows:\n\nFor each azure (color 8) object, find its bottom-most, non-connected point. Change the adjacent right cell of this point to blue (color 1). If the right cell is already part of the azure object, or if the right cell is out of boundary, do nothing.\n"
