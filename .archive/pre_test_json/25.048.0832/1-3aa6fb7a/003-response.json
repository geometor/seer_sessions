A blue (color 1) cell appears adjacent to each azure object.\n\n3.  **Describe the rule:** For each azure object, find the rightmost pixel of its lowest row. The cell immediately to the left of this pixel is changed to blue (color 1).\n\n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**\nThe transformation rule is very similar to the first task.\n\nFor each azure (color 8) object:\n1. Locate the *lowest* row of the azure object.\n2. Identify the *right-most* pixel on that row.\n3. Color the cell to the *left* of this identified cell to blue (color 1).\n4. If there is an azure object directly to the left, do nothing.\n\nThe provided python code can implement this rule with minor changes.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is very similar to the first task.\n\nFor each azure (color 8) object:\n1.
