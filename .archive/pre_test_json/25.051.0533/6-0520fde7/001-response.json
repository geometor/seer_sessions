Otherwise, it is 0.\n3.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 which is filled with color 0, with a centered pixel of color 2.\n\n**In essence,** the transformation focuses on the central vertical line. The output is always a 3x3 grid filled with 0, but the central color extracted (color 2).\n"
