Note their positions. These objects form an \"L\" shape, consisting of a 2x2 block with one cell removed.\n\n2.  **Preserve Objects:** Keep every object of color 8 in its original position in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Introduce New Objects:** Add new objects to the grid.\n    *    To the right of the top left object 8, introduce a single cell of color 1 (blue) if and only if the cell to the right of the object is color 0.\n    *    To the left of the bottom right object 8, introduce a single cell of color 1 (blue) if and only if the cell to the left of the object is color 0.\n\nIn summary, the transformation preserves the azure \"L\" shaped objects and adds a blue cell adjacent to each, based on the initial positions of these shapes, with the added blue cells located on opposite sides.\n"
