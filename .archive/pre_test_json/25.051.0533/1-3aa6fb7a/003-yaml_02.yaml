      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (two instances)
        positions:
          - top-right corner: [0,4] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
          - middle-left: [2,2] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
          - bottom-right: [5,4]
        notes: The L-shape objects appear in different places compared with the first example.
