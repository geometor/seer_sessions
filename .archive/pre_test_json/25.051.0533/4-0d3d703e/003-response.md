Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Block for Observations:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [2, 3, 8]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (2, 3, 8).
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [6, 4, 9]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (6, 4, 9).
transformation:
  type: color_mapping
  details: Each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement remains identical.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**

The input grid consists of three horizontal lines, each displaying the color sequence 2, 3, 8.  The output grid mirrors this structure with three horizontal lines, but the colors are transformed according to a consistent mapping:

1.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.
2.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.
3.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.

Similar to the previous example, the transformation involves only a color change. The spatial characteristics—positions, sizes, and shapes of the horizontal lines—are preserved. The operation is a straightforward color substitution based on the defined mapping. No geometric transformations are applied.
