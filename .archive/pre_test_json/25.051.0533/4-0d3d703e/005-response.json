The spatial arrangement remains identical.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe input grid is composed of three horizontal lines, each characterized by the color sequence 5, 8, 6. The output grid maintains the same structure of three horizontal lines but exhibits a different color sequence, determined by a specific color mapping:\n\n1.  Color 5 (gray) in the input is transformed to color 1 (blue) in the output.\n2.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is transformed to color 9 (maroon) in the output.\n3.  Color 6 (magenta) in the input is transformed to color 2 (red) in the output.\n\nThe transformation is purely a color substitution. The spatial attributes of the objects\u2014the horizontal lines\u2014remain consistent between the input and output grids. There are no changes in position, size, or shape; only the colors of the constituent elements are altered according to the defined mapping.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe input grid is composed of three horizontal lines, each characterized by the color sequence 5, 8, 6.
