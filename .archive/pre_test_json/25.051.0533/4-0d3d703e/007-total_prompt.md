Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block for Observations:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [3, 1, 2]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (3, 1, 2).
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [4, 5, 6]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (4, 5, 6).
transformation:
  type: color_mapping
  details: Each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement remains identical.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**

The input grid consists of three horizontal lines, each with the color sequence 3, 1, 2. The output grid also has three horizontal lines. However, the colors have been transformed according to a specific mapping:

1.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.
2.  Color 1 (blue) in the input is replaced by color 5 (gray) in the output.
3.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.

The positions, sizes, and shapes of the objects (horizontal lines) remain unchanged; only the colors are altered based on the above mapping. There are no rotations, reflections or translations. The transformation consists on a color mapping.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Block for Observations:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [2, 3, 8]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (2, 3, 8).
output_grid:

  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [6, 4, 9]
      count: 3

transformation:
  type: color_mapping
  details: Each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement remains identical.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**

The input grid consists of three horizontal lines, each displaying the color sequence 2, 3, 8.  The output grid mirrors this structure with three horizontal lines, but the colors are transformed according to a consistent mapping:

1.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.
2.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.
3.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.

Similar to the previous example, the transformation involves only a color change. The spatial characteristics—positions, sizes, and shapes of the horizontal lines—are preserved. The operation is a straightforward color substitution based on the defined mapping. No geometric transformations are applied.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Block for Observations:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [5, 8, 6]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (5, 8, 6).

      color_sequence: [1, 9, 2]

transformation:
  type: color_mapping
  details: Each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement remains identical.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**

The input grid is composed of three horizontal lines, each characterized by the color sequence 5, 8, 6. The output grid maintains the same structure of three horizontal lines but exhibits a different color sequence, determined by a specific color mapping:

1.  Color 5 (gray) in the input is transformed to color 1 (blue) in the output.
2.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is transformed to color 9 (maroon) in the output.
3.  Color 6 (magenta) in the input is transformed to color 2 (red) in the output.

The transformation is purely a color substitution. The spatial attributes of the objects—the horizontal lines—remain consistent between the input and output grids. There are no changes in position, size, or shape; only the colors of the constituent elements are altered according to the defined mapping.

Across all examples, the transformation consistently involves a one-to-one color mapping while preserving the spatial structure of the input grid. Each color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output grid, without any changes to the positions, shapes, or sizes of the elements.

Based on the three examples provided, we can deduce the following comprehensive color mapping:

1. Color 3 (green) -> Color 4 (yellow)
2. Color 1 (blue) -> Color 5 (gray)
3. Color 2 (red) -> Color 6 (magenta)
4. Color 8 (azure) -> Color 9 (maroon)
5. Color 5 (gray) -> Color 1 (blue)
6. Color 6 (magenta) -> Color 2 (red)

This mapping covers all color transformations observed in the provided examples. The function below will apply this universal mapping to transform any given input grid into its corresponding output grid.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
