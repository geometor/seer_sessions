Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5 (gray)
        shape: irregular, but roughly rectangular regions
        positions: various, forming a larger pattern
        size: varies
    background:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills the entire grid
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: similar to the gray regions in the input, but slightly altered
        positions: corresponding to the gray regions
        size: varies
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: occupies spaces where parts of the gray objects were connected
        positions: between azure regions
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills remaining space
```

**Natural Language Program**
Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see several objects. They are contiguous blocks of cells with color 5 (gray), surrounded by cells of color 0 (white).

2.  **Color Transformation (Gray to Azure):** Every gray (5) cell in the input grid is changed to an azure (8) cell in the output grid.

3.  **Red Filling between Gray Objects:** Now look at the azure objects. The red objects are related with them. For each pair of vertically or horizontally adjacent azure, draw the largest possible red rectangle so that:
    - It starts from the edge of the first azure object.
    - It ends at the edge of the second azure object.
    - It's thickness is equal to one cell.

4.   The bounding box of the objects formed by gray objects must be equal to the bounding box formed by azure and red objects.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

*   Replace all gray (5) cells with azure (8) cells.
*   Fill the one-cell-thick spaces between azure objects with red (2).
*   Ensure that the bounding box of the gray regions in the input is conserved.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5 (gray)
        shape: irregular, roughly rectangular and linear arrangements
        positions: various, forming a discontinuous pattern
        size: varies

      - color: 0 (white)

        shape: similar to the gray regions in the input, but some are altered
        positions: corresponding to the gray regions
        size: varies
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: fills spaces where parts of the gray objects were connected or adjacent
        positions: between or adjacent to azure regions
    background:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills the remaining space

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we see distinct objects, which are contiguous blocks of cells with color 5 (gray), surrounded by cells of color 0 (white).

2.  **Color Transformation (Gray to Azure):**  Most of the gray (5) cells in the input grid are changed to azure (8) cells in the output grid.

3.  **Red Filling between and adjacent to Gray Objects:** Examine pairs of gray objects and their relative positions:
     - If two gray objects have the potential to be connected by a horizontal or vertical line of red (2) color of thickness one, draw the largest possible red line connecting them.
     - If two gray objects are diagonally adyacent, also fill with red color.

4.  **Bounding Box Conservation**: The overall bounding box defined by the outermost edges of the gray objects in the input grid should be the same as the bounding box of the combined azure and red objects in the output grid.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

*   Replace almost all gray (5) cells with azure (8) cells.
*   Fill the one-cell-thick spaces between azure objects, and cells diagonally adjacent with red (2).
*   Ensure that the bounding box of the gray regions in the input is conserved.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5 (gray)
        shape: irregular, roughly rectangular and linear arrangements
        positions: various, forming a discontinuous pattern
        size: varies
    background:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills the entire grid
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: parts of the gray regions, typically the rightmost or bottommost parts
        positions: corresponding to parts of the gray regions
        size: varies
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: fills remaining spaces that were part of the gray object
        positions: replacing gray
    background:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills the remaining space

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** First, identify the distinct objects in the input grid. These are the contiguous regions of gray (5) cells.

2.  **Partial Color Transformation**: The gray cells within the input grid are changed to one of two colors:
    *   Azure (8): The rightmost gray pixels within a row are turned into azure.
    *   Red (2): The remaining gray pixels, other than the rightmost, become red.

3.  **Bounding Box**: It's implicitly understood that we only consider transformations within the bounding box encompassing the original gray objects.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1.  Locate all gray (5) colored regions.
2.  Within each contiguous horizontal segment of a gray region, change all gray cells to red (2) except the rightmost cell.
3.  Change the rightmost gray cell in each contiguous horizontal segment to azure (8).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
