These are the contiguous regions of gray (5) cells.\n\n2.  **Partial Color Transformation**: The gray cells within the input grid are changed to one of two colors:\n    *   Azure (8): The rightmost gray pixels within a row are turned into azure.\n    *   Red (2): The remaining gray pixels, other than the rightmost, become red.\n\n3.  **Bounding Box**: It's implicitly understood that we only consider transformations within the bounding box encompassing the original gray objects.\n\n**Summary of the Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  Locate all gray (5) colored regions.\n2.  Within each contiguous horizontal segment of a gray region, change all gray cells to red (2) except the rightmost cell.\n3.  Change the rightmost gray cell in each contiguous horizontal segment to azure (8).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.
