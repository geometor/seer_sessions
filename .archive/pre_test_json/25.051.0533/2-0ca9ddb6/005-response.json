Also one to the left, and one to the right.\n\n4.  **Create Orange Surroundings:** For *each* blue cell (color 1), create an L-shape pattern with orange cells (color 7). Specifically, one position above, one to the left, and one to the right of the original blue cells position, plus one cell with the same row and one position left to the blue cell.\n\n5.  **Magenta cells unchanged:** Similar to the Azure cell from the previous example, the magenta (color 6) single cell does not trigger any additional transformations. It's treated the same as any other single-cell object that isn't red or blue.\n\nThe provided python code correctly implements this.\n"
