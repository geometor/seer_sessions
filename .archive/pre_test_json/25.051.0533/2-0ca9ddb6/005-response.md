Okay, let's analyze this third example and confirm/update our transformation rule.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      position: (5, 6)
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
      note: unchanged
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
      note: unchanged
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      position: (5, 6)
      shape: single cell
      note: unchanged
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (3,1), (3,3)]
      shape: single cells forming a pattern around the red object
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (7, 4)]
      shape: L shape surrounding the blue objects
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be consistent with the previous examples, with the addition of handling a magenta (color 6) cell:

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Locate all objects in the input grid that consist of a single cell.

2.  **Preserve All Single Cells:** Keep *all* single-cell objects (regardless of color) in their original positions in the output grid.

3.  **Create Yellow Surroundings:** For *each* red cell (color 2), place a yellow cell (color 4) two rows above and one to the left, two rows above and one to the right. Also one to the left, and one to the right.

4.  **Create Orange Surroundings:** For *each* blue cell (color 1), create an L-shape pattern with orange cells (color 7). Specifically, one position above, one to the left, and one to the right of the original blue cells position, plus one cell with the same row and one position left to the blue cell.

5.  **Magenta cells unchanged:** Similar to the Azure cell from the previous example, the magenta (color 6) single cell does not trigger any additional transformations. It's treated the same as any other single-cell object that isn't red or blue.

The provided python code correctly implements this.
