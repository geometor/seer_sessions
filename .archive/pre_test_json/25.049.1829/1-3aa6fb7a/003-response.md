Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: Three separate L-shaped objects
      size: Each L-shape consists of 3 cells.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: Three L-shaped objects
      size: Each L-shape has size 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: single cells.
      size: 1
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Replacement Points:** The "internal corner" of each L-shape is targeted for modification.

3.  **Color Insertion**: Change the color of each corner from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue).

4. **No change otherwise**: All other cells are unchanged.

**Transformation Rule in Natural Language**

The transformation rule is identical to the previous example. It identifies azure (8) colored L-shaped objects (of 3 cells) and changes the color of their internal corner cell to blue (1).

The Python code provided previously should be correct because this rule generalizes across both examples.
