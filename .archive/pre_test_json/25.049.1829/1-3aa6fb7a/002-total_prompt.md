Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shaped objects (one mirrored)
      size: Each L-shape consists of 3 cells.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two L-shaped objects
      size: Each L-shape has size 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single cells.
      size: 1
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Replacement Points:** Observe that the "internal corner" or "elbow" of the L shapes (azure color).

3. **Color Insertion**: Change the color of the corner in each L-shape object from azure (8) to color blue (1).

4. **No change otherwise**: All other cells are unchanged.

**Transformation Rule in Natural Language**

The transformation identifies all the azure (8) colored L-shaped objects (made of 3 cells of color 8) in the input grid. Then, changes to blue (1) the internal corner of those L-shaped objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
