Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: Single pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two distinct L-shaped objects.

2.  **Corner Detection:** Locate the interior corner of the "L" by finding a singular azure pixel adjacent with the other azure pixels.

3.  **Color Change:** Change the singular azure pixel to blue (color 1).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation identifies the two azure L-shaped and changing the interior corner pixel to blue. All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
