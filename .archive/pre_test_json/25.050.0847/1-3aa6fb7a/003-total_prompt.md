Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical and 2x1 horizontal azure colored clusters"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical and 2x1 horizontal azure colored clusters"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 blue cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all the azure (color 8) colored clusters in the input grid. In this instance we find a 1x2 and a 2x1 cluster.

2.  **Check Blue Objects:** Verify if any blue cells (color 1) appears *adjacent* and to the *right* of the 1x2 azure object *top*, and if a blue cell (color 1) appears *adjacent* and to the *left* of the 2x1 azure object *bottom*.

3.  **Place Blue Object:** If the above condition is true, place a single blue cell (color 1) immediately *adjacent* and to the *right* of the 1x2 azure object *top*, and a single blue cell (color 1) immediately *adjacent* and to the *left* of the 2x1 azure object *bottom*.

4.   **Preserve Original:** All remaining objects and their positions in the input remain unchanged.

In summary, the rule involves identifying the specific shape/position azure clusters, and based on that, placing a blue color accordingly, and preserving the azure clusters.

```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies two specific azure (color 8) clusters: a 1x2 vertical cluster and a 2x1 horizontal cluster. A blue cell (color 1) is placed immediately to the right of the top cell of the 1x2 cluster, and another blue cell is placed immediately to the left of the bottom cell of the 2x1 cluster. The azure clusters and other cells remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
