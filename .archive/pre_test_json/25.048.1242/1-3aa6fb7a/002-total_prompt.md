Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single separate pixels."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One is an "L" shape formed by the pixels at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The other is an inverted "L" shape formed by pixels at (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5).

2.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:**
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) is placed immediately to the right of the topmost azure pixel of the first "L" shape. In other words, from azure pixel (1,1), to the right is (1,2).
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) is placed immediately to the left of the lowest azure pixel of the second "L" shape. In other words, from azure pixel (4,5) to the left is (4,4).

3.  **Preserve other Azure Pixels.** The existing azure pixels from input are not modified.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation identifies the two azure L-shaped objects and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to a specific point on each of those objects. The first object is identified on the top-left side, and the second L-shaped object is identified on the middle-right side. The rest of the azure pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
