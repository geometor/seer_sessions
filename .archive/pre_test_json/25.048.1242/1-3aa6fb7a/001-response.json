Here's my breakdown:\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n      shape: \"Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)\"\n  dimensions: [7, 7]\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n      shape: \"Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)\"\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]\n      shape: \"Two single separate pixels.\"\n  dimensions: [7, 7]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One is an \"L\" shape formed by the pixels at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The other is an inverted \"L\" shape formed by pixels at (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5).\n\n2.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:**\n    *   A blue pixel (color 1) is placed immediately to the right of the topmost azure pixel of the first \"L\" shape. In other words, from azure pixel (1,1), to the right is (1,2).\n    *   A blue pixel (color 1) is placed immediately to the left of the lowest azure pixel of the second \"L\" shape. In other words, from azure pixel (4,5) to the left is (4,4).\n\n3.  **Preserve other Azure Pixels.** The existing azure pixels from input are not modified.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation identifies the two azure L-shaped objects and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to a specific point on each of those objects. The first object is identified on the top-left side, and the second L-shaped object is identified on the middle-right side. The rest of the azure pixels remain unchanged.\n"
