Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Three separate 2x1 vertical shapes and a single horizontal 1x2 shape and a single point.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,4),(2,3),(5,3)]
      shape: single vertical shapes
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two primary objects: azure (color 8) colored regions and the background (color 0).

2.  **Detect Corner:** The corner of azure colored shapes will be converted. For the shapes at the left side, upper-right, For shapes at right, it is lower-left.

3. **Change the colors:** The identified point should be converted to blue.

4.  **Preserve other objects:** The azure color regions remain unchanged.

**In summary**:
The input features azure squares. These objects do not move.
The corner of azure shapes should be converted to blue.
