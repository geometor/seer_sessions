Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate azure 'L' shapes, each composed of three cells."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate azure 'L' shapes, similar to input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]
      shape: "Two blue single cells inside L shape's corners."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) cells. Each "L" shape consists of three cells.

2.  **Locate Corners.**: For both azure L shapes, identify their inner corner.

3. **Change Color:** A blue cell (color code 1) is placed inside the corner of each "L".

4.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged (color 0).

**In summary**: The transformation identifies particular L-shaped patterns and put a blue cell inside each L shape's corner. All other parts of the input are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
