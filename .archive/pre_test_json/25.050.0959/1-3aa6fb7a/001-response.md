Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (inverted)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (inverted)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects, both of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Change**: The first object made of 8 is at position (1,1), and the second is at (3,4). The target cell to change is the cell next to the top right corner of the L-shape.

3.  **Action - Single Cell Replacement:** Select the cell to the top-right of each L-shape with value 0.

4.  **Coloring:** Change the color of the identified cell from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

5. **Preservation of other objects:** the L-shape objects with color 8 should be preserved.

**Summary of the rule**

The transformation rule identifies azure L-shaped (3 cells) objects within the grid. For each of those objects, it locates a cell on its top-right corner and colors it in blue. Other cells are kept unchanged.
