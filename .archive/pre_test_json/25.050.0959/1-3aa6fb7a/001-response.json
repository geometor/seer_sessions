The target cell to change is the cell next to the top right corner of the L-shape.\n\n3.  **Action - Single Cell Replacement:** Select the cell to the top-right of each L-shape with value 0.\n\n4.  **Coloring:** Change the color of the identified cell from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).\n\n5. **Preservation of other objects:** the L-shape objects with color 8 should be preserved.\n\n**Summary of the rule**\n\nThe transformation rule identifies azure L-shaped (3 cells) objects within the grid. For each of those objects, it locates a cell on its top-right corner and colors it in blue. Other cells are kept unchanged.\n"
