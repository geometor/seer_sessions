Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (2x2 block with one cell removed)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
     - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[0,4],[0,5],[1,5]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions:  [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions:  [[5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions:  [[0,4],[0,5],[1,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[2,3], [5,3],[1,4]]
  grid_size: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Change:**
    *   The first L-shape is defined by corners at (2,2).
    *   The second object has corner at (6,4)
    *  The third object has corner at (0,4)

3.  **Action - Single Cell Replacement:** Locate the top-right adjacent cell to each identified L-shape (relative to the corner of the "L").

4.  **Coloring:** Change the color of the selected cell from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

5. **Preservation:** Keep the other cells with the same color.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example. It identifies all azure L-shaped (3-cell) objects. For each L-shape, the cell to its top-right corner, if the cell is 0, it is changed to blue (1). Other cells remain the same. The code already developed correctly implements this rule.
