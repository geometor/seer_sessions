All other cells are 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Move Objects:** The program proceeds as follow:\n\n    \\- All the colored objects are moved to the last rows, preserving the column order. In detail:\n    - The object of color 6 moves from (3, 0) to (4, 0).\n    - The object of color 3 in position (1,1) moves to (2,1). The other two objects of color 3 moves to (3,1) and (4,1).\n    - The object of color 1 in position (0, 3) moves to (3,3). The other object of color 1 moves to (4,3).\n    - The object of color 2 moves from (2,4) to (4,4).\n\n3.  **Final Output**: The cells that are not occupied by the moved objects become, or remain, 0.\n\nIn summary, all the colored objects are moved to the last rows preserving the column order. The first object of a certain colors is moved to the row with index equal to the total number of istances of that color.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Identify all the colored objects.\n2. Move the objects to the last rows, preserving the columns and putting the i-th object of color c to the row with index equal to the total number of objects of color c.\n3. All other cells in the grid, not occupied by the moved objects, are set to 0.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, then set everything to 0.\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to count and track colored cells.\n    color_counts = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the input grid to find single-cell objects (non-zero cells).\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = input_grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0:\n                # Update color count\n                if color not in color_counts:\n                    color_counts[color] = [0,0] #count, row_index\n                color_counts[color][0] += 1\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid to find single-cell objects (non-zero cells).\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = input_grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0:\n                # Move the object to the correct row.\n                output_grid[color_counts[color][0]-1-color_counts[color][1], c] = color\n                color_counts[color][1] += 1\n                \n    return output_grid\n```\n"
