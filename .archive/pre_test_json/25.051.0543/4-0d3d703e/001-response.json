The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 3 (green), the second of cells with color 1 (blue), and the third of cells with color 2 (red).\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid.  The specific mapping observed is:\n    *   Input color 3 (green) becomes output color 4 (yellow).\n    *   Input color 1 (blue) becomes output color 5 (gray).\n    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).\n\n3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** Add one (+1) to the index position in the row. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +3 to each cell index.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation involves a consistent color mapping and index positioning (+3) where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure.\n"
