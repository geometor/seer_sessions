            "text": "Okay, I've analyzed the three examples and noticed a consistent pattern. In all cases, there's a direct color mapping, and the structure (vertical lines) is preserved. It seems like the transformation rule is primarily a color substitution cipher, where each color in the input grid is mapped to a different, consistent color in the output grid. There's no complex geometric manipulation or conditional logic beyond this one-to-one color mapping. I will implement a general solution based on this.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is a color substitution cipher.
