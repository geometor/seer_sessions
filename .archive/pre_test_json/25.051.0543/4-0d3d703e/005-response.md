Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 8
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 6
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 9
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 2
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 5 (gray), the second of cells with color 8 (azure), and the third of cells with color 6 (magenta).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The specific mapping observed is:

    *   Input color 5 (gray) becomes output color 1 (blue).
    *   Input color 8 (azure) becomes output color 9 (maroon).
    *   Input color 6 (magenta) becomes output color 2 (red).

3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.

4.  **Transformation Rule:**
   * Subtract four (-4) to the first vertical line.
   * Add one (+1) to the second vertical line.
   * Subtract four (-4) from the third vertical line.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**

The transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The transformation rule subtracts -4 to the first object's index, adds +1 to the second, and subtracts -4 from the third.

```python
"""
The transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The mapping is as follows: 5 (gray) -> 1 (blue), 8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon), and 6 (magenta) -> 2 (red). The grid dimensions and object shapes/positions are preserved.
