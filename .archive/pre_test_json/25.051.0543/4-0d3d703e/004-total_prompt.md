Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 1
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 2
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 4
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 5
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 6
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line is composed of cells with color 3 (green), the second of cells with color 1 (blue), and the third of cells with color 2 (red).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid.  The specific mapping observed is:
    *   Input color 3 (green) becomes output color 4 (yellow).
    *   Input color 1 (blue) becomes output color 5 (gray).
    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).

3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and the relative positions of the colored lines are preserved during the transformation. The output grid has the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** Add one (+1) to the index position in the row. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +3 to each cell index.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**

The transformation involves a consistent color mapping and index positioning (+3) where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure.

```python
"""
The transformation involves a consistent color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a specific corresponding color in the output, maintaining the geometric structure. The mapping is as follows: 3 (green) -> 4 (yellow), 1 (blue) -> 5 (gray), and 2 (red) -> 6 (magenta). The grid dimensions and object shapes/positions are preserved.

    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

    }

    # Iterate through the input grid and apply the color transformation.

        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]
            # Use the color map to determine the output color, default to 0 if not found
            output_color = color_map.get(input_color, input_color + 3)  # Use the input color + 3 for mapping, else default to input color

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Block for Initial Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 3
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 8
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    objects:
      - color: 6
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 4
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
      - color: 9
        shape: vertical_line
        count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of cells. The first vertical line has cells of color 2 (red), the second of color 3 (green), and the third of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each unique color in the input grid is transformed to a new, unique color in the output grid. The observed mapping is:

    *   Input color 2 (red) becomes output color 6 (magenta).
    *   Input color 3 (green) becomes output color 4 (yellow).
    *   Input color 8 (azure) becomes output color 9 (maroon).

3.  **Shape and Position Preservation:** The shape (vertical lines) and relative positions of the lines are maintained.  The output grid, like the input grid, is 3x3.

4.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Add four (+4) to the first vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +4 to the cell index.
    - Add one (+1) to the second vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.
    - Add one (+1) to the third vertical line. The output grid takes the color index in the input grid and transforms it by adding +1 to the cell index.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule:**

The transformation is a color mapping where each color in the input is replaced by a corresponding color in the output, preserving the geometric structure. The transformation rule adds +4 to the index of the first object, +1 to the second, and +1 to the third.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
