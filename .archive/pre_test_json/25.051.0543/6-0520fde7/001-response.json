The transformation will replace the gray color with a new color, 2 (red).\n\n4.  **Define the output size:** The new color 2 (red) appears in the new output grid that has a size of 3x3.\n\n5. **Output:** Output a 3x3 grid of the same height of the input, all zeros except the center cell which has color 2 (red).\n\n**Transformation Summary**\n\nThe transformation takes specific object from the input, detects its size, and replaces it by a new object color. The output grid is all zeros (background color) except for a single red (color 2) cell in the center.\n"
