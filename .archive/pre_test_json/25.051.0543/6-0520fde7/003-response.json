The transformation will replace the gray color with a new color, 2 (red).\n\n4.  **Define the output size:** The new color 2 (red) appears in the new output grid that has a size of 3x3.\n\n5. **Output:** Output a 3x3 grid. It contains 3 cells with value 2. These form a vertical line at x = 1, and there is one cell in the center of x=2.\n\n**Transformation Summary**\n\nThe transformation takes a specific object from the input, detects its size, and replaces it by a new object color. The output grid is all zeros (background color) except for the cells with color 2 which form two lines as described above.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation takes specific object from the input, detects its size, and replaces it by a new object color. The output grid is all zeros (background color) except for a single red (color 2) cell in the center.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a 3x3 numpy array filled with zeros.\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Place the color 2 (red) in the output grid.\n    output_grid[0, 1] = 2\n    output_grid[1, 2] = 2\n    output_grid[2, 1] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
