This includes a red cell at (2, 2), a blue cell at (7, 3) and a magenta cell at (5,6).\n\n2.  **Yellow Surround:** For the red object, place yellow (4) cells above, below, and two cells placed horizontally to form a mirrored L-shape around the red cell on the left. The pattern looks like two vertical lines, placed one row above and other below the identified object.\n\n3.  **Orange Surround:** For the blue cell, create an L-shape using orange object (color 7) to surround it on the left, using 3 orange cells at the left of the blue object and one cell at the bottom-right, at a distance of one cell.\n\n4. **Preserve all single cells:** The original single cells remain in their original positions in the output grid. The magenta cell is kept.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Find every object of size 1 in the input.\n2.  For each of those objects:\n    -   if the object is red:\n        -   Place a yellow cell above it.\n        -   Place a yellow cell below it.\n        - Place a yellow cell at its left.\n        - Place a yellow cell diagonally up and to the left\n    -   if the object is blue:\n        -   Place 3 orange cells to form a vertical line at its left.\n        -   Place one orange cell at the bottom-right of the blue cell, with distance 1.\n3.  Maintain original objects of size 1.\n\nThis transformation rule is consistent with the previous examples, confirming that single objects are sorrounded based on the rules for the red and blue color. Additionally all the single objects are kept, including the magenta cell.\nThe python implementation does not require changes.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.

For each of those objects:\n   - if the object is red:\n     - Place a yellow cell above it.\n     - Place a yellow cell below it.\n     - Place a yellow cell at its left.\n     - Place a yellow cell diagonally up and to the left.\n   - if the object is blue:\n     - Place 3 orange cells to form a vertical line at its left.\n     - Place one orange cell at the bottom-right of the blue cell, with distance 1.\n3.
