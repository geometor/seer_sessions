One L-shape is at the top left, and the second L-shape is at the bottom right. The rest of the grid comprises 0 (white) single cells.\n\n2.  **Detect the Filling:** We can observe in the output grid that a color 1 (blue) cell has been placed in between the two cells that form the \"legs\" of the L-shape object of color 8. The position of this new color is at the direct center point between two cells of the objects.\n\n3.  **Describe the Transformation:** For each \"L-shape\" object, find the empty cell adjacent to the interior angle formed by the object, which means finding the only adjacent cell between the two cells forming the arms of the L-shape. Fill that cell by color 1(blue).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is to locate the empty cell at the inner center of each azure (color 8) L-shaped object and fill those positions with a single blue (color 1) cell. All other cells remain unchanged.\n"
