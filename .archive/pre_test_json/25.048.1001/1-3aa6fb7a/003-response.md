Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Three L-shapes
      positions:
        - Top-right: (0,4)
        - Center-left: (2,2)
        - Bottom-right: (5,3)
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Three L-shapes
      positions:
        - Top-right: (0,4)
        - Center-left: (2,2)
        - Bottom-right: (5,3)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:
        - (1,4) inner center to the L-shape object at (0,4)
        - (2,3) inner center to the L-shape object at (2,2)
        - (5,3) inner center to the L-shape object at (5,3)
  dimensions: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct "L-shaped" objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect the Filling:** The output grid shows that a color 1 (blue) cell is added at the inner center of each L-shape, similar to the first example.

3.  **Describe the Transformation:** For every "L-shape" object made of color 8, find the inner adjacent cell. Fill that cell with color 1(blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule, consistent with the first example, is to locate the inner center cell of each azure (color 8) L-shaped object and fill that position with a single blue (color 1) cell. The positions and shapes of the color 8 objects remain unchanged.
