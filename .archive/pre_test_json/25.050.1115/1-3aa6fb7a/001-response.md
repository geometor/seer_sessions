Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). Both are composed by 3 cells and shaped like 'L'.

2.  **Change specific cells:**
    *   Locate the azure object in the top-left part of the grid. If there is a white cell (0) to the right of the top cell of the object, change this cell to blue (1).
    *   Locate the azure object in the bottom-right part of the grid. If there is a white cell (0) to the left of the bottom cell of the object, change this cell to blue (1).

3.  **Preserve:** The rest of the grid, remains the same.

**Informal predicates and actions**

*   **Predicates:**
    *   `is_azure(cell)`: Checks if a cell is colored azure (8).
    *   `is_white(cell)`: Checks if a cell is colored white (0).
    *   `top_left_object(grid)`: Checks if object is in top-left position.
    *   `bottom_right_object(grid)`: Checks if object is in bottom-right position.
    *   `to_the_right_of(cell1, cell2)`: Checks if `cell2` is directly to the right of `cell1`.
    *   `to_the_left_of(cell1, cell2)`: Checks if `cell2` is directly to the left of `cell1`.

*   **Actions:**
    *   `change_color(cell, new_color)`: Changes the color of a cell.
    *   `find_object(grid, color)`: Returns a list of cells composing an object of a specific color.
