Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: [(0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6)]
    gray_objects:
      - shape: single cell
        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: Remaining cells
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      - shape: single cell
        position: (1,1)
    white_objects:
      - shape: irregular
         positions: Remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Determine the center of the input grid, it will be the central gray pixel, which is at the coordinates (1, 3).

2.  **Construct output grid:** Create an output grid with size 3x3 filled with white pixels.

3.  **Count blue objects:** Iterate through the second row and count the number of blue objects.

4.  **Place the red object:** Using the blue objects count on step 3, insert this number on the central pixel of the output grid.

In summary, the transformation extracts the central pixel of the original shape to create a new 3x3 grid. It changes this extracted pixel color to red and fills the other pixels of the output grid with color white. It replaces the central red pixel with the number of blue objects in the second row.

2.  **Construct output grid:** Create an output grid with size 3x3 filled with white pixels.

3.  **Count blue objects:** Iterate through each row and count the number of blue objects.

4.  **Place the red object:** Using the blue objects count on step 3, insert this number on the corresponding central pixel of the output grid by row.

In summary, the transformation extracts the central pixel of the original shape to create a new 3x3 grid. For each row, it counts the blue pixels. If the blue count is greater than 0, it replaces the central white pixel in the output grid with a red one (color code 2). The other pixels in the output remain white (color code 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
