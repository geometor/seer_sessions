The transformation extracts the central pixel of the original shape to create a new 3x3 grid. For each row,
it counts the blue pixels. If the blue count is greater than 0, then change pixel (row, 3 - row) to red.
If blue count is equal to 0 do nothing. The other pixels in the output remain white (color code 0).
