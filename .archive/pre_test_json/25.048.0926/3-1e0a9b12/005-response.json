            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.\n\n**Observations in YAML Format**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 5x5\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 19\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (0,3), (2,3)\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      count: 3\n      positions: (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      count: 1\n      position: (2,4)\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      count: 1\n      position: (3,0)\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 5x5\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 19\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      count: 1\n      positions: (4,0)\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (4,1), (3,1)\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (4,3), (3, 3)\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      count: 1\n      position: (4,4)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program Description**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify non-white cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid that do *not* have the color white (0).\n\n2.  **Move to Bottom Row, Preserve Order**: Move a copy of all the non-white cells to the last row of the grid. The order of non-white cells is maintained in the output following a column-major order.\n\n3. **Remove**: If there are any cells with duplicate colors, keep all occurrences in the output, maintaining the last row order.\n\n**Inferred Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows: The colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original column-major order, but keeping all color duplicates. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original column-major order and keeping color duplicates. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:\n    Colored cells are moved to the last row, maintaining their column-major order,\n    keeping duplicates, and the rest of the grid is filled with white (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1. Identify non-white cells and their original order.\n    non_white_cells = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], r, c)) # Store color, row, and col\n\n    # 2. Sort non-white cells by column and then row to preserve the column-major order in the bottom row.\n    non_white_cells_sorted = sorted(non_white_cells, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[1]))\n\n    # 3. Place the sorted non-white cells in the last row of the output grid, keeping duplicates.\n    last_row_index = 0\n    # used_colors = set() # No duplicate removal\n    for cell in non_white_cells_sorted:\n        # if cell[0] not in used_colors: # No duplicate removal\n            output_grid[rows - 1, last_row_index] = cell[0]\n            # used_colors.add(cell[0])\n            last_row_index += 1\n            \n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n"
