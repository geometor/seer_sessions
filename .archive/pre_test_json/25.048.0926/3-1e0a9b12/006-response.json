            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n**Observations in YAML Format**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 4x4\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 10\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (0,1), (2,1)\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      count: 1\n      position: (0,3)\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      count: 1\n      position: (2,2)\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      count: 1\n      position: (3,0)\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 4x4\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 11\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      count: 1\n      positions: (3,1)\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      count: 1\n      position: (3, 0)\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      count: 1\n      position: (3, 2)\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      count: 1\n      position: (3, 3)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program Description**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify non-white cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid that do *not* have the color white (0).\n\n2.  **Move to Bottom Row:** Move all the non-white cells to the last row of the grid.\n\n3.  **Preserve Order:** Maintain the relative order of the non-white cells as they appear in the input grid, reading from left to right and top to bottom (row-major order). Arrange them from left to right on the bottom row.\n\n4. **Fill Remaining:** Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).\n\n**Inferred Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:\n    Colored cells are moved to the last row, maintaining their order,\n    and the rest of the grid is filled with white (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1. Identify non-white cells and their original order.\n    non_white_cells = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                non_white_cells.append((input_grid[r, c], r, c)) # Store color and original position\n\n    # 2. Sort non-white cells to maintain their original order (row-major)\n    non_white_cells_sorted = sorted(non_white_cells, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))\n\n    # 3. Place the sorted non-white cells in the last row of the output grid.\n    last_row_index = 0\n    for cell in non_white_cells_sorted:\n        output_grid[rows - 1, last_row_index] = cell[0]\n        last_row_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n"
