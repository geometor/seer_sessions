Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      positions: Most of the grid
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: (0,1), (2,1)
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: (0,3)
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: (2,2)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: (3,0)

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 11
      positions: Most of the grid
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 1
      positions: (3,1)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: (3, 0)
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: (3, 2)
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: (3, 3)
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify non-white cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid that do *not* have the color white (0).

2.  **Move to Bottom Row, Preserve Order**: Move a copy of all the non-white cells to the last row of the grid. The order of non-white cells in the input is maintained in the output: The colored cells are arranged in the last row, sorted from left to right, following the column major order in the input.

3. **Remove**: Remove cells that have the same value of an adjacent cell (left, right, up, down).

**Inferred Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
The colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order, and removing equal adjacent colored cells. The remaining cells are set to white (0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
