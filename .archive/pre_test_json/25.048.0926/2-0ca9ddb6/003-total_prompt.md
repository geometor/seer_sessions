Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: fills the grid

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    yellow_object:
        color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
        shape: cross pattern around red object
    orange_object:
      color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [ (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: cross pattern surrounding blue object
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: fills the grid
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input grid.

2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For the red cell, create a cross-shaped pattern of yellow (color 4) cells. The cross is centered one cell above the original position. This cross consists of one cell directly to its west and another cell to its east. It consists of one cell two positions to its north and one cell two positions to its south. The position of the red cell does not change.

3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For the blue cell, create a cross-shaped pattern of orange (color 7) cells, centered on the original blue cell. The arms of this cross each extend one cell, one cell directly to its north, another cell to its south and one cell directly to its west, and another to its east.

4. **Preserve:** The original red and blue objects remain in their initial positions.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule involves drawing a yellow cross above the red cell and an orange cross around the blue cell. The original cells remain, other positions remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
