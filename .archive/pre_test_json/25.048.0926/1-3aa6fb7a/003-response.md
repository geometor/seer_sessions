Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4),(6,4), (6,5)]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4),(6,4), (6,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3),(5,3)]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** These objects will be modified.

3.  **Detect corner change:** The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)` loses its up-right corner which turns blue. The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)` loses its up-right corner which turns blue. The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(5,4),(6,4), (6,5)` loses its down-left corner which turns blue.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

Locate any azure (8) L-shaped object, find its up-right and down-left corner, and change the color to blue(1).

This is the same rule as the previous case.
