The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)` loses its up-right corner which turns blue. The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(5,4),(6,4), (6,5)` loses its down-left corner which turns blue.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be described as follows:\n\nLocate any azure (8) L-shaped object, find its up-right and down-left corner, and change the color to blue(1).\n\nThis is the same rule as the previous case.\n"
