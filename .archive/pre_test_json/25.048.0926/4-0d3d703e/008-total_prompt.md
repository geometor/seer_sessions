Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping, incrementing each color value by a fixed amount:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct horizontal lines of colors: green (3), blue (1), and red (2).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color by increment it by a constant value as follows:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4) - increment by 1.
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5) - increment by 4
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6) - increment by 4.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**
The increment is not uniform. The transformation is adding 1 to green, and 4 to the other colors.

```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is, again, a color mapping. The process is similar to the one observed in the first set of grids:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct horizontal lines of colors: red (2), green (3), and azure (8).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color, incrementing it by the following logic:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6): increment by 4.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4): increment by 1.
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9): increment by 1.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**

The increment logic applies different values to different colors.
The transformation is adding 4 to red and 1 to the other colors, similarly to the first task.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation continues to be a color mapping, with specific increments applied to each color.

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct horizontal lines of colors: gray (5), azure (8), and magenta (6).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Each color in the input is transformed as follows:
    *   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1): decrement by 4, or increment by -4.
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9): increment by 1.
    *   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2): decrement by 4, or increment by -4.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**

The pattern identified consists on applying two different values: 1 or -4.
- Gray and Magenta are decremented by 4.
- Azure is incremented by 1.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation is, consistently, a color mapping.

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three horizontal color lines: maroon (9), yellow (4), and red (2).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:**
    *   Maroon (9) becomes Azure (8): decrement by 1.
    *   Yellow (4) becomes Green (3): decrement by 1.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6): increment by 4.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**

Following the previously identified logic, where colors are modified by +1, +4 or -4, we can confirm the following.
- Maroon should be transformed by -1, and Yellow by -1 as well: They don't belong in the other groups, where numbers are transformed by adding or substracting 4.
- Red belongs to the group of colors transformed by +4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
