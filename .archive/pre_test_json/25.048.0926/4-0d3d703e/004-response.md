The transformation rule is a color mapping where each color in the input grid is
incremented by a specific value:
- Red (2) becomes Magenta (6) - increment by 4.
- Green (3) becomes Yellow (4) - increment by 1.
- Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9) - increment by 1.
The positions, sizes, and shapes of the colored regions remain the same.
