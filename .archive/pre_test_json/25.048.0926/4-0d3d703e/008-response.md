```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping based on consistent patterns observed across multiple examples:

- Colors are grouped and consistently transformed by either adding/subtracting 1 or adding/subtracting 4.
- Group 1 (+4, -4):
    - 2 (Red) and 1 (Blue) are transformed by adding 4.
    - 6 (Magenta) and 5 (Gray) are transformed by subtracting 4 (implemented as +6 mod 10).
- Group 2 (+1, -1):
    - 3 (Green), 8 (Azure), 9 (Maroon), and 4 (Yellow) are transformed by either adding or subtracting 1
      depending on what other colors of this group are present at the inputs and outputs of the task examples

The positions, sizes, and shapes of the colored regions remain the same.
