Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [11, 11]
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular
      position: centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
      bounding_box: [[2, 2], [7, 8]]
  background:
    color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [11, 11]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, L-shaped
      position: Top-left part of the original gray object.
      bounding_box: [[2,2], [7,4]]
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular, mirrored L.
      position: Bottom-right part, replacing parts of the original grey.
      bounding_box: [[3,3], [7,7]]

  background:
    color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the single connected object composed of gray (color 5) cells in the input grid.

2.  **Divide and Conquer:**
    The object is replaced by two colors: azure (8) and red (2).

    - The azure (8) color fills the "top-left" segment and it is defined like this: if the object cell is above or on the main diagonal that goes from the element (0,0) of the bounding box, to the element (n,n) of the bounding box, but without counting the last row, it takes azure (8).
    - The red (2) replaces the "bottom-right" segment that is defined like this: if the object cell is below the main diagonal that goes from the element (0,0) of the bounding box, to the element (n,n) of the bounding box, and it's not in the top row, it takes color red (2).

3.  **Background Preservation:** The cells that are not part of the gray object (color 0) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
