Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal rectangles
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal rectangles
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two 1x1 squares

  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 1x2 rectangle, and the other is a horizontal 2x1 rectangle.

2.  **Locate the Topmost Azure Pixel of Each Object:**
    *   For the first object, a 1x2 rectangle, the topmost azure pixel is located at row 1, column 1.
    *   For the second object, a 2x1 rectangle, the topmost azure pixel is located at row 3, column 4.

3. **Paint with blue:**
  * Find the pixel to the right of the topmost azure pixel of the first object. Add a blue (color 1) pixel there (row 1, column 2).
  * Find the pixel to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the second object. Add a blue (color 1) pixel there (row 4, column 4).

4.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation identifies two azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. It then adds a blue (color 1) pixel adjacent to the topmost azure pixel of each object: to the right of the first object's topmost pixel, and to the top of the second object's topmost pixel. All other azure pixels from the input remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate objects: a 2x1 horizontal rectangle, a 1x2 vertical rectangle and another 2x1 horizontal rectangle.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate objects: a 2x1 horizontal rectangle, a 1x2 vertical rectangle and another 2x1 horizontal rectangle.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: three 1x1 squares

  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's the step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. These are: a 2x1 horizontal rectangle at the top, a 1x2 vertical rectangle in the middle-left, and a 2x1 horizontal rectangle at the bottom.

2.  **Locate the Topmost Azure Pixel of Each Object:**
    *   For the first object (top horizontal rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (0, 4).
    *   For the second object (middle vertical rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (2, 2).
    *  For the third object (bottom horizontal rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (5,4)

3.  **Paint with blue:**
  *   Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the right and one row down of the top most azure pixel of the first object. Specifically, place it at (1,4).
  *  Add a blue pixel one pixel to the left of the topmost pixel of the second object, namely at (2,3).
  *   Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the left of the top most azure pixel in the third object, resulting in the position (5, 3).

4.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels remain unchanged.

**Summary and Comparison with Previous Example**
The underlying principle is very similar to the previous example. Azure objects are identified, and for each, we pinpoint the topmost azure-colored pixel. The difference appears in *where* the blue pixel is placed relative to that topmost azure pixel. It is still dependent of the relative position within all the objects of that color.

The python code is correct and does not need to be modified.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
