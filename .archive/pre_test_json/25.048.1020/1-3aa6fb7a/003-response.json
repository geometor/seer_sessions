These are: a 2x1 horizontal rectangle at the top, a 1x2 vertical rectangle in the middle-left, and a 2x1 horizontal rectangle at the bottom.\n\n2.  **Locate the Topmost Azure Pixel of Each Object:**\n    *   For the first object (top horizontal rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (0, 4).\n    *   For the second object (middle vertical rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (2, 2).\n    *  For the third object (bottom horizontal rectangle), the topmost azure pixel is at (5,4)\n\n3.  **Paint with blue:**\n  *   Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the right and one row down of the top most azure pixel of the first object. Specifically, place it at (1,4).\n  *  Add a blue pixel one pixel to the left of the topmost pixel of the second object, namely at (2,3).\n  *   Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the left of the top most azure pixel in the third object, resulting in the position (5, 3).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Summary and Comparison with Previous Example**\nThe underlying principle is very similar to the previous example. Azure objects are identified, and for each, we pinpoint the topmost azure-colored pixel. The difference appears in *where* the blue pixel is placed relative to that topmost azure pixel. It is still dependent of the relative position within all the objects of that color.\n\nThe python code is correct and does not need to be modified.\n"
