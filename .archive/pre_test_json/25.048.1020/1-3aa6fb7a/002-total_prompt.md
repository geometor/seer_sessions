Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal rectangles
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal rectangles
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two 1x1 squares

  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 1x2 rectangle, and the other is a horizontal 2x1 rectangle.

2.  **Locate the Topmost Azure Pixel of Each Object:**
    *   For the first object, a 1x2 rectangle, the topmost azure pixel is located at row 1, column 1.
    *   For the second object, a 2x1 rectangle, the topmost azure pixel is located at row 3, column 4.

3. **Paint with blue:**
  * Find the pixel to the right of the topmost azure pixel of the first object. Add a blue (color 1) pixel there (row 1, column 2).
  * Find the pixel to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the second object. Add a blue (color 1) pixel there (row 4, column 4).

4.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
