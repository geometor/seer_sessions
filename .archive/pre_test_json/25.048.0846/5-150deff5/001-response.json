This object is irregular in shape.\n\n2.  **Separate Object by color:** The gray object is divided into azure (8) and red (2) based on a certain rule:\n    *   Azure color (8): it is placed on the positions of gray where the left neighbor of that position is also gray and the position is not on the most left side of the shape.\n    *   Red color(2): it is placed on the other positions.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe gray object is transformed in a manner that separates cells that have a left neighbor also gray. The separated cells are assigned with different colors (azure and red).\n\n"
