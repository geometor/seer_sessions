```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: Irregular shapes.
        position: Centered horizontally.
        size: Variable
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Positions within the original gray object where the left neighbor is also gray.
        position: Same as input.
        size: Variable
      - color: 2
        shape: Remaining positions within the original gray object.
        position: Same as input
        size: Variable
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (5) object within the input grid.
2.  **Separate and Recolor:** Divide the gray object into two new objects, colored azure (8) and red (2), based on the following rule:
    *   **Azure (8):** A cell within the gray object is colored azure if it has a left neighbor that is also part of the gray object.
    *   **Red (2):** All other cells within the gray object (those without a gray left neighbor) are colored red.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation recolors a gray object based on the presence of a left neighbor within the object.  If a gray cell has another gray cell to its immediate left, it becomes azure; otherwise, it becomes red.
