Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each with a distinct color (3, 1, and 2) that are arranged one next to each other.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding cell's color in the output grid.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note there must be a circular or modulo operation for this transformation to work with any given number.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape and position of the objects remain the same; only the colors change. The spatial arrangement and size of colored regions are consistent between the input and output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
