Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each with a distinct color (3, 1, and 2) that are arranged one next to each other.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding cell's color in the output grid.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note there must be a circular or modulo operation for this transformation to work with any given number.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape and position of the objects remain the same; only the colors change. The spatial arrangement and size of colored regions are consistent between the input and output.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this new example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule is a color substitution. However, this time, the increment is not uniform across all colors:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of distinct colors (2, 3, and 8).

2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6). This is an increment of 4.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4). This is an increment of 1.
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9). This is an increment of 1.

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape, position, and size of the objects remain consistent between the input and output grids.

**Revised Description**

Based on the previous example and this one, the transformation involves adding a fixed number to each initial color modulo 10. But, it seems that this added number is not always one: it depends on the initial color:

- The program adds 4 to color 2.
- The program adds 1 to colors 1, 3 and 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
