"""
The transformation rule is a color substitution where each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by a specific value that depends on the original color. The structure and position of the colored regions remain unchanged.

- If the color is 2, it's incremented by 4.
- If the color is 1, 3, or 8, it's incremented by 1.
- All additions are modulo 10.
