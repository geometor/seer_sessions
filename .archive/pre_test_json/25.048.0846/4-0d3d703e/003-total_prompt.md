Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each with a distinct color (3, 1, and 2) that are arranged one next to each other.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding cell's color in the output grid.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note there must be a circular or modulo operation for this transformation to work with any given number.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape and position of the objects remain the same; only the colors change. The spatial arrangement and size of colored regions are consistent between the input and output.

The transformation rule is a color substitution where each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by 1 (modulo 10) to produce the corresponding cell's color in the output grid. The structure and position of the colored regions remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
