Another object of color azure (color 8) is present, and the rest is background.\n\n2.  **Preserve Original objects:** The red, blue and azure cells from the input grid maintain their original position and color in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Frame the red objects:** A yellow (color 4) frame of single cells is added surrounding each red cell. The yellow frame occupies the cells directly above, below, and to the sides (i.e. it takes a cross shape, centered in the original red cell, with arms of length 1).\n\n4.  **Frame the blue objects:** An orange (color 7) frame of single cells is added, surrounding each blue cell, in the same way as the frame around the red cells.\n\n5. **Fill the rest:** All other cells on the board remain of the background color.\n\n**Summary of the transformation rule:**\n\nThe transformation preserves the position and color of the initial red and blue cells and frames those cells with a cross of the same size. The cross surrounding the red cells is color 4, while the cross surrounding the blue cell is color 7. The azure object (color 8) is also preserved.\n"
