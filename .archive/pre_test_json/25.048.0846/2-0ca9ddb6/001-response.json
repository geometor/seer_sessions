The rest is the background.\n\n2.  **Preserve Original objects:** The red and blue cells from the input grid maintain their original position and color in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Frame the red object:** A yellow (color 4) frame of single cells is added surrounding the red cell. The yellow frame occupies the cells directly above, below, and to the sides (i.e. it takes a cross shape, centered in the original red cell, with arms of length 1).\n\n4.  **Frame the blue object:** An orange (color 7) frame of single cells is added, surrounding the blue cell, in the same way as the frame around the red cell.\n\n5. **Fill the rest:** All other cells on the board remain of the background color.\n\n**Summary of the transformation rule:**\n\nThe transformation preserves the position and color of the initial red and blue cells and frames those cells with a cross of the same size. The cross surrounding the red cell is color 4, while the cross surrounding the blue cell is color 7.\n"
