The search of a neighbor starts from the right and follows a clockwise fashion.\n\n3.  **Change**: Once found, change one white pixel (color 0) neighbor from step 2 to blue (color 1).\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The azure objects remain unchanged. All other cells in the grid also remain the same.\n\nIn summary, it's the same transformation rule as in the first example. The transformation identifies each azure object, and adds a single blue pixel in the clockwise direction relative to the object.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation identifies the azure objects, and adds a single blue pixel in the clockwise direction.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds objects of a specific color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of positions for each object, sorted by top-leftmost coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                # Sort the object's positions by row and then by column\n                current_object.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef clockwise_neighbor(grid, pos):\n   \"\"\"Finds the next clockwise neighbor of a cell, starting from the right.\"\"\"\n   row, col = pos\n   rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n   # Define order: right, down, left, up\n   directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]\n\n   for dr, dc in directions:\n      new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc\n      # Return if position is valid\n      if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:\n         return (new_row, new_col)\n\n   return None # Should not be reached\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    1. Identify azure (color 8) objects.\n    2. Find the closest white (color 0) in clockwise direction.\n    3. Change the white pixel to blue (color 1).\n    4. Preserve the azure objects and other cells.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n\n      changed = False\n\n      for pos in obj:\n        if changed:\n          break\n        neighbor = clockwise_neighbor(input_grid, pos)\n        # If neighbor exists and has color 0, then change its color to 1\n        if neighbor is not None:\n           row, col = neighbor\n           if input_grid[row, col] == 0:\n              output_grid[row, col] = 1\n              changed = True\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Improvements in the Code:**\n\n1.  **Object Finding and Sorting:** The `find_objects` function now not only finds the contiguous regions of color 8 but also sorts the positions within each object. It sorts by the row first and then by the column. This makes sure that the iteration considers the object's pixels in the correct order for the rule.\n\n2.  **Clockwise Search Logic:** The logic within the transform functions remains consistent. It checks for a neighbor in this order: right, down, left, and up.\n\n3. **Object Iteration:**\n    The main change is that the iteration iterates over the coordinates in the object.\n"
