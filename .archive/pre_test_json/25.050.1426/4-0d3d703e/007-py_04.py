"""
The transformation rule is a direct color substitution. Each color in the input grid is replaced with a new color according to a fixed mapping. Specifically:

- Color 9 (maroon) is transformed to color 8 (azure).
- Color 4 (yellow) is transformed to color 3 (green).
- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).

The positions and arrangement of the colors are preserved; only the color values themselves are changed. The dimensions of the grid remain the same.
