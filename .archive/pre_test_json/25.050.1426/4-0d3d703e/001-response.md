**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a direct color substitution.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a new color according to a fixed mapping. Specifically:

- Color 3 (green) is transformed to color 4 (yellow).
- Color 1 (blue) is transformed to color 5 (gray).
- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).

The positions and arrangement of the colors are preserved; only the color values themselves are changed. The dimensions of the grid remain the same.
