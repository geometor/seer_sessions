The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Iterate through each cell:** Examine every cell in the input grid, row by row, column by column.\n\n2. **Check for gray color:** For each cell, check if its color is gray (color code 5).\n\n3. **Apply column-based recoloring:**\n    - If the cell's color is gray (5) and its **column index is 4 or greater** (considering 0-based indexing), change the cell's color to **azure** (color code 8).\n    - If the cell's color is gray (5) and its **column index is less than 4**, change the cell's color to **red** (color code 2).\n\n4. **Maintain other colors:** If the cell's color is not gray (5), leave it unchanged.\n\nIn essence, gray cells in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 are transformed to red, and gray cells in columns 4 and onwards are transformed to azure.  Non-gray cells remain unchanged.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation applied to the input grid is based on the column index of each cell.\n\n1. **Iterate through each cell:** Examine every cell in the input grid.\n2. **Check for gray color:** For each cell, check if its color is gray (color code 5).\n3. **Apply column-based recoloring:**\n    - If gray and column index is 4 or greater, change to azure (color code 8).\n    - If gray and column index is less than 4, change to red (color code 2).\n4. **Maintain other colors:** If not gray, leave unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid based on column index and gray color.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 5: # If the cell is gray\n                if j >= 4:\n                    output_grid[i, j] = 8 # Azure if column index is 4 or greater\n                else:\n                    output_grid[i, j] = 2 # Red if column index is less than 4\n    return output_grid\n```"
