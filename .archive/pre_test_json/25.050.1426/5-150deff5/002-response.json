This region constitutes the object to be transformed.\n\n2. **Determine boundary and interior cells:** For each cell within the identified gray object, determine if it is a boundary cell or an interior cell.\n    - A cell is considered a **boundary cell** if at least one of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) is not part of the gray object (i.e., is color 0 or white).\n    - A cell is considered an **interior cell** if all of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are within the grid boundaries are also part of the gray object.\n\n3. **Recolor boundary cells:** Change the color of all boundary cells of the gray object from gray (color 5) to azure (color 8).\n\n4. **Recolor interior cells:** Change the color of all interior cells of the gray object from gray (color 5) to red (color 2).\n\n5. **Maintain background:** All cells in the grid that are not part of the original gray object (i.e., cells with color 0 or white) remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation outlines the gray shape with azure and fills its interior with red, while leaving the surrounding white background untouched.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _is_boundary(grid, i, j, gray_object):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to check if a cell is on the boundary of the gray object.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:\n        if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and (x, y) not in gray_object:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid by recoloring a gray object's boundary to azure and its interior to red.\"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Identify the gray object (contiguous region of color 5)\n    gray_object = set()\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                gray_object.add((i, j))\n\n    # Determine boundary and interior cells, and recolor them\n    for i, j in gray_object:\n        if _is_boundary(input_grid, i, j, gray_object):\n            output_grid[i, j] = 8  # Azure for boundary cells\n        else:\n            output_grid[i, j] = 2  # Red for interior cells\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
