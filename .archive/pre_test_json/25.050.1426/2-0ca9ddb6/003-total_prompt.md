**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1. **Initialization:** Create a new output grid that is initially identical to the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Input Grid:** Examine each cell in the input grid, row by row, and column by column.
3. **Identify Red Pixels:** If a cell in the input grid contains the color red (color code 2):
    - Consider its horizontal and diagonal neighbors: top-left, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
    - For each neighbor position, check if the corresponding cell in the *input* grid is white (color code 0).
    - If a neighbor cell in the input grid is white, change the color of the same neighbor cell in the *output* grid to yellow (color code 4).
4. **Identify Blue Pixels:** If a cell in the input grid contains the color blue (color code 1):
    - Consider all eight neighbors: top, bottom, left, right, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
    - For each neighbor position, check if the corresponding cell in the *input* grid is white (color code 0).
    - If a neighbor cell in the input grid is white, change the color of the same neighbor cell in the *output* grid to orange (color code 7).
5. **Maintain Original Pixels:** The original red and blue pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. All other pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels (or whose neighbors in input were not white) also remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.
6. **Output:** The resulting output grid after processing all red and blue pixels in the input grid is the final transformed grid.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
