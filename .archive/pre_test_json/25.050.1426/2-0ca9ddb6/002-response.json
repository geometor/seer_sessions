All other pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels (or whose neighbors in input were not white) also remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n6. **Output:** The resulting output grid after processing all red and blue pixels in the input grid is the final transformed grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules for red and blue pixels.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the given row and column are within the grid boundaries.\"\"\"\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def get_neighbors(r, c, diagonal=False):\n        \"\"\"Returns the neighbors of a cell.
