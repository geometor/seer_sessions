The transformation operates column by column. For each column in the input grid, identify all the non-zero color values.  Then, in the output grid, populate the same column from bottom to top with these identified non-zero color values in the same order they appeared in the input column. Fill the remaining cells in the top rows of the output column with the color white (0). This effectively pushes all colored blocks in each column to the bottom.
