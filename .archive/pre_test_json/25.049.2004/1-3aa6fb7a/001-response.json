Here's my breakdown:\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]\n      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)\n      size: 3 cells each\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n      size: 43\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]\n      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)\n      size: 3 cells each\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]\n      shape: two single cells.\n      size: 1\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n      size: 41\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) are present in the input grid. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Cells within Objects:**\n    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in its object.\n    *    Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the left of the others in its object.\n\n3.  **Change Cell Colors:**\n    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the right of the others.\n    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the left of the others.\n\n4. **Leave other cells unchanged.**\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule is the following.\n1. Identify the rightmost cell of color 8 in the left object, and change it to color 1 (blue).\n2. Identify the leftmost cell of color 8 in the rigth object, and change it to color 1 (blue).\nAll other cells remain the same.\n"
