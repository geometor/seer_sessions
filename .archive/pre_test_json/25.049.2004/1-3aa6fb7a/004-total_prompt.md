Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)
      size: 3 cells each
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 43
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)
      size: 3 cells each
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: two single cells.
      size: 1
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 41
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) are present in the input grid. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Locate Specific Cells within Objects:**
    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in its object.
    *    Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the left of the others in its object.

3.  **Change Cell Colors:**
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the right of the others.
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the left of the others.

4. **Leave other cells unchanged.**

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation rule is the following.
1. Identify the rightmost cell of color 8 in the left object, and change it to color 1 (blue).
2. Identify the leftmost cell of color 8 in the rigth object, and change it to color 1 (blue).
All other cells remain the same.

Okay, let's analyze this new input-output pair.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
      shape: Three separate objects. Two L-shapes and one single cell.
      size: 3, 3 and 1
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 42
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
      shape: Three separate objects. Two L-shapes and one single cell.
      size: 3,3 and 1
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1, 4], [2, 3], [5,3]]
      shape: three single cells.
      size: 1
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 39
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Three distinct objects of color 8 (azure) are present in the input grid: two L-shapes and a single cell. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Locate Specific Cells within Objects:**
    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in the top-left object.
    *    Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the left of the others in the middle object.
    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in the bottom-left object.

3.  **Change Cell Colors:**
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the right of the others in the first object.
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the left of the others in the second object.
    *   Turn to blue the single azure cell that represents the other object.

4. **Leave other cells unchanged.**
**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1.  Identify the three distinct objects of azure color.
2. For the top-left object, turn to blue the rightmost cell.
2. For the middle object, turn to blue the leftmost cell.
2. For the bottom-left object, turn to blue the rightmost cell.
4. All other cells remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
