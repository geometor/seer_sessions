Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)
      size: 3 cells each
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 43
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one inverted)
      size: 3 cells each
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: two single cells.
      size: 1
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
      size: 41
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) are present in the input grid. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Locate Specific Cells within Objects:**
    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in its object.
    *    Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the left of the others in its object.

3.  **Change Cell Colors:**
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the right of the others.
    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the left of the others.

4. **Leave other cells unchanged.**

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation rule is the following.
1. Identify the rightmost cell of color 8 in the left object, and change it to color 1 (blue).
2. Identify the leftmost cell of color 8 in the rigth object, and change it to color 1 (blue).
All other cells remain the same.

```python

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
