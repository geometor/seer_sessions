Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangles and two single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangles and two single cells.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two types of objects: azure (8) colored objects and the white (0) background. The azure objects appear as two 2x1 vertical rectangles and two individual cells.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare each cell of the output grid to the input grid.

3. **Observe Transformations**:
    * The azure (8) objects from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
    * Inspect the cells to the immediate right of each azure object. If an azure object is found, and the adjacent cell on the right is background color (white/0), then this cell turns to color blue (1).

4.  **Apply the Rule:**
  - The cell at (1, 2) is to the right of the cell(1,1), and is color 0, therefore, it turns to 1 (blue).
  - The cell at (4, 4) is to the right of the cell(4,5) and is color 0, therefore, it turns to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

The azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged. For each azure object, examine the cell directly to its right. If the cell is background color (white/0), change it to blue (1). Otherwise, leave it unchanged.

```python
"""

"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the current cell is azure (8)
            if input_grid[r, c] == 8:
                # Check if there's a cell to the right
                if c + 1 < cols:
                    # Check if the cell to the right is white (0)
                    if input_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                        # Change the cell to the right to blue (1)
                        output_grid[r, c + 1] = 1

    return output_grid
```

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Two 2x1 rectangles, one 1x2 rectangle, and two single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Two 2x1 rectangles, one 1x2 rectangle and two single cells
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: Three single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains azure (8) colored objects and a white (0) background.  The azure objects have various shapes as described above.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare the output grid to the input grid. The azure objects remain in the same positions. New blue (1) objects appear.

3. **Observe Transformations**:
    *   Azure (8) objects are unchanged.
    *   Cells to the right of azure objects that were originally white/0 are now blue(1).

4.  **Apply the Rule:**
    *   The cell at (1, 4) is to the immediate right of (1,5), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).
    *   The cell at (2, 3) is to the immediate right of (2,2), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).
    *   The cell at (5, 3) is to the immediate right of (5,4), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

The azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged. For each azure object, examine the cell directly to its right. If that cell is the background color (white/0), change it to blue (1).  Otherwise, leave it unchanged. This is the same rule as the first example. The provided Python code correctly implements this rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
