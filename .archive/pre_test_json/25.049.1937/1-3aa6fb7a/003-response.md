Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 7]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
      shape: "Three separate azure (8) colored objects: two lines and one square."
    - color: 0
      positions: "All other cells not colored 8"
      shape: "Background"

output_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 7]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
      shape: "Three separate azure (8) colored objects: two lines and one square, same as the input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [[1, 4], [2,3], [5,3]]
      shape: "Three single cells colored blue in different positions."
    - color: 0
      positions: "All other cells not colored with 8 or 1."
      shape: "Background"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three distinct azure (color 8) objects.

    *   Object 1: A 1x2 horizontal line at the top.
    *   Object 2: A 2x2 square in the center-left.
    *   Object 3: A bent shape on the bottom-right.

2.  **Detect corner cell in the objects:**
    *   Object 1 has cell [0,4] as part of a horizontal line.
    *   Object 2 has cell [2,2] as part of a vertical line.
    *   Object 3 has cell [5,4] as part of a vertical line.

3.  **Change cell color:** The azure cell at the top-left "corner" of each object changes its color to blue (1). The selection criteria is:
    *   Select left-most for horizontal line
    *   Select upper-most for vertical line

4.  **Preserve:** All other cells maintain their original colors.

The core rule is the same as the first case. It is necessary to identify objects colored in azure (8). In each object find the corner cell: leftmost if is part of a horizontal line and uppermost if is part of a vertical line. Change to blue the cells identified in this way.
