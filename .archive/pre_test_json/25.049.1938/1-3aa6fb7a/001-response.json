In this case, we have two L-shaped structures.\n\n2.  **Action- Change single cell color:** For each azure object, the corner cell that forms the corner furthest away from all other shapes is recolored to blue (1).\n\nThis natural language program describes the \"story\" of the transformation: identifying particular azure shapes and recoloring the furthest away corner of each.\n"
