The background is white (0).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing the input and output grids, the azure (8) objects remain unchanged.  Three blue (1) pixels appear.\n\n3.  **Describe Transformation:**\n    *   Find cells with color `0` that are located to the right of corner of L-shapes of color `8`.\n    *    Change those `0` color cells to `1` (blue).\n\n**Summary**:  The transformation is identical to the previous example. It identifies the corner pixel of each 3-pixel L-shaped object (color 8).  It then places a blue pixel (color 1) immediately to the right of the corner pixel, if that space exists within the grid and is color `0`. The L-shapes can point in any direction.\n\nThe provided Python code from the first example correctly implements this logic, including identification of L-shapes, finding the \"corner\", and placing the blue pixel. No changes are needed.\n"
