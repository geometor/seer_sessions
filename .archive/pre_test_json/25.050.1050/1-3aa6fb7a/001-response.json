One is an \"L\" shape in the top-left corner and the other is a reverse \"L\" shape in the bottom right corner. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare each cell between input and output:\n    *   All cells that contain the color `8` are unchanged.\n    *   All cells that have the color `0` are unchanged, except the cells at coordinates `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`.\n\n3. **Describe Transformation**:\n    *   Find the cells on color `0` immediately to the right of an `8` colored cell that forms the corner of the L-shape. Replace `0` with a `1` (blue).\n\n**Summary**: The transformation preserves the azure (8) colored L-shaped objects. For each L shape, it adds a blue (1) colored pixel to the direct right of the corner of the \"L\".\n"
