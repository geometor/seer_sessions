The first one has its top-left corner at row 1, column 1.\nThe second \"L\" shape top is at row 4, column 5.\n2.  **Transformation:** Following the rule, we locate the position at the right of the top of the shape. For the first \"L\" shape, this cell has a row 1 and column 2. This position had the value 0 and it is painted in blue (value 1). For the second \"L\" shape, the new position is (4,5).\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and two blue cells to the right of the top of the \"L\".\n\n"
