Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to identify azure (color 8) L-shaped objects (made of three cells) and, based on their position on the input grid, paint with color blue (value 1) the cell to the right of the upper part of each "L" object.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects that are composed of three cells forming an "L" shape.
2.  **Find Target:** For each identified L-shaped object, locate the cell immediately to the right of the top-most cell that constructs the shape "L".
3. **Change color:** Change the color value of this target cell to blue (1).
4. **Keep initial object** Keep the identified L-shaped objects.

**Step-by-step explanation applied to the example:**
1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
The input grid contains two azure "L" shapes. The first one has its top-left corner at row 1, column 1.
The second "L" shape top is at row 4, column 5.
2.  **Transformation:** Following the rule, we locate the position at the right of the top of the shape. For the first "L" shape, this cell has a row 1 and column 2. This position had the value 0 and it is painted in blue (value 1). For the second "L" shape, the new position is (4,5).
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and two blue cells to the right of the top of the "L".

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example. It identifies azure (color 8) L-shaped objects (made of three cells) and paints a blue cell (value 1) relative to each L-shape's orientation. The key is to precisely define "relative to" based on the L-shape orientation, covering all four cases in the `find_l_shapes` function:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects that are composed of three cells, forming an "L" shape.

2.  **Determine Orientation and Target:**  For each identified L-shape, determine its orientation (top_left, top_right, bottom_left, or bottom_right). The target cell to be colored blue (1) is:
    *   **top\_left or top\_right:** The cell to the *right* of the top-most part of the L-shape.
    *    **bottom\_left:** The cell to the *right* of the *upper part* of the L-shape
    *   **bottom\_right:** The cell that completes the square at the *top of the object*

3.  **Change color:** Change the color value of the target cell to blue (1).

4.  **Keep initial object:** The identified L-shaped objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Step-by-step explanation applied to the new example:**
1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
The input grid contains three azure "L" shapes, with diverse orientations.

2. **First L shape**
 - It is located at (0,4).
 - Its orientation is top_right.
 - The cell at the right of the upper element is (0,5). This position is painted in blue.

3.  **Second L shape**
 - It is located at (2,2).
 - Its orientation is bottom_left.
 - The cell at the right of the upper part of the shape is (2,3). This position is painted in blue.

4.  **Third L shape**
 - It is located at (5,3).
 - Its orientation is bottom_right.
 - The cell where a square can be formed is (5,3).

5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and a blue cell (value 1) next to each one, based on the rules explained.

The Python code provided previously already implements this logic correctly by using the function find\_l\_shapes to analyze the shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
