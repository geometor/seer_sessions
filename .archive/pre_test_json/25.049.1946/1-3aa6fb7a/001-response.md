Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to identify azure (color 8) L-shaped objects (made of three cells) and, based on their position on the input grid, paint with color blue (value 1) the cell to the right of the upper part of each "L" object.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects that are composed of three cells forming an "L" shape.
2.  **Find Target:** For each identified L-shaped object, locate the cell immediately to the right of the top-most cell that constructs the shape "L".
3. **Change color:** Change the color value of this target cell to blue (1).
4. **Keep initial object** Keep the identified L-shaped objects.

**Step-by-step explanation applied to the example:**
1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
The input grid contains two azure "L" shapes. The first one has its top-left corner at row 1, column 1.
The second "L" shape top is at row 4, column 5.
2.  **Transformation:** Following the rule, we locate the position at the right of the top of the shape. For the first "L" shape, this cell has a row 1 and column 2. This position had the value 0 and it is painted in blue (value 1). For the second "L" shape, the new position is (4,5).
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and two blue cells to the right of the top of the "L".
