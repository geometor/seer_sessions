Specifically, it's the \"inner\" corner where the two legs of the L meet at a right angle.\n\n3.  **Change Color:** The identified corner pixel of each L-shape is changed to blue (color 1).\n\n4.  **No change:** If a pixel is not the corner of the identified L-shape objects, its color is unchanged.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is: Find the inner corner pixel of each L-shaped azure (color 8) object and change its color to blue (color 1).\n\nThe previous python code I wrote looked for the upper left corner. The correct implementation should look for all corners.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_l_shapes(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds L-shaped objects of a specific color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of corner coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n\n        neighbors = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            dfs(nr, nc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                if len(current_object) >= 3: #L shapes have at least 3 pixels\n                    # Find the corner\n                    rows, cols = zip(*current_object)\n                    # Count occurrences of each row and col\n                    row_counts = {}\n                    col_counts = {}\n\n                    for row in rows:\n                        row_counts[row] = row_counts.get(row, 0) + 1\n                    for col in cols:\n                        col_counts[col] = col_counts.get(col, 0) + 1\n\n                    # Corner will have a row and col that occur more than once\n                    corner = None\n                    for r, c in current_object:\n                       if row_counts[r] >1 and col_counts[c] > 1:\n                          corner = (r,c)\n                          break\n                    if corner is not None:\n                        objects.append(corner)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by finding L-shaped objects of color 8,\n    and changing their corner pixel color to 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    l_shapes = find_l_shapes(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Change the color of the identified corners\n    for r, c in l_shapes:\n        output_grid[r, c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
