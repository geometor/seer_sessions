One object at the top left, is composed by cells (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2). The other one, at the bottom right, is composed by cells (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5).\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** The azure objects remain unchanged between the input and output. In the output we can observe two new blue pixels (color code 1).\n\n3.  **Describe New Objects:**\n *    The first new pixel in the output is at the position (1,2) of the original top-left shape.\n *    The second new pixel in the output is at the position (4,4) the original bottom-right shape.\n\n4. **Transformation rule**: For each azure object, compute the centroid and change the value of this cell to `1` (blue).\n\n**Step-by-step transformation**\n1. Find each isolated azure object.\n2. For each of them: Paint with blue the cell corresponding to their centroid.\n"
