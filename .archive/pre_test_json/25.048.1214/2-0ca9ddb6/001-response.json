We consider each of these a distinct object.\n\n2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For the red object, create a 2x2 block of yellow, cross-like, by placing it around the location of the red object. The yellow fills cells at positions that are vertically and horizontally adjacent to where the red object was found.\n\n3. **Blue Object Transformation**: For the blue object, we draw an orange cross with arms that are 3 cells each.\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The original red and blue pixels are preserved in their initial positions.\n    The final grid uses the background with all other cells which are not a part of the defined regions.\n\n**Inferred Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying single-pixel red and blue objects, and drawing a yellow square around the red object and an orange cross around the blue one. The rest of the grid remains unchanged (filled with the background color 0).\n"
