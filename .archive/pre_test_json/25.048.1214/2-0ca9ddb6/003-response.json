There may be multiple instances of each.\n\n2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For each red object, draw a 2x2 yellow, cross-like shape. The yellow fills are vertically and horizontally adjacent.\n\n3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For each blue object, draw a orange cross whose arms extend vertically and horizontally one adjacent cell.\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The original red and blue pixels remain unchanged.\n    The final grid uses the background with all other cells which are not a part of the defined regions, as well as, the azure object.\n\n**Inferred Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule extends the previous one. It applies to *all* instances of single-pixel red and blue objects. A yellow cross is drawn around each red pixel, and an orange cross is drawn around each blue pixel. The azure pixel, like the white background, remains unchanged.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule identifies all single-pixel red and blue objects.  For each red object, a 2x2 yellow cross is created, centered around each original red pixel's location.  For each blue object, an orange cross is created, with arms extending 1 cell from the original blue pixels' locations. The red and blue pixels are preserved, and other pixels, including a single azure one and the background, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_all_objects(grid, color):\n    # Find the coordinates of *all* single-pixel objects of the specified color.\n    coords = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(coords[0], coords[1]))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all red objects (color 2).\n    red_positions = find_all_objects(input_grid, 2)\n    for red_pos in red_positions:\n        # Draw a yellow cross centered on each red object.\n        row, col = red_pos\n        for i in range(-1,2):\n            output_grid[row+i, col] = 4 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row+i,col]\n            output_grid[row, col+i] = 4 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row,col+i]\n\n    # Find all blue objects (color 1).\n    blue_positions = find_all_objects(input_grid, 1)\n    for blue_pos in blue_positions:\n        # Draw an orange cross centered on each blue object\n        row, col = blue_pos\n        for i in range(-1, 2):\n            output_grid[row + i, col] = 7 if abs(i)==1 else output_grid[row + i, col]\n            output_grid[row, col + i] = 7 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row, col+i]\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
