Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 1x1
      position: (3,2)
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 1x1
      position: (6,6)
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: 9x9

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 1x1
      position: (3,2)
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 1x1
      position: (6,6)
    yellow_object:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: 2x2, cross-like
      position: centered around red object, (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3).
    orange_object:
       color: 7 (orange)
       shape: 1x3, cross-like.
       position: centered around blue object.
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: 9x9
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the single red (color 2) pixel and the single blue (color 1) pixel within the input grid. We consider each of these a distinct object.

2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For the red object, create a 2x2 block of yellow, cross-like, by placing it around the location of the red object. The yellow fills cells at positions that are vertically and horizontally adjacent to where the red object was found.

3. **Blue Object Transformation**: For the blue object, we draw an orange cross with arms that are 3 cells each.

4.  **Preserve:** The original red and blue pixels are preserved in their initial positions.
    The final grid uses the background with all other cells which are not a part of the defined regions.

**Inferred Rule Summary**

The transformation rule involves identifying single-pixel red and blue objects, and drawing a yellow square around the red object and an orange cross around the blue one. The rest of the grid remains unchanged (filled with the background color 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
