Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this fourth example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column and having a distinct color (maroon, yellow, and red).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color as follows:
    *   Maroon (9) becomes Azure (8).
    *   Yellow (4) becomes Green (3).
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The spatial structure of the objects (vertical lines) is maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 9, 4, 2 are replaced with 8, 3, 6 respectively.
