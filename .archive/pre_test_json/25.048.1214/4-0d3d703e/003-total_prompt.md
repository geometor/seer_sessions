Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, and red), and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to the color with value + 1:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note: according to the color map in the prompt, 2 is red and 5 is grey.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (vertical lines) are maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 1, 2, 3 are replaced with 4, 5, 6 respectively.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color mapping:
- Green (3) in the input becomes Yellow (4) in the output.
- Blue (1) in the input becomes Gray (5) in the output.
- Red (2) in the input becomes Magenta (6) in the output.
The structure (vertical lines) is preserved.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by mapping colors according to the rule:
    3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.  Preserves spatial structure.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply the color transformation.
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5
    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 6

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
