Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, and red), and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to the color with value + 1:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note: according to the color map in the prompt, 2 is red and 5 is grey.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (vertical lines) are maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 1, 2, 3 are replaced with 4, 5, 6 respectively.

The transformation rule is a simple color mapping:
- Green (3) in the input becomes Yellow (4) in the output.
- Blue (1) in the input becomes Gray (5) in the output.
- Red (2) in the input becomes Magenta (6) in the output.
The structure (vertical lines) is preserved.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column and having a distinct color (red, green, and azure).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color as follows:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The spatial structure of the objects (vertical lines) is maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 2, 3, 8 are replaced with 6, 4, 9 respectively.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
