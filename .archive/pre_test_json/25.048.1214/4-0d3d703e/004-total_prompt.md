Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, and red), and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to the color with value + 1:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note: according to the color map in the prompt, 2 is red and 5 is grey.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (vertical lines) are maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 1, 2, 3 are replaced with 4, 5, 6 respectively.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color mapping:
- Green (3) in the input becomes Yellow (4) in the output.
- Blue (1) in the input becomes Gray (5) in the output.
- Red (2) in the input becomes Magenta (6) in the output.
The structure (vertical lines) is preserved.

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by mapping colors according to the rule:
    3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.  Preserves spatial structure.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply the color transformation.
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5
    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 6

    return output_grid
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column and having a distinct color (red, green, and azure).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color as follows:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The spatial structure of the objects (vertical lines) is maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 2, 3, 8 are replaced with 6, 4, 9 respectively.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
