Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
     - color: 1 (blue)
       shape: single cell
       positions: [(1,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(4,4)]
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Object Persistence:** the two azure L-shaped objects exist in the output grid.

3.  **Detect Change:** The cells to the immediate right of the top-left corner element of each original L-shape are changed from color 0 (background) to color 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**

The transformation preserves the azure L-shaped objects. The transformation paints blue the cells at the right of the top-left element of each azure L-shape.
