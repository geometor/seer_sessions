task_context: "The task is to modify a grid by adding colored cells around existing non-zero colored cells based on their original color. Specifically, red cells get yellow diagonals, and blue cells get orange orthogonals."

      color: 2
      action: surround with yellow diagonals
  - blue_cell:

predicates:

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The process transforms the input grid by examining each cell.
If a cell contains the color red (2), then in the output grid, yellow cells (4) are placed at the four diagonal positions relative to this red cell.
If a cell contains the color blue (1), then in the output grid, orange cells (7) are placed at the four orthogonal (up, down, left, right) positions relative to this blue cell.
If a cell is of any other color, it remains unchanged in the output grid, unless it becomes modified by the placement of new colors around red or blue cells.
The modifications for red and blue cells are independent and can potentially overlap. If they do overlap, the color placed last will overwrite the previous one. In this example, no overlaps occur.
The process is applied to each cell in the input grid that is either red or blue.

**Natural Language Program:**

The process transforms the input grid by iterating through each cell.
If a cell in the input grid is red (color 2), then in the output grid, yellow cells (color 4) are placed at the four diagonal positions relative to this red cell.
If a cell in the input grid is blue (color 1), then in the output grid, orange cells (color 7) are placed at the four orthogonal positions (up, down, left, right) relative to this blue cell.
If a cell in the input grid is of any other color, it remains unchanged in the output grid, unless it is modified by the placement of new colors around red or blue cells.
The transformations for red and blue cells are independent and can overwrite each other if their affected areas overlap. In this specific example, overlaps are possible and do occur as seen in the top right area, and the bottom left area.
This process is applied to every cell in the input grid that is either red or blue.

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process analyzes each cell in the input grid.
If a cell's color is red (2), then in the output grid, yellow cells (4) are added to the four diagonal positions adjacent to this red cell.
If a cell's color is blue (1), then in the output grid, orange cells (7) are added to the four orthogonal positions (up, down, left, right) adjacent to this blue cell.
Cells with any other color in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid, unless they are modified by the addition of yellow or orange cells as described.
These modifications are independent, meaning if a location is targeted by both a red cell's diagonal modification and a blue cell's orthogonal modification, the last modification applied will take precedence. In this particular example, there is no overlap of modifications from different colored cells.
This process is applied for every cell in the input grid that is either red or blue.
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
