**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell.
2. **Apply a color substitution rule:**
   - If the color value is 2 (red), replace it with 6 (magenta).
   - If the color value is 3 (green), replace it with 4 (yellow).
   - If the color value is 8 (azure), replace it with 9 (maroon).
3. **Place the new color value** in the same cell position in the output grid.
4. **Repeat** steps 1-3 for every cell in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

This transformation is a direct color replacement. Each color present in the input grid is consistently mapped to a new color in the output grid, regardless of its position or context within the grid.
