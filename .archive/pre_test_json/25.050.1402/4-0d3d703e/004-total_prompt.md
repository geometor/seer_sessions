**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, apply the following color transformations:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell in the input grid.
2. **Apply the transformation rule:**
   - If the color value is 3 (green), change it to 4 (yellow).
   - If the color value is 1 (blue), change it to 5 (gray).
   - If the color value is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta).
3. **Place the transformed color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4. **Repeat steps 1-3** for all cells in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

In essence, this task involves a direct color-to-color substitution based on a fixed mapping rule applied uniformly across the entire grid. Each instance of a specific color in the input is consistently replaced with another specific color in the output.
```python
"""
This program transforms the input grid to the output grid by applying the following color mapping:
- Color 3 (green) in the input grid is changed to color 4 (yellow) in the output grid.
- Color 1 (blue) in the input grid is changed to color 5 (gray) in the output grid.
- Color 2 (red) in the input grid is changed to color 6 (magenta) in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell.
2. **Apply a color substitution rule:**
   - If the color value is 2 (red), replace it with 6 (magenta).
   - If the color value is 3 (green), replace it with 4 (yellow).
   - If the color value is 8 (azure), replace it with 9 (maroon).
3. **Place the new color value** in the same cell position in the output grid.
4. **Repeat** steps 1-3 for every cell in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

This transformation is a direct color replacement. Each color present in the input grid is consistently mapped to a new color in the output grid, regardless of its position or context within the grid.
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
