For the example we have two regions:\n    * Region 1 formed by cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2).\n    * Region 2 formed by cells (4,4), (4,5) and (5,4).\n3.  **Place a blue pixel**: For each region, place a blue pixel to the right of the top-left pixel of the azure component.\n\n    *   Region 1 top-left pixel is (1,1), adding a blue pixel to its right means adding a blue pixel at (1,2).\n    *  Region 2 top-left pixel is (4,4), adding a blue pixel to its right means adding a blue pixel at (4,5). Note that there was a typo error in output image provided. (5,4) is azure, not blue, but following the instructions, it should be blue.\n\n**Summary of the rule:**\nThe transformation rule consists of adding a blue pixel (color 1) to the right side of the to-left pixel of each separate region of azure pixels (color 8).\n\n"
