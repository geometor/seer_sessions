            "text": "**Natural Language Description of the Transformation:**\n\nThe transformation rule operates on each row of the input grid independently. For each row, it identifies contiguous blocks of cells with color 8 (azure). If a block of color 8 has a length of exactly one cell, then the rule checks the row index of this block.\n\n- If the row index is in the top half of the grid (row indices 0, 1, 2, or 3), and if the cell immediately to the right of this single-cell block of color 8 is within the grid boundaries and has color 0 (white), then change the color of that cell to 1 (blue).\n- If the row index is in the bottom half of the grid (row indices 4, 5, or 6), and if the cell immediately to the left of this single-cell block of color 8 is within the grid boundaries and has color 0 (white), then change the color of that cell to 1 (blue).\n\nIf a block of color 8 in any row has a length greater than one cell, no changes are made in the vicinity of that block in that row. If there are no blocks of color 8 of length one in a row, no changes are made in that row.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"grid transformation\"\ntransformation_rule: \"conditional color change based on block of 8s length and row position\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"block of color 8\"\n    properties:\n      - \"length\"\n      - \"position (row, column)\"\npredicates:\n  - \"is_length_one(block)\"\n  - \"is_row_in_top_half(row_index)\"\n  - \"is_row_in_bottom_half(row_index)\"\n  - \"is_cell_to_right_color_0(block)\"\n  - \"is_cell_to_left_color_0(block)\"\nactions:\n  - \"change_cell_to_color_1(cell)\"\nstep_by_step_transformation:\n  - \"for each row in the grid:\"\n  - \"  identify contiguous blocks of color 8\"\n  - \"  for each block:\"\n  - \"    determine block length\"\n  - \"    if block length is 1:\"\n  - \"      get row index of the block\"\n  - \"      if row index < 4:\"\n  - \"        check cell to the right; if color 0, change to 1\"\n  - \"      else if row index >= 4:\"\n  - \"        check cell to the left; if color 0, change to 1\"\n```"
