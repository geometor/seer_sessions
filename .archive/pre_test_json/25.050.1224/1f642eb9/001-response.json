We have four single-color cells (9, 6, and 4, one each) and the rectangle made with color 8.\n\n2.  **Move 9**: The cell with color 9 combines with the 8 object. Specifically, color 9 moves to the top of the closest 8 object. This creates an object with 9 on top and 8 at the bottom.\n\n3.  **Move 6:** The cell with color 6 moves to the bottom left side of the closest color 8, but at the level of the bottom row of the 8 rectangle.\n\n4. **Move 8:** We use the top left corner of the 8 to find a cell to separate from the rectangle, at (3,5).\n\n5.  **Move 4:** The cell with color 4 moves near the object made of color 8, maintaining the column, but getting as close as possible to the object.\n\n**Summary**\nEach single color cell targets the 8 object. Each one takes a different position. Number 9 takes the upper one, number 4 takes the center one and number 6 takes the left-bottom one. The 8 object loses one cell.\n"
