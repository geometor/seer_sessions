Okay, let's analyze this third transformation, building upon what we've learned from the previous two.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 4
      shape: single cell
      position: (0, 3)
    - color: 8
      shape: 3x4 rectangle
      position: (3, 3)
    - color: 6
      shape: single cell
      position: (3, 9)
    - color: 3
      shape: single cell
      position: (4, 0)
    - color: 2
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (6, 0), (7,9)
    - color: 7
      shape: single cell
      position: (9, 3)

output_grid:
  size: 10x10
 objects:
    - color: 4
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (0, 3), (3,3)
    - color: 8
      shape: 3x3 rectangle
      position: (3,3)
    - color: 6
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (3, 9), (3,5)
    - color: 3
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (4, 0), (4,3)
    - color: 2
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (6, 0), (7,5)
    - color: 7
      shape: single cell, single cell
      position: (9, 3), (7,3)
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** We have several single-color cells (4, 6, 3, 2, and 7) and one larger rectangular object of color 8. Notice how similar the setup is from previous prompt.

2.  **Move 8:**
    - The cell at the position (3,5) on the object with color 8 is removed.

3.  **Move Single Cells to the 8 object**:
    - The object made with color 3 is now on the left side of the 8 object, in its same row.
    - The object made with color 6 is now on the right side of the 8 object, in its same row.
    - The object made with color 4 is now at the top of the 8 object.
    - The object made with color 7 is now on the left side of the 8 object, in its same row.

4. **Move 8**:
    - The cell at position (3,5) is now next to the 2 cell, on its right side.
   

5.  **Summary**: The 8 object loses one cell. The single cells target the 8 object. Numbers 3 and 6 combine on the sides, while numbers 4 and 7 occupy the upper and lower sides, respectively. Color 2 get the extra cell of 8.

This description captures the essence of the transformation using the concepts of objects, predicates (positions, shapes), and actions (moves, additions).
