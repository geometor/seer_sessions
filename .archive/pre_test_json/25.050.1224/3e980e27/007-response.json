A new object is created by mirroring the blue object using the position of a green object as the axis of symmetry.\nThe yellow shapes are copied and some are mirrored. A copy of the yellow shape is mirrored relative to the red object on the bottom right.\nThe other yellow shapes are copied and translated.\nThe red single-cell objects and the green single cell are preserved without changes.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe blue shape is duplicated and mirrored, based on the first green point.
