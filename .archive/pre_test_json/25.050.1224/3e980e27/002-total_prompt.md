Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 13x13
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(3,3), (8,7)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,5)]
      shape: L-shape and single cell

output_grid:
  size: 13x13
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(3,3), (8,7)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (10,5)]
      shape: original L and single cell and a mirrored and translated copy

```

**Natural Language Program: Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct types of objects:
    *   Red (color 2) single-cell objects.
    *   Blue (color 1) objects, which appear as a small "L" shape and a single cell.

2.  **Preservation of Red Objects:** The red single-cell objects at positions (3, 3) and (8, 7) remain unchanged in their position and color in the output grid.

3. **Copy, move and mirror of blue objects**: All blue object are copied, mirrored and moved to the bottom right,

4.  **Transformation of Blue Objects:** The blue objects undergo a transformation.
  * The existing blue objects from the input are kept at their original place.
  * The blue objects are moved to the bottom right. The amount is calculated by the position of the red point in the bottom right corner of the grid.
  * The blue object that triggered the translation (the one on the bottom right of the input grid) is mirrored along the axis that passes for the red point.

**Complete Description**
The blue shape is copied, mirrored, and translated in the grid based on the bottom-right red object. The red objects are not impacted.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
