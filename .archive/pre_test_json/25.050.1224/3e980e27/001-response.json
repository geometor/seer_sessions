The amount is calculated by the position of the red point in the bottom right corner of the grid.\n  * The blue object that triggered the translation (the one on the bottom right of the input grid) is mirrored along the axis that passes for the red point.\n\n**Complete Description**\nThe blue shape is copied, mirrored, and translated in the grid based on the bottom-right red object. The red objects are not impacted.\n\n"
