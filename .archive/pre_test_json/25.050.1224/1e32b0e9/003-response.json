First, red (color 2) fills the area adjacent to blue (color 1), the inverse logic to the previous problem. Second, blue instances are removed if adjacent to the red instances, meaning that they get replaced by red. The overall effect appears to be a kind of \"expansion\" of red surrounding the blue color.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation rule:\n1. Preserve all instances of color 2 (red).\n2. For each instance of 1 (blue) that contains an adjacent cell of color 0,\n   change the adjacent color 0 to color 2.\n3. For each instance of 1 (blue) that contains and adjacent cell of color 2,\n    change the instance of 1 to 2.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Returns the valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    if row > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row - 1, col))  # Up\n    if row < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row + 1, col))  # Down\n    if col > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row, col - 1))  # Left\n    if col < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row, col + 1))  # Right\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through the grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[row,col] == 1:\n                for neighbor_row, neighbor_col in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col):\n                    if input_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] == 0:\n                         output_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] = 2\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[row,col] == 1:\n                for neighbor_row, neighbor_col in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col):\n                    if output_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] == 2:\n                         output_grid[row,col] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
