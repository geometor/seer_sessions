Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shape and single blocks
      positions: Several, forming a cross-like pattern
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Vertical and horizontal lines, and a large horizontal block
      positions: Forming a grid-like pattern, with a solid block at rows 6 and 12.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shape and single blocks
      positions: Similar to the input, but with slight shifts
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Modified vertical and horizontal lines. Most of the lines exist, plus some additional instances.
      positions: Filling cells adjacent to color 2.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 2 (red) and color 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Base:** Maintain all existing elements in the output.

3.  **The Azure Filling Rule:**
    *   For each cell containing color 8 in the input, maintain that cell.
    *   For each cell containing a 2 in the input, add an 8 in any adjacent cell (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) that contain a zero.

**Explanation of the Transformation**

The core transformation is to take the azure (8) and to fill the adjacent empty cells around all instances of the red (2). The overall effect appears to be a kind of "filling" or "expansion" of the azure color (8) surrounding the red color (2). The original azure lines are preserved. The red instances are preserved.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  Preserve all instances of color 2 (red) and 8 (azure).
2.  For each cell containing color 2, change any adjacent (up, down, left, right) 
    cells with color 0 (white) to color 8 (azure).

Okay, let's analyze this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Vertical lines and a large horizontal block
      positions: Forming a cross-like pattern.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Small groups of blocks
      positions: Scattered around the grid, near some of the red lines.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Appears to fill cells adjacent to color 1 instances
      positions: Expanded from the input, surrounding instances of color 1.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Small groups
      positions: Some have disappeared.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      positions: Filling the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 2 (red) and color 1 (blue) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve and Fill The Red:**
    *   For each cell with color 2 in the input, maintain it in the output.
    *    For each cell containing a 1 in the input, add a 2 in any adjacent cell (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) that contain a zero.

3.  **Remove Blue:**
    *   For each instance of 1 in the input, if it has an adjacent instance of 2, change it to a 2 in the output.

**Explanation of the Transformation**

The core transformation involves two primary actions. First, red (color 2) fills the area adjacent to blue (color 1), the inverse logic to the previous problem. Second, blue instances are removed if adjacent to the red instances, meaning that they get replaced by red. The overall effect appears to be a kind of "expansion" of red surrounding the blue color.

**Python Code**

```python
"""
Transformation rule:
1. Preserve all instances of color 2 (red).
2. For each instance of 1 (blue) that contains an adjacent cell of color 0,
   change the adjacent color 0 to color 2.
3. For each instance of 1 (blue) that contains and adjacent cell of color 2,
    change the instance of 1 to 2.
