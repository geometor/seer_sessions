Most of the lines exist, plus some additional instances.\n      positions: Filling cells adjacent to color 2.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: Background\n      positions: Filling the remaining cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 2 (red) and color 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Preserve Base:** Maintain all existing elements in the output.\n\n3.  **The Azure Filling Rule:**\n    *   For each cell containing color 8 in the input, maintain that cell.\n    *   For each cell containing a 2 in the input, add an 8 in any adjacent cell (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) that contain a zero.\n\n**Explanation of the Transformation**\n\nThe core transformation is to take the azure (8) and to fill the adjacent empty cells around all instances of the red (2). The overall effect appears to be a kind of \"filling\" or \"expansion\" of the azure color (8) surrounding the red color (2). The original azure lines are preserved. The red instances are preserved.\n"
