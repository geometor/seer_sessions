In this case, we have blue (1) and green (3). Preserve and expand the blue adjacent to all instances of green. Then remove any green that has an instance of blue that is horizontally or vertically adjacent.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation rule:\n1. Preserve all instances of color 1 (blue).\n2. If any cell that is of color 3 has adjacent zeros, change those zeros to 1.\n3. If any cell of color 3 has an adjacent cell of color 1, change the 3 to a 1.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Returns the valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    if row > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row - 1, col))  # Up\n    if row < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row + 1, col))  # Down\n    if col > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row, col - 1))  # Left\n    if col < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row, col + 1))  # Right\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through the grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[row,col] == 3:\n                for neighbor_row, neighbor_col in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col):\n                    if input_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] == 0:\n                         output_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] = 1\n    \n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[row,col] == 3:\n                for neighbor_row, neighbor_col in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col):\n                    if output_grid[neighbor_row,neighbor_col] == 1:\n                         output_grid[row,col] = 1\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
