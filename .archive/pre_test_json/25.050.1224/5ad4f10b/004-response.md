# 5ad4f10b • 004 • example_2 - CODE

---
Okay, I understand. Based on the two examples, it appears there's a general pattern we can follow. Here's a breakdown and a more generalized Python implementation:

**Generalized Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Determine the "target" color based on the non-background color that *appears in the output grid*. In the first example, it was azure (8), and in the second, it was red (2).  The background color is always 0.

2.  **Locate Target Cells:** Find all cells in the input grid with the target color.

3. **Determine Output Grid Size:** In both provided cases, output grid size is 3x3.

4.  **Analyze Adjacencies:** For each target-colored cell in the *input* grid, examine its immediate neighbors (including diagonals).

5.  **Conditional Output:**
    *   If a target cell has *any* neighbor with the background color (0), it *might* correspond to a background cell (0) in the output.
    *   If all neighbors are not color (0), and there exist one color different than target, the output is the target color.
    *   If all neighbors are color 0, the output is 0.

6.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the output grid, prioritizing cells based on adjacencies. The output is always 3x3. The selection order of target cells from the input seems to be from top-left to bottom-right but it must check the neighbors. If there is any neighbor with the background color (0), it is considered first. If there are no neighbors, the default value is background.

**Improved Python Code**

```python
"""
Generalized transformation:

1. Identify the target color (non-background color in the output).
2. Find all cells of the target color in the input.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid.
4. For each target cell:
   - If it has any background (0) neighbor, it *might* become 0 in the output.
   - If all neighbors are not zero and contains one different color, output the target.
   - If all neighbors are zero, the output is zero.
5. Fill the 3x3 output, prioritizing based on neighbors.

      else:
          output_grid[output_row,output_col] = 0

      output_col += 1

    return output_grid
```

Key Changes and Improvements:

*   **`find_target_color` function:**  This function now dynamically determines the target color from a given output, making the code more general.
*   **Prioritized Filling:** The code prioritizes filling output grid positions based on whether a target cell has a background neighbor.
*   **Handles Empty Target Coords:** The function now returns an all zero matrix, if the target pixels are not present.
* **Target Dictionary**: Creates a dictionary that maps the target coordinates with its neighbors.
*   **Clearer Logic:** The conditional logic for determining the output color is made more explicit.

This improved version should be more robust and adaptable to similar ARC tasks where a small output grid is derived from specific colored cells and their adjacencies in a larger input grid.  It captures the core "story" of selecting a subset of cells and determining their values based on neighbor relationships.
