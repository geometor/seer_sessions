            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this fourth transformation. It seems to continue the pattern, but with a key difference in the object being expanded.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      shape: 1x1 square\n      position: (4,4) # (row, col) - zero indexed\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      shape: \"L\" shape\n      position: (4,3),(3,3) and (3,4)\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: 9x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      shape: Partial tilted square\n      position: Expands around initial position\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   An orange cell at position (4,4).\n    *   A red \"L\" shaped object, with cells at (3,3) (3,4) and (4,3).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Predicates, actions, and changes):**\n    * The red 'L' shaped object disappears\n    * The orange cell expands into a 5x5 partially tilted square centered around the intial orange cell. Since the 'corner' of the red 'L' shape has coordinates with both row and col minor of the coordinate of the orange pixel, the final partial tilted square is missing the bottom-right 3x3 area.\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning**\n\nThe transformation now involves an \"L\" shaped object disappearing, and the *single cell* of a different color expanding. It seems that when a L-shape coexists with a single cell, and they have different colors, it's the single cell (of any color) that expands after the L-shape (of any color) is removed. The expansion, as before, forms a partial 5x5 tilted square. The rule about missing sub-square of the previous cases is confirmed also in this example.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is summarized as follows:\n\n1. Identify the single-cell object (any color).\n2. Identify the L-shaped object (any color).\n3. Remove the L-shaped object\n4. Expand the single-cell object into a tilted 5x5 square:\n   - Determine the \"corner\" of the L-shape.\n   - Based on relative position of the single cell, expand as follow:\n      * cell has row major than corner row and col major than corner col: expand down-right, top-left 3x3 sub-square is missing.\n      * cell has row major than corner row and col minor than corner col: expand down-left, top-right 3x3 sub-square is missing.\n      * cell has row minor than corner row and col major than corner col: expand up-right, bottom-left 3x3 sub-square is missing.\n      * cell has row minor than corner row and col minor than corner col: expand up-left, bottom-right 3x3 sub-square is missing.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds coordinates of cells with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    coords = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r,c] == color:\n                coords.append((r, c))\n    return coords\n\ndef detect_l_shape(coords):\n    \"\"\"Detects if the given coordinates form an L-shape and determines its orientation.\"\"\"\n    if len(coords) != 3:\n        return None  # Not an L-shape\n\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier calculations\n    coords = np.array(coords)\n\n    # sorting coords to handle different input L orders\n    coords = sorted(coords, key=lambda x: (x[0],x[1]))\n    coords = np.array(coords)\n    diffs = np.diff(coords, axis=0)\n    if (np.all(diffs[0] == [1, 0]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [0, 1])) or \\\n        (np.all(diffs[0] == [0, 1]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [1, 0])) :\n      # case 1:  _|_\n      return 'down_right', coords[0]\n    elif (np.all(diffs[0] == [0, 1]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [-1, 0])) or \\\n      (np.all(diffs[0] == [-1, 0]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [0, 1])) :\n      # case 2:   _|\n      return 'down_left', coords[0] if (np.all(diffs[0] == [-1, 0])) else coords[2]\n    elif (np.all(diffs[0] == [0, -1]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [-1, 0])) or \\\n      (np.all(diffs[0] == [-1, 0]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [0, -1])) :\n      # case 3: |_\n      return 'up_left',  coords[0] if (np.all(diffs[0] == [-1, 0])) else coords[2]\n    elif (np.all(diffs[0] == [1, 0]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [0, -1])) or \\\n        (np.all(diffs[0] == [0, -1]) and np.all(diffs[1] == [1, 0])) :\n      # case 4:  -|\n      return 'up_right', coords[0]\n\n    return None\n\ndef get_expansion_direction(l_corner, cell_coord):\n    \"\"\"Determines the expansion direction based on L-shape corner and single cell position.\"\"\"\n    row_c, col_c = l_corner\n    row_s, col_s = cell_coord\n    \n    # Determine expansion direction\n    if row_s > row_c and col_s > col_c:\n      return 'down_right'\n    elif row_s > row_c and col_s < col_c:\n      return 'down_left'\n    elif row_s < row_c and col_s > col_c:\n      return 'up_right'\n    elif row_s < row_c and col_s < col_c:\n      return 'up_left'\n    else:\n      # same row or col\n      if row_s == row_c:\n        if col_s > col_c: return 'down_right' # same row, col maj\n        else: return 'up_left' # same row, col min\n      else:\n        if row_s > row_c: return 'down_right' # col is the same, row maj\n        else: return 'up_left' # col is the same, row min\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the final rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # 1.
