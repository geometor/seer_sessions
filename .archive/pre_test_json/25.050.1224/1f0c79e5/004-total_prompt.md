Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: L-shape (or 2x1 rectangle + 1x1 square)
      position: (5,3) and (6,3) and (6,4) # (row, col) - zero indexed
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: 1x1 square
      position: (5,4)

output_grid:
  dimensions: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: Roughly a 5x5 tilted square, upper part
      position: Top-left at (1,5), extends to (5,1). Contains central blank
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects:
    *   A yellow object that resembles a rotated "L" shape, constituted by two yellow cells at (6,3), (5,3) and one at (6,4) (using a 0-indexed row, column notation).
    *   A single red cell, located at (5,4).

2.  **Transformation Rule (Predicates, actions, and changes):** The red object disappear, and at the same time, yellow object expands around its initial position. The yellow 'L' shape "expands" by replicating the '4' color. This extension forms a sort of upwards-pointing and leftwards 5x5 tilted "arrowhead", or an incomplete 5x5 rotated square, where is missing the 'bottom right' 3x3 sub-square. The bottom left corner of the final figure is placed at (1+k, 5-k) with k=4.

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The core of the transformation is the expansion and change of shape of the yellow object and the removing of the red object. The rule seems to dictate a specific pattern of expansion, not simply filling adjacent cells, but creating an almost symmetric shape centered around where yellow and red cells where initially in contact.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify a yellow "L" shaped object and a red cell in the input grid.
2. Remove the red cell.
3. Expand the yellow object into a 5x5 tilted square-like shape, pointing upwards and leftwards, 
   with its bottom-left corner 4 cells diagonally down and left from a starting position near the initial yellow object.

Okay, let's analyze this second transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: 2x1 rectangle + 1x1 square (L-shape)
      position: (2,2), (1,2) and (2,3)  # (row, col) - zero indexed
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: 1x1 square
      position: (2,3)

output_grid:
  dimensions: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: Roughly a 5x5 tilted square, bottom-right part, centered around the initial 'L'
      position: The diagonal starts at (1,2) and extends downwards and to the right.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains:
    *   A green "L" shaped object formed by three green cells located at (1,2), (2,2), and (2,3) using 0-indexed row, column notation.
    *  A red cell at position (2,3)

2.  **Transformation Rule (Predicates, actions, and changes):**
    *   The red cell disappears.
    *   The initial green L-shape object expands around its location. The green object grows into shape of a 5x5 tilted square where the upper left 3x3 sub-square is not present. The top left corner of the final figure is at (1,2).

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

This transformation is very similar to the previous one. A small colored object (red) disappear, and another object of different color ('L' shaped) expands into a partial tilted squared centered on the original position of the 'L' shaped object. The only difference with the example before is the 'direction' of the tilted square (bottom-right instead of top-left).

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify a green "L" shaped object and a red cell in the input grid.
2. Remove the red object.
3. Expand the green object into a partial, downwards-pointing 5x5 tilted "square" shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
