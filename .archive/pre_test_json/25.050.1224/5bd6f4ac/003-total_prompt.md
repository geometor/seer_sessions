Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Target Cells:** The transformation extracts specific cells from the input grid to form the output grid. The program focuses on extracting a 3x3 subgrid defined by specific row and columns of the original grid.

2.  **Row and Column Selection:** The output grid comprises cells taken from rows 0, 1 and 2, and the columns selected are 6, 7 and 8 of the input grid.

3. **Output Formation**: The output grid is obtained by arranging the selected cells from the input grid.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the top right corner of the input grid (rows 0, 1 and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8) to create the output grid.

```python
"""

    Returns:

    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Extract the 3x3 subgrid
    output_grid = input_array[0:3, 6:9]

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
