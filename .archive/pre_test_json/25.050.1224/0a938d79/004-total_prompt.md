Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [10, 25]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: [0, 5]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 8
      position: [9, 7]
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [10, 25]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      positions: [[i, 5 + 5*j] for i in range(10) for j in range(5)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
    - color: 8
      positions: [[i, 7 + 5*j] for i in range(10) for j in range(5)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation rule involves replicating the initial objects (single cells of color 2 and 8) across the grid in a specific pattern.

1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: Two single-cell objects are present in the input grid: one of color 2 and one of color 8.

2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:
    *   The object with color 2, initially at position (0, 5), is replicated vertically down the entire column and then repeated every 5 columns to the right.
    *   The object with color 8, initially at position (9, 7), is replicated vertically down the entire column and then repeated every 5 columns to the right.
   
3. **Vertical Replication and Columns creation:** Each cell is the source of a new object, and each object replicates vertically down.

4. **Horizontal Replication and Columns creation:** Both initial single cells objects creates are replicated horizontally in a repeating pattern.

In summary, it is like stamping the single instances of the color vertically down, and repeat the result horizontally.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 23]
  objects:
    - color: 1
      position: [0, 5]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 3
      position: [6, 8]
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [7, 23]
  objects:
    - color: 1
      positions: [[i, 5 + 5*j] for i in range(7) for j in range(3)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
    - color: 3
      positions: [[i, 8 + 5*j] for i in range(7) for j in range(3)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation follows the same rule as the previous example. It replicates single-cell objects across the grid in a specific pattern.

1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: There are two single-cell objects in the input grid, one with color 1 and another with color 3.

2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:
    *   The object with color 1 (initially at position (0, 5)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.
    *   The object with color 3 (initially at position (6, 8)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.

3. **Vertical Replication and Columns creation:** Each cell is the source of a new object, and each object replicates vertically down.

4. **Horizontal Replication and Columns creation:** Both initial single cells objects creates are replicated horizontally in a repeating pattern.

In summary, the same "stamping" rule is applied: single instances of colors are stamped vertically, and the results are repeated horizontally every 5 columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
