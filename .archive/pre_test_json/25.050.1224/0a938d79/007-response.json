It's similar to the third one.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: [24, 8]\n  objects:\n    - color: 4\n      position: [7, 0]\n      shape: single cell\n    - color: 1\n      position: [11, 0]\n      shape: single cell\n  background_color: 0\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: [24, 8]\n  objects:\n    - color: 4\n      positions: [[7 + 8*j, i] for i in range(8) for j in range(3)]\n      shape: single cells forming rows\n    - color: 1\n      positions: [[11 + 8*j, i] for i in range(8) for j in range(3)]\n      shape: single cells forming rows\n  background_color: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of Transformation**\n\nThe transformation rule is the same as in example three, replicating initial single-cell objects horizontally and then repeating the resulting rows vertically.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: The input grid contains two single-cell objects: one of color 4 at (7, 0) and one of color 1 at (11, 0).\n\n2.  **Horizontal Replication**:\n    *   The object with color 4 is replicated across its entire row (row 7).\n    *   The object with color 1 is replicated across its entire row (row 11).\n\n3.  **Vertical Pattern Repetition**:\n    *   The row now filled with color 4 (originally row 7) is repeated every 8 rows, starting from row 7.\n    *    The row now filled with color 1 (originally row 11) is repeated every 8 rows, starting from row 11.\n\nThe critical difference from the first two examples is again the order: horizontal expansion *before* vertical repetition. The vertical repetition interval is also different, 8 rows instead of 4.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves replicating the initial objects horizontally and then repeating the generated rows at specific intervals.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: The input grid contains two single-cell objects.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Replication**:\n    *   Each object with a non-zero color is replicated across its entire row.\n\n3.  **Vertical Pattern Repetition**:\n     *    Each filled row is repeated every 8 rows downwards.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find initial objects\n    initial_objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                initial_objects.append(((r, c), input_grid[r, c]))\n\n    # Replicate horizontally and then vertically\n    for obj in initial_objects:\n        pos, color = obj\n        initial_row, _ = pos\n\n        # Horizontal replication\n        for c in range(cols):\n            output_grid[initial_row, c] = color\n\n        # Vertical repetition\n        for i in range(1,(rows - initial_row) // 8 + 1):\n            new_row = initial_row + 8 * i\n            if new_row < rows:\n               for c in range(cols):\n                    output_grid[new_row,c] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
