Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [10, 25]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: [0, 5]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 8
      position: [9, 7]
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [10, 25]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      positions: [[i, 5 + 5*j] for i in range(10) for j in range(5)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
    - color: 8
      positions: [[i, 7 + 5*j] for i in range(10) for j in range(5)]
      shape: single cells forming columns
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation rule involves replicating the initial objects (single cells of color 2 and 8) across the grid in a specific pattern.

1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: Two single-cell objects are present in the input grid: one of color 2 and one of color 8.

2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:
    *   The object with color 2, initially at position (0, 5), is replicated vertically down the entire column and then repeated every 5 columns to the right.
    *   The object with color 8, initially at position (9, 7), is replicated vertically down the entire column and then repeated every 5 columns to the right.
   
3. **Vertical Replication and Columns creation:** Each cell is the source of a new object, and each object replicates vertically down.

4. **Horizontal Replication and Columns creation:** Both initial single cells objects creates are replicated horizontally in a repeating pattern.

In summary, it is like stamping the single instances of the color vertically down, and repeat the result horizontally.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml

  dimensions: [7, 23]
  objects:
    - color: 1
      position: [0, 5]
      shape: single cell

```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation follows the same rule as the previous example. It replicates single-cell objects across the grid in a specific pattern.

1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: There are two single-cell objects in the input grid, one with color 1 and another with color 3.

2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:
    *   The object with color 1 (initially at position (0, 5)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.
    *   The object with color 3 (initially at position (6, 8)) is replicated vertically down and then repeated every 5 columns.

3. **Vertical Replication and Columns creation:** Each cell is the source of a new object, and each object replicates vertically down.

4. **Horizontal Replication and Columns creation:** Both initial single cells objects creates are replicated horizontally in a repeating pattern.

In summary, the same "stamping" rule is applied: single instances of colors are stamped vertically, and the results are repeated horizontally every 5 columns.

Okay, let's analyze this third example. This one differs significantly from the previous two.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [22, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: [5, 0]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 3
      position: [7, 8]
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [22, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2
      positions: [[5 + 4*j, i] for i in range(9) for j in range (4)]
      shape: single cells forming rows
    - color: 3
      positions: [[7+ 4*j, i] for i in range(9) for j in range (4)]
      shape: single cells forming rows
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation in this example involves replicating the initial objects (single cells of color 2 and 3) *horizontally* and then repeating the generated rows at specific intervals.

1.  **Identify Initial Objects**: The input grid contains two single-cell objects: one of color 2 at position (5, 0) and one of color 3 at position (7, 8).

2.  **Horizontal Replication**:
    *   The object with color 2 is replicated across the entire row (row 5).
    *   The object with color 3 is replicated across the entire row (row 7).

3.  **Vertical Pattern Repetition**:
     *   The row with color 2 (row 5) is repeated every 4 rows, starting from its initial position.
     *   The row with color 3 (row 7) is repeated every 4 rows, starting from its initial position.

In summary, the single color instances are expanded *horizontally* to fill their respective rows. Then those filled rows are repeated downwards every four rows.  This is different from the previous two, which replicated vertically first and then horizontally. The order of replication matters.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
