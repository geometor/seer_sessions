Since this is a 3x3 grid, the diagonal effectively fills cells (0,2), (1,1). The cell (2,0) does not become red in this smaller grid, because it has already color 5.\n\n3.  **Create the yellow line**: The last row keeps color 5 on the first element, and becomes yellow (color code 4) on the remaining cells.\n\n4.  **Everything else:** Preserve the remaining cells in the output, that becomes white (0).\n\n**Explanation of the Rule:**\nIt's the same rule as before, but applied to a smaller grid. The first column remains the same. The diagonal from bottom left to top right is drawn with color 2.\nThe last row is color 4, except for the first column.\nThe remaining cells are color 0.\n\nThe provided Python code correctly implements this transformation rule and handles different grid sizes, including this 3x3 example, making the code correct.\n"
