Here's my breakdown:\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: Cross-like pattern\n      positions: [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)]\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: Background\n      positions: All other cells\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: similar cross-like pattern, but 2 cells are different color\n      positions: [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)]\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      shape: single cells inside the green object.\n      positions: [(2,2), (3,3)]\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: Background\n      positions: All other cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Green Object:** Locate the contiguous \"cross-like\" shaped object formed by cells of color 3 (green) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Locate the center:** Inspect the cells that belong to the green object. Locate the cell that belongs to object 3, that is surrounded, on its top, bottom, left and right, by other cells that belong to the object, paint that yellow.\n\n3. **Repeat:** Repeat the process for other cells of the object that meet similar conditions.\n\n**Elaboration and Explanation**\nThe core transformation involves the object with color 3. Two cells from it are changing their colors.\n"
