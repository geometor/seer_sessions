Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (1,5), (1,8), (3,3), (3,7), (5,1), (5,5), (7,3), (7,7), (8,1)]
      shape: "Scattered individual cells"
    - color: 5 (gray)
      positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two vertical lines of length 3"
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: "All other cells"
      shape: "Background"

output_grid:
  size: 5x5
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4), (2,2)]
      shape: "Corners and center of a 5x5 square"
    - color: 5 (gray)
      positions: [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]
      shape: "Two vertical lines of length 3 at corners"
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: "All other cells"
      shape: "Background"
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two main types of objects besides the background (color 0):
    *   Azure (color 8) cells scattered throughout the grid.
    *   Two vertical lines of gray (color 5) cells, each three cells long.

2.  **Determine Core Pattern:** Notice that the output grid is smaller (5x5) than the input grid (9x9). The output appears to extract and rearrange a subset of the input's colored cells. Specifically, it takes some of the azure and gray cells.

3.  **Describe Relative Positions:**
    *   The output grid's corner cells (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), and (4,4) are azure (color 8). These correspond to the azure cells at the top-left area, top-center, lower-center and bottom left areas of the original input.
    * The output also has an azure piece in its center (2,2) that corresponds to the color 8 at the top-right of the original input.
    *   The two vertical lines of gray (color 5) cells are preserved in the output, but their positions change. In the input, they are at columns 1 and 5. In the output, they form the leftmost and rightmost columns.

4. **Transformation rule**:
    * Consider a 5x5 subgrid from the perspective of a 3x3 subgrid, so that we have a cross-shaped central part.
    * Extract the subgrid given by `(row, column)` coordinates `(1,1), (1,8), (8,1), (3,3)` from the input. Place them in the output, on the four corners.
    * The color 8 at the top-right area of the input is placed on the center of the output.
    * Extract the two vertical lines in columns 1 and 5, from row 2 to row 4. Place them in the output's first and last columns, from row 1 to row 3.
    * Fill all other output grid locations to color 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
