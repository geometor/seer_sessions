These cells remain unchanged in position and color in the output grid.\n\n2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 \"cross\" or \"+\" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.\n\n3. **Orange expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 \"cross\" or \"+\" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.\n\n**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**\n\n1.  The red (2) cell at (3, 2) and the blue (1) cell at (6, 6) in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.\n2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from the red cell.\n3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of the blue cell.\n\nIn summary, this task shows object constancy, with a shape created around two selected objects based on colors.\n"
