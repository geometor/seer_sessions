Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate the single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position and color in the output grid.

2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.

3. **Orange expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**

1.  The red (2) cell at (3, 2) and the blue (1) cell at (6, 6) in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.
2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from the red cell.
3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of the blue cell.

In summary, this task shows object constancy, with a shape created around two selected objects based on colors.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  The single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input remain unchanged.
2.  A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.
3.  An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

       shape: 1x1
     - color: 0
       position: all other cells
       shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** There are two red (color 2) cells and two blue (color 1) cells in the input. An azure cell (color 8) is also in the input, but remains unchanged in position and in the output. Red and blue cells remain unchanged in position and color.

2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below *each* red cell.

3.  **Orange Expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of *each* blue cell.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**

1.  The azure (8) cell, the red (2) cells and the blue (1) cells in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.
2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from each red cell.
3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of each blue cell.

This is essentially the same rule as in the first example, but applied to *multiple* red and blue cells instead of just one of each.

**Python Code**
The code provided works perfectly also for this case, because it does not assume there is one single object 2 or object 1, as it uses the function `find_object` that returns coordinates no matter if the objects are more than one.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  The red (color 2) cells and the blue (color 1) cells in the input remain unchanged.
2.  A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below each red cell.
3.  An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of each blue cell.

      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** There is one red (color 2) cell, one blue (color 1) cell and one magenta (color 6) in the input. All of them remain unchanged.

2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.

3.  **Orange Expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**

1.  The red (2) cell, the blue (1) cell and the magenta (6) in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.
2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from the red cell.
3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of the blue cell.

This is the same rule again. The presence of the magenta cell is irrelevant; it's just a distractor. The core rule about creating yellow and orange crosses around red and blue cells, respectively, still holds.

**Python Code:**

The previously provided Python code correctly implements this transformation. The `find_objects` function (or the original `find_object` function) will locate the red and blue cells, and the rest of the logic will generate the yellow and orange crosses correctly, regardless of the presence of other colored cells.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  The red (color 2) cells and the blue (color 1) cells in the input remain unchanged.
2.  A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below each red cell.
3.  An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of each blue cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
