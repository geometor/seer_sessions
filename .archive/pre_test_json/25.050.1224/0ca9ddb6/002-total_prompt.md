Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3,2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6,6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate the single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position and color in the output grid.

2.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the row above and the row below the red cell.

3. **Orange expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "cross" or "+" shape appears centered on the column to the left and the column to the right of the blue cell.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description:**

1.  The red (2) cell at (3, 2) and the blue (1) cell at (6, 6) in the input are copied to the same positions in the output.
2.  Yellow (4) cells are placed on the cells located at one row of distance from the red cell.
3.  Orange (7) cells are placed on the cells located at one column of distance of the blue cell.

In summary, this task shows object constancy, with a shape created around two selected objects based on colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
