Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  - dimensions: [3, 30]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Scattered and contiguous regions of varying sizes.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, interspersed with blue regions.
    - color: 5 (gray)
      properties:
        - description: Single cells at the top left and right edges of the first row.
    - color: 1
      shape: rectangle
      size: [1,4]
      position: [1,15]


output_grid:
  - dimensions: [3, 30]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Similar to input, except for a region replaced by color 6.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, unchanged from input.
    - color: 5 (gray)
      properties:
        - description: Same as input.
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      properties:
        - description: A 1x4 rectangular block in rows 2 and 3.
      shape: rectangle
      size: [1,4]
      position: [1,15]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Locate the contiguous 1x4 rectangle of blue (color 1) cells starting at row 1, column 15 of the input grid. It is located at the coordinates (1,15)
2.  **Change the object color:** Transform or replace the identified rectangle block of blue cells with a magenta block(color 6).
3.  **Preserve Other Elements:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

In short: The transformation isolates a specified rectangular block of blue cells (1x4) and turns it magenta, while everything else stays the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
