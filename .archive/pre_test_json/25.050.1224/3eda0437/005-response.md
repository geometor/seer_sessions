Okay, let's analyze this third transformation example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  - dimensions: [2, 20]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Scattered and contiguous regions of varying sizes.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, interspersed with blue regions.
    - color: 1
      shape: rectangle
      size: [1,5]
      position: [0,2]

output_grid:
  - dimensions: [2, 20]
  - objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      properties:
        - description: Similar to input, except for a region replaced by color 6.
    - color: 0 (white)
      properties:
        - description: Background, unchanged from input.
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      properties:
        - description: A 1x5 rectangular block in rows 1 and 2.
       shape: rectangle
      size: [1,5]
      position: [0,2]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Locate the contiguous 1x5 rectangle of blue (color 1) cells starting at the coordinates (0,2) of the input grid, row 0, column 2.
2.  **Change Object Color:** Transform the identified rectangular block of blue cells to magenta (color 6).
3. **Preserve Other Elements:** All other cells remain unchanged.

The rule is consistent: find a contiguous horizontal block of blue cells (1xN, where N is variable) starting at a particular location and change its color to magenta, while preserving all other elements of the grid.
