Firstly, The cells with color code 2 (red) is replaced with the color 7 (orange) object, causing it to merge/expand with the original orange object.. Secondly, the entire background, originally white (color 0), is changed to green (color 3), while the combined orange object remains unchanged.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves two primary actions.
