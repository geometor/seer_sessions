Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      position: centered, slightly offset to the left
      bounding_box: [3,2] to [5,4] # row, col
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: Vertical line
      position: centered, intersects yellow object
      bounding_box: [3,5] to [5,5]

output_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: Filled rectangle
      position: covers the entire grid
      bounding_box: [0,0] to [9,9]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: Cross-shape
      position: centered
      bounding_box: [3,3] to [5,6]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Yellow Object:** Locate the contiguous region of yellow (color 4) cells in the input grid.

2.  **Identify the Red Object:** Notice that some parts of the red objects (color 2) cells in the original input grid are replaced by color 4.

3. **Change Red to Yellow**: Every cell with color code 2 is replaced with color code 4.

4.  **Background Change:** Change all the cells in the input grid to color 3 (green), except for the contiguous region that is color 4.

**Complete Description:**

The transformation involves two main actions. First, all the cells with value `2` have been replaced by value `4`, effectively combining all shapes into a single yellow cross shape. Then, the entire background, which was originally white (color 0), is changed to green (color 3). The yellow shape remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: 1x2 rectangle
      position: Top, centered horizontally
      bounding_box: [3,3] to [3,4]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: L-shape
      position: Centered, slightly below the red object
      bounding_box: [4,3] to [6,5]

output_grid:
  size: 10x10
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: Filled rectangle
      position: covers the entire grid
      bounding_box: [0,0] to [9,9]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: Combined Shape
      position: center
      bounding_box: [1,4] to [6,5]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Magenta Object:** Locate the contiguous region of magenta (color 6) cells in the input grid.
2. **Identify the Red Object**: The red object (color code 2) will disappear and its position will be occupied by color 6.

3.  **Combine Objects:** Replace every color code '2' with the color code '6'.

4.  **Background Change:** Change all the remaining cells in the input grid that has not color `6` to color 3 (green).

**Complete Description:**

The transformation involves two main actions. The first action replaces the color `2` object with the color `6`. It effectively overlaps or merges the red object's location with the color magenta. The second is that the entire background, which was originally white (color 0), is changed to green (color 3), except for the final magenta shape.

    return new_output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
