The first action replaces the color `2` object with the color `6`. It effectively overlaps or merges the red object's location with the color magenta. The second is that the entire background, which was originally white (color 0), is changed to green (color 3), except for the final magenta shape.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves two main actions.
