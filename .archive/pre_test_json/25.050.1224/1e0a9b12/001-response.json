These are our objects.\n\n2.  **Move Down:** Shift the identified colored cells to the last row of the grid.\n\n3. **Preserve X, Sort by X** The colored cells preserve the column, that is their horizontal (X) position.\n\n4. **Fill with White** Fill the cells that the objects leaved with white.\n\nIn summary: The colored cells are moved to the last row of the output, the other cells are filled with white.\n\n"
