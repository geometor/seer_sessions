Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 2x6
  objects:
    color_1:
      - position: [0, 1]
      - position: [0, 3]
      - position: [0, 5]
    color_2:
      - position: [0, 0]
      - position: [0, 2]
      - position: [0, 4]
      - position: [1, 0]
      - position: [1, 2]
      - position: [1, 4]
    color_3:
      - position: [1, 1]
      - position: [1, 3]
      - position: [1, 5]
output_grid:
  size: 2x2
  objects:
    color_1:
      - position: [0, 1]
    color_2:
      - position: [0, 0]
      - position: [1, 0]
    color_3:
      - position: [1, 1]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Columns:** Examine the input grid, which is 2x6.
2.  **Select Columns:** Take every third column of the input grid starting from the first column. That is, consider column 0 and column 3.
3. Remove other columns.
4.  **Construct Output:** Arrange the content of these selected columns to construct the output grid of size 2x2, preserving the original order of rows.

In other words, the output grid is formed by sampling specific columns from the input grid.
