The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Identify Columns:** Examine the input grid, which is 3x9.
2. **Select Columns:** Take every third column of the input grid starting from the first column. That is, consider column 0, column 3, and column 6.
3. Remove other columns.
4. **Construct Output:** Arrange the content of these selected columns to construct the output grid of size 3x3, preserving the original order of rows.

In other words, the output grid is formed by sampling specific columns from the input grid.
