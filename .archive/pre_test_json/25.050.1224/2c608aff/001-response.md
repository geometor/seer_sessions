Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  objects:
    - color: 3 # Green
      shape: 3x3 square
      position: Centered horizontally, slightly above center vertically
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      shape: single cell
      position: Varies, but appears within the horizontal bounds of the green square
    - color: 8 # Azure
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid
  relationships:
    - The green square and yellow cell are distinct objects.
    - The yellow cell's horizontal position seems related to the green square's horizontal span.
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous block of color `3` (green) and the single cell of color `4` (yellow). Also, note the background is color `8` (azure).

2. **Detect Horizontal Translation**: In the 4th row from top, detect the column number where the single yellow object is in the input grid. Let say it is `x`.

3. **Horizontal Expansion:** Starting from column number `x` in the 4th row, replace four cells to the right including cell at `x` with the color of the single yellow object.

4. **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects are preserved. In this case the green object and azure background is preserved.

**Explanation of the Rule**

The core of the rule is that the single yellow block extends to the right and become horizontally elongated. All other objects and background are preserved as is.
