Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in the second example.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  objects:
    - color: 1 # Blue
      shape: 3x3 square
      position: Centered horizontally, slightly above center vertically
    - color: 2 # Red
      shape: Background
      position: Fills entire grid except where other colors are present
    - color: 8  # Azure
      shape: single cell
      position: bottom row, centered under blue square, 4th column
  relationships:
      - The red color serves as a default background.
      - The position of the azure block is tied to the horizontal position of the blue square.

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the blue (color `1`) 3x3 square, the azure (color `8`) single cell, and the red (color `2`) background.

2.  **Locate Column:** Determine the starting column index of the azure cell in the input, say `x`.

3.  **Vertical Extension:**  Extend the azure color vertically upwards. Starting from the row of the azure block and going up, replace the cells in the same column (`x`) with azure (color `8`) until reaching row number 5 (inclusive).

4. **Preserve other objects.** All other objects are kept as is (blue square and red background).

**Explanation of the Rule**

The core transformation is the vertical extension of the single azure block. Starting from its original position, it expands upwards to row 5, effectively creating a vertical line of azure color, overwriting background color red. The blue block remains the same.
