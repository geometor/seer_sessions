            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this third example and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 5x7\n  objects:\n    blue_line:\n      color: 1\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: center column\n    maroon_pixels:\n      color: 9\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line\n    white_pixels:\n      color: 0\n      shape: scattered\n      position: surrounding the blue line\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 5x3\n  objects:\n    azure_pixels:\n      color: 8\n      shape: scattered, no clear pattern at first glance\n      position: dispersed across multiple rows\n    white_pixels:\n      color: 0\n      shape: background\n      position: filling the remaining cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** In the input grid, locate all pixels with the color blue (value 1). It's not necessarily a contiguous line this time.\n\n2.  **Resize the Grid:** The output grid has dimensions of 5 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3.  **Map Blue to Azure:** For *each* row in the input grid where a blue pixel exists, place an azure pixel (value 8) in the output grid. The output grid's azure pixel placement corresponds to the input's blue pixel presence on a row-by-row basis within the resized width.  If a blue pixel exists anywhere in columns 0,1 or 2 of a given row, put azure in position (row,0). If it exists in column 3, put an azure in position (row,1). If it exist on columns 4,5 or 6 put azure in (row, 2).\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining with White:** All other cells in the output grid that don't correspond to a row with a blue pixel are set to white (value 0).\n\n**Explanation and Refinement of the Rule:**\n\nThis example clarifies a crucial point: The rule isn't strictly about a *vertical line* of blue, but rather the *presence* of blue within each row. If any blue pixel appears in a row in the input grid, then an azure is generated to output. The column where azure appears depends on the input column.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of blue pixels in each row.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 1:\n                if j in [0, 1, 2]:\n                    output_grid[i,0] = 8\n                if j == 3:\n                    output_grid[i,1] = 8\n                if j in [4,5,6]:\n                    output_grid[i,2] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nKey improvements in this final version:\n\n*   **Handles Scattered Blue:**  The code now correctly processes cases where blue pixels are not forming a straight vertical line. It checks each cell individually.\n*   **Row-Based Mapping:** The logic explicitly maps the presence of blue in a *row* of the input to the presence of azure in the *same row* of the output.\n*   **Column Mapping**: The columns are now also mapped accordingly.\n\nThis revised explanation and code provide a more general and accurate solution for the transformation task.\n"
