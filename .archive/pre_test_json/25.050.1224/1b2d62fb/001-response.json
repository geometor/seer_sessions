This line is in the center column.\n\n2.  **Resize the Grid:** Change the overall grid dimensions. The new grid will have the same number of rows as the original grid, which is 5. The width is set to 3.\n\n3. **Find Blue:** Two azure pixels must be placed where at least one blue was in the original resized input.\n\n4.  **Clear Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid, besides the two azure pixels at the center, are set to white (color code 0).\n\n**Explanation of the Rule:**\n\nThe input consists of a central vertical blue line with a set of points colored with white, and the rest with maroon. The transformation extracts the central line's position, reduces the width of the grid, and places two azure cells in that relative position, filling the rest of the grid with white.\n"
