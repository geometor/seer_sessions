Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 5x7
  objects:
    blue_line:
      color: 1
      shape: vertical line
      position: center column
    maroon_pixels:
      color: 9
      shape: scattered
      position: surrounding the blue line
    white_pixels:
        color: 0
        shape: scattered
        position: surrounding the blue line and near the border.

output_grid:
  size: 5x3
  objects:
    azure_pixels:
      color: 8
      shape: horizontal line
      position: second to last row, center
    white_pixels:
        color: 0
        shape: background
        position: fill the grid

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Central Vertical Line:** In the input grid, locate the vertical line composed of blue pixels (color code 1). This line is in the center column.

2.  **Resize the Grid:** Change the overall grid dimensions. The new grid will have the same number of rows as the original grid, which is 5. The width is set to 3.

3. **Find Blue:** Two azure pixels must be placed where at least one blue was in the original resized input.

4.  **Clear Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid, besides the two azure pixels at the center, are set to white (color code 0).

**Explanation of the Rule:**

The input consists of a central vertical blue line with a set of points colored with white, and the rest with maroon. The transformation extracts the central line's position, reduces the width of the grid, and places two azure cells in that relative position, filling the rest of the grid with white.
