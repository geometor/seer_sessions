In this case, we find two: a blue (1) cell at (2, 6) and a yellow (4) cell at (7, 5).\n\n2.  **Expand and frame based on color:**\n    *   If the object is blue (1), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.\n    *   If the object is yellow (4), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is consistent with the previous example.  It involves taking each single-cell object in the input, and create frame and columns, depending on the original cell color. The position of the identified single cell determines at what height we draw the vertical bars.\n"
