Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 6 (magenta)
    position: (2, 2)
    shape: single cell
  - color: 7 (orange)
    position: (7, 7)
    shape: single cell
output_objects:
  - color: 6 (magenta)
    shape: 10x2 frame (top and bottom) and two 3x1 lines
  - color: 7 (orange)
      shape: 10x2 frame (top and bottom) and two 3x1 lines
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Single Cells:** Locate all single-cell objects in the input grid. In this case, we find two: a magenta (6) cell at (2, 2) and an orange (7) cell at (7, 7).

2.  **Expand and frame based on color:**
    *   If the object is magenta (6), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.
    *   If the object is orange (7), replicate it to top and bottom row. Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule involves taking each single-cell object in the input, and create frame and columns, depending on the original cell color.

```python
"""
The transformation rule involves taking each single-cell object in the input, 
and create frame and columns, depending on the original cell color.
If the object is magenta (6), replicate it to top and bottom row. 
Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.
If the object is orange (7), replicate it to top and bottom row. 
Then draw two lines, 3 cells down from the top, and 3 cells up from the bottom.

    """
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the input grid to find single-cell objects
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                color = input_grid[r,c]

                # replicate color to top and bottom rows
                output_grid[0, :] = color
                output_grid[rows - 1, :] = color

                # draw vertical lines
                output_grid[r+1:r+4,0] = color
                output_grid[r+1:r+4,cols-1] = color

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
