Color 3 (green) is gone.\n\n2. **Discard the 'cross':** The central cross made by color 3 is discarded.\n\n3.  **Focus on the corners:** Consider the corners of the original 5x5 grid. And extract a 2x2 subgrid with the colors present in the bottom corners.\n\n4. **Result:** A 2x2 output grid including the bottom two rows and left two columns.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule is: Extract the 2x2 bottom-left corner of the original grid and discard the colors that disappear.\n"
