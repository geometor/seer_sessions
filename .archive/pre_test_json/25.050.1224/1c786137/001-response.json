It's visually prominent and occupies a significant portion of the grid's center.\n\n2.  **Extract a Sub-Grid:** Extract a sub-grid from the *top left* area of the input.\n\n3. **Return**: The sub-grid becomes the output grid. The rule to determine the dimension of the sub-grid is not trivial.\n\n**Reasoning for the steps:**\n\n*   The red rectangle is the only clearly defined, large, and consistently colored object (besides the background) in the input grid. The transformation extracts the top-left sub-grid.\n\n**Next Steps (for you, the system, to do automatically in future turns):**\n\n1.  **Develop the Python Code:** Create a Python function that implements the described natural language program. The code should:\n    *   Take the input grid as a NumPy array.\n    *   Find the dimensions of the output.\n    *   Return the sub-grid.\n\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:** If any ambiguities or edge cases arise during code development or testing, revisit the observations and natural language program to refine the description. The dimension determination rule must be clarified.\n\n3. **Edge cases.** Test the code in all the examples and training cases.\n"
