The output is a Nx1 grid with cells ordered vertically by their color codes.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_distinct_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of distinct colors present in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.unique(grid).tolist()\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid into a Nx1 grid representing the distinct colors in a specific vertical order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the distinct colors from the input grid\n    distinct_colors = get_distinct_colors(input_grid)\n\n    # Initialize the output grid as an empty list\n    output_grid = []\n\n    # Add each distinct color to the output grid list\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        output_grid.append(color)\n\n    # Reshape the output to Nx1 (where N is the number of distinct colors)\n    return np.array(output_grid).reshape(-1, 1)\n```\nThe natural language program and the Python code are ready and correctly capture the described transformation.\n"
