Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 21x21
      objects:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          count: 79
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 160
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 95
          shape: large, contiguous block in the bottom left
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 0
        - color: 1 (blue)
          count: 0
          
  - output_grid:
      size: 10x10
      objects:
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 91
          shape: fills most of the grid
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 9
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the input grid. We need to find the dimensions and location of the cropping.

2.  **Cropping:** Observe that the input area includes 11 empty rows (all 0s) from line 10. Also observe that the bottom-left square in the input of color 2 (red) is of dimension 10. The program crops a 10x10 square.

3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly this 10x10 sub-part of the input.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid. No other transformations.

```python
"""
The output grid is a 10x10 section extracted from the bottom-left corner of the 21x21 input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a 10x10 subgrid from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # Define the size of the output grid.
    output_size = 10

    # Extract the 10x10 subgrid from the bottom-left.
    output_grid = input_array[rows-output_size:, :output_size]
    
    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second task.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      size: 17x19
      objects:
        - color: 2 (red)
          count: 60
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 220
          shape: irregular, scattered
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 43
          shape: contiguous block in the bottom right
  - output_grid:
      size: 7x9
      objects:
        - color: 3 (green)
          count: 43
          shape: fills the grid
        - color: 0 (white)
          count: 20

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** The output grid seems to be related to the bottom-right section of the input grid where color 3 (green) appears.

2.  **Cropping:**
     The input grid has many empty rows (filled by '0') on top. The relevant data of the grid starts at row 12. The block of color 3 is also identifiable. Its size is 7x9.

3. **Copy the relevant part:** The output is exactly the sub-part of dimension 7x9 including color 3.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The output grid is a 7x9 section extracted from the bottom-right part of the 17x19 input grid. It focuses on the region containing the green (color 3) objects.

```python
"""
The output grid is a 7x9 section extracted from the bottom-right part of the input grid,
specifically containing the contiguous block of color 3.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    output_rows = 7
    output_cols = 9

    output_grid = input_array[rows-output_rows:, cols-output_cols:]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
