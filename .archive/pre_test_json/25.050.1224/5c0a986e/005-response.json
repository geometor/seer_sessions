The positions are (2,0), (3,1), (4,2). Note that these new blue pixels stop when they meet the position of the existing 2x2 blue square.\n\n4. **Diagonal of Red Pixels:** A diagonal line of red pixels (color 2) are added to the output grid starting two rows below and to the right of the top left corner of the 2x2 blue square. The positions are (4,7), (5,8) and (6,9).\n\n**Summary of Transformation**\nThe main objects are preserved and two diagonals of single pixels are added. The diagonal of color 1 starts on the first available cell on the top and left side of the grid and goes down diagonally, stopping when it encounters an existing object with the same color. The diagonal with color two does the same, but considering a bottom-right perspective.\n\n**Final Python Code**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation preserves two 2x2 squares (blue and red) from the input grid. \nIt then adds a diagonal line of blue pixels starting near the top-left corner and going down, stopping when it encounters existing blue pixels. \nA diagonal line of red pixels is added starting to the right and down, stopping when it encounter a red pixel.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Start with a copy of the input\n\n    # Find the 2x2 squares (for generalization)\n    def find_squares(grid):\n      squares = []\n      for r in range(grid.shape[0] - 1):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1] - 1):\n          if grid[r, c] == grid[r+1, c] == grid[r, c+1] == grid[r+1, c+1] != 0:\n            squares.append((r, c, grid[r,c])) # row, col, color\n      return squares\n\n    squares = find_squares(input_grid)\n\n\n    # Add diagonal blue pixels\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n      if output_grid[i, i] ==0:\n        output_grid[i,i]=1\n      elif output_grid[i,i] == 1:\n        break\n\n    #Find existing diagonals\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    diagonals = {}\n    for i in range(-rows + 1, cols):\n        diagonals[i] = np.diagonal(input_grid, offset=i)\n\n    #Add blue\n    r, c = 0, 0\n    while r < rows and c < cols and output_grid[r,c] == 0:\n        output_grid[r,c] = 1\n        r += 1\n        c += 1\n\n    # Add diagonal red pixels\n    red_squares = [(r, c) for r, c, color in squares if color == 2]\n\n    #Find the first red square from top-left\n    red_squares.sort()\n\n    if red_squares:\n        start_r, start_c = red_squares[0]\n        start_c += 2\n        start_r -= 1\n        r, c = start_r, start_c\n        while r < rows and c < cols and r >=0:\n            if output_grid[r,c]==0:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 2\n            elif output_grid[r,c]==2:\n                break;\n            r += 1\n            c += 1\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
