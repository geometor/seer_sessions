Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (2,2)
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (6,4)

output_objects:
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (2,2)
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (6,4)
  extra_blue:
      color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(0,0), (1,1)]
  extra_red:
      color: 2
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(8,6), (9,7)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize two primary objects in the input grid:
    *   A 2x2 blue square (color 1) located at coordinates (2,2).
    *   A 2x2 red square (color 2) located at coordinates (6,4).

2.  **Preserve Original Objects.** The positions of the original objects remain the same.

3. **Add Blue Pixels** Two blue pixels (color 1) are added to the top-left, outside the original blue square. One at the extreme corner (0, 0), and the other at coordinate (1,1).

4.  **Add Red Pixels:** Two red pixels (color 2) are added to the bottom-right, outside the original red square. One is placed two cells from the rightmost bottom corner at the position (8,6) and the last one at position (9,7).

**Summary of the transformation**
The main objects are preserved and two single pixels of the same color are placed at their top-left position and their bottom-right position.
