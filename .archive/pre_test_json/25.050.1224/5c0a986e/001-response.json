One at the extreme corner (0, 0), and the other at coordinate (1,1).\n\n4.  **Add Red Pixels:** Two red pixels (color 2) are added to the bottom-right, outside the original red square. One is placed two cells from the rightmost bottom corner at the position (8,6) and the last one at position (9,7).\n\n**Summary of the transformation**\nThe main objects are preserved and two single pixels of the same color are placed at their top-left position and their bottom-right position.\n"
