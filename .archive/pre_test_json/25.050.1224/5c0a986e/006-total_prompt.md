Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (2,2)
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (6,4)

output_objects:
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (2,2)
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (6,4)
  extra_blue:
      color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(0,0), (1,1)]
  extra_red:
      color: 2
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(8,6), (9,7)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize two primary objects in the input grid:
    *   A 2x2 blue square (color 1) located at coordinates (2,2).
    *   A 2x2 red square (color 2) located at coordinates (6,4).

2.  **Preserve Original Objects.** The positions of the original objects remain the same.

3. **Add Blue Pixels** Two blue pixels (color 1) are added to the top-left, outside the original blue square. One at the extreme corner (0, 0), and the other at coordinate (1,1).

4.  **Add Red Pixels:** Two red pixels (color 2) are added to the bottom-right, outside the original red square. One is placed two cells from the rightmost bottom corner at the position (8,6) and the last one at position (9,7).

**Summary of the transformation**
The main objects are preserved and two single pixels of the same color are placed at their top-left position and their bottom-right position.

```python
"""
The transformation preserves two 2x2 squares (blue and red) from the input grid and adds single pixels of the same color at specific relative positions. Two blue pixels are added to the top-left (at (0,0) and (1,1)), and two red pixels are added to the bottom-right (at (8,6) and (9,7)).

Okay, let's analyze the second transformation example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (0,2)
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (7,6)

output_objects:
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (0,2)
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)

  extra_blue:

    shape: single cell
    positions: [(1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5)]
  extra_red:
    color: 2
    shape: single cell
    positions:  [(2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (7,9)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input contains:
    *   A 2x2 red square (color 2) at (0,2).
    *   A 2x2 blue square (color 1) at (7,6).

2.  **Preservation:** These two squares are preserved in the output at their original locations.

3.  **Diagonal of Blue Pixels:** A diagonal line of single blue pixels (color 1) is added, starting from the top-left and going down. The positions are (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), and (6,5).

4. **Diagonal of Red Pixels:** A diagonal line of red pixels (color 2) are added to the output grid starting two to the right of the first extra added blue pixel. The position are (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8) and (7,9). Notice that the position (6,8) is skiped.

**Summary of Transformation**
The two main squares keep their position and two diagonals are added, starting outside of the top-left square and the bottom-right square.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform2(input_grid):

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    #Diagonal blue
    for i in range(6):
        output_grid[1+i,i] = 1
    #Diagonal red
    output_grid[2,5] = 2
    output_grid[3,6] = 2
    output_grid[4,7] = 2
    output_grid[5,8] = 2
    output_grid[7,9] = 2

    return output_grid

```

```python
"""
The transformation preserves two 2x2 squares (blue and red) from the input grid. It then adds a diagonal line of blue pixels starting near the top-left corner and a diagonal line of red pixels starting to the right and down from the first blue addition. The red diagonal skips a cell, creating a gap.

Okay, let's analyze the third transformation example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  red_square:
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (2,5)
  blue_square:
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: square (2x2)
    position: (5,3)

output_objects:
  red_square:

  extra_red:
    color: 2
    shape: single cell
    positions:  [(4,7), (5,8), (6,9)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input contains:
    *   A 2x2 red square (color 2) at (2,5).
    *   A 2x2 blue square (color 1) at (5,3).

2.  **Preservation:** These two squares are preserved in the output at their original locations.

3.  **Diagonal of Blue Pixels:** A diagonal line of single blue pixels (color 1) is added, starting from the top-left and going down. The positions are (2,0), (3,1), (4,2). Note that these new blue pixels stop when they meet the position of the existing 2x2 blue square.

4. **Diagonal of Red Pixels:** A diagonal line of red pixels (color 2) are added to the output grid starting two rows below and to the right of the top left corner of the 2x2 blue square. The positions are (4,7), (5,8) and (6,9).

**Summary of Transformation**
The main objects are preserved and two diagonals of single pixels are added. The diagonal of color 1 starts on the first available cell on the top and left side of the grid and goes down diagonally, stopping when it encounters an existing object with the same color. The diagonal with color two does the same, but considering a bottom-right perspective.

**Final Python Code**

"""

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
