Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (0,1) # Top-left corner coordinates
  - object_2:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (2,4)
  - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (1,7)

output_objects:
 - object_1:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (1,1)
 - object_2:
     color: 4(yellow)
     shape: 2x2 square
     position: (1,4)
 - object_3:
     color: 1(blue)
     shape: 2x2 square
     position: (1,7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see three 2x2 squares, colored red, yellow, and blue, respectively.

2.  **Vertical Movement:**
    *   The red 2x2 square moves one row down.
    *   The yellow 2x2 square moves one row up.
    *   The blue 2x2 square keep in the original row.

3.  **Result:** The three squares are now aligned in the second row.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation involves moving the three objects to the second row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
