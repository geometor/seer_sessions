Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      position: (2,1) # Top-left corner coordinates
  - object_2:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      position: (1,3)
  - object_3:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      position: (3,6)

output_objects:
 - object_1:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      position: (2,1)
 - object_2:
     color: 2(red)
     shape: 2x1 rectangle
     position: (2,3)
 - object_3:
     color: 4(yellow)
     shape: 2x1 rectangle
     position: (2,6)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see three 2x1 rectangles, colored blue, red, and yellow, respectively.

2.  **Vertical Movement:**
    *   The blue 2x1 rectangle does not move.
    *   The red 2x1 rectangle shift one row down.
    *   The yellow 2x1 rectanble shift one row up.

3.  **Result:** All the three rectangles are now aligned in the third and forth row (index 2 and 3).

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation involves moving the red object down one row and the yellow object up one row, resulting in all three rectangles occupying rows 3 and 4.

```python
"""
The transformation involves identifying three 2x1 rectangles (blue, red, and yellow) in the input grid and repositioning them vertically. The blue rectangle stays in place, the red rectangle moves down one row, and the yellow rectangle moves up one row. This results in all three rectangles being aligned in the third and fourth rows of the output grid, maintaining their original column positions.
