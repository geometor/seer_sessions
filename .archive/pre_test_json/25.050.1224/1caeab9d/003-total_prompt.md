Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (0,1) # Top-left corner coordinates
  - object_2:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (2,4)
  - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (1,7)

output_objects:
 - object_1:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: 2x2 square
      position: (1,1)
 - object_2:
     color: 4(yellow)
     shape: 2x2 square
     position: (1,4)
 - object_3:
     color: 1(blue)
     shape: 2x2 square
     position: (1,7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see three 2x2 squares, colored red, yellow, and blue, respectively.

2.  **Vertical Movement:**
    *   The red 2x2 square moves one row down.
    *   The yellow 2x2 square moves one row up.
    *   The blue 2x2 square keep in the original row.

3.  **Result:** The three squares are now aligned in the second row.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation involves moving the three objects to the second row.


```python
"""
The transformation involves identifying three 2x2 squares (red, yellow, and blue) in the input grid and repositioning them vertically. The red square moves down one row, the yellow square moves up one row, and the blue square remains in its original row, resulting in all three squares being aligned in the second row.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
