Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 2 # Red
      shape: Frame/border
      position: Top rows and rightmost column
    - color: 8 # Azure
      shape: Frame/border
      position: Leftmost column, bottom rows
    - color: 0 # White
      shape: Irregular, scattered
      position: Mostly within the area bounded by colors 2 and 8

output_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 2 # Red
      shape: Frame/border (same as input)
      position: Top rows and rightmost column
    - color: 8 # Azure
      shape: Frame/border (same as input)
      position: Leftmost column, bottom rows
    - color: 0 # White
      shape: Scattered, some replaced by 3
      position: Within the area bounded by colors 2 and 8
    - color: 3 # Green
      shape: Large rectangular block, almost filling border.
      position: Filling the central area bounded by colors 2 and 8. Some isolated instances replaced white
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Borders:** Locate the frame/border formed by color 2 (red) along the top rows and the rightmost column, and the frame/border formed by color 8 (azure) along the bottom rows and the leftmost column.

2.  **Interior Filling:** Within the area enclosed by these borders, identify a vertical line of White (0) pixels extending downwards from the red frame. Change these pixels to green.

3. **Interior Filling:** Within the area enclosed by these borders and adjacent to the pixels turned Green in step 2, change all white (0) pixels within the frames to green (3).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves the red (2) and azure (8) borders. The core rule is to change the white pixels vertically aligned with the red frame to green, then fill the rest of the interior region bounded by the red and azure frames with green (3).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
