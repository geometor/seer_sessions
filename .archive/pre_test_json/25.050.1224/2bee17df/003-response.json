Some isolated instances replaced white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Borders:** Notice the borders. Color 8 (azure) is on the top row and rightmost column. Color 2 (red) is on the leftmost column and bottom rows.\n\n2.  **Interior Filling, First Pass:**  Locate the start of the interior. There is a set of two adjacent white pixels in the second row, enclosed by 2 and 8. Change them to Green. Scan horizontally and do the same\n\n3. **Second Pass** identify the enclosed area created by steps 1 and 2 and change white (0) pixels within this enclosed region to green (3).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves the red (2) and azure (8) borders. The core rule is to change two adjacent white pixels enclosed by the frames. The fill the interior with green\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nPreserves red (2) and azure (8) borders. Changes to green (3) two adjacent white pixels.\nThen fills the interior region bounded by the red, azure frames and two adjacent pixels with green (3).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_borders(grid, color):\n    # Find the row and column indices where the border color exists.\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return rows, cols\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find red (2) and azure (8) borders.\n    red_rows, red_cols = find_borders(input_grid, 2)\n    azure_rows, azure_cols = find_borders(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Determine the bounding box of the interior region.\n    min_red_row = np.min(red_rows)\n    max_azure_row = np.max(azure_rows)\n    min_azure_col = np.min(azure_cols)\n    max_red_col = np.max(red_cols)\n   \n    # Find and fill two adjacent pixels\n    for r in range(min_red_row, max_azure_row):\n        for c in range (min_azure_col, max_red_col -1):\n            if output_grid[r,c] == 0 and output_grid[r, c+1] == 0:\n                output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                output_grid[r,c+1] = 3\n\n    # Fill the interior with green (3) - second pass\n    for r in range(min_red_row + 1, max_azure_row):\n        for c in range(min_azure_col + 1 , max_red_col ):\n             if output_grid[r, c] == 0:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 3\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
