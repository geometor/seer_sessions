Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)] # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    red_object:
      count: 1
      positions: [(3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)]
      shape: cross-like, centered
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
        count: 7
        positions:
          - all cells except (0,0) and (2,0)
        shape: 3 x 3 block (with 2 holes)
    background:
        color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two types of objects: yellow (4) single-cell objects and one red (2) cross-shaped object. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).

2.  **Focus on Yellow Objects:** The output grid primarily consists of yellow (4) cells. Observe the locations of the yellow objects in the input grid.

3. **Corner Extraction:** The four yellow objects are situated at the four inside corners where inside refers to one cell in from the boundary of the 7 x 7 input grid.
   - row index: 1, column index: 1
   - row index: 1, column index: 5
   - row index: 5, column index: 1
   - row index: 5, column index: 5

4. **Relative Positioning:** With respect to those four corners, form a 3x3 output matrix.
   - position (1,1) transforms into position (0,0),
   - position (1,5) transform into position (0,2),
   - position (5,1) transforms into position (2,0),
   - position (5,5) transforms into position (2,2).

5.  **Fill Rule:** All elements of the 3x3 output matrix become yellow, except the corners (0,0) and (2,0) which become white.

In summary, the input is scanned for yellow dots situated one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions determine the output grid, which fills every cell of a 3x3 grid yellow except (0,0) and (2,0) which become white. The red object in the input grid is ignored.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
