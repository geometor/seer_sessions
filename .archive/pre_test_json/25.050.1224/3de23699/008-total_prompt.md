Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)] # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    red_object:
      count: 1
      positions: [(3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)]
      shape: cross-like, centered
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    yellow_objects:
        count: 7
        positions:
          - all cells except (0,0) and (2,0)
        shape: 3 x 3 block (with 2 holes)
    background:
        color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two types of objects: yellow (4) single-cell objects and one red (2) cross-shaped object. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0).

2.  **Focus on Yellow Objects:** The output grid primarily consists of yellow (4) cells. Observe the locations of the yellow objects in the input grid.

3. **Corner Extraction:** The four yellow objects are situated at the four inside corners where inside refers to one cell in from the boundary of the 7 x 7 input grid.
   - row index: 1, column index: 1
   - row index: 1, column index: 5
   - row index: 5, column index: 1
   - row index: 5, column index: 5

4. **Relative Positioning:** With respect to those four corners, form a 3x3 output matrix.
   - position (1,1) transforms into position (0,0),
   - position (1,5) transform into position (0,2),
   - position (5,1) transforms into position (2,0),
   - position (5,5) transforms into position (2,2).

5.  **Fill Rule:** All elements of the 3x3 output matrix become yellow, except the corners (0,0) and (2,0) which become white.

In summary, the input is scanned for yellow dots situated one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions determine the output grid, which fills every cell of a 3x3 grid yellow except (0,0) and (2,0) which become white. The red object in the input grid is ignored.

```python
"""

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 12x9
  objects:
    green_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 7), (5, 1), (5, 7)]  # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    red_object:
      count: 1
      positions: Several, forming a somewhat irregular shape in the center.
      shape: Irregular, not a simple geometric shape.
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 3x5
  objects:
    green_objects:
      count: 6
      positions: [(0,1),(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3)]
      shape: Mostly single cells, except a 2x1 block on rows 0,1 and col 1
    background:
      color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we identify green (3) single-cell objects and one red (2) irregularly shaped object. The rest is the background (0).

2.  **Focus on Green Objects:**  Like the previous example, the transformation seems to be using the positions of the green objects.

3.  **Corner Extraction:** The four green objects are located one cell in from the corners of the grid.
    *   row index: 1, column index: 1
    *   row index: 1, column index: 7
    *   row index: 5, column index: 1
    *   row index: 5, column index: 7

4. **Resizing and mapping.** Consider that those green corner dots represent a sub-matrix within the larger input matrix. Compute its size and map it to the output:
    - input submatrix size = (5-1+1) x (7-1+1) = 5 x 7
    - we remap this to the 3x5 output matrix
    - Therefore:
      - input position (1,1) becomes (0,0) output
      - input position (1,7) becomes (0,4) output
      - input position (5,1) becomes (2,0) output
      - input position (5,7) becomes (2,4) output

5.  **Fill and Overwrite Rule:**
    *   Fill all cells of the 3x5 output matrix with color 0.
    *   Fill with color 3 output positions (0,0), (0,4), (2,0) and (2,4).
    *   Fill with color 3 output positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) and (1,2)

In summary, the input is scanned for green dots located one cell in from the outer boundary, and these positions delineate a sub-matrix, which after remapping defines a set of coordinates to be colored green in the output matrix.

```python
"""

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 12x14
  objects:
    magenta_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(5, 3), (5, 8), (10, 3), (10, 8)]  # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    azure_object:
      count: 1
      positions: Several, forming a centered, somewhat irregular shape.
      shape: Irregular, centered around the magenta objects.
    background:
      color: 0

  size: 4x4
  objects:

      shape: Irregular
    background:
      color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have magenta (6) single-cell objects and one azure (8) irregularly shaped object.  The rest is background (0).

2.  **Focus on Magenta Objects:** The transformation uses the positions of the magenta objects.

3.  **Corner Extraction:** The four magenta objects are located one cell in from the boundary of a rectangle.

    *   row index: 5, column index: 3
    *   row index: 5, column index: 8
    *   row index: 10, column index: 3
    *   row index: 10, column index: 8
    The azure object is ignored.

4.  **Resizing/Mapping** The 4 magenta objects define a rectangle. Extract it, and map it to a 4x4 output:

    -   Input submatrix dimensions: (10-5+1) x (8-3+1) = 6 x 6
    - Map to 4 x 4 as follows:

        *   input position (5, 3) becomes (0, 0) output
        *   input position (5, 8) becomes (0, 3) output
        *   input position (10, 3) becomes (3, 0) output
        *   input position (10, 8) becomes (3, 3) output

5.  **Fill and Overwrite Rule:**
    *   Fill all cells of the 4x4 output matrix with color 0.
    *   Fill with color 6 output positions (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), and (3, 3)
    *   Fill with magenta (6) additional output locations (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) and (3,2).

In summary, the input is scanned for magenta dots located one cell in from the boundaries of a rectangle, and those dots are mapped to the output matrix, and additional magenta cells complete the shape in the ouput.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this fourth example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 12x18
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      count: 4
      positions: [(1, 2), (1, 11), (6, 2), (6, 11)]  # (row, col)
      shape: single cells
    yellow_object:
      count: 1
      positions: Several, forming a disconnected shape.
      shape: Disconnected, located in the center-left region of the grid.
    background:
      color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 4x8
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      count: 6
      positions: [(0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(1,3),(2,6),(3,5),(3,6)]
      shape: Mostly single cells, two instances of 2 consecutive horizontal cells
    background:
      color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have azure (8) single-cell objects and one yellow (4) disconnected object. The rest is background (0).

2.  **Focus on Azure Objects:** The transformation involves the azure objects.

3.  **Corner Extraction:** The four azure objects are located one cell in from the boundary of a sub-matrix of the input.

    *   row index: 1, column index: 2
    *   row index: 1, column index: 11
    *   row index: 6, column index: 2
    *   row index: 6, column index: 11

   The yellow object can be ignored.

4.  **Submatrix Resizing/Mapping** The four azure objects define a rectangle of size (6-1+1) x (11-2+1) = 6 x 10. This gets remapped/resized into an output matrix of size 4x8

    *   input (1, 2) becomes output (0, 0)
    *   input (1, 11) becomes output (0, 7)
    *   input (6, 2) becomes output (3, 0)
    *   input (6, 11) becomes output (3, 7)

5.  **Fill and Overwrite Rule:**

    *   Fill all output cells with color 0
    *   Fill with color 8 positions (0,0), (0,7), (3,0) and (3,7).
    * Fill with azure color additional cells:  (0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(1,3),(2,6),(3,5) and (3,6).

In summary, the input is scanned for azure dots that define a rectangle. The azure dots are mapped to the output grid corners.
The final shape involves additional azure cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
