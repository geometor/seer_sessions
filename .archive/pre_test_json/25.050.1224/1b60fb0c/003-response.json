It maintains its shape, size and position.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** The changes happen across multiple rows that contains the most blue pixels. The leftmost blue pixels are changed to red. The number of red pixels may vary.\n\n3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate the rows with blue pixels in the input. Change the left most blue pixels to red with a maximum length of 3.\n\n**Step-by-step Summary**\n1. Copy the blue object from the input.\n2. Find the rows in the input which contain the blue object. Change up to 3 leftmost blue pixels in each of these rows to red. If a row has less than or equal to three blue pixels and at least one blue pixel, all of those get changed to color red.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1. Copy the blue object from the input.\n2.
