It maintains its shape, size and position.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** We can see the changes only happen on the blue object, row 5 from top. The left most 3 blue pixels are changed to color red.\n\n3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate the row that contains most blue pixels in the input. Change the left most 3 blue pixels in that row to red.\n\n**Step-by-step Summary**\n1. Copy the blue object from the input.\n2. Find the left most 3 blue pixels on row 5 and change them to red.\n"
