It maintains its shape, size and position.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** We can see changes only happening on the rows that contains blue pixels. The left most blue pixels in these rows are changed to red.\n\n3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate all the rows with blue pixels in the input. Change the left most blue pixels to red. If a row contains less than 3 blue pixels, change all the blue pixels in this row to red.\n\n**Step-by-step Summary**\n\n1. Copy the blue object from the input.\n2. Find the all the rows which contain blue pixels. For each of these rows, change up to 3 leftmost blue pixels to red, unless the total number of blue pixels in a given row is fewer than 3, in which case change all to red.\n\nThe natural language description and Python code from the previous round accurately capture the transformation rule, and this third example confirms it. No changes are needed to either the natural language description or code.\n"
