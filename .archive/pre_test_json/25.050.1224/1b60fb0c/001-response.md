Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Irregular, resembling a stylized "S" or a winding path.
      position: Centered vertically, slightly off-center horizontally.
      size: Spans multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Same as in the input grid.
      position: Same as in the input grid.
      size: Same as in the input grid
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: L-shaped, 2x2
      position: left of the blue object
      size: 3 contiguous pixels.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.
      size: 10x10

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous blue (1) object within the input grid.  It maintains its shape, size and position.

2.  **Detect Change:** We can see the changes only happen on the blue object, row 5 from top. The left most 3 blue pixels are changed to color red.

3. **Preserve and Create**: Preserve the blue shape. Locate the row that contains most blue pixels in the input. Change the left most 3 blue pixels in that row to red.

**Step-by-step Summary**
1. Copy the blue object from the input.
2. Find the left most 3 blue pixels on row 5 and change them to red.
