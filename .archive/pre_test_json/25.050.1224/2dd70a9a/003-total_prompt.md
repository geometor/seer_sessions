Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation (YAML)**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 20x20
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: scattered, many small clusters and single cells
      notes: Dominant color, forms the background and some lines/shapes.
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      notes: Fills most of the empty space.
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: small block, 1x2
      position: (2,17) and (3,17)
      notes: Appears to be a fixed object
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: single cell
      position: (14,3) and (15,3)
      notes: another object

output_grid:
  size: 20x20
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Same as the input shape.
      notes: this color maintain its input shape
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background.
      notes: Fills most of the empty space.
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: small block, 1x2
      position: (2,17) and (3,17)
      notes: Appears to be a fixed object, and is not modified.
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: horizontal line
      position: starts in row 6, between two azure blocks.
      notes: The two greens of the input become a very long object, it seems that it expands to the azure blocks on the sides.

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program)**

1.  **Identify Static Objects:** The two red cells (color 2) at positions (2,17) and (3,17) remain unchanged in the output. The Azure (color 8) objects remain unchanged.

2.  **Green Object Transformation:** The two single green cells (color 3) are considered agents.

3. **Expansion to the sides**: The green color expand to the left and right side, taking cells of color 0.

4. **Limit of Expansion**: This expansion continues horizontally until an azure color object (color 8) is encountered, acting as stopping object.

5. **Row determination:** The expansion takes place in a single row which is given by averaging the row indices of the initial positions of the two green cells, that is (14+6)/2 = 6.

**Python Implementation (Conceptual)**
The python code is not requested, I provide the analysis.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  **Identify Static Objects:** The two red cells (color 2) at positions (2,17) and (3,17) remain unchanged. The Azure (color 8) objects also remain in their initial configuration.
2.  **Green Object Transformation:** The two single green cells (color 3) are agents.
3.  **Expansion to the sides**: The green color expands to the left and right.
4.  **Limit of Expansion**: This expansion continues horizontally until an azure (color 8) object is encountered.
5.  **Row determination:** The expansion takes place in the row 6.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
