The Azure (color 8) objects remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Green Object Transformation:** The two single green cells (color 3) are considered agents.\n\n3. **Expansion to the sides**: The green color expand to the left and right side, taking cells of color 0.\n\n4. **Limit of Expansion**: This expansion continues horizontally until an azure color object (color 8) is encountered, acting as stopping object.\n\n5. **Row determination:** The expansion takes place in a single row which is given by averaging the row indices of the initial positions of the two green cells, that is (14+6)/2 = 6.\n\n**Python Implementation (Conceptual)**\nThe python code is not requested, I provide the analysis.\n"
