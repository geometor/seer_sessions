            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this third input/output pair, keeping in mind the previously developed rule and checking for any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Observations and Documentation (YAML)**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 15x15\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: scattered single cells and small clusters\n      notes: Acts as a boundary and seed for green expansion.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: background\n      notes: Fills most of the empty space.\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      shape: 1x2 block\n      position: (9, 1) and (9, 2)\n      notes: Remains static.\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: two adjacent cells\n      position: (5, 1) and (5, 2)\n      notes: Agents for transformation.\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 15x15\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      notes: Unchanged.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      notes: Unchanged.\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      notes: Unchanged.\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: Horizontal segments.\n      notes: Multiple expansions, each triggered by nearby azure and previous green positions.\n\n```\n\n**Determining the Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program)**\n\n1.  **Static Objects:** The red cells (color 2) and azure cells (color 8) remain in their initial configurations.\n\n2.  **Green Object Identification:** The two adjacent green cells (color 3) at (5, 1) and (5, 2) are the initial agents.\n\n3.  **Expansion Procedure Refinement:**\n    *   Calculate the average row index of the initial green pair: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5.\n    *   Find the closest azure cell (seed) *to the right* on this row (or the closest if no azure to the right). The closest is at (5, 8).\n    *   Expand green from this seed to the *left* until an azure cell or the grid boundary is hit.\n    *   The next expansions are a bit different. It seems new expansions don't just come from *pairs* of green cells, but from *any* green cells, and the expansion row can also be determined using an azure cell as reference. The next \"seed\" appears to be at (7,7) and (8,7), with row (6+9)/2.\n    *   In row 6, we have a new expansion to the left. In row 9, to the right.\n\n4. **Revised Expansion Summary**\nThe expansion algorithm is better explained as follows:\n   - Locate existing green objects.\n   - Compute average row indices between pairs of color 3 objects, or between color 3 objects and the closest color 8 to its right if only one object 3 is present.\n   - Use the closest azure seed *to the right* of the initial object 3 in that row (or simply the closest seed if no azure cells on that side)\n   - Expand from the azure seed to the left or to the right (or both) until reaching a border, or another color 8.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_object_positions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the positions of all cells with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return np.array(np.where(grid == color)).T\n\ndef find_closest_azure_seed(grid, row, start_col, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the closest azure cell in the specified row, starting from a given column and searching in a given direction.\n    \n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        row: The row to search.\n        start_col: start searching from this column\n        direction: 1 for right, -1 for left.\n\n    Returns: The position of the closest azure, or None.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if direction != 1 and direction != -1:\n        raise Exception(\"direction must be -1 (left) or +1 (right)\")\n\n    azure_positions = get_object_positions(grid, 8)\n    \n    if len(azure_positions) == 0 :\n        return None\n\n    azure_in_row = [pos for pos in azure_positions if pos[0] == row]\n    if not azure_in_row:\n        return None\n    \n    if direction == 1: # search to the right\n      \n      valid_azure = [pos for pos in azure_in_row if pos[1] > start_col]\n\n      if len(valid_azure) == 0: # no azure on the right, search closest\n          return min(azure_in_row, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[1] - start_col), default=None)\n\n      return min(valid_azure, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[1] - start_col), default=None)\n\n    else: # search to the left\n      valid_azure = [pos for pos in azure_in_row if pos[1] < start_col]\n\n      if len(valid_azure) == 0:  # no azure on the left, search closest\n            return min(azure_in_row, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[1] - start_col), default=None)\n      \n      return min(valid_azure, key=lambda pos: abs(pos[1] - start_col), default = None)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the final rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # 1.
