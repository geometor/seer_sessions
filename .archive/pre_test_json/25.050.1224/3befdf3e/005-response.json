            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this third example.\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 # Green\n      shape: rectangle\n      position: (3,2)\n      size: (4,4)\n      properties:\n        - Contains a 2x2 blue (1) square in the center.\n    - color: 1 # Blue\n      shape: rectangle\n      position: (4,3)\n      size: (2,2)\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3 # Green\n      shape:  \"cross-like\" or plus sign + surrounding cells. More complex\n      position: (1,2) #relative\n      size: (7,4) #approximate, the filled area\n      properties:\n        - Contains a larger, more complex blue shape within, resembling a hollow square/frame\n    - color: 1 # Blue\n      shape: hollow square or frame\n      position: (3,2)\n      size: (4,4) # Outer dimensions\n      properties:\n          - frame thickness: 1 cell\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the core objects:**\n    *   A 4x4 green (color 3) rectangle.\n    *   A 2x2 blue (color 1) square inside the green rectangle.\n\n2.  **Describe Object Interactions, Predicates and Actions:**\n    * The initial blue object expands. It becomes a hollow square shape or frame with the side length of 4. The inside cells are empty.\n    * The initial shape of the green expands vertically. The first and second lines are copied upwards by 1 cell. Additionally, a column on each side appear.\n    *  The green color appears in a more complex shape. The first line and the last line of the initial shape are moved up/down respectively by 1 cell. Then there are two cells on the left and two cells on the right of the initial shape that get the color 3.\n\n3.  **Transformation as Action:**\n    -  The blue object 'loses' its center cells and its shape. The object expands to a 4x4 frame (hollow inside).\n    - The green object changes in shape, similarly as in the previous example.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation consists of two actions: the blue square transforms into a hollow blue square with a frame and the green rectangle changes its shape, in a complex mode.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation consists of two actions: the blue square transforms into a hollow blue square with a frame and the green rectangle changes its shape, in a complex mode.\n\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find the blue object\n    blue_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 1:\n                blue_coords.append((r, c))\n\n    # Expand the blue object into hollow shape\n    if blue_coords:\n      min_br = min(r for r,c in blue_coords)\n      max_br = max(r for r,c in blue_coords)\n      min_bc = min(c for r,c in blue_coords)\n      max_bc = max(c for r,c in blue_coords)\n\n      for r in range(min_br -1, max_br+2):\n        for c in range(min_bc-1, max_bc + 2):\n          if 0<= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n            if r == min_br -1 or r == max_br + 1 or c == min_bc -1 or c == max_bc+1:\n              output_grid[r,c] = 1\n\n    # find green object\n    green_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r,c] == 3:\n              green_coords.append((r,c))\n    if green_coords:\n      min_gr = min(r for r, c in green_coords)\n      max_gr = max(r for r, c in green_coords)\n      min_gc = min(c for r, c in green_coords)\n      max_gc = max(c for r, c in green_coords)\n      # copy first and last rows\n      for c in range(min_gc, max_gc+1):\n        if min_gr > 0:\n            output_grid[min_gr-1, c] = 3\n        if max_gr < rows -1:\n            output_grid[max_gr+1,c] = 3\n      # add columns\n      for r in range(min_gr-1, max_gr + 2):\n          if 0 <= r < rows:\n              if min_bc>1:\n                  output_grid[r,min_bc-2] = 3\n              if max_bc < cols -2:\n                  output_grid[r,max_bc+2] = 3\n              if min_gc>0:\n                  output_grid[r,min_gc-1]=3\n              if max_gc < cols-1:\n                  output_grid[r, max_gc+1] = 3\n\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
