Okay, let's analyze this third example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 3 # Green
      shape: rectangle
      position: (3,2)
      size: (4,4)
      properties:
        - Contains a 2x2 blue (1) square in the center.
    - color: 1 # Blue
      shape: rectangle
      position: (4,3)
      size: (2,2)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 3 # Green
      shape:  "cross-like" or plus sign + surrounding cells. More complex
      position: (1,2) #relative
      size: (7,4) #approximate, the filled area
      properties:
        - Contains a larger, more complex blue shape within, resembling a hollow square/frame
    - color: 1 # Blue
      shape: hollow square or frame
      position: (3,2)
      size: (4,4) # Outer dimensions
      properties:
          - frame thickness: 1 cell

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the core objects:**
    *   A 4x4 green (color 3) rectangle.
    *   A 2x2 blue (color 1) square inside the green rectangle.

2.  **Describe Object Interactions, Predicates and Actions:**
    * The initial blue object expands. It becomes a hollow square shape or frame with the side length of 4. The inside cells are empty.
    * The initial shape of the green expands vertically. The first and second lines are copied upwards by 1 cell. Additionally, a column on each side appear.
    *  The green color appears in a more complex shape. The first line and the last line of the initial shape are moved up/down respectively by 1 cell. Then there are two cells on the left and two cells on the right of the initial shape that get the color 3.

3.  **Transformation as Action:**
    -  The blue object 'loses' its center cells and its shape. The object expands to a 4x4 frame (hollow inside).
    - The green object changes in shape, similarly as in the previous example.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation consists of two actions: the blue square transforms into a hollow blue square with a frame and the green rectangle changes its shape, in a complex mode.
