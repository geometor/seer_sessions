The colors are green (3), blue (1), and red (2), from left to right.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color according to a consistent rule, and the position of the colors are maintained.\n\n3. **Transformation rule**:\n    -   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).\n    -   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).\n    -   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).\n\nIn summary: every number is increased by one, except when it is bigger than 8.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe colors are changed according to a fixed color map. +1 is added to each color.\n"
