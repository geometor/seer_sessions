The colors are red (2), green (3), and azure (8), from left to right.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color, maintaining the column structure.\n\n3. **Transformation rule**:\n    -   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).\n    -   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).\n    -   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe transformation rule consists of adding a fixed number to the value of input pixel, the number depends on the value:\n- if the value is 2, add 4\n- if the value is 3, add 1\n- if the value is 8, add 1\n\nThis is a little bit more concise than the previous description. In the previous case, every number was added by one.\n\nHowever, it is clear that the general rule that applies to BOTH cases is that we need to apply color mapping (which is equivalent to adding a number which may depend on the input color).\n\nIt would be interesting to have a third example that combines some of the previous examples to ensure we got the rule right.\n"
