Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Columns:** The input grid consists of three distinct columns, each filled with a single color. The colors are green (3), blue (1), and red (2), from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color according to a consistent rule, and the position of the colors are maintained.

3. **Transformation rule**:
    -   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
    -   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
    -   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

In summary: every number is increased by one, except when it is bigger than 8.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The colors are changed according to a fixed color map. +1 is added to each color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
