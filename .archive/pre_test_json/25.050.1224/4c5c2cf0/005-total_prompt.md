Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2
      positions: [(3,3), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3)]
    yellow_objects:
      color: 4
      positions: [(7,6), (7,8), (9,6), (9,8)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

output_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2
      positions:  [(3,3), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (3,8), (3,11), (4,8), (4,10), (4,11), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,10), (7,11), (9,3), (9,11), (10,4), (10,5), (10,9), (10,10), (11,5), (11,6), (11,8), (11,9), (12,3),(12,6), (12,8), (12,10), (12,11), (13,3), (13,6), (13,8), (13,11)]
    yellow_objects:
      color: 4
      positions: [(7,6), (7,8), (9,6), (9,8)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of red (color 2) objects, yellow (color 4) objects, and a background of white (color 0) cells.

2. **Yellow Object Invariance:** The yellow objects do not change their positions or quantity between the input and output. These are likely not a crucial part of the transformation and should not be changed.

3.  **Red Object Expansion:** The core transformation lies in the alteration of the red objects. It is neither simple translation, reflection nor rotation. If we look closely, there are additional red cells created around a copy of the original red cells.

4. **Mirroring and Superposition:**
    *   Copy the structure created by the initial set of red cells.
    *   Mirror it horizontally.
    *   Superpose the mirrored version on the initial structure with the constraint of a spacing of two cells.
    *   Some initial and new red cells might overlap.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation involves making a horizontally mirrored copy of red structure, with an offset, and adding it to the output. The yellow structure remains invariant.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for this second example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      color: 8
      positions: [(3,8), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]
    green_objects:
      color: 3
      positions: [(6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

output_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      color: 8
      positions: [(3,2), (3,8), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (11,2), (11,8)]
    green_objects:
      color: 3
      positions: [(6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (color 8) objects, green (color 3) objects, and a background of white (color 0) cells.

2.  **Green Object Invariance:** The green objects do not change their positions or quantity between the input and output. They are not part of the main transformation.

3.  **Azure Object Transformation:** The transformation involves modification of the azure objects.

4.  **Duplication and Vertical Reflection:**
    *   Copy the structure defined by the original set of azure cells.
    *   Duplicate this copy, mirroring it vertically with respect to the horizontal axis of the approximate center of the shape made by green cells.
    *   Superpose the mirrored azure shape with the original one, with a vertical offset that places the copy centered below the green shape.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation involves taking the azure structure, creating a vertically mirrored copy of it, and adding this copy to the output grid, positioning it according to the horizontal center of the green shape. The green objects remain invariant.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
