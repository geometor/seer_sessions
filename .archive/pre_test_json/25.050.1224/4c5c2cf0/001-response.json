These are likely not a crucial part of the transformation and should not be changed.\n\n3.  **Red Object Expansion:** The core transformation lies in the alteration of the red objects. It is neither simple translation, reflection nor rotation. If we look closely, there are additional red cells created around a copy of the original red cells.\n\n4. **Mirroring and Superposition:**\n    *   Copy the structure created by the initial set of red cells.\n    *   Mirror it horizontally.\n    *   Superpose the mirrored version on the initial structure with the constraint of a spacing of two cells.\n    *   Some initial and new red cells might overlap.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe transformation involves making a horizontally mirrored copy of red structure, with an offset, and adding it to the output. The yellow structure remains invariant.\n\n"
