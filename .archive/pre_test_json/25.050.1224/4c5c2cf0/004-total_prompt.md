Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2
      positions: [(3,3), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3)]
    yellow_objects:
      color: 4
      positions: [(7,6), (7,8), (9,6), (9,8)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

output_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2
      positions:  [(3,3), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (3,8), (3,11), (4,8), (4,10), (4,11), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,10), (7,11), (9,3), (9,11), (10,4), (10,5), (10,9), (10,10), (11,5), (11,6), (11,8), (11,9), (12,3),(12,6), (12,8), (12,10), (12,11), (13,3), (13,6), (13,8), (13,11)]
    yellow_objects:
      color: 4
      positions: [(7,6), (7,8), (9,6), (9,8)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of red (color 2) objects, yellow (color 4) objects, and a background of white (color 0) cells.

2. **Yellow Object Invariance:** The yellow objects do not change their positions or quantity between the input and output. These are likely not a crucial part of the transformation and should not be changed.

3.  **Red Object Expansion:** The core transformation lies in the alteration of the red objects. It is neither simple translation, reflection nor rotation. If we look closely, there are additional red cells created around a copy of the original red cells.

4. **Mirroring and Superposition:**
    *   Copy the structure created by the initial set of red cells.
    *   Mirror it horizontally.
    *   Superpose the mirrored version on the initial structure with the constraint of a spacing of two cells.
    *   Some initial and new red cells might overlap.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation involves making a horizontally mirrored copy of red structure, with an offset, and adding it to the output. The yellow structure remains invariant.

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid

    # Get the positions of red and yellow objects
    red_objects = get_objects_by_color(input_grid, 2)

    # Yellow objects remain the same, so no action needed

    # Mirror the red objects horizontally and add to output grid
    if (len(red_objects) > 0):
      max_x = max(obj[1] for obj in red_objects)
      min_x = min(obj[1] for obj in red_objects)

      for obj in red_objects:
         # Calculate offset to the right based on the shape
          new_x = obj[1] + 2 * (max_x - obj[1] + 1) # obj[1] is column (x) and obj[0] is row(y)
          output_grid[obj[0], new_x] = 2

      # Add a second mirrow, this time to the left
      for obj in red_objects:
          new_x = obj[1] - 2 * (obj[1] - min_x  + 1)
          if (new_x >= 0):
            output_grid[obj[0], new_x] = 2

    return output_grid

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for this second example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      color: 8
      positions: [(3,8), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]
    green_objects:
      color: 3
      positions: [(6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

output_grid:
  dimensions: [14, 14]
  objects:
    azure_objects:
      color: 8
      positions: [(3,2), (3,8), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), (11,2), (11,8)]
    green_objects:
      color: 3
      positions: [(6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6)]
    background:
      color: 0
      positions: "all cells not occupied by other objects"

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (color 8) objects, green (color 3) objects, and a background of white (color 0) cells.

2.  **Green Object Invariance:** The green objects do not change their positions or quantity between the input and output. They are not part of the main transformation.

3.  **Azure Object Transformation:** The transformation involves modification of the azure objects.

4.  **Duplication and Vertical Reflection:**
    *   Copy the structure defined by the original set of azure cells.
    *   Duplicate this copy, mirroring it vertically with respect to the horizontal axis of the approximate center of the shape made by green cells.
    *   Superpose the mirrored azure shape with the original one, with a vertical offset that places the copy centered below the green shape.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation involves taking the azure structure, creating a vertically mirrored copy of it, and adding this copy to the output grid, positioning it according to the horizontal center of the green shape. The green objects remain invariant.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
