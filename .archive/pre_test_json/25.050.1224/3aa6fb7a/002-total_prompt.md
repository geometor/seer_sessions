Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure blocks.
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure blocks. Same as the input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: 1x1 blocks
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 2x1 block on the left, the other an horizontal 1x2 block on the right.

2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing to the output grid we see that azure objects are mantained, and we also observe that that a blue pixel (color 1) appears in output just on the right of isolated azure pixel.

3. **Transformation rule:**
    Change to blue the pixel at the right of each isolated azure pixel.
    An isolated azure pixel is any azure pixel having only azure neighbours on its left.

**Elaboration of Reasoning**

The core of the transformation lies in identifying the isolated azure pixels and change to blue the pixels in the positions to their right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
