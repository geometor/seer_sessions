Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several isolated azure pixels and some 1x2 blocks, both horizontal and vertical.
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Exactly the same as input_grid.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: 1x1 blocks (single pixels).
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid primarily contains azure (color 8) pixels, existing as both single isolated pixels and small blocks.

2.  **Transformation Rule:** Examine each azure (color 8) pixel. If an azure pixel has only azure neighbors to its left, change the pixel immediately to the right of it to blue (color 1).
  If the azure pixel is at the extreme right, do nothing.

3. **Elaboration:**
    We iterate to apply the rule to each of isolated azure pixels.

**Python Implementation**

The provided Python code from the previous response already implements this logic correctly.  The `transform` function and `get_neighbors` correctly identify the "isolated azure pixels" and adds a blue pixel to their right. We can reuse the same function.
