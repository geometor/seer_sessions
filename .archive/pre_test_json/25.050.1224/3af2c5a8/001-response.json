The width is multiplied by 2 (4 * 2 = 8), and the height by 2 (3 * 2 = 6) resulting in an output that is doubled in size.\n\n3. **Replication**: The shape made by the azure colored pixels in the input is preserved, every '8' pixel from input is kept in the output.\n\n4. **Fill**: The positions that were previously 0 in the input are maintained as 0 after replication. The expanded layout is respected.\n\n**Elaboration**\n\nThe transformation rule is essentially a scaling operation. It's a combination of duplication and expansion, with the core azure shape being preserved and enlarged, and the empty spaces scaling accordingly.\n\n"
