The movement is influenced by rows containing blue and red cells. Azure objects are shifted to rows with both blue and red cells.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8), blue (1), and red (2) colored objects in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Determine Target Rows:**\n    *   Identify rows that contain *both* blue (1) and red (2) colored objects.\n\n3.  **Move Azure Objects:**\n    *   Move *all* azure (8) objects from the entire grid to the rows identified in step 2.\n    *   The azure objects are placed to fill the identified row(s) starting from the leftmost available position.\n    * The shape is not preserved.\n\n4.  Other objects are not moved, except for azure objects that have been moved to the target row.\n\n**Elaboration and Edge Cases**\n\n*   If there are multiple target rows (containing both blue and red), the azure objects are placed on these rows, starting from the top and moving down.\n*   The azure objects lose their original shape and are placed individually in the new locations.\n\nThis natural language program accurately describes the transformation, explaining how the presence of both blue and red objects in a row dictates the relocation of all azure objects to those rows.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule involves moving azure (color 8) objects.
