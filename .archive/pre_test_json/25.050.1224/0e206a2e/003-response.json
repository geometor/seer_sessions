Other objects remain in their initial cell, except green object.\n\n**Elaboration and Edge Cases**\n- The connectivity between original green objects needs to be considered.\n- If more green cells than available columns exists, additional greens use columns with lower index.\n\nThis natural language program tries to capture the observed transformation. It provides the actions for the green objects.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation this time consolidates green (color 3) objects to the bottom right, influenced by rows that contains blue color (1).\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all green (3) and blue(1) objects within the input grid.\n\n2. **Iterate**:\n  + Consider each row where blue cell exist.\n  + find the green objects in the input.\n\n3.  **Consolidate green:**\n    +   All green objects in the grid are moved and combined to the most-bottom right position in the rows where blue cell(s) exist, preserving connectivity and extending to adjacent rows if needed.\n    +   The moving of green objects only affect to row(s) with blue object(s).\n    + The shape tries to maintain the horizontal shape.\n    + The shape will fill the lower index columns in case of overflow.\n\n4.
