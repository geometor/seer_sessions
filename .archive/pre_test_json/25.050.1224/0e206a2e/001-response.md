Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions: [[2,3], [3,2], [3,4], [7,7], [8,7], [8,8], [9,7], [10,1]]
      shapes: [single cell, L-shape, single cell, line, rectangle, line, line]
    - color: 1 # Blue
      positions: [[2, 4], [10, 7], [4, 16]]
      shapes: [single cell, single cell, single cell]
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [[3, 3], [2, 15]]
    - color: 3 # Green
      positions: [[2, 2], [4, 13], [12, 2], [7, 7]]
      shapes: [single cell, single cell, single cell, single cell]

output_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions:  [[2, 14], [3, 15], [2, 16], [4, 14], [4, 15], [10,1], [11,3], [4,13]]
      shapes: [L-shape, single cell, line, single cell, single cell, single cell ]
    - color: 1 # Blue
      positions: [[9, 2], [4, 17]]
      shapes: [single cell, single cell]
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [[2, 15]]
    - color: 3 # Green
      positions: [[12, 2], [4, 13]]
      shapes: [single cell, single cell]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to involve moving azure (color 8) objects, influenced by blue (color 1) objects if present in the row. Azure (8) moves to the rightmost open position in the same row. 

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and blue (1) colored objects in the input grid.

2. **Iterate**:
  + Consider each row where blue cell exist.
  + find the azure objects in this row.

3.  **Move Azure Objects:** For each azure object in rows with at least a blue cell.
    +   Move that object to the right side of the grid, immediately to the left of the rightmost non-zero element.
    + For connected azure objects, perform the displacement for all of them, maintaining their original shape.

4. Other colors remain in their cells.

**Elaboration and Edge Cases**
- If there are no other element different to '0' in the row, put the azure element(s) in the column(s) most to the right.
- If there are any azure elements in the same row, concatenate them in one shape.

This natural language program captures the observed transformation. It specifies the predicates (azure object, and blue) and the actions to the azure cells, and maintaining their original shape.
