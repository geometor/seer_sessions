**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to involve moving azure (color 8) objects, influenced by blue (color 1) objects if present in the row. Azure (8) moves to the rightmost open position in the same row. 

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and blue (1) colored objects in the input grid.

2. **Iterate**:
  + Consider each row where blue cell exist.
  + find the azure objects in this row.

3.  **Move Azure Objects:** For each azure object in rows with at least a blue cell.
    +   Move that object to the right side of the grid, immediately to the left of the rightmost non-zero element.
    + For connected azure objects, perform the displacement for all of them, maintaining their original shape.

4. Other colors remain in their cells.

**Elaboration and Edge Cases**
- If there are no other element different to '0' in the row, put the azure element(s) in the column(s) most to the right.
- If there are any azure elements in the same row, concatenate them in one shape.

This natural language program captures the observed transformation. It specifies the predicates (azure object, and blue) and the actions to the azure cells, and maintaining their original shape.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation this time consolidates green (color 3) objects to the bottom right, influenced by rows that contains blue color (1).

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all green (3) and blue(1) objects within the input grid.

2. **Iterate**:
  + Consider each row where blue cell exist.
  + find the green objects in the input.

3.  **Consolidate green:**
    +   All green objects in the grid are moved and combined to the most-bottom right position in the rows where blue cell(s) exist, preserving connectivity and extending to adjacent rows if needed.
    +   The moving of green objects only affect to row(s) with blue object(s).
    + The shape tries to maintain the horizontal shape.
    + The shape will fill the lower index columns in case of overflow.

4. Other objects remain in their initial cell, except green object.

**Elaboration and Edge Cases**
- The connectivity between original green objects needs to be considered.
- If more green cells than available columns exists, additional greens use columns with lower index.

This natural language program tries to capture the observed transformation. It provides the actions for the green objects.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions: [[3, 5], [3, 9], [4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 8], [4, 10], [5, 9]]
    - color: 1 # Blue
      positions: [[4, 5], [11, 1]]
    - color: 2 # Red
      positions: [[4, 9], [11, 5]]
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [[2, 9], [13, 5]]

output_observations:
  objects:
    - color: 8 # Azure
      positions: [[12, 2], [12, 3], [12, 4], [12, 6], [11,5], [10,5], [12,1]]
      shapes: []
    - color: 1 # Blue
      positions: [[11, 1]]
    - color: 2 # Red
      positions: [[11, 5]]
     - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [[13, 5]]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule involves moving azure (color 8) objects. The movement is influenced by rows containing blue and red cells. Azure objects are shifted to rows with both blue and red cells.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8), blue (1), and red (2) colored objects in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Target Rows:**
    *   Identify rows that contain *both* blue (1) and red (2) colored objects.

3.  **Move Azure Objects:**
    *   Move *all* azure (8) objects from the entire grid to the rows identified in step 2.
    *   The azure objects are placed to fill the identified row(s) starting from the leftmost available position.
    * The shape is not preserved.

4.  Other objects are not moved, except for azure objects that have been moved to the target row.

**Elaboration and Edge Cases**

*   If there are multiple target rows (containing both blue and red), the azure objects are placed on these rows, starting from the top and moving down.
*   The azure objects lose their original shape and are placed individually in the new locations.

This natural language program accurately describes the transformation, explaining how the presence of both blue and red objects in a row dictates the relocation of all azure objects to those rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
