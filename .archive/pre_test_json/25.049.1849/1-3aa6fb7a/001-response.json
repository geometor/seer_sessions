Here's my breakdown:\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]\n      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangle and one 1x2.\n    - color: 0\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]\n      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangle and one 1x2.\n    - color: 1\n      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]\n      shape: Single cells\n    - color: 0\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a natural language description of the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify all occurrences of color 8 (azure). There are two separate constructions with this color.\n\n2.  **Locate the first object of color 8 at the top left corner**. Let's suppose they are numbered 1 and 2 (from top left).\n\n3. **Insert color 1:** For object 1, the insertion will occur at it's right. For object 2, the insertion will occur at its left.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other cells in the input grid (color 0) remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe transformation identifies objects of color 8. If the object has color 8, insert color 1 in the next position. If there are multiple objects made with color 8, insert at left and right, according to their position, starting from top left.\n"
