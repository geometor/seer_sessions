Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4),(6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Three separate objects. Two 2x1 and one 1x2 rectangle.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4),(6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Three separate objects. Two 2x1 and one 1x2 rectangle.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3),(5,3)]
      shape: Single cells
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a natural language description of the step-by-step transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify all occurrences of color 8 (azure). There are three separate constructions with this color.

2.  **Locate the objects of color 8.** Let's order them from top to bottom, and from left to right, as they would appear when reading.

3.  **Insert color 1:** For objects 1 and 3, insertion of color 1 occurs in the cell to the left of the top-left cell of the object. For object 2, the insertion of color 1 occurs in the cell to the right of the top-left cell of the object.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other cells in the input grid (color 0) remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation process can be expressed as a general rule that is consistent with what was outlined for the previous example, and thus a good candidate for being the solution:

The transformation identifies objects of color 8. If the object has color 8, insert color 1 in the next position. If there are multiple objects made with color 8, insert at left and right, according to their position, starting from top left.
