Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangle and one 1x2.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangle and one 1x2.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: Single cells
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a natural language description of the step-by-step transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify all occurrences of color 8 (azure). There are two separate constructions with this color.

2.  **Locate the first object of color 8 at the top left corner**. Let's suppose they are numbered 1 and 2 (from top left).

3. **Insert color 1:** For object 1, the insertion will occur at it's right. For object 2, the insertion will occur at its left.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other cells in the input grid (color 0) remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation identifies objects of color 8. If the object has color 8, insert color 1 in the next position. If there are multiple objects made with color 8, insert at left and right, according to their position, starting from top left.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
