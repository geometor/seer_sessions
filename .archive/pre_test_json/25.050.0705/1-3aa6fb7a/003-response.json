The change occurs through the addition of three blue pixels.\n\n3. **Pinpoint blue change:**\n\n    *   For each azure \"L\" shaped object add a blue pixel immediately to the left or to the right of the corner pixel forming the L, if available. The selection criterion between available empty space to the left and right is not specified and we have to consider either option valid.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe rule is consistent with the previous example.\n\nThe azure L-shaped objects are unchanged. Blue pixels (color 1) are added, if possible, horizontally adjacent (left/right) to the *corner* azure pixels belonging to an L-shaped structure.\n\nThe provided python program implements this rule and I don't see the need to change it.\n"
