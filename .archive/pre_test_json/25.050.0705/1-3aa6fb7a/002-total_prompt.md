Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate azure 'L' shapes.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate azure 'L' shapes.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single blue pixels.
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Detect Change:** The azure objects are the same in the input and the output. The change are two blue pixels.

3. **Pinpoint blue change:**
     - Add a blue pixel to the right of the top left azure pixel.
     - Add a blue pixel to the left of the bottom right azure pixel.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The azure L-shaped objects are unchanged. Blue pixels (color 1) are added, if possible, horizontally adjacent (left/right) to azure pixels belonging to an L-shaped structure, where such addition does not change the overall L shape of the object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
