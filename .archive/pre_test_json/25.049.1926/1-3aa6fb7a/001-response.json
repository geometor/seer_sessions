One is a 2x1 vertical shape next to another 1x1 square (or another 2x1 vertical shape, when considering it next to the square). Another component is a shape with two azure colored pixels placed one above the other making a 2x1 vertical line.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is on the left made of 3 pixels. One is on the right made of 3 pixels.\n\n2.  **Change to Blue the Top-Right Pixel of Azure Objects:**\n    It seems that the input changed to blue (color 1) the top-right pixel of each object.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as: Find every separated figure colored in azure. Find the top-right pixel of this object. Convert this pixel to blue.\n\n"
