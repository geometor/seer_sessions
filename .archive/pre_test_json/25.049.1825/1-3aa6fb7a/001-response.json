For each azure object, locate the azure color cell that is highest and furthest to the right. Change the color of this cell from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue).\n\n**Explanation of the Program**\nThe program identifies the azure objects. Then the program keeps every azure object the same with regard to shape size and position. Finally, the program modifies these original azure objects by taking only one cell of each shape and changing that cell's color from azure to blue. The single cell of the azure object that is changed is always the cell that is highest (smallest row index) and furthest right (largest column index).\n"
