For each azure object, locate the azure color cell that is highest and furthest to the *left*. Change the color of this cell from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue).\n\n**Explanation of the Program**\n\nThe logic is almost identical to the previous example, with a key difference in the cell selection criteria for color change. The program identifies the azure objects, preserves all existing azure objects without modification, and then, for each distinct azure object, changes *only one* azure (8) cell to blue (1). The critical difference is that this time, the cell chosen within each object is the one that is highest (smallest row index) and furthest to the *left* (smallest column index), rather than the right.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all objects (contiguous regions) of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The shape, size, and location of all azure colored objects are kept the same in the output grid.\n3.  **Change color to blue:** Go over the cells of the azure objects one by one, starting from top to bottom.

Specifically, within the `transform` function,  the condition `col > top_right_cell[1]` is now `col < top_left_cell[1]` inside the inner loop, and variable is renamed `top_left_cell`. This ensures that the *leftmost* cell is chosen, fulfilling the new rule.\n"
