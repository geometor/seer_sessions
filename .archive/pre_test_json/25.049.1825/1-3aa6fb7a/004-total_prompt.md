Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and 2x1 L shape.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and 2x1 L shape.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2),(5,4)]
      shape: single cells

  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all objects (contiguous regions) of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Keep the shape, size, and location of all azure colored object the same in the output grid.
3.  **Change color to blue:** Go over the cells of the azure objects one by one starting from top to bottom. For each azure object, locate the azure color cell that is highest and furthest to the right. Change the color of this cell from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue).

**Explanation of the Program**
The program identifies the azure objects. Then the program keeps every azure object the same with regard to shape size and position. Finally, the program modifies these original azure objects by taking only one cell of each shape and changing that cell's color from azure to blue. The single cell of the azure object that is changed is always the cell that is highest (smallest row index) and furthest right (largest column index).

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the new input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Various shapes including a 2x1 vertical, and others
  dimensions: 7x7

    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: Single cells
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all objects (contiguous regions) of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The shape, size, and location of all azure colored objects are kept the same in the output grid.
3.  **Change color to blue:** Go over the cells of the azure objects one by one, starting from top to bottom. For each azure object, locate the azure color cell that is highest and furthest to the *left*. Change the color of this cell from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue).

**Explanation of the Program**

The logic is almost identical to the previous example, with a key difference in the cell selection criteria for color change. The program identifies the azure objects, preserves all existing azure objects without modification, and then, for each distinct azure object, changes *only one* azure (8) cell to blue (1). The critical difference is that this time, the cell chosen within each object is the one that is highest (smallest row index) and furthest to the *left* (smallest column index), rather than the right.

        # Change the color of the top-left cell to blue (1)
        output_grid[top_left_cell] = 1

    return output_grid
```

The Python code is updated to reflect this change in the selection criteria. Specifically, within the `transform` function,  the condition `col > top_right_cell[1]` is now `col < top_left_cell[1]` inside the inner loop, and variable is renamed `top_left_cell`. This ensures that the *leftmost* cell is chosen, fulfilling the new rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
