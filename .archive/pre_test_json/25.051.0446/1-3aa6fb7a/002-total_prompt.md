Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:

```yaml
task: 000-example_1
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background_color: 0 (white)
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
  background_color: 0 (white)

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, there are two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Preserve Objects:** Both azure L-shaped objects are preserved in their original positions and shapes in the output grid.
3. **Insert new objects:** Examine each "leg" of the L-shaped object, insert a blue (1) pixel, on each leg, located 1 cell away from the "elbow" of each L.

**Natural Language Program**
The L shapes of azure color are kept, and in each "corner" a blue pixel is created, inside the L-shape, at a Manhattan distance of 1 of the meeting of the two segments of the L.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
