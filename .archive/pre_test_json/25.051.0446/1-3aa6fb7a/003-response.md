Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
task: 002-example_2
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated, inverted)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
  background_color: 0 (white)
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated, inverted)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,4], [2,3], [5,3]]
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**
The exact same logic from the first example applies here.

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, there are three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Preserve Objects:** The three azure L-shaped objects are preserved in their original positions and shapes in the output grid.

3.  **Insert new objects:** A blue (1) pixel is inserted inside each L-shape, specifically at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the "elbow" of each L on each branch.

**Natural Language Program**
The L shapes of azure color are kept, and in each "corner" or "elbow" a blue pixel is inserted at the cells adjacent to the elbow in the direction of each leg.

The Python code provided in the previous response will correctly handle this case, too, because it correctly detects the L shapes and their elbows, and inserts the blue pixels as described in the rule. There's no need to modify the code.
