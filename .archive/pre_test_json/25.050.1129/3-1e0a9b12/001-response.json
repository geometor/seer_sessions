The new position will have this cell moved the the last row.\n\n3.  **Preserve Color and Order, relative position:** The color of each moved cell is maintained. Also, the x coordinate of the cells are preserved.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n1. Find all cells where the value is not 0.\n2. Move all non-zero cells the the last row of the grid.\n3. Change the position of the cell without modifying the original column.\n"
