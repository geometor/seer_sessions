Find all non-zero cells within the input grid.\n2.  Move these non-zero cells to the last rows of the grid. Start filling from the last row and continue upwards.\n3.  Ensure that moved cells retain their original color and their horizontal position (column index).\n\nThe Python code provided and updated in the previous step should accurately handle this transformation. No changes are needed.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nMoves all non-zero colored cells to the bottom rows of the grid,\npreserving their original column and color, filling the rows from bottom to top.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving non-zero cells to the bottom rows.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid.\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Clear the last row to prepare to move the non-zero cells.\n    # The last rows will be filled with the input cells with non-zero values, from bottom to top.\n    output_grid[:, :] = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each column.\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Find the non-zero elements in the current column.\n        non_zero_elements = []\n        for i in range(rows):\n           if input_grid[i,j] != 0:\n              non_zero_elements.append(input_grid[i,j])\n        \n        # Move last non-zero values to the last rows.\n        for i, value in enumerate(reversed(non_zero_elements)):\n           output_grid[rows-1-i, j] = value\n           \n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
