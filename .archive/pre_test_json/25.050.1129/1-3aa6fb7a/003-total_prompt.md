Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single-pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical block on the left, and another is a 1x2 object at the right.

2.  **Detect corner/border:** We find the pixel to the right of the top-most pixel of the first object and replace it with a blue pixel.

3.  **Detect corner/border:** We find the pixel to the left the bottom-most pixel of the second object and replace it with a blue pixel.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, remain unchanged.

In summary, the azure objects are preserved with blue (1) markers identifying corners defined according to the rules.

```python
"""
The transformation preserves two azure (color 8) objects from the input grid to the output grid.
It adds a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of the top-most pixel of the leftmost azure object, and another blue pixel to the left of the bottom-most pixel of the rightmost azure object.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
