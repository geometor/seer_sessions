It seems, again, we increment by adding +4. Let's check the first guess.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**  The structure is identical to the previous example: three columns, each a single color. The colors are red (2), green (3), and azure (8).\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:**\n\n    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).\n    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).\n    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).\n\n    This shows that the general form of the rule is the same, a color change\n    depending on the original number.\n    new color = old color + 4\n\n3. **Preservation of Structure:** Once again, the shape and location are the same.\n\n**Summary**\nThe rule consists on increasing the value associated to each color by 4, except for the 1 which is increased by 5-1=4, 2 which is increased by 6-2=4, 3 that becomes 3+1=4 and 8 that becomes 9.\n\nIt can be simplified by adding +4 and taking modulo 10:\n`new_color = (old_color + 4) % 10`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n      for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n        output_grid[i,j] = (input_grid[i,j] + 4) % 10\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
