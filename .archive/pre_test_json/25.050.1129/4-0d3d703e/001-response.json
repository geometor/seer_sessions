Note that here the colors jump from 1 (blue) to 5 (grey). This suggests that the transformation considers a modulo 10 of the input +1.\n    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).\n    *  In essence: new color = old color + 1 (+3 if old color = 1)\n\n3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The spatial arrangement and shape of the objects (the three columns) remain identical between the input and output. Only the colors change.\n\n**Summary**\nThe rule consists on increasing the value associated to each color.\nIf the input value is 1, the output value is 5.\nOtherwise, the output value is the input value + 1.\n"
