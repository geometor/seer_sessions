This is our primary object.\n\n2.  **Substitution 1:** Every cell to the rigth of the central vertical axis of the object, that have color 5 is transformed to color 8.\n\n3. **Substitution 2**: Every cell to the left of the central vertical axis of the object, that have color 5 is transformed to color 2.\n\n**Explanation and Justification**\n\nThis time, the transformation uses the central vertical axis of object 5 as reference. Every cell in object 5 at each side of the central axis is changed to a different color. The cells at the right are changed to 8 and the cells to the left are changed to 2.\n"
