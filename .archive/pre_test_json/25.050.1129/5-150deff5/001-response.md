Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular
      position: centered
      size: 15
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid
      size: remaining cells
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: approximate copy of the input object with color 5
      position: approximately the same position
      size: approximately the same size.
    - color: 2
      shape: approximate negative of the input object with color 5
      position: inside the first color 8 object.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid
      size: remaining cells

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the contiguous region of color '5' (gray) in the input grid. This is our primary object.

2.  **Substitution 1:** Change all the cells of color 5 by color 8.

3.  **Substitution 2:** Every cell with value 0 and inside the object 1 (that is, surrounded by color 8 objects) will turn into color 2.

**Explanation and Justification**
The transformation performs substitutions, changing color 5 to color 8 and some internal cells to color 2.
