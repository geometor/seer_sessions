Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  grid_size: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: cross shape, centered around red object, distance of 1 cell in cardinal directions.
    - color: 7 # Orange
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: cross shape, centered around blue object, distance of 1 cell in cardinal directions.
  grid_size: (9, 9)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the single red (color 2) cell and the single blue (color 1) cell in the input grid. These are our primary objects.

2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The red and blue cells remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.

3.  **Create Yellow Cross:** For the red cell:
    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position above.
    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position below.
    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the left.
    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the right.

4.  **Create Orange Cross:** For the blue cell:
    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position above.
    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position below.
    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the left.
    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the right.

5. **Fill the remaining cells:** keep them as color 0 (white, background)

In essence, the transformation creates a cross-shaped pattern of a specific color around each of the initially present, single-cell colored objects (red and blue), while keeping the original cells unchanged. The surrounding colors are different for red and blue.

```python
"""
The transformation identifies single red (2) and blue (1) cells in the input grid.
It preserves these cells in the output. A yellow (4) cross is created around the red cell,
and an orange (7) cross is created around the blue cell. The crosses are formed by placing
the respective colors one cell away in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
