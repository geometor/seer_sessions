Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,2]
          - top_left: [4,4]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8 or 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). These objects are 2x1 rectangles. One is located at the top-left corner (1, 1), and the second at position (3,4).

2.  **Detect Changes**: Comparing the input and output, we can see that a color 1 (blue) cell has been added to the right of the top rectangle (at [1,2]). We can see that the other color 1 (blue) cell is added to the left of the bottom rectangle (at [4,4]).

3. **Transformation Rule:**
    -   For the top azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right of the rectangle.
    -   For the bottom azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left of the rectangle.

**Summary**

The program identifies each 2x1 azure rectangle. For the topmost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right. For the bottommost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left.
