Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,2]
          - top_left: [4,4]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8 or 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). These objects are 2x1 rectangles. One is located at the top-left corner (1, 1), and the second at position (3,4).

2.  **Detect Changes**: Comparing the input and output, we can see that a color 1 (blue) cell has been added to the right of the top rectangle (at [1,2]). We can see that the other color 1 (blue) cell is added to the left of the bottom rectangle (at [4,4]).

3. **Transformation Rule:**
    -   For the top azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right of the rectangle.
    -   For the bottom azure rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left of the rectangle.

**Summary**

The program identifies each 2x1 azure rectangle. For the topmost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate right. For the bottommost rectangle, add a blue cell to the immediate left.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles and one single cell
        positions:
          - top_left: [0,4]
          - top_left: [2,2]
          - top_left: [3,2]
          - top_left: [6,3]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: three separate 2x1 rectangles and one single cell
        positions:
          - top_left: [0,4]
          - top_left: [2,2]
          - top_left: [3,2]
          - top_left: [6,3]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,4]
          - top_left: [2,3]
          - top_left: [5,3]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions:
          - all cells not occupied by color 8 or 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have four distinct objects of color 8 (azure). There are three objects which are 2x1 rectangles, and one single azure cell.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Comparing the input and output, three color 1 (blue) cells appear next to the three azure 2x1 rectangles.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Iterate through each 2x1 azure rectangle.
    *   For the top-most 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue cell to its immediate left.
    *   For the second and third 2x1 azure rectangle, starting from the top, add a blue cell to the right for the first, and a blue cell to the left for the next.

**Summary**

The program identifies each 2x1 azure rectangle. The blue cell is placed to the left of the top-most rectangle. Then, it processes the following rectangles, placing a blue cell to the right of the second top-most rectangle, and a blue cell to the left of the next rectangle.
It does nothing with the single azure cell.

This natural language program aligns perfectly with the provided Python code and accurately captures the transformation logic.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
