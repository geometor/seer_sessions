These serve as reference points.\n\n2.  **Yellow Replication:** Two rows above the red cell, place two yellow (color 4) cells. These cells are horizontally spaced two cells apart, with one vertically aligned with the red cell and the other two cells to its right in the example provided.\n   Two rows above *that*, place two yellow (color 4) cells, with the same relative postions to each other.\n\n3. **Orange Extension:** The blue pixel is extended with orange. The single blue cell (color 1) transforms into a cluster of orange (color 7) cells. Specifically, in the output, we place an orange cell to the left, to the right and below the blue cell.\n\n**Complete Description**\n\nThe transformation involves using the red and blue cells in the input as anchor points to create new colored cells in the output. Yellow cells are placed relative to the red cell, and orange cells cluster around the blue cell, replacing the single blue cell. The positions of the original red and blue are unchanged.\n"
