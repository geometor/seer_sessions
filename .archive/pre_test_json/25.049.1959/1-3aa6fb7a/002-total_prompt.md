Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1) # Top-left cell of the object
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4) # Top-left cell of the object
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (1,1)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (3,4)
     - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Detect Change:** One cell of color 1 (blue) has been added, connected to the top right side, to each of the L-shaped object of the input.

3. **Transformation Rule:** It fills with color 1 the cell at north-east position, considering the most western cell of each azure shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
