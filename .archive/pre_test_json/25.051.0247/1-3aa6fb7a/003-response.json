The rest is white background (color 0).\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The three azure objects are copied to the output grid without changes in shape or position.\n\n3.  **Place Blue next to objects:**\n    *   For each azure object, a blue cell is placed directly next to it.\n    *   If the object is on the left side, the blue pixel is added to the right side, in the middle of the object height.\n    *   If the object is on the right side, the blue pixel is added to the left side, in the middle of the object height.\n\n4.  **Background remains:** The rest of the background is unchanged.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation (Summarized):**\n1.  Copy azure objects.\n2.  Add a blue cell next to the azure objects depending on their relative position.\n3. The white background remains the same.\n\nThe provided Python code correctly implements this logic by:\n1. Copying the input to the output grid.\n2. Finding each object in the input grid.\n3. Determining their position.\n4. Placing the blue pixel depending on the object's relative position in the grid.\n"
