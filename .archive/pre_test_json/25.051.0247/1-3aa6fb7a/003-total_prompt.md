Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      position: 
        - One rectangle at (row 1, col 1) and (row 2, col 1)
        - One rectangle at (row 3, col 4) and (row 4, col 4)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

  output_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      position: Same as in the input
        - One rectangle at (row 1, col 1) and (row 2, col 1)
        - One rectangle at (row 3, col 4) and (row 4, col 4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: two single cells.
      position:
        - One cell at (row 1, col 2) directly to the right of the first azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 4, col 5) directly to the left of the second azure rectangle
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle. The remaining cells are white (color 0), forming the background.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The two azure rectangles remain unchanged in their position and shape in the output grid.

3. **Place Blue next to objects:** 
    For the azure object on the left side of the grid, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object right border, in the middle of the object y axis.
    For the azure object on the right side, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object left border, in the middle of the object y axis.

4. **Background remains:** The rest of the background color is unchanged.

**Step-by-step transformation:**

1.  Copy the two azure rectangles from the input to the output grid.
2.  Locate the azure rectangle on the left. Add a blue cell to its immediate right in the middle of the object height.
3.  Locate the azure rectangle on the right. Add a blue cell to its immediate left in the middle of the object height.
4.  The white background remains the same.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the two azure (color 8) 2x1 vertical rectangles in the input grid.
2. Preserve these rectangles in the output grid without any changes.
3. For the left azure rectangle, add a blue (color 1) cell immediately to its right,
    in the middle of the object height.
4. For the right azure rectangle, add a blue (color 1) cell immediately to its left,
    in the middle of the object height.
5. The rest of the grid (background color 0) remains unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
