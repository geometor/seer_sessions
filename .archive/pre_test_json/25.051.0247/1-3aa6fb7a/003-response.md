Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: three separate objects
      position:
        - A 2x2 square at (row 2, col 2) and (row 3, col 2), (row 2, col 3) and (row 3, col 3)
        - A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (row 0, col 4) and (row 1, col 4)
        - A 1x2 horizontal rectangle at (row 5, col 4) and (row 5, col 5)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

  output_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: three separate objects.
      position: Same as input
        - A 2x2 square at (row 2, col 2) and (row 3, col 2), (row 2, col 3) and (row 3, col 3)
        - A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (row 0, col 4) and (row 1, col 4)
        - A 1x2 horizontal rectangle at (row 5, col 4) and (row 5, col 5)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: three single cells
      position:
        - One cell at (row 2, col 3) adjacent to the left of the top right azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 1, col 5) adjacent to the top right azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 5, col 3) adjacent to the top right azure square

    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input, there are three azure (color 8) objects: a 2x2 square, a 2x1 vertical rectangle, and a 1x2 horizontal rectangle. The rest is white background (color 0).

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The three azure objects are copied to the output grid without changes in shape or position.

3.  **Place Blue next to objects:**
    *   For each azure object, a blue cell is placed directly next to it.
    *   If the object is on the left side, the blue pixel is added to the right side, in the middle of the object height.
    *   If the object is on the right side, the blue pixel is added to the left side, in the middle of the object height.

4.  **Background remains:** The rest of the background is unchanged.

**Step-by-step transformation (Summarized):**
1.  Copy azure objects.
2.  Add a blue cell next to the azure objects depending on their relative position.
3. The white background remains the same.

The provided Python code correctly implements this logic by:
1. Copying the input to the output grid.
2. Finding each object in the input grid.
3. Determining their position.
4. Placing the blue pixel depending on the object's relative position in the grid.
