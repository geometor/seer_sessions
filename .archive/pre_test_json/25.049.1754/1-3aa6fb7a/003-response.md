Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 3]]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 3]]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [[1, 4], [2, 3], [5,3]]
      shape: "Three single pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three azure (color 8) "L-shaped" objects and white (color 0) elsewhere.

2.  **Detect Changes**:
    *   A blue pixel appears to the left of the top-right L-shaped object in the second row.
    *   A blue pixel appears to the right of the middle-left L-shaped object in the third row.
    *   A blue pixel appears to the left of the bottom-right L-shaped object in the 6th row.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** Find every azure (color 8) object that forms an L shape. Check the row of isolated pixel of the L shape. Then:
    *   If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on its left with a blue (color 1) pixel.
    *   If it is in the third row, replace the white pixel on its right with a blue (color 1) pixel.
    *   If it is in the sixth row, replace the white cell on its left with a blue pixel (color 1).

In summary, the transformation rule is:
For the azure objects that form an L-shape using three pixels. Select the singular azure pixel that is not part of the 2x1 azure object. If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on its left with a blue pixel. If it is in the third row, replace the white pixel on its right. If it is in the sixth row, replace the white pixel on the left with a blue pixel.

```python
"""
Transformation Rule:

Identify azure (color 8) objects that form an L-shape using three pixels. 
For the single azure pixel that defines the L, check its row:
- If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on its left with a blue pixel (color 1).
- If it is in the third row, replace the white pixel on its right with a blue pixel (color 1).
- If it is in the sixth row, replace the white cell on its left with a blue pixel (color 1).
