Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: "Two single pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two azure (color 8) "L-shaped" objects, and the rest of the cells are white (color 0).

2.  **Detect Change:**
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) appears on the right side of the top left azure object.
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) appears on the left side of the bottom right azure object.

3. **Transformation Rule:** Find every azure (color 8) object, a blue pixel (color 1) replaces the white pixel on the right of the azure object in the second row, and the left of the object in the fifth row.

In summary, the transformation rule is:
For the azure objects that form an L-shape using three pixels. Select the singular azure pixel that is not part of the 2x1 azure object. If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on the right with a blue pixel. If it is on the fifth row, replace the white pixel on the left with a blue pixel.
