Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: "Two single pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two azure (color 8) "L-shaped" objects, and the rest of the cells are white (color 0).

2.  **Detect Change:**
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) appears on the right side of the top left azure object.
    *   A blue pixel (color 1) appears on the left side of the bottom right azure object.

3. **Transformation Rule:** Find every azure (color 8) object, a blue pixel (color 1) replaces the white pixel on the right of the azure object in the second row, and the left of the object in the fifth row.

In summary, the transformation rule is:
For the azure objects that form an L-shape using three pixels. Select the singular azure pixel that is not part of the 2x1 azure object. If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on the right with a blue pixel. If it is on the fifth row, replace the white pixel on the left with a blue pixel.

Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 3]]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 3]]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [[1, 4], [2, 3], [5,3]]
      shape: "Three single pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three azure (color 8) "L-shaped" objects and white (color 0) elsewhere.

2.  **Detect Changes**:
    *   A blue pixel appears to the left of the top-right L-shaped object in the second row.
    *   A blue pixel appears to the right of the middle-left L-shaped object in the third row.
    *   A blue pixel appears to the left of the bottom-right L-shaped object in the 6th row.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** Find every azure (color 8) object that forms an L shape. Check the row of isolated pixel of the L shape. Then:
    *   If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on its left with a blue (color 1) pixel.
    *   If it is in the third row, replace the white pixel on its right with a blue (color 1) pixel.
    *   If it is in the sixth row, replace the white cell on its left with a blue pixel (color 1).

In summary, the transformation rule is:
For the azure objects that form an L-shape using three pixels. Select the singular azure pixel that is not part of the 2x1 azure object. If it is in the second row, replace the white pixel on its left with a blue pixel. If it is in the third row, replace the white pixel on its right. If it is in the sixth row, replace the white pixel on the left with a blue pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
