            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example. The YAML and natural language program from the first example generally apply, but let's refine the definition of \"corner\" with respect to this specific problem.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations (Second Example)**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n      shape: Three separate objects: two horizontal 1x2 rectangles, and a vertical 1x2 rectangle.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n      shape: Three separate objects: two horizontal 1x2 rectangles, and a vertical 1x2 rectangle.\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]\n      shape: individual pixels.\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.\n\n2. **Identify and change the leftmost corner cell**: If an azure region is made of 2 cells, change the leftmost cell to blue.\n\n3. **Preserve background**: All white cells remain unchanged.\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program**\n\n```\n1. Find all separate azure (color 8) objects.\n2. Check if the separated object consists of two cells.\n3. For each object consisting of two cells, find the leftmost coordinate, and change it to blue.\n4. Keep all other cells, both other azure colored and all the background, the same color.\n```\n\n**Refined Python Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of the specified color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of coordinates for each object.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n\n    return objects\n    \ndef find_leftmost(object_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and returns the leftmost coordinate of a set of object coordinates\n    \"\"\"\n    if not object_coords:\n        return None\n    \n    leftmost_coord = object_coords[0]\n    \n    for coord in object_coords:\n        if coord[1] < leftmost_coord[1]:\n            leftmost_coord = coord\n\n    return [leftmost_coord]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the refined rule:\n    - Finds azure (color 8) objects.\n    - For each object with 2 cells, the leftmost cell is turned blue.\n    - Keeps all other cells the same.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        if len(obj) == 2:\n            leftmost = find_leftmost(obj)\n            for coord in leftmost:\n                output_grid[coord] = 1\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning**\n\nThe crucial change is in how we define a \"corner\" and process those objects.\n\n*   **`find_leftmost` Function:** This new function specifically identifies the *leftmost* cell within a given object, which captures the notion of which cell gets colored blue.\n*   **Object Size Check**: With this new example, we now added logic that filters the list of objects: only if the separated object consist of two cells, we change the corner color.\n*   **Clarity and Generality:** The refined description is more explicit. It focuses on checking the leftmost cell in a pair of cells.\n\nThis refined logic captures the consistent transformation rule, which applies to both examples and more accurately reflects the pattern.\n"
