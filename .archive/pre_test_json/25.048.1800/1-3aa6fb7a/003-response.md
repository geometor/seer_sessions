**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Detect all connected regions of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2. **Sort Objects:** Order the identified objects from left to right based on their horizontal position (minimum column index).
3. **Process Leftmost Object:** For the first object in the sorted list:
    - Find its topmost cell (minimum row index).
    - Locate the cell immediately to the right of this topmost cell and change its color to 1 (blue).
4. **Process Rightmost Object:** For the last object in the sorted list:
    - Find its topmost cell (minimum row index).
    - Locate the cell immediately below this topmost cell and change its color to 1 (blue).
5. **Process Middle Objects:** For all other objects (if any) in the sorted list (excluding the first and last):
    - Find their topmost cell (minimum row index).
    - Locate the cell immediately to the left of this topmost cell and change its color to 1 (blue).
6. **Output:** The resulting grid is the output grid.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle transformation"
transformation_rule: "Identify connected components of color 8, sort them horizontally, and modify cells adjacent to the topmost cell of each component based on their horizontal order."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8 # azure
predicates:
  - "connected": "cells of the same color are adjacent"
  - "leftmost": "object with the minimum starting column index (first in sorted list)"
  - "rightmost": "object with the maximum starting column index (last in sorted list)"
  - "middle_object": "object that is neither leftmost nor rightmost in sorted list"
  - "topmost": "cell with the minimum row index within an object"
actions:
  - "identify": "detect connected regions of color 8"
  - "sort": "order objects based on their leftmost column"
  - "change_color": "modify cell color to 1 (blue)"
  - "locate_adjacent_cell_right": "find cell immediately to the right of a given cell"
  - "locate_adjacent_cell_below": "find cell immediately below a given cell"
  - "locate_adjacent_cell_left": "find cell immediately to the left of a given cell"
steps:
  - "Identify all connected components of color 8."
  - "Sort these components based on their minimum column index (left to right)."
  - "For the first (leftmost) component, find its topmost cell and change the color of the cell immediately to its right to 1."
  - "For the last (rightmost) component, find its topmost cell and change the color of the cell immediately below it to 1."
  - "For all components in between (if any), find their topmost cell and change the color of the cell immediately to their left to 1."
