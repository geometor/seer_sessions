These regions are considered as distinct objects.\n2. **Sort Objects:** Order the identified objects from left to right based on their horizontal position. The horizontal position of an object is determined by the minimum column index among all cells belonging to that object.\n3. **Leftmost Object Action:** For the object that is leftmost in the sorted order:\n    - Find its topmost cell. The topmost cell is the cell with the minimum row index among all cells of this object.\n    - Locate the cell immediately to the right of this topmost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries, change its color to 1 (blue).\n4. **Rightmost Object Action:** For the object that is rightmost in the sorted order:\n    - Find its bottommost cell. The bottommost cell is the cell with the maximum row index among all cells of this object.\n    - Locate the cell immediately to the left of this bottommost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries, change its color to 1 (blue).\n5. **Output:** The grid obtained after applying these changes is the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"ARC-AGI grid puzzle transformation\"\ntransformation_rule: \"Identify connected components of color 8, sort them horizontally, and modify cells adjacent to the leftmost and rightmost components.\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"connected region\"\n    color: 8 # azure\npredicates:\n  - \"connected\": \"cells of the same color are adjacent (horizontally or vertically)\"\n  - \"leftmost\": \"object with the minimum starting column index\"\n  - \"rightmost\": \"object with the maximum starting column index\"\n  - \"topmost\": \"cell with the minimum row index within an object\"\n  - \"bottommost\": \"cell with the maximum row index within an object\"\nactions:\n  - \"identify\": \"detect connected regions of color 8\"\n  - \"sort\": \"order objects based on their leftmost column\"\n  - \"change_color\": \"modify cell color to 1 (blue)\"\n  - \"locate_adjacent_cell\": \"find cell immediately to the right or left of a given cell\"\nsteps:\n  - \"Identify all connected components of color 8.\"\n  - \"Sort these components based on their minimum column index (left to right).\"\n  - \"For the leftmost component, find its topmost cell and change the color of the cell immediately to its right to 1.\"\n  - \"For the rightmost component, find its bottommost cell and change the color of the cell immediately to its left to 1.\"\n```"
