Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects and
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,4)]
      shape: two 1x1 blue objects.

```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, identify all objects with color 8 (azure). There are two of those, one on the top-left and one on the down-right.

2.  **Locate Top and Bottom of shapes:** Find a top most azure colored pixel in each object and remember it.

3. **Create a blue pixel**: Change pixel next to remembered to a blue pixel (color 1)

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule takes the azure colored object in the input grid and creates a blue pixel next to its upmost pixel.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
