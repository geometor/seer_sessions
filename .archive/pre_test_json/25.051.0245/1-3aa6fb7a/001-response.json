For each such region, we need to identify its 'end points', specifically those cells within the region that have exactly one neighbor also belonging to the same region. From these 'end points', we determine the 'top-most' and 'bottom-most' based on their row and column indices. Then, for the 'top-most' end point, we place a color 1 (blue) cell immediately to its right. For the 'bottom-most' end point, we place a color 1 cell immediately to its left.\"\nnatural_language_program: |\n  For each connected component of color 8 in the input grid:\n  1. Identify all cells that form the connected component of color 8.\n  2. For each cell in this component, count the number of its neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also part of the same component.\n  3. Determine the \"end points\" of the component. An \"end point\" is a cell that has exactly one neighbor within the same color 8 component.\n  4. Find the \"top-most end point\" among all identified end points. This is the end point with the minimum row index. If there's a tie in row indices, choose the one with the minimum column index.\n  5. Find the \"bottom-most end point\" among all identified end points. This is the end point with the maximum row index. If there's a tie in row indices, choose the one with the minimum column index.\n  6. In the output grid, place a color 1 (blue) cell immediately to the right of the \"top-most end point\".\n  7. In the output grid, place a color 1 (blue) cell immediately to the left of the \"bottom-most end point\".\n  8. If a grid cell is not modified by steps 6 or 7, it retains its original color from the input grid.\n```"
