For each cell in this component, count the number of its neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also part of the same component.\n3. Determine the \"end points\" of the component. An \"end point\" is a cell that has exactly one neighbor within the same color 8 component.\n4. Find the \"top-most end point\" among all identified end points. This is the end point with the minimum row index. If there's a tie in row indices, choose the one with the minimum column index.\n5. Find the \"bottom-most end point\" among all identified end points. This is the end point with the maximum row index. If there's a tie in row indices, choose the one with the minimum column index.\n6. In the output grid, place a color 1 (blue) cell immediately to the right of the \"top-most end point\".\n7. In the output grid, place a color 1 (blue) cell immediately to the left of the \"bottom-most end point\".\n8.
