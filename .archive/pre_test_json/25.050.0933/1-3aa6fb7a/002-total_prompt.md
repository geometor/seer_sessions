Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) regions"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape:  "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) regions"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid. There two separate azure regions.
2.  **Identify Single Azure Pixels:** Observe that there are single azure pixels within each azure regions that don't have neighbors of color 8.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the isolated single azure pixels into blue (color 1) in the output grid.
4. **Preserve the rest:** All the rest of azure object and the background are preserved.

**Explanation of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation identifies azure regions. From each identified regions, find the most isolated azure pixel, which has no neighbors with the same color and change it to blue. The rest of the structure is kept unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
