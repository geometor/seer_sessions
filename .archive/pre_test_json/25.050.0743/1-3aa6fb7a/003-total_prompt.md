Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shaped objects.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape:  Two separate L-shaped objects. Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two single-cell objects.
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).
2.  **Preservation:** The two azure L-shaped structures from the input are kept unchanged in the output.
3. **Change Detection:** Now we look for changes:
    *   The cell at (1, 2) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).
    *   The cell at (4, 4) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).
4. **Find the changed cells**: Check the cells that are to the immediate right (neighbor) of the top left corner of the azure objects. If those cells has color 0 (white), change those cells to have color 1 (blue).

**Step-by-step description in simple terms**:

The rule seems to change the color of cells to the right the top-left-corner of color 8 (azure) "L" shapes.
- The cell to the right of the uppermost-leftmost azure cell, is changed to blue.
- The cell to the right of the other L-shape uppermost-leftmost azure cell is changed to blue.


```python
"""
The transformation rule preserves two L-shaped azure objects and changes the color of the cells immediately to the right of their top-left corners from white (0) to blue (1).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
