Same as input.\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]\n      shape: Two single-cell objects.\n  dimensions: 7x7\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).\n2.  **Preservation:** The two azure L-shaped structures from the input are kept unchanged in the output.\n3. **Change Detection:** Now we look for changes:\n    *   The cell at (1, 2) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).\n    *   The cell at (4, 4) is now a blue cell. In the input it was a white cell (color 0).\n4. **Find the changed cells**: Check the cells that are to the immediate right (neighbor) of the top left corner of the azure objects. If those cells has color 0 (white), change those cells to have color 1 (blue).\n\n**Step-by-step description in simple terms**:\n\nThe rule seems to change the color of cells to the right the top-left-corner of color 8 (azure) \"L\" shapes.\n- The cell to the right of the uppermost-leftmost azure cell, is changed to blue.\n- The cell to the right of the other L-shape uppermost-leftmost azure cell is changed to blue.\n\n"
