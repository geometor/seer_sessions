Check the shape to determine if we should paint the cell down, right or up of the top-left corner.*\n*If the shape is vertical paint in blue (color 1) down.*\n*If the shape is horizontal paint in blue (color 1) right.*\n\nIt appears that there is an error in my code. I missed the third L-shape in the second example because I considered only two types of L shapes.\nHere is the modified function :\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nFor each azure L-shape in the input grid:\nFind its uppermost and leftmost cell.

I think now all edge cases will be handled by the function. Here is the corrected Python Code.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nFor each azure L-shape in the input grid:\nFind its uppermost and leftmost cell.
