Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    3: 3
    1: 3
    2: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    4: 3
    5: 3
    6: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column. The lines are colored green (3), blue (1), and red (2) from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping/Transformation**:
    *   Every instance of color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 1 (blue) in the input is replaced by color 5 (gray) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.

3. **Preservation of Structure**: The shape and the position of the lines are preserved during the transformation.

**Transformation Rule Concise Description**

The transformation rule consists of a color substitution: 3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 5, and 2 becomes 6. The spatial structure of the grid (three vertical lines) is preserved.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column. The lines are colored red (2), green (3), and azure (8) from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping/Transformation**:
    *   Every instance of color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.

3.  **Preservation of Structure**: The shape and the position of the lines are preserved during the transformation.

**Transformation Rule Concise Description**

The transformation rule consists of a color substitution: 2 becomes 6, 3 becomes 4, and 8 becomes 9. The spatial structure of the grid (three vertical lines) is preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
