Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    9: 3
    4: 3
    2: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    8: 3
    3: 3
    6: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column. The lines are colored maroon (9), yellow (4), and red (2) from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping/Transformation**:
    *   Every instance of color 9 (maroon) in the input is replaced by color 8 (azure) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 4 (yellow) in the input is replaced by color 3 (green) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.

3.  **Preservation of Structure**: The shape and the position of the lines are preserved during the transformation.

**Transformation Rule Concise Description**

The transformation rule consists of a color substitution: 9 becomes 8, 4 becomes 3, and 2 becomes 6. The spatial structure of the grid (three vertical lines) is preserved.
