Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    5: 3
    8: 3
    6: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
  color_counts:
    1: 3
    9: 3
    2: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column. The lines are colored gray (5), azure (8), and magenta (6) from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping/Transformation**:
    *   Every instance of color 5 (gray) in the input is replaced by color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.
    *   Every instance of color 6 (magenta) in the input is replaced by color 2 (red) in the output.

3.  **Preservation of Structure**: The shape and the position of the lines are preserved during the transformation.

**Transformation Rule Concise Description**

The transformation rule consists of a color substitution: 5 becomes 1, 8 becomes 9, and 6 becomes 2. The spatial structure of the grid (three vertical lines) is preserved.
