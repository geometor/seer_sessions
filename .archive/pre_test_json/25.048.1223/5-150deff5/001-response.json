This object has a shape similar to a mirrored and rotated \"F\".\n\n2.  **Decompose and Recolour:**\n    *   The top 2x2 square formed by color 5 at rows 2,3 and columns 2,3 is recolored to color 8 (azure).\n    *   The parts that follow the same columns are recolored in azure too, up to the intersection.\n    *   The central vertical part, or stem, of the \"F\" shape (from the third row to the seventh, the intersection), is recolored to color 2 (red).\n\n3.  **Background:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning:**\nThe gray object gets decomposed and recolored. The core of the gray shape and the arms that come out from the sides get the color azure. The \"stem\" gets recolored to red. The background (white/0) stays untouched.\n"
