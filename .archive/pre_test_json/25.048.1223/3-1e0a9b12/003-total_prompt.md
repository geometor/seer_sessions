Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2,1), (3, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 0)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white colored cells in the input grid.

2.  **Shift Objects:**
    All the non-white colored pixels are moved to the last row, keeping it's order.

3. **Place Objects on the bottom:**
    *   The yellow object that was originally at (0, 1) is moved to (3,1)
    *   The yellow object that was originally at (2, 1) is moved to (3,1)
    *   The maroon object originally at (0, 3)is moved to (3, 3).
    *    The magenta object originally at (2,2) is moved to (3,2)
    *   The blue object at (3, 0) stays at (3, 0).

4. **All other cells:** fill all others cells with white (0)

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify all non-white colored cells in the input grid.
2. Move all non-white cells to the last row of the output grid, maintaining their original horizontal order.
3. Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
