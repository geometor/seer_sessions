Note their positions.\n\n2.  **Preserve:** Copy every azure pixel to the output grid, keeping its position unchanged.\n\n3. **Detect Particular Shape:** The azure pixels form two separated 'L' shapes made of three pixels each.\n\n4.  **Insert:** For each one of the two shapes, insert a blue (color 1) pixel inside the corner of the \"L\" shape. The blue pixel should connect the two lines of the \"L\".\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**\nThe azure pixels did not move. The only change from the input to the output is the addition of blue pixels in the \"elbows\" of the two L-shapes.\n"
