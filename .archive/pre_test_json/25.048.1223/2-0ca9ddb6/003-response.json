It extends one cell to the left, right, and below each blue cell, except the blue cell on (3,2) that is below.\n\n5. **Background Persistence:** All other cells remain unchanged (white, color 0).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves the azure, red, and blue cells in their initial positions. It creates a yellow aura (color 4) one cell distant to the left and to the right of the red objects, and it creates an orange aura (color 7) one cell to the left, right, and below for the blue objects and one up.\n"
