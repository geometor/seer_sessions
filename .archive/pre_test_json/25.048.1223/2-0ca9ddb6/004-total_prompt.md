Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions:  [(5,6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** In the input grid, we have two significant single-cell objects: a red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6). All the other cells are white (color 0, the background).

2.  **Preservation:** The red and the blue objects are maintained in the output.

3.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "aura" appears around the red object. Specifically, two yellow cells is created, simmetrically opposed, one cell to the left and another to the right of the object.

4. **Orange Expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "aura" appears around the blue object. Specifically, three orange cells appear: one to the left, one to the right, and the last one below.

5. **Background Persistence:** The other cells remain unchanged (white, color 0).

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation preserves a red cell and a blue cell. Then, it draws a yellow, simmetrical, aura one cell distant to the red object and an orange aura one cell distant to the blue object.

Okay, let's analyze the second transformation.

**YAML Description of Observations**

      position: (0, 3)
      shape: 1x1

    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** The input grid contains:
    *   An azure cell (color 8) at (0, 3).
    *   Two red cells (color 2) at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue cells (color 1) at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Preservation:** All identified objects (azure, red, and blue cells) are preserved in their original positions in the output grid.

3.  **Yellow Expansion:**
    * A yellow (color 4) 1 x 1 aura is added around the red object at (2,6), simmetrically, to the left and to the right.
    * A yellow (color 4) 1 x 1 aura is added around the red object at (7,1), simmetrically, to the left and to the right.

4.  **Orange Expansion:**
    *   An orange (color 7) aura is placed around both blue objects. It extends one cell to the left, right, and below each blue cell, except the blue cell on (3,2) that is below.

5. **Background Persistence:** All other cells remain unchanged (white, color 0).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves the azure, red, and blue cells in their initial positions. It creates a yellow aura (color 4) one cell distant to the left and to the right of the red objects, and it creates an orange aura (color 7) one cell to the left, right, and below for the blue objects and one up.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
