Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: [3, 7]
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 5
      positions: [[0,0], [1,1], [1,5], [1,6], [2,0]]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [[0,3], [1,3], [2,3]]
    white_objects:
      count: 13
      positions:  "All the remaining positions not occupied by blue or gray"
output_grid:
  size: [3, 3]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      count: 1
      positions: [[1,1]]
    white_objects:
          count: 8
          positions: "All positions except [1,1]"

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Determine the center of the input grid. In this case, with dimensions 3x7, the center is at row 1, column 3 (0-indexed).

2.  **Extract a 3x3 Subgrid:** Create a 3x3 subgrid centered around the central element identified in step 1.

3. **Check color:** Check for a gray object in this center position,

4.  **Change Central color:** If there is a gray object in that position, change the central cell of the 3x3 subgrid to red (color code 2). Otherwise keep it with color code 0.

5.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill all other cells of the 3x3 subgrid with white (color code 0).

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: [3, 7]
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 7
      positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,5], [1,4], [1,5], [2,0], [2,1]]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [[0,3], [1,3], [2,3]]
    white_objects:
      count: 11
      positions: "All the remaining positions not occupied by blue or gray"
output_grid:
  size: [3, 3]
  objects:
    red_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [[0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]
    white_objects:
      count: 6
      positions: "All the remaining positions except the red ones"
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Determine the center of the input grid. In this case, with dimensions 3x7, the center is at row 1, column 3 (0-indexed).

2.  **Extract a 3x3 Subgrid:** Imagine creating a 3x3 subgrid centered around the central element identified in step 1. *However, this subgrid is not directly extracted or copied*. It's a conceptual region of interest.

3.  **Identify Gray Column:** Recognize that the central column of the input grid (column 3) is entirely composed of gray (5) colored cells.

4.  **Output Pattern:** Generate a specific 3x3 output grid based on the input:
    *   The output grid is filled with white (0) except for three red (2) cells.
    * The three red cells forms a vertical line.
    *   If the identified central column is ALL gray:
        *  A red (2) cell will be placed in the cells located at positions (0,1) (1,2) and (2,1) of the output. The indexing here corresponds to the output grid, not the imaginary subgrid.
    * Else: If the central column is not all gray.
        * The output will be all white.

*   **No Subgrid Extraction**: Unlike some transformations, we don't extract a 3x3 portion and modify it. The transformation is based on a *property* of the central column (all gray) and generates a *specific output pattern*.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
