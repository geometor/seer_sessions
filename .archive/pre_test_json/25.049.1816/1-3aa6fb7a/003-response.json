The azure objects are identical. Three single blue pixels are added.\n\n3.  **Describe the change:** Locate the corners of the azure L-shapes. Paint these corners with blue.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1.  Find the azure (8) colored objects in the grid.\n2.  Find the corners of the three L-shapes.  The coordinates are (1, 4), (2, 3), and (5,3).\n3.  Paint the corner cells of the azure shapes to blue (1).\n4. Keep other azure pixels.\n5.  Keep other grid colors.\n\nThis natural language program describes the observed transformation, including object properties, actions, and the overall rule. The key is to identify the L-shapes, find their corners, and change only the color of those corner pixels.\n"
