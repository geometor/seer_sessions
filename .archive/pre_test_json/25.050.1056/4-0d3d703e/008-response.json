That is +1.\n    *   Blue (1) cells become Gray (5). That is +4.\n    *   Red (2) cells become Magenta (6). That is +4.\n\n3.  **Object Transformations**: It seems more adequate to state that the transformation rule adds different numbers to values on *odd* columns than to values on *even* columns:\n    * Add +1 to the values of cells on odd columns.\n    * Add +4 to the values of cells on even columns.\n\n4. **Preservation of Structure** The general shape and the number of cells are preserved.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe transformation rule consists of incrementing the color value of each cell by a fixed amount. The amount is determined by the parity of the column's index.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule consists of incrementing the color value of each cell by a fixed amount. \nThe amount is determined by the parity of the column's index:\n- Add +1 to the values of cells on odd columns.\n- Add +4 to the values of cells on even columns.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by incrementing the color value of each cell \n    based on the parity of its column index.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check if the column index is even or odd\n            if (j + 1) % 2 == 1:  # Odd column\n                output_grid[i, j] += 1\n            else:  # Even column\n                output_grid[i, j] += 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
