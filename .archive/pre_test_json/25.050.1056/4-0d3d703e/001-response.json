That is +1.\n    *   Blue (1) cells become Gray (5). That is +4.\n    *   Red (2) cells become Magenta (6). That is +4.\n\n3.  **Object Transformations**: It seems more adequate to state that the transformation rule adds different numbers to values on *odd* columns than to values on *even* columns:\n    * Add +1 to the values of cells on odd columns.\n    * Add +4 to the values of cells on even columns.\n\n4. **Preservation of Structure** The general shape and the number of cells are preserved.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe transformation rule consists of incrementing the color value of each cell by a fixed amount. The amount is determined by the parity of the column's index.\n\n"
