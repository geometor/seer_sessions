Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    yellow_cross:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      position: surrounding red object
      shape: cross
    orange_cross:
      color: 7 (orange)
      position: surrounding blue object
      shape: cross
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two single-cell objects: a red object (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue object (color 1) at position (6, 6). The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).

2.  **Maintain Core Objects:** The red and blue objects remain in their original positions and retain their colors in the output grid.

3.  **Create Crosses:**
    *   A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) is created around the red object. The yellow cross extends one cell up, down, left and right of the center red cell.
    *   An orange "cross" shape (color 7) is created around the blue object. The orange cross extends one cell up, down, left and right of the center blue cell.

4. **No other changes:** The background (0) is not changed.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows: For each non-background colored cell in the input grid, create a cross-shaped object of a new specific color centered at the original object's location. Red object creates an yellow cross, blue object an orange cross. The original object is not changed. The size of cross is one cell.

```python
"""
Transformation Rule: For each non-background colored cell in the input grid, create a cross-shaped object of a new specific color centered at the original object's location. Red object creates a yellow cross, and a blue object creates an orange cross. The original object is not changed. The size of the cross is one cell extending in each cardinal direction.

        for c in range(cols):

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cell
    azure_object:
        color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0,3)
        shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cell
    yellow_crosses:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: surrounding red objects
      shape: cross
    orange_crosses:
      color: 7 (orange)
      positions: surrounding blue objects
      shape: cross
    azure_object:
        color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0,3)
        shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains several single-cell objects: two red objects (color 2), two blue objects (color 1), and one azure object (color 8).

2.  **Maintain Core Objects:** The red, blue, and azure objects all remain in their original positions with the same color in the output grid.

3.  **Create Crosses:**
    *   Yellow crosses (color 4) are created around each of the red objects.
    *   Orange crosses (color 7) are created around each of the blue objects.
    * Azure object does not cause any changes.

4.  **No other changes:** The background color (white, 0) is unaffected.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is consistent with the first example.  For each red (2) or blue (1) cell in the input, a cross of a corresponding color (yellow for red, orange for blue) is created, centered on the original cell. The original red and blue cells are preserved. Other colored cells (like the azure one in this example) are unchanged and do not generate any crosses.

The python code does not need modification, as this example still uses the same principles described.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
