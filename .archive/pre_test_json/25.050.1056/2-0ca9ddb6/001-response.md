Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    yellow_cross:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      position: surrounding red object
      shape: cross
    orange_cross:
      color: 7 (orange)
      position: surrounding blue object
      shape: cross
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two single-cell objects: a red object (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue object (color 1) at position (6, 6). The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).

2.  **Maintain Core Objects:** The red and blue objects remain in their original positions and retain their colors in the output grid.

3.  **Create Crosses:**
    *   A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) is created around the red object. The yellow cross extends one cell up, down, left and right of the center red cell.
    *   An orange "cross" shape (color 7) is created around the blue object. The orange cross extends one cell up, down, left and right of the center blue cell.

4. **No other changes:** The background (0) is not changed.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows: For each non-background colored cell in the input grid, create a cross-shaped object of a new specific color centered at the original object's location. Red object creates an yellow cross, blue object an orange cross. The original object is not changed. The size of cross is one cell.
