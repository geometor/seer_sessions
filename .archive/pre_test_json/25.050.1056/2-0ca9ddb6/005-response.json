Only red (2) and blue (1) cells trigger the creation of crosses.  Red cells generate a yellow (4) cross, and blue cells generate an orange (7) cross.  The crosses are centered on the original cell and extend one unit in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  Other colored cells (like magenta (6) in this example) do not trigger any cross creation and stay in their original configuration.\n\nThe Python code developed previously perfectly captures this rule and requires no modifications:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation Rule: For each red (2) or blue (1) cell in the input grid, create a cross-shaped object of a corresponding color (yellow for red, orange for blue) centered on the original cell. The original red and blue cells are preserved. Other colored cells do not generate crosses and are kept unchanged. The size of the cross is one cell extending in each cardinal direction.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Start with a copy of the input grid\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the cell is red or blue\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:  # Red cell\n                cross_color = 4  # Yellow\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 1:  # Blue cell\n                cross_color = 7  # Orange\n            else:\n                continue  # Skip if not red or blue\n\n            # Create the cross by changing the neighboring cells\n            if r > 0:\n                output_grid[r - 1, c] = cross_color  # Up\n            if r < rows - 1:\n                output_grid[r + 1, c] = cross_color  # Down\n            if c > 0:\n                output_grid[r, c - 1] = cross_color  # Left\n            if c < cols - 1:\n                output_grid[r, c + 1] = cross_color  # Right\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
