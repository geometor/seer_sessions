For each red (2) or blue (1) cell in the input, a cross of a corresponding color (yellow for red, orange for blue) is created, centered on the original cell. The original red and blue cells are preserved. Other colored cells (like the azure one in this example) are unchanged and do not generate any crosses.\n\nThe python code does not need modification, as this example still uses the same principles described.\n"
