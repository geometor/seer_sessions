Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cell
    azure_object:
        color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0,3)
        shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cell
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cell
    yellow_crosses:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: surrounding red objects
      shape: cross
    orange_crosses:
      color: 7 (orange)
      positions: surrounding blue objects
      shape: cross
    azure_object:
        color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0,3)
        shape: single cell
  background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains several single-cell objects: two red objects (color 2), two blue objects (color 1), and one azure object (color 8).

2.  **Maintain Core Objects:** The red, blue, and azure objects all remain in their original positions with the same color in the output grid.

3.  **Create Crosses:**
    *   Yellow crosses (color 4) are created around each of the red objects.
    *   Orange crosses (color 7) are created around each of the blue objects.
    * Azure object does not cause any changes.

4.  **No other changes:** The background color (white, 0) is unaffected.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is consistent with the first example.  For each red (2) or blue (1) cell in the input, a cross of a corresponding color (yellow for red, orange for blue) is created, centered on the original cell. The original red and blue cells are preserved. Other colored cells (like the azure one in this example) are unchanged and do not generate any crosses.

The python code does not need modification, as this example still uses the same principles described.
