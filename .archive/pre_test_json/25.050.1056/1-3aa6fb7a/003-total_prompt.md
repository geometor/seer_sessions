Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate azure 'L' shapes, one in the top-left and other on the right"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Same as input"
  - color: 1
    positions: [(4,1), (1,4)]
    shape: "Two, separate, individual blue cells."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, we have two distinct "L" shaped objects.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The azure objects are preserved from input to output.

3. **Detect top left corner and bottom right corner:** The upper-leftmost azure object is in position (1,1) and the bottom right most corner is (4,5).

4.  **Place blue pixels:** Place a blue (color 1) pixel on the corners of the bounding box of the object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is as follows:
- The azure colored objects are maintained from the input grid to the output grid.
- A blue pixel is placed in the grid at the top left corner and at the bottom right corner.

```python
"""
The azure colored objects are maintained from the input grid to the output grid.
A blue pixel is placed in the grid at the top left corner and at the bottom right corner of the azure colored cluster.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_azure_objects(grid):
    """
    Finds the positions of azure (color 8) pixels in the grid.
    """
    azure_positions = []
    for i in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[i, j] == 8:
                azure_positions.append((i, j))
    return azure_positions

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:
    - Azure objects are preserved.
    - Blue pixels are placed at the top-left and bottom-right corners of azure clusters.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    azure_positions = find_azure_objects(input_grid)

    if azure_positions:
      #find top-left and bottom-right corners
      min_row = min(pos[0] for pos in azure_positions)
      min_col = min(pos[1] for pos in azure_positions)
      max_row = max(pos[0] for pos in azure_positions)
      max_col = max(pos[1] for pos in azure_positions)

      output_grid[min_row, min_col] = 1 # top-left
      output_grid[max_row,max_col] = 1 # bottom-right

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
