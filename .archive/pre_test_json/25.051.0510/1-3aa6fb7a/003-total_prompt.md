Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical lines, and two separate 1x2 horizontal lines.
      positions:
        - [1,1] , [2,1] # Vertical line 1
        - [2,2] # Vertical Line 1
        - [3,4], [3,5] # Horizontal line 1
        - [4,5] # Horizontal line 2
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: everywhere else

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical lines, and two separate 1x2 horizontal lines.
        positions:
          - [1,1] , [2,1] # Vertical line 1
          - [2,2] # Vertical Line 1
          - [3,4], [3,5] # Horizontal line 1
          - [4,5] # Horizontal line 2
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: Single pixel
        positions:
          - [1,2]
          - [4,4]
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        position: everywhere else
```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-step transformation):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (8) colored objects and the white (0) background. The azure objects appear as two disconnected 2x1 vertical lines and two 1x2 horizontal lines.

2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing input to output, new blue (1) pixels appear.

3.  **Locate Blue Pixel Positions:**
    *   A blue pixel appears to the immediate right of the *topmost* vertical azure line. Specifically, it is at position [1,2].
    *    A blue pixel appears to the immediate left of the *bottommost* horizontal azure line. Specifically, at [4,4].

4. **Transformation Rule:** The overall transformation rule is:
    * Find the topmost vertical line of color 8. Place color 1 to the immediate right of the top of that segment.
    * Find the bottommost horizontal line of color 8. Place a color 1 to the immediate left of that segment.
    *   The azure (8) elements and the white (0) background remain unchanged.

In simple terms. The azure objects remain where they are, but one blue pixel is added to the right of the highest vertical azure line, and another is added to the left of the lowest horizontal azure line.

```python
"""
Transformation Rule:
The azure (8) objects remain unchanged. 
A blue (1) pixel is added to the immediate right of the top of the topmost vertical azure line.
Another blue (1) pixel is added to the immediate left of the bottommost horizontal azure line.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
