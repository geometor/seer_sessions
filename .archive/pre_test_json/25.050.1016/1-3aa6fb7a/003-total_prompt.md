Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored shapes, can consider it as individual pixels or two separate groups."
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Same structure as input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,3)]
    
      shape: "Two single blue (1) pixels."
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have azure (color 8) pixels at the following locations: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 4).

2. **Introduce blue color:**
    - The azure object at (1,1) becomes the anchor point for a blue color 1 pixel at position +1 on the y-axis, that is position (1,2).
    - The azure object at (5,4) becomes the anchor point for a blue color 1 pixel at position -1 on the x-axis, that is position (4,3).
3.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is as follows: Find the top-left most and bottom-right most azure (8) objects. The top-left most is the object that has the smallest x and y coordinates. The bottom-right most has the largest x and y coordinates.
Create a blue pixel (1) by moving +1 on the y-axis from the top-left most, and another by moving -1 in the x-axis of the bottom-right most azure pixel. The rest of azure color pixels remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
