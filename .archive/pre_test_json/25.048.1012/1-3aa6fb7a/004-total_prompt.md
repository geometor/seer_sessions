Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal rectangles
      position: (1,1) and (3,4) # Starting row and column indices for the top-left corner of each rectangle
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal rectangles.
      position:  (1,1) and (3,4)  #Same position
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2) and (4,5) #fills the spaces
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:
1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have the following objects: two azure (color 8) colored rectangles, and the background (color 0).
2.  **Azure Rectangles Properties:** Two azure rectangles, are not modified. One is located in column 1 and rows 1 and 2, and consists in two azure cells vertically. The other is located in row 4 and columns 4 and 5, and consists in two horizontally placed azure cells.
3.  **Change**: The cells that:
    +   have a direct neighbor to the left of color 8.
    +   have a direct neighbor to the right of color 8.

    are changed to the color blue (1).

**Transformation Rule**
The transformation rule can be described as background. For each cell, If a cell, that is not part of a azure rectangle, is between two azure colored cells (neighbor to the left is azure and neighbor to the right is azure), change the cells to blue (1).

def transform(input_grid):

    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the current cell is not azure (color 8)
            if input_grid[r, c] != 8:
                # Check for azure neighbors to the left and right
                if c > 0 and c < cols - 1 and input_grid[r, c-1] == 8 and input_grid[r, c+1] == 8:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 1  # Change the cell color to blue (1)

    return output_grid
```

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in the second example.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: various configurations (single cells, 2x1, 1x2)
      position: scattered throughout the grid
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: same as input
      position: same as input
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: filling cells that have color 8 neighbors to the left and right.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains azure (color 8) objects of various shapes (single cells, 2x1 vertical rectangles, and 1x2 horizontal rectangles) and a background of color 0.

2.  **Azure Objects Persistence:** The azure objects' shapes and positions remain unchanged in the output grid.

3. **Change Condition:** The cells, that are between two neighbor of color 8, changes its color to blue (1).

**Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is identical to the first case: For each cell in the grid, if a cell (which is not color 8) has an immediate neighbor to its left and to its right that are both color 8, then change the cell's color to 1 (blue).

The natural language description and the python code developed are valid for this case.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
