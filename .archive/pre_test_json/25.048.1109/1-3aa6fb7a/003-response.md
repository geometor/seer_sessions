Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: "Three L-shaped objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3),(6,4)]
      shape: "Three L-shaped objects"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single-cell objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can observe three L-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Detect Changed Pixels**
    - Find pixels on the left side of the top-right azure L. Change the color of the pixel to blue (color 1).
    - Find pixels on the left side of the middle-left azure L. Change the color of the pixel to blue (color 1).
     - Find pixels on the up side of the down-left azure L. Change the color of the pixel to blue (color 1).

3.  **Construct Output:** The output grid retains all azure colored pixels, except the specified three pixels which become blue.

**Elaborated Description of the Rule**

The transformation rule preserves most of the azure pixels, and adding three blue pixels, each one at specific relative positions related with the three initial L-shaped objects.

```python
"""
The transformation rule preserves most of the azure pixels, and adds three blue pixels, each one at specific relative positions related with the three initial L-shaped objects.
Specifically:
- one blue pixel is placed to the immediate left of the top-right L-shaped object.
- one blue pixel is placed to the immediate left of the middle-left L-shaped object.
- one blue pixel is placed to the immediate up of the bottom-left L-shaped object.
