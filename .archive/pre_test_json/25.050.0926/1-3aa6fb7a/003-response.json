In this case, the first azure object at (0,4) and (0,5) gets a blue pixel at position (1,4).\n    - A vertical 2x1 rectangle: a blue pixel gets added on the same row and one column to the right (relative to the top-left corner of the component). The object with top at (2,2) gets a blue pixel at position (2,3).\n    - An irregular object: we first look for a pixel with neighbors at south and east. The first pixel where this condition holds is at row=5, col=4 (neighbor at south is (6,4) and neighbor at east is at (5,5) which does not exists). A blue pixel gets added one row above and one column to the left, therefore at position (5,3).\n\n3.  **All Other Pixels Remain Unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the identified azure objects remain with color 0.\n\n**In essence, we detect the azure colored components and insert one single blue pixel for each one of these, according to their shape.**\n"
