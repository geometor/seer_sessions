Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure components: 1x2, 2x1, and another irregular shape"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure components: 1x2, 2x1, and another irregular shape"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) components.

2.  **Classify Azure Objects and place Blue Pixel:**
     - A horizontal 1x2 rectangle: a blue pixel gets added on the row below, and one column to the left (relative to the top-left corner of the component). In this case, the first azure object at (0,4) and (0,5) gets a blue pixel at position (1,4).
    - A vertical 2x1 rectangle: a blue pixel gets added on the same row and one column to the right (relative to the top-left corner of the component). The object with top at (2,2) gets a blue pixel at position (2,3).
    - An irregular object: we first look for a pixel with neighbors at south and east. The first pixel where this condition holds is at row=5, col=4 (neighbor at south is (6,4) and neighbor at east is at (5,5) which does not exists). A blue pixel gets added one row above and one column to the left, therefore at position (5,3).

3.  **All Other Pixels Remain Unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the identified azure objects remain with color 0.

**In essence, we detect the azure colored components and insert one single blue pixel for each one of these, according to their shape.**
