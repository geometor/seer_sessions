Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 azure rectangles, one in top-left and the other bottom-right."
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 azure rectangles, with no changes to initial blocks."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 blue squares"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Rectangles:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. In this case, there are two disconnected 2x1 azure rectangles.

2.  **Locate Empty Spots:** Iterate the positions next to the detected azure objects
    and search for white (color 0) cells.

3.  **Fill with Blue:** If, next to the object, there is a white (color 0) cell, change its color to blue (color 1). Top-left azure object only changes the first available empty position. The second azure object only fills one empty adjacent slot with blue.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule identifies disconnected azure rectangles, and for two of them, fills one adjacent white cell to blue.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: "Three separate azure objects. One 2x1 rectangle on top-right, one 2x1 rectangle rotated, and one L shaped azure object on bottom"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: "Same as the objects in the input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three 1x1 blue squares"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored objects in the input grid. In this case, there are three disconnected azure objects.

2.  **Locate Empty Spots:** Iterate the positions next to the detected azure objects and search for white (color 0) cells.

3.  **Fill with Blue:** If, next to the object, there is a white (color 0) cell, change its color to blue (color 1). Each azure object only changes the first available empty position next to them.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule identifies disconnected azure rectangles, and for each of them, fills one adjacent white cell to blue. The previous python implementation should work in this case.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
