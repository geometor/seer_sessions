Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects, some are single pixels, and others form larger connected components.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Identical to the input grid.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single blue pixels.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The first step is to identify all the azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Single Azure Pixels:** Find the azure pixels, from the previous set, that are composed by one element.

3.  **Change to blue next clockwise cell**: Find the azure pixels that have only one neighbor.
    For each of those single azure pixels, change its adjacent pixel to blue (color 1) using the next position in a clockwise direction.
   
**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation identifies isolated, single-pixel azure-colored objects. Then, it changes the color of one neighbor cell to the isolated azure object to blue (color 1). The movement follows a clockwise direction.
This description aligns with what's implemented in the Python code. The function `get_neighbors` helps to select the right neighbor and the use of a boolean value `is_single` helps us identify if the azure pixel is part of a bigger object, or if it should be considered for the transformation.
