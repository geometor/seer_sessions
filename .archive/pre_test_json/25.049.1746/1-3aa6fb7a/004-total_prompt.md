Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shapes, which might represent different objects or a combination
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single blue pixels.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we identify all azure (color 8) colored pixels.

2.  **Locate Single-pixel Objects:** Find two azure objects composed by a single azure element.

3.  **Change color**: From the set, move by one position clockwise the azure pixels and change their colors to blue (color 1).

**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation rule is a simple process. We look for single-pixel objects colored in azure and paint blue the cell next to them following a clockwise path.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies single-pixel azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. For each identified azure pixel, the adjacent pixel in the clockwise direction (starting from the top: top, right, bottom, left) is changed to blue (color 1).

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects, some are single pixels, and others form larger connected components.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Identical to the input grid.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single blue pixels.
  dimensions: [7, 7]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The first step is to identify all the azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Single Azure Pixels:** Find the azure pixels, from the previous set, that are composed by one element.

3.  **Change to blue next clockwise cell**: Find the azure pixels that have only one neighbor.
    For each of those single azure pixels, change its adjacent pixel to blue (color 1) using the next position in a clockwise direction.
   
**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation identifies isolated, single-pixel azure-colored objects. Then, it changes the color of one neighbor cell to the isolated azure object to blue (color 1). The movement follows a clockwise direction.
This description aligns with what's implemented in the Python code. The function `get_neighbors` helps to select the right neighbor and the use of a boolean value `is_single` helps us identify if the azure pixel is part of a bigger object, or if it should be considered for the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
