Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and one 1x2 horizontal shape.
        positions: 
          - (1,1) and (2,1) # top-left azure region
          - (3,5) and (4,5) # bottom-right azure region. The separate single azure is on (4,4)
        
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells

  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: same as input.
        positions: 
          - (1,1) and (2,1)
          - (3,5) and (4,5)
      - color: 1
        shape: single cell
        positions:
          - (1,2) # top-left azure region replaced with 1
          - (4,4) # bottom right azure region replaced with 1
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two separate regions of color `8` (azure). One is the vertical shape of size two composed by stacked azure cells on the second column. The second element is an horizontal shape composed by two azure cells side by side on the fifth column. There is a separate single azure cell on (4,4).

2.  **Predicate:** Select one azure object with only one cell. If it is not unique, then iterate.

3.  **Action, Change Color:** Change the color of the top cell of the vertical object from `8` to `1` (blue) and change the color of the left cell of the horizontal object from `8` to `1`.

In summary, two azure cells, top and left on each azure shape, were replaced by blue cells.
