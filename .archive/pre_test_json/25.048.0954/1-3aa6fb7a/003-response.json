They come in pairs of vertical or horizontal shapes.\n\n2.  **Predicate:** Differentiate the two main shapes: 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal.\n\n3.  **Action, Change Color:** Within each azure shape, specific cells change color.\n    *   For vertical shapes: The *top* cell changes from color 8 to 1.\n    *   For horizontal shapes: The *left* cell changes from color 8 to 1.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies vertical and horizontal azure colored shapes. On the vertical shapes, the upper azure cell is replaced with a blue cell and on the horizontal shapes the left azure cell is replaced with a blue cell.\n\nThe natural language program and the python code are still valid.\n"
