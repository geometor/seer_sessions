Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too simplistic, only preserving green (3) pixels and setting everything else to white (0). While this worked perfectly for Example 3, it failed on Examples 1 and 2 because it did not preserve the existing background color.

**Strategy:**

The core issue is that the transformation should keep the green pixels and retain a white background. Example 1 has 18 extra white pixels (3x3 and 3x3 block). example 2 misses white, red, and azure pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**
Here's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has green, yellow, blue, and red objects on a white background.
    *   The code correctly identified and preserved the green object.
    *    The code did *not* preserve the background, but, coincidentally, the background is the same color as the background of the correct output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has a green object, red object, and azure colored objects on a white background.
    *   Output only contains the green object on white background.
    *   The code correctly preserved the green object.
    *   The code did *not* preserve the background, but, coincidentally, the background is the same color as the background of the correct output.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input contains a green object, azure colored objects, and orange colored objects on a white background.
    *   Output contains only the green object.
    *   The transformation was correct.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Consider these as distinct objects. One of these is the background.
2.  **Find Green Objects:** Iterate through all the identified objects.
3.  **Preserve Green, remove the others:** copy the green object to the output grid.
4. **Set Background Color:** Fill any other pixels (the background) of the output with white (0).

Essentially this is a "keep only the green objects, and set the background to
white", or "remove all objects that are not green, ensure background is white".
