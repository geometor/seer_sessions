Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies rectangular objects and filters based on color. However, it's too strict. It only *keeps* green and yellow, while the examples show it should keep green and *sometimes* yellow, or azure. In example 2, the yellow rectangle is removed when it should be. The consistent rule across all valid examples seems to be: Keep Green objects.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Color Filtering:** Modify the natural language program to focus solely on retaining green rectangles.
2.  **Re-evaluate Object Definition:** Ensure the object finding is robust and handles various shapes, but currently, only rectangles are in the data, so focus on them.
3. **Remove other colors**

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Contains red, blue, yellow, and green rectangles.
    *   **Expected Output:** Only the green and one of the yellow rectangles are retained.
    *   **Actual Output:** Green and both yellow rectangles are retained.
    *   **Issue:** The program includes all yellow objects.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains red, yellow and green rectangles.
    *   **Expected Output:** Removes all of the red and yellow rectangles and keeps only the green
    *   **Actual Output:** Keeps the green rectangle, but also keeps a yellow rectangle.
    *    **Issue:** The program includes yellow, when it should not.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Contains azure, orange, and green rectangles.
    *   **Expected Output:** Only the green rectangle is retained.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only the green rectangle is retained.
    *   **Issue:** No issues, this example worked perfectly.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (excluding white/0).
2.  **Selective Retention:** Retain green rectangles.
3.  **Removal:** Remove all other color rectangles.
4.  **Output:** Produce a new grid with the selected color areas (green) retained and all others replaced with the background (white/0).
