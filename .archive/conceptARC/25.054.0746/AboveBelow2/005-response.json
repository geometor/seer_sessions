            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program correctly identified the core concept: finding rectangular objects and selectively retaining those of a specific color (green/3). However, it failed in some cases because other colored objects could overlap with a green object and get included in the output when only the green part should have been.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe current strategy is mostly correct, but it's not precise enough regarding \"objects.\" It appears to be retaining the bounding box of green objects, even if non-green pixels are also present.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 18\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel counts: False\n    *    Observation: the extra yellow pixels are being kept because the green box shares a line with yellow objects.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 48\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n        *   Observation: The same type of issue occurred as in Example 1, where the green object bounding box included extra color pixels.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels off: 0\n    *   Size correct: True\n    *   Color palette correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n    *    Observation: this case works because no other objects are on the same line as the green object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: green\n    shape: rectangle\n    action: retain\n  - color: other\n    shape: rectangle\n    action: remove\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color (excluding white/0). An object is any grouping of adjacent pixels, not just rectangles.\n2.  **Selective Retention:** Keep only the green (color 3) objects.\n3.  **Removal:** Remove all other colored objects, replacing their pixels with the background color (white/0).\n4.  **Output:** Create a new grid where only the green objects are present, and everything else is white.\n"
