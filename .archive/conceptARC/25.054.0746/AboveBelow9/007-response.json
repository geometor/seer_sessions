The primary colors observed are orange (7), yellow (4), and white (0). The input grid contains distinct shapes formed by orange and yellow pixels, while the output grid seems to simplify or eliminate some of these shapes. The most notable change is the complete removal of the orange (7) shapes below the yellow (4) line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
