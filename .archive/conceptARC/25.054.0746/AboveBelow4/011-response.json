            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying objects and horizontal border pixels was partially correct. However, the trigger-insert logic is flawed. It correctly identifies *when* a change should happen (adjacent to a border pixel of a specific color), but it doesn't correctly capture the *directionality* of the change, and relies too heavily on the trigger color being present in output after the change, which may not be the case. Also, the current logic only looks for *horizontal* changes and won't apply a needed change if there are no eligible horizontal neighbors.\n\nThe core issue is that the code changes pixels adjacent to the border pixel *only if* those neighboring pixels are *not* the insert or trigger. The code should simply change the neighbor in output to the *insert* color regardless of current value in input *or* output.\n\nThe algorithm needs to focus on identifying the *changed* pixels between the input and output grids, and from that, deducing the rule for the change. It should *not* rely on the trigger color remaining unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the examples, focusing on relevant information for debugging:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains objects of color 2 (red) and 4 (yellow).\n*   **Output:** Some red pixels adjacent to yellow are replaced with yellow, others are unchanged. Yellow pixels are unchanged.\n*   **Observation:** The changed pixels are always where red (2) is to the left or right of yellow (4). Red (2) pixels to the left of yellow become yellow (4). Red (2) pixels to the right of yellow (4) become yellow. Yellow (4) object is the *stable* object and expands into adjacent red (2) pixels.\n*   **Mismatch:** The code did not change any pixels.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains objects of color 3 (green) and 6 (magenta).\n*   **Output:** Some green pixels adjacent to magenta become magenta.\n* **Observation:** The changed pixels are always green (3) to the left or right of magenta(6). Green pixels next to Magenta become magenta. Magenta (6) object is the *stable* object which expands into adjacent green (3) pixels.\n*   **Mismatch:** The code did not change any pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    stable_object_color: 4  # Yellow\n    changing_object_color: 2  # Red\n    change_direction: \"adjacent\" # Red next to yellow changes to yellow\n    border: horizontal\n\n  - id: 2\n    stable_object_color: 6  # Magenta\n    changing_object_color: 3  # Green\n    change_direction: \"adjacent\"   # Green next to magenta changes to magenta.\n    border: horizontal\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects, where each object is a contiguous region of pixels of the same color.\n\n2.  **Identify Stable and Changing Colors:** Compare each input/output pair. Determine which color expands into the other color. The expanding color is *stable*, the other color is *changing*.\n\n3. **Find Horizontal Neighbors:** For each pixel in the input grid check its left and right neighbors.\n\n4.  **Apply Rule:**\n    *   If a pixel is the *changing* color, and is horizontally adjacent (left or right) to a pixel of *stable* color, the *changing* pixel becomes the *stable* color in the output grid.\n\n**Revised Strategy**\nFocus on identifying corresponding pixels in the input and output and determining color adjacency. Then, determine a simple rule that explains what changes. Finally, apply this rule to *all* objects in the input.\n"
