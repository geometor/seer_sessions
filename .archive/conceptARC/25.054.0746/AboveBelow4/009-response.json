            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a misinterpretation of the first training example. The original natural language program assumed that color 6 (magenta) was inserted next to *any* region of color 3 (green).  The second example clearly demonstrates a more specific rule: Color 6 (magenta) is inserted adjacent to color 3 (green) *only if the color 3 is on the border or edge of a larger object*. The existing code doesn't consider what the 3's are part of. It just adds 6's to the horizontal neighbors unconditionally.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** We need to identify objects first, and then find color 3 (green) pixels at the horizontal edges (borders) of these objects.\n2.  **Conditional Insertion:** Only insert color 6 (magenta) adjacent to these border pixels.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Test the refined logic against all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\nNote - I cannot use code here, so I'll describe what I would do and provide estimated results.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Objects:** We have several distinct objects (regions of contiguous pixels) in the expected output.\n    *   **Color 3 Border Pixels:** The expected output shows that color 4 is being inserted next to color 2.\n        *   I would use code to iterate through the *expected output* grid, identify all '2' pixels, check their horizontal neighbors, and see if the neighbor *was* a '4' in the original.\n    *   **Action:** Color 4 is being added.\n    *   **Error Analysis:**  The current code does not identify different colored regions or find border pixels, explaining the incorrect transformation.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Objects:** Several distinct objects.\n    *    Color 3 Border Pixels: The expected output shows that color 6 is being insert next to color 3\n    *    Action: Color 6 is being added.\n    *   **Error Analysis:** Again, the code lacks object and border awareness. It incorrectly adds 6's next to all 3s.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: Contiguous regions of the same color.\n    properties:\n      - color: integer (0-9)\n      - shape: irregular\n      - border_pixels: list of (row, col) tuples\n        border_definition: horizontal_edges\n\nactions:\n  - name: insert_color\n    trigger:\n      object_property: border_pixels\n      color_to_insert: varies by object and color\n    location:\n      relative_to: border_pixel\n      direction: horizontal\n    constraints:\n        - neighbor_is_not: insert_color\n        - neighbor_is_not: trigger_color\n\ncolor_mapping:\n    example_1:\n        trigger: 2\n        insert: 4\n    example_2:\n        trigger: 3\n        insert: 6\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects, where each object is a contiguous region of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Find Border Pixels:** For each object, identify its border pixels. In this case, a border pixel is defined as a pixel within the object that has a horizontal neighbor (left or right) *that is part of a different object or the edge of the grid*.\n3. **Determine Trigger and Insert Colors:** From the training set inputs and outputs, locate pairs of pixels that are horizontally adjacent. One pixel from each pair will be the *trigger*, and the other will be the *insert*. Record all unique trigger, insert pairs.\n4.  **Conditional Insertion:**\n    * Iterate through all trigger, insert color pairs found in step 3.\n    * Locate the border pixels of each object in the input_grid.\n    * If a border pixel is a trigger color, check its immediate horizontal neighbors.\n        *  If a horizontal neighbor is not the same as either the *trigger* or *insert* color, change that neighboring pixel's color to the *insert* color.\n\n"
