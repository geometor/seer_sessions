"""
Identify diagonal lines in the input grid. A diagonal line is a sequence of one or more pixels of the same color, where each subsequent pixel is one row down and one column to the right of the previous pixel. For each identified diagonal line, extend the line downwards and to the right. Extension Rule: Add pixels of the *same color* as the original diagonal line. Add one pixel below the last pixel of the diagonal, and one to the right. Continue adding pixels one row down, one column right, until the edges of the grid are reached (either the bottom edge or right edge). Overwrite existing pixels during extension.
