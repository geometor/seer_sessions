Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (likely 2D array) of numerical values, where `0` represents white and `3` represents green. The transformation seems to involve expanding the green pixels (`3`) downwards and to the right. The expansion appears to fill the entire remaining area of the grid, bounded by its original diagonal line.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 3
        color: green
  - observation: Green pixels form a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.
  - transformation: Green pixels expand.
  - expansion_direction: Downwards and to the right.
  - expansion_limit:  Original diagonal forms a boundary, and the expansion continues to the grid edges.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all green pixels (value `3`) in the input grid.
2.  **Propagate:** For each green pixel, change all pixels below it and all the pixels to its right, including itself, to green (value `3`). The green pixels will expand to the lower and right boundaries of the grid.
