Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly handled the first example, which involved filling to the left of a top-left to bottom-right diagonal. However, the second example revealed a flaw: the filling logic after finding the "bottom-left to top-right" diagonal was not handled correctly. The extension logic to fill complete rows applied to all diagonals incorrectly. It should only occur after a bottom-left to top-right diagonal is filled to the right.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Diagonal Filling:** Make sure the filling is happening on the correct side of the diagonal by updating the natural language program and therefore the code.
2.  **Conditional Extension:** The row extension (filling the remaining rows) should only be applied when the diagonal is from the bottom-left to the top-right, *and* filling is to the right.

**Metrics and Reports:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (11, 14)
    *   Output Shape: (11, 14)
    *   Diagonal Direction: Top-Left to Bottom-Right
    *   Fill Direction: Left
    *   Color: Yellow (4)
    *   Match: True

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (11, 12)
    *   Output Shape: (11, 12)
    *   Diagonal Direction: Bottom-Left to Top-Right
    *   Fill Direction: Right
    *   Color: Green (3)
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels off: Only rows after the diagonal were extended, the first line with the diagonal was not extended.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    objects:
      - type: diagonal
        color: yellow
        direction: top_left_to_bottom_right
        fill: left
    transformation:
      - fill_left_of_diagonal: yellow
  - id: 2
    objects:
      - type: diagonal
        color: green
        direction: bottom_left_to_top_right
        fill: right
    transformation:
      - fill_right_of_diagonal: green
      - extend_fill_down: true

```

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** Determine the target `color` for the diagonal, the `fill_direction` (left or right), and the `diagonal_direction` (top-left to bottom-right, or bottom-left to top-right).

2.  **Locate the Diagonal:** Find the longest diagonal line of pixels matching the target `color` and `diagonal_direction`.

3.  **Fill based on Direction:**
    *   If `fill_direction` is "left", for each row, change all pixels to the *left* of the diagonal pixel in that row to the target `color`.
    *   If `fill_direction` is "right", for each row, change all pixels to the *right* of the diagonal pixel in that row to the target `color`.

4.  **Conditional Extension (Example 2):** If and *only if* the `diagonal_direction` is "bottom-left to top-right" AND the `fill_direction` is "right", then extend the filling to the bottom of the grid. This means, after filling to the right of the diagonal, continue filling all subsequent rows completely with the target `color`.
