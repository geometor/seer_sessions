A rectangle is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color, with a width of at least 2 and where all the rows are complete to that width.\n2.  **Determine Destination Row:** The destination for this rectangle is the row immediately below its original *top* row, unless it would overlap other objects, in which case it is skipped..\n3.  **Clear Source:** The source area of the top-most rectangle is cleared (all pixels set to black/0).\n4.  **Redraw Rectangle:** Redraw the rectangle at the new position. The new top row of the rectangle becomes the destination row.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_top_rectangle(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the top-most horizontal rectangle in the grid.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    top_rectangle = None\n    top_row = rows  # Initialize with a row number that's beyond the grid\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                width = 0\n                # Check for horizontal rectangle\n                c_temp = c\n                while c_temp < cols and grid[r, c_temp] == color:\n                    width += 1\n                    c_temp += 1\n\n                if width > 1: # is it a rectangle? width must be > 1\n                    # check if all rows below until color changes are same\n                    height = 1\n                    r_temp = r + 1\n                    valid_rect = True\n                    while r_temp < rows and grid[r_temp,c] == color:\n                        for i in range(width):\n                            if c + i >= cols or grid[r_temp, c+i] != color:\n                                valid_rect = False\n                                break\n                        if not valid_rect:\n                            break\n\n                        height += 1\n                        r_temp += 1\n\n                    if valid_rect: # we found a rectangle, now check to mark it as visited.\n                        for i in range(r, r + height):\n                            for j in range(c, c + width):\n                                visited[i,j] = True\n\n                        if r < top_row: # is this the top most?\n                            top_row = r\n                            top_rectangle = ((r, c), (width, height), color)\n\n\n    return top_rectangle\n\ndef redraw_rectangle(grid, start_pos, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Redraws the rectangle at the new position.\"\"\"\n    new_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    r, c = start_pos\n    width, height = size\n    new_r = r + 1  # Destination row is one below the original top row\n\n    # Check for out of bounds\n    if new_r + height > new_grid.shape[0]:\n        return new_grid  # Don't move if it goes out of bounds\n\n    # clear source\n    for i in range(r, r+height):\n      for j in range(c, c+width):\n        new_grid[i,j] = 0\n\n    # Redraw at new position\n    for i in range(new_r, new_r + height):\n        for j in range(c, c + width):\n            new_grid[i, j] = color\n\n    return new_grid\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the top-most horizontal rectangle\n    top_rect = find_top_rectangle(output_grid)\n\n    # If a rectangle is found, redraw it one row down.\n    if top_rect:\n        start_pos, size, color = top_rect\n        output_grid = redraw_rectangle(output_grid, start_pos, size, color)\n    return output_grid\n```"
