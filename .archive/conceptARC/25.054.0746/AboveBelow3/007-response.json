The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), magenta (6), and white (0). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). The transformation seems to involve a vertical shift or \"sliding\" of a specific part of the grid upwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Everything from the top until the beginning of the large magenta block is moved.\n\n3.  **Maintain Middle Regions:** The large rectangular magenta (6) region remain in its original position.\n\n4.  **Preserve Bottom region:** Bottom red region does not change.\n\nIn essence, the transformation is a downward shift of only the top red region by two rows, leaving the other colored regions untouched.\n"
