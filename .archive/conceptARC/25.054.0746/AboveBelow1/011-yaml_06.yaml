    output_shape: [11, 12]
    match: False
    pixels_off: 4
    notes: >
      The code failed to blank the rows *after* the horizontal line. The 4
      pixels that don't match are due to keeping rows that should be blanked
      (specifically, the yellow and black pixels in rows 8-10. Row 3 is
      correctly kept, and all subsequent rows are incorrectly kept)
    objects:

    output_shape: [10, 16]
    match: True
    pixels_off: 0
    notes: >
      The code works correctly because the horizontal line is followed only by
      rows that are already blank (or should remain blank).

    input_shape: [9, 16]
    output_shape: [9, 16]
    match: False
    pixels_off: 8
    notes: >
      The horizontal line at row 3 is preserved correctly, but rows after it are not blanked.
      The pixels on row 4 that should be blanked are not.
