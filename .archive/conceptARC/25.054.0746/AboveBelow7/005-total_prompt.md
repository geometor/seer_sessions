"""
1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Find a rectangle object (contiguous block of pixels of the same color). Record its color, top-left, and bottom-right coordinates.
    *   Find a U-shaped object (contiguous block of pixels forming a 'U' shape, opening upwards). Record its color, and bounding box. The color may vary.
2.  **Handle Missing Objects:**
    *   If either the rectangle or the U-shape is not found, return the input grid unchanged.
3. **Determine new position:**
    * Find the top most row of the rectangle.
    * Find the top most row of the U-shape.
4.  **Swap Positions:**
    *   Clear the original positions of both objects in the output grid.
    *   Redraw the rectangle at the original vertical position of the U-shape.
    *   Redraw the U-shape at the original vertical position of the rectangle.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**
    * Ensure all other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
