Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The colors present are primarily white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The shapes formed by the azure and red pixels appear to be the primary objects of interest. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. There is a noticeable shift or rearrangement of the azure (8) colored sections.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_region_1
    color: azure (8)
    type: contiguous_region
    initial_position: top_left
    final_position: bottom_left
  - id: azure_region_2
    color: azure (8)
    type: contiguous_region
    initial_position: top_middle
    final_position: bottom_middle_right
  - id: red_region
    color: red (2)
    type: contiguous_region
    position: middle
    shape: constant

actions:
  - type: move
    object: azure_region_1
    direction: down
  - type: move
    object: azure_region_2
    direction: down and right

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: azure regions move while the red region remains stationary.
  - type: boundary
    description: all objects are contained and do not overlap
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels and the contiguous region of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Azure Region Movement:** Move the top-left azure region to the bottom-left. Move the top-center azure region to the bottom right, adjacent to existing pixels.
3.  **Red Region Stability:** The red region maintains its shape and relative position within the grid. It does not move.
4. The white area fills the area where no colors are assigned.

In essence, the transformation involves a downward and potentially sideways shift of the azure regions, while the red region acts as a fixed element.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
