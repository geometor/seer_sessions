            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding of the transformation, focusing solely on the movement of red blocks and their positions in specific rows. The results from the second example show that the transformation isn't simply about copying red blocks to fixed positions, but it is specific about row and column positions for copying. It appears to extend row 5 to row 6.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption that red blocks are *always* moved to rows 7 and 8 is incorrect. We need a more flexible rule.\n2.  **Focus on Relative Movement:** Instead of hardcoded row/column indices, we need to think about *how* the red blocks move relative to their original positions or relative to other elements in the grid.\n3.    **Object Properties:** consider that the length of continuous object may be important\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use the provided results and visual inspection (since I can see the images) to build the report.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Red blocks on row 4. Other colors present.\n    *   Expected Output: red blocks extending down 2 rows\n    *   Actual Output: red block did not move, row 5 and 6 unchanged\n    *   Observations: The code incorrectly assumed the output would put 2's in row 7 and 8.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Red blocks on row 5 and row 7. Other colors present.\n    *   Expected output: Red extended on row 6 and row 8, col 8/9 red unchanged\n    *   Actual output: red extended on row 7 correctly, 8 is wrong\n    *   Observations: The code almost captured movement, but made an error about positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: red\n    type: contiguous_block\n    properties:\n      - can_move: true\n      - movement_type: conditional_extension\n      - shape: variable\n      - extend_down: true\n  - color: other\n    type: background\n    properties:\n      - can_move: false\n\nactions:\n - object: red_block\n   type: extend\n   details: |-\n        The code correctly recognized the presence of red blocks and attempted a transformation. The conditional move logic, hardcoded to rows 7 and 8, is partially correct for the example set seen so far, the rows are not hardcoded, but relative.\n        It extends a continuous red block down, copying the block.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Find all contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Conditional Extension:** For each contiguous block of red pixels:\n     * Extend one row down and copy the object.\n\n"
