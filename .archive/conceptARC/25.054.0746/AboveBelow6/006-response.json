Expansion and Overwrite For each red band, starting from the top-most:\n    *   Copy the pixels from the row where the red band starts.\n    *   Insert two copies of this row immediately below the start row of the red band. The original rows below the expanded rows, are overwritten by the expansion.\n    *   If there is no room, skip the expansion for that band.\n4.  No Padding. Do not add extra padding rows.\n5.
