Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too simplistic. It correctly identified the azure (8) pixels but didn't accurately reproduce their positions relative to other objects or background. It seems the code is attempting to extract *all* azure pixels, but it is not consistently placing them relative to the input. It is placing the azure pixels at the correct location, but it is failing to set to 0 any azure pixels that do not exist in the output. The strategy should be to find azure pixels, and then determine if those azure pixels should also appear in the output, and if so, keep the position.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Misplaced Pixels:** Carefully examine the `pixels_off` in each example. Determine *why* those specific pixels are incorrect. Are they azure pixels that shouldn't be there, or are other colored pixels incorrectly modified?
2.  **Relative Positioning:** The key seems to be understanding that only *some* of the azure pixels are retained. We need to determine the *rule* that dictates which azure pixels are kept and which are discarded, and also the final locations. It probably is not the absolute position, but their position relative to other objects.
3. **Object Identification**: Consider if there is an object defined by the azure color, and if so, should the entire object be identified?

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a more detailed analysis:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has several colors (0, 3, 8, 6, 7, 4). Output has only 0 and 8.
    *   The azure (8) pixels form a distinct shape in both input and output. The output maintains a subset of the original azure pixels in the *same shape*.
    *    Pixels off are azure colored, and have value 8 in the input, but should be zero.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has colors (3, 8, 2, 7, 9, 1). Output has only 0 and 8.
    *   Similar to example 1, the output seems to retain a *subset* of the azure pixels, maintaining relative positioning.
    *   Pixels off are azure colored, and have value 8 in the input, but should be zero.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has colors (0, 3, 8, 1). Output contains only 0 and 8.
    *   Again, a subset of azure pixels is retained.
    *   Pixels off are azure colored, and have value 8 in the input, but should be zero.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_colors: [0, 3, 8, 6, 7, 4]
      output_colors: [0, 8]
      azure_pixels:
        input_count: 10
        output_count: 10  # Expected, but not achieved by current code
        retained: partial # some are kept, some are not
      other_pixels: changed # all non-azure pixels in input are 0 in output
      objects:
          - color: 8
            description: connected azure region
            status: partially retained in output

  - example_2:
      input_colors: [3, 8, 2, 7, 9, 1]
      output_colors: [0, 8]
      azure_pixels:
          input_count: 14
          output_count: 14
          retained: partial
      other_pixels: changed
      objects:
          - color: 8
            description: connected azure region
            status: partially retained

  - example_3:
      input_colors: [0, 3, 8, 1]
      output_colors: [0, 8]
      azure_pixels:
         input_count: 12
         output_count: 12
         retained: partial
      other_pixels: changed
      objects:
          - color: 8
            description: connected azure region
            status: partially retained in output
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Azure Regions:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions, filled entirely with grey (0) pixels.
3. **Copy Selected Azure Regions.** Copy *all* the azure pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining the original position of the pixel.
4. **Set Other Pixels.** Set all the non-azure pixels in the output grid to grey (0).

In short, this program says copy the azure pixels and eliminate all others.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
