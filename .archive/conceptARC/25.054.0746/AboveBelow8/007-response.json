The primary focus seems to be on isolating and highlighting a specific color (azure, represented by the number 8) within the input grid. All other colors are replaced with white (represented by 0) in the output grid, with all color beside 8 set to 0. The shape formed by the azure pixels appears to be maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
