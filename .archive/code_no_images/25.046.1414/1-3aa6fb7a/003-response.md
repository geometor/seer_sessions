Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Scattered L and line shapes, various orientations.
      position:
        - Top-right corner.
        - Middle-left.
        - Bottom-right.
      count: 3 groups

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Same as input.
      position: Same as input
      count: 3 groups
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single pixel
      position: Adjacent to azure pixels, where the azure pixel has only one azure neighbor.
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve:** Copy all azure objects to the output grid without changing their positions or shapes.

3.  **Change:** For each azure (color 8) pixel, count the number of adjacent azure pixels (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally). If an azure pixel has exactly one adjacent azure pixel, and the neighboring position in the direction opposite to it is 0, add a blue pixel(color 1) at the empty(color 0) available position.

**Elaboration and Key Insights**

*   The core transformation is the addition of blue pixels adjacent to specific azure pixels.
*   The rule for adding blue pixels is based on the number of adjacent azure pixels: only azure pixels with exactly one azure neighbor receive an adjacent blue pixel, and only when available.
* The previous implementation is consistent with the new example.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2. Copy the azure objects to the output grid.
3. Find every azure object that is adjacent with only one cell in its x or y axis and add a blue (color 1) pixel adjacent to it, where available.
