Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at the top-right. The second is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the center-left. The last one is a 1x2 horizontal rectangle in the bottom-center.

2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is almost identical to the input grid. The difference is that a blue pixel (color 1) has appeared immediately to the right of the top-most azure pixel in each object.

**YAML Summary:**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (0,4)  # top-left corner coordinates
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (2,2)
  - color: 8
    shape: 1x2 rectangle
    position: (6,3)

output_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (0,4)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (0,5)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (2,2)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (2,3)
  - color: 8
    shape: 1x2 rectangle
    position: (6,3)
    - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example and can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects within the input grid.
2.  **Find Top-Most Pixel:** For each identified azure object, determine its top-most pixel.
3.  **Place Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, place a blue (color 1) pixel to the immediate right of the top-most pixel of the azure object. If the location to the right is already occupied or outside the boundary, it is skipped.

The natural language program is the same as that provided in the first example.
