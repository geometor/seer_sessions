Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the left, and the other is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the right.

2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a blue pixel (color 1) has appeared directly to the right of the top-most azure pixel of each object.

**YAML Summary:**




*text:*

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)  # top-left corner coordinates
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (3,4)

output_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (1,2)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (3,4)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  For each azure object, locate its top-most pixel.
3.  If a pixel to the right of the top-most pixel is within the boundary, and that location is '0', set the value of the output grid at that location to blue (color 1).

**Python Implementation:**

```python
"""
Identify azure (color 8) objects. For each, find the topmost pixel.
If a '0' pixel exists immediately to the right, change it to blue (color 1).
"""
