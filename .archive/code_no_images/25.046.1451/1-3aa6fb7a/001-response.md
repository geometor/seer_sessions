Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
       shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two 1x1 blue objects.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all objects with color 8 (azure) in the input grid. In this case, we have two such objects. One is a 1x2 vertical line at (1,1) and (2,1). Another is a 2x1 horizontal line at (3,4),(3,5), (4,5).

2. **Place Blue Pixel:** For each object, the intent is to perform a replacement of some cells with blue.
The target cells are the azure cell on the right of other azure cells.

3.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels that are not transformed to blue should be kept.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The rule identifies azure objects, and then adds a blue pixel to the right of them.
