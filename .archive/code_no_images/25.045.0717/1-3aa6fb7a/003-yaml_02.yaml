task_context: "Grid transformation with connected regions and directional modification"
transformation_rule: "Identify and order connected regions of color 8. Modify a single cell adjacent to the top-leftmost cell of the first region in the order for which a valid modification is possible, following a cycle of directions (Right, Down, Left, Up)."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "top-leftmost cell"
      - "adjacent cell"
actions:
  - "identify connected regions of color 8"
  - "order regions based on top-leftmost cell position"
  - "iterate through regions in order"
  - "determine direction from cycle (Right, Down, Left, Up) based on region order"
  - "calculate target cell based on top-leftmost cell and direction"
  - "check if target cell is within bounds and color 0"
  - "if conditions met, change target cell color to 1 and stop"
predicates:
  - "connected"
  - "same color"
  - "top-leftmost"
  - "adjacent"
  - "within bounds"
  - "color 0"
  - "first region in order"
  - "direction (Right, Down, Left, Up)"
