Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped tetrominoes"
  size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped tetrominoes"
      
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two, single-cell, isolated objects"
  size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of azure cells.

2.  **Locate Upper-Leftmost Azure Pixel:** Find the azure pixel that is most to the upper-left of the full shape it belongs to.

3. **Change to Blue**: Change the color from azure to blue.

4. **Repeat for all azure objects**: Do the same for every object.

**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation rule focuses on changing to blue the color of the upper-left azure pixel of each separate azure object.
The core concept is object identification, finding a specific property (the upper-leftmost coordinate), and color modification.
