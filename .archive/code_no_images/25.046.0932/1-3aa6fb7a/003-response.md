Okay, let's analyze the second example's transformation.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate objects. Two L-shaped tetrominoes and one single pixel"
  size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate objects. Two L-shaped tetrominoes and one single pixel"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single-cell objects"
  size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is identical to the previous example:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all distinct azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  **Locate Upper-Leftmost Azure Pixel:**  For *each* azure object, determine the pixel that has the smallest row and column indices. This is the top-leftmost pixel of that object.
3.  **Change to Blue:** Change the color of *only* that top-leftmost pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).
4. **Repeat for all objects.**

**Explanation and Justification**

The transformation rule is consistent. The core concepts are:

*   **Object Identification:** The ability to distinguish separate contiguous regions of the same color (azure).
*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Determining the "top-leftmost" pixel within each object. This requires comparing row and column indices.
*   **Color Manipulation:**  Changing the color of a specific pixel based on its spatial properties within an object.

The program written for the previous example will produce the right output for the second example.
