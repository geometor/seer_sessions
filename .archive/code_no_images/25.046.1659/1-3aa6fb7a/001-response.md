Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped structures, one on left, other on right."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Same as the input, two L-shapes."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single cells"
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8). The first is at the top-left, and the second is at the bottom-right.

2.  **Detect Change**: We observe that the azure objects maintain their shape and position. However, the blue color (1) occupies the rightmost cell of each L-shape's top segment.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    -   Locate the two azure L-shaped objects.
    -   Paint with blue the cell located directly to the right of the azure cell in the top row of each of the two shapes.

In summary: Find L shapes, locate cells next to their top part, and paint in a different color.
