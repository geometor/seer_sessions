Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the top-left, and the other is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the bottom-right.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a single blue pixel (color 1) has been added directly to the right of the top-most azure pixel of each azure object.

**YAML Summary:**



*text:*
```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: top-left
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: bottom-right

output_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: top-left
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: bottom-right
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1
    position: adjacent right to the object above

transformation:
  - For each azure colored (8) object, insert color 1 to its immediate right, aligning it to the top most pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is: "For each vertically oriented 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue pixel (color 1) immediately to the right of its top-most azure pixel."

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
