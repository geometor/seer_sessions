Okay, let's analyze the second set of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. All are 2x1 rectangles, but this time they can be horizontal or vertical. One is horizontal at the top-right. One is vertical on the mid-left. The other is vertical in the bottom-center.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a single blue pixel (color 1) has been added. If the object is vertical, the blue pixel is placed directly to the right of the *top-most* azure pixel. If the object is horizontal, the blue pixel is placed directly *below* the left-most azure pixel.

**YAML Summary:**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: horizontal
    position: top-right
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: vertical
    position: mid-left
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: vertical
    position: bottom-center

output_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: horizontal
    position: top-right
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: vertical
    position: mid-left
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    orientation: vertical
    position: bottom-center
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1
    position: adjacent right to the top pixel for vertical
              adjacent bottom to the left pixel for horizontal

transformation:
  - For each azure colored (8) 2x1 rectangle, insert color 1.
  - if the rectangle is vertical, to its immediate right of top, aligning it to the top most pixel.
  - if the rectangle is horizontal, below its leftmost pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is: "For each 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue pixel (color 1). If the rectangle is vertical, add the blue pixel immediately to the right of its top-most azure pixel. If the rectangle is horizontal, add the blue pixel immediately below its left-most azure pixel." This captures the orientation-dependent placement of the blue pixel.
