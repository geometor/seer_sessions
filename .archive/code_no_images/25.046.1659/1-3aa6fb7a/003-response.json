            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second set of input and output grids.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. All are 2x1 rectangles, but this time they can be horizontal or vertical. One is horizontal at the top-right. One is vertical on the mid-left. The other is vertical in the bottom-center.\n*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a single blue pixel (color 1) has been added. If the object is vertical, the blue pixel is placed directly to the right of the *top-most* azure pixel. If the object is horizontal, the blue pixel is placed directly *below* the left-most azure pixel.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: horizontal\n    position: top-right\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: vertical\n    position: mid-left\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: vertical\n    position: bottom-center\n\noutput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: horizontal\n    position: top-right\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: vertical\n    position: mid-left\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    orientation: vertical\n    position: bottom-center\n  - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1\n    position: adjacent right to the top pixel for vertical\n              adjacent bottom to the left pixel for horizontal\n\ntransformation:\n  - For each azure colored (8) 2x1 rectangle, insert color 1.\n  - if the rectangle is vertical, to its immediate right of top, aligning it to the top most pixel.\n  - if the rectangle is horizontal, below its leftmost pixel.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is: \"For each 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue pixel (color 1). If the rectangle is vertical, add the blue pixel immediately to the right of its top-most azure pixel. If the rectangle is horizontal, add the blue pixel immediately below its left-most azure pixel.\" This captures the orientation-dependent placement of the blue pixel.\n"
