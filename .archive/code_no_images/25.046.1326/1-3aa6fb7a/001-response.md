Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two L-shaped objects, one in the top left and another in the bottom right corner of the active area.
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]], [[3,5], [3,6], [4,6]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: same as input
      positions: Same as in input grid [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]], [[3,5], [3,6], [4,6]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single-celled object
      positions: [[1,2], [4,5]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Preserve all of the original objects:** The objects of colour 8 from the input must appear at the same place in the output.

3. **Detect singleton object:**
The singletons are made of only one cell, in the position that corresponds to the relative position of the original object in the group of objects of the same shape and color.

4.  **Add New Objects:** For each azure object, add a new object of color 1(blue):
    *   For the "L" shape at the top left, a blue cell is added immediately to the right of the top-most azure cell.
    *   For the "L" shape at the bottom right, a blue cell is added immediatly to the left of the bottom-most azure cell.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The rule consists in preserving every object of the original image and adding two blue singletons that are placed depending on the structure of the two "L" shapes.
