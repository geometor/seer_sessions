One is an \"L\" shape in the top-left quadrant, and the other one is a \"reverse L\" shape in the bottom right quadrant. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).\n\n2.  **Detect Change**: The azure objects did not changed. However, two new blue cells appeared.\n\n3.  **Determine Rule of Change**: Looking at the input and the output and knowing that the azure objects did not change, the azure pixel adjacent to the top-left most azure object of the L-shape changes to blue. The azure pixel adjacent to the bottom-right most azure object of the reverse L-shape changes also to blue.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe azure objects are identified, and a simple predicate (change to blue the top-left most or bottom-right most azure pixel).\n"
