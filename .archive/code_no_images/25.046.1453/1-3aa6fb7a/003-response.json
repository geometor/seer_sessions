            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:**  Contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. The objects appear to be of size 2x1 or 1x1.\n*   **Output Grid:** The azure objects remain unchanged. A blue pixel (color 1) has been added immediately to the right of the top-most azure pixel of *each* azure object, similar to the first example.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 8  # Azure\n    shape: Various (2x1 or 1x1 rectangles)\n    position: Scattered across the grid\n  - color: 0 # white\n    shape: background\n\ntransformation:\n  - action: add\n    color: 1  # Blue\n    position: directly right of the top-most azure pixel of each object.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is consistent with the first example:\n\n1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.\n2.  For each azure object, locate the top-most pixel.\n3.  Change the color of the pixel immediately to the right of this top-most pixel to blue (color 1).\n4.  All the other pixels keep their color.\n\nThe rule applies consistently regardless of the shape or position of the azure objects, as long as they are distinct. The key is finding the top-most pixel of *each* azure object and placing a blue pixel to its right.\n"
