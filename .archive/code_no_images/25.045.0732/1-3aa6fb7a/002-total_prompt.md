**Natural Language Program:**

For each contiguous block of color 8 (azure) in the input grid:
1. Identify all cells belonging to the block.
2. Find the cell within this block that is located at the topmost row and then leftmost column (prioritizing rows, then columns in reading order). Let's call this the 'top-leftmost' cell of the block.
3. Calculate the sum of the row index and column index of this 'top-leftmost' cell.
4. If this sum is less than 5, then change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the 'top-leftmost' cell to color 1 (blue).
5. If this sum is greater than or equal to 5, then change the color of the cell immediately below the 'top-leftmost' cell to color 1 (blue).

This transformation is applied independently to each block of color 8 in the input grid. Cells that are not part of a color 8 block, or are adjacent to it but not selected by the transformation rule, remain unchanged.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
