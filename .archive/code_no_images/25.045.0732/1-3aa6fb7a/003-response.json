Find the cell within this block that is located at the topmost row and then leftmost column (prioritizing rows, then columns in reading order). Let's call this the 'top-leftmost' cell of the block.\n3. Get the column index of this 'top-leftmost' cell.\n4. If the column index is less than 4, then change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the 'top-leftmost' cell to color 1 (blue).\n5. If the column index is greater than or equal to 4, then change the color of the cell immediately below the 'top-leftmost' cell to color 1 (blue).\n\nThis transformation is applied independently to each block of color 8 in the input grid. Cells that are not part of a color 8 block, or are adjacent to it but not selected by the transformation rule, remain unchanged."
