**Natural Language Program:**

Identify all contiguous vertical blocks of azure color (8). Order these blocks from left to right based on their column index. For the leftmost block, locate the topmost cell of color azure. Change the color of the cell immediately to its right to blue (1). For the next block (if any), locate the bottommost cell of color azure. Change the color of the cell at the same position to blue (1).

**Step-by-step transformation:**

1. **Identify vertical blocks of azure (8):**
   - Block 1: Column 1, Rows 1-2 (coordinates: (1,1), (2,1))
   - Block 2: Column 4, Rows 3-4 (coordinates: (3,4), (4,4))

2. **Order blocks by column index:**
   - Block 1 (column 1) is first.
   - Block 2 (column 4) is second.

3. **Process the first block (Block 1):**
   - Find the topmost azure cell: (1,1)
   - Change the color of the cell to its right (1, 2) to blue (1).

4. **Process the second block (Block 2):**
   - Find the bottommost azure cell: (4,4)
   - Change the color of the cell at the same position (4, 4) to blue (1).

This step-by-step transformation matches the observed change from input to output.
