**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1. **Identify 'Azure' (color 8) Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of cells containing the color 'azure' (8) in the input grid. These blocks are considered as objects.
2. **Examine Neighbors of 'Azure' Objects:** For each cell that is part of an 'azure' object, inspect its immediate neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
3. **Conditional Color Change:** If a neighboring cell of an 'azure' object has the color 'white' (0), change the color of this neighboring cell to 'blue' (1) in the output grid.
4. **Maintain Unaffected Cells:**  All cells in the input grid that are not neighbors of an 'azure' object (and are 'white') or are already part of an 'azure' object, retain their original color in the output grid. In essence, only 'white' cells directly adjacent to 'azure' objects are transformed to 'blue'.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
