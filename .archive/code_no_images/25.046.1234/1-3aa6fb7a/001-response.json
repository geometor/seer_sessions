The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which serves as the background.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** By comparing the output and input grids, it appears that a single cell of value '1' (blue) is added to the right of the top-left corner of each L-shape.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule:**\n\n    *   Locate each azure (8) L-shaped object.\n    *   For each one, identify their top-left corner.\n    *   Change the color of the cell directly to the right of the identified corner to blue (1).\n    *   Leave the original azure objects unchanged, as well as the white background.\n\nIn summary, the input contains azure L-shapes on white. In the output, a single blue cell has been added to the right of each L-shape's top-left corner. Everything else remains the same.\n"
