Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:  [[4,4]]
  background:
     color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which serves as the background.

2.  **Detect Change:** By comparing the output and input grids, it appears that a single cell of value '1' (blue) is added to the right of the top-left corner of each L-shape.

3. **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Locate each azure (8) L-shaped object.
    *   For each one, identify their top-left corner.
    *   Change the color of the cell directly to the right of the identified corner to blue (1).
    *   Leave the original azure objects unchanged, as well as the white background.

In summary, the input contains azure L-shapes on white. In the output, a single blue cell has been added to the right of each L-shape's top-left corner. Everything else remains the same.


*text:*
Okay, here's the Python code implementing the transformation rule described above:



*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Locate each azure (8) L-shaped object.
2.  For each one, identify the top-left corner cell.
3.  Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of each identified top-left corner to blue (1).
4.  Keep every other cell in its original state.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,3]]

  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,4]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[2,3]]
     - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,3]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
       shape: single cell
       positions: [[5,3]]
  background:
     color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in various rotations, and a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Change:** Comparing the output and input grids, it's evident that a single cell of color 1 (blue) has been added to the right of the top-left cell of *each* azure L-shape.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Locate all azure (8) L-shaped objects.
    *   For each L-shape, find the top-left corner cell. This requires considering different rotations of the L-shape.
    *   Add a blue (1) cell to the right of the identified top-left corner.
    *   Preserve the existing azure L-shapes and the white background.

The core concept is consistent with the first example: identify the top-left corner of each azure L-shape and place a blue cell to its right. The generalization now clearly includes handling different rotations of the L-shapes. The previous Python implementation should be correct.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output

    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
