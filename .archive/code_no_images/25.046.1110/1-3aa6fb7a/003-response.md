Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Several separate azure objects of different sizes and shapes.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Several separate azure objects of different sizes and shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Object Size Check:** Determine the size of each contiguous azure object.
3. **Place Blue Pixel**: For every separated azure object made out of more than one pixel, detect the azure color with the highest x and lowest y, and place a new blue (color 1) pixel directly to its left.

**Explanation:**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example, with one key change: the placement of the blue pixel is to the *left* of the rightmost-uppermost pixel of azure objects that have size greater than 1, instead of to its right. The core logic remains the same: we're identifying azure objects, checking their size, and conditionally placing a blue pixel based on the position of a specific pixel within qualifying azure objects.

```python
"""
Identify Azure Objects: Locate all azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.

Place Blue Pixel: For every separated azure object made out of more than one pixel, detect the azure color with the highest x and lowest y, and place a new blue (color 1) pixel directly to its left.
