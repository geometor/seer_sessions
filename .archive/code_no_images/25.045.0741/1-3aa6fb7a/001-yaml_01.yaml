task_context: "The task involves transforming an input grid to an output grid. The transformation rule is based on connected components of color '8' (azure)."
objects:
  - type: "grid"
    description: "A 2D array of integers representing colors."
  - type: "connected component"
    color: 8
    description: "A group of adjacent cells of color '8', where adjacency is defined horizontally and vertically."
predicates:
  - "connected":
      description: "Cells are adjacent horizontally or vertically and have the same color."
  - "color":
      description: "The color value of a cell."
  - "top-leftmost":
      description: "The cell in a connected component with the minimum row index, and among those with the minimum column index."
actions:
  - "identify_connected_components":
      description: "Find all groups of connected cells of color '8'."
  - "find_top_leftmost_cell":
      description: "For each connected component, determine the cell with the minimum row and then minimum column index."
  - "check_cell_to_right":
      description: "Examine the cell immediately to the right of the top-leftmost cell."
  - "check_cell_below":
      description: "If the cell to the right was not modified, examine the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell."
  - "change_color":
      description: "If a checked cell is within grid boundaries and has color '0', change its color to '1'."
transformation_rule: "For each connected component of color '8', identify its top-leftmost cell. If the cell to its right is within the grid and is '0', change it to '1'. Otherwise, if the cell below is within the grid and is '0', change it to '1'."
