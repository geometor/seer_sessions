task_context: "The task involves transforming an input grid to an output grid. The transformation rule is based on connected components of color '8' (azure), applying a specific transformation to the first three components found in reading order."

      description: "For each connected component, determine the cell with the minimum row and then minimum column index."
  - "order_components":
      description: "Order connected components based on the row index of their top-leftmost cell, then by column index."
  - "check_cell_right":
      description: "Examine the cell immediately to the right of the top-leftmost cell."

      description: "If the cell to the right was not modified, examine the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell."

      description: "Change the color of a cell to '1'."
transformation_rule: "Identify connected components of color '8'. Order them by the top-leftmost cell's row, then column. For the first three components, check the cell to the right of the top-leftmost cell. If it is in bounds and color '0', change it to '1'. Otherwise, check the cell below. If it is in bounds and color '0', change it to '1'. For the fourth and subsequent components, do nothing."
