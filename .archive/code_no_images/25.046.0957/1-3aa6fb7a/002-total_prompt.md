Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate azure "L" shapes, one in top left corner, one in the bottom right
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate azure "L" shapes, one in top left corner, one in the bottom right
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single blue pixel, one per azure L
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two distinct "L"-shaped objects formed by azure (color 8) pixels. The remaining pixels are background (color 0).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The azure L shapes do not change.

3. **Blue Pixel Insertion**: For *each* azure 'L' shape, the transformation finds the azure pixel which is closest to the top-left, relative to the other pixels in that object. It places a blue pixel immediately to the *right* of that pixel.

**Elaboration and Edge Cases**
The rule successfully changes the correct '8' to a '1'. The core concept relies on identifying the azure objects, their properties, and using a relative positioning rule.

**Summary**
The program finds the top-left-most pixel for each connected group of azure pixels and places a blue pixel to its right.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
