Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 180
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 180
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single
      positions: [[1,2],[4,4]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One 'L' shape object is in the top left corner formed by the cells (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2), and a 180 rotated 'L' is present on the right formed by (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5).

2.  **Detect Changes:** By comparing the input and output grids, we see changes in the color of two of the light blue cells:
	*   The cell at position (1,2) changes from 8 in input to 1 in output.
    *   The cell at position (4,4) changes from 8 in input to 1 in output.

3.  **Determine the Rule**
	* Check every cell color 8 (azure).
    * If it belongs to an 'L' shape, change to 1 (blue) the cell at the vertex of the angle.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule replaces some, but not all, of the azure (8) cells with blue (1) cells. The rule highlights the change applied to the azure L shapes.


*text:*
Okay, here's the Python implementation based on the transformation rule we've identified:

"""
The transformation rule identifies 'L' shaped objects of color 8 (azure).
For each 'L' shape, it changes the color of the cell at the vertex of the 'L' to 1 (blue).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
