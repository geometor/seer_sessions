Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two separate azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the left, and the other is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the right.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a blue (color 1) pixel appears to the immediate right of the top-most azure pixel in each object.

**YAML Summary:**




*text:*

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)
    count: 2
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (3,4)
    count: 2
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: relative to object 8
    count: 2

transformations:
  - action: add
    color: 1
    position: right of the top pixel of object 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects.
2.  For each azure object, locate the top-most pixel.
3.  Place a blue (color 1) pixel immediately to the right of this top-most pixel.
4.  All the existing object positions are preserved.

**Python Implementation:**
