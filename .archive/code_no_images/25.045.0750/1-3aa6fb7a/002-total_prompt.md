**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected regions of color 8 in the input grid. We consider a region as connected if cells of color 8 are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** For each identified region of color 8:
    a. **Find Top-Leftmost Cell:** Locate the cell within the region that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same smallest row index, choose the one with the smallest column index among them. Let's call the coordinates of this cell (row, column).
    b. **Check Right Neighbor:** Examine the cell immediately to the right of the top-leftmost cell, at coordinates (row, column + 1).
        i. **If Right Neighbor is White (0):** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).  After changing the color, move to the next object (if any).
    c. **Check Bottom Neighbor (if Right Neighbor was not changed):** If the right neighbor was not white (either it was out of bounds, or not color 0), then examine the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell, at coordinates (row + 1, column).
        i. **If Bottom Neighbor is White (0):** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue). After changing the color, move to the next object (if any).
3. **Output Grid:** The modified grid after processing all regions of color 8 is the output grid.

This program describes how to transform the input grid to the output grid by identifying contiguous regions of color 8 and changing the color of a neighboring white cell to blue, prioritizing the right neighbor and then the bottom neighbor of the top-leftmost cell of each region.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
