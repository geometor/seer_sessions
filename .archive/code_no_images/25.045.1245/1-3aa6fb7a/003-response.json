The remaining cells are white (0).\n\n2.  **Object Persistence:** The three L-shaped objects remain in the same locations and orientations in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Color Change:** A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel of *each* L-shaped object. This aligns with the rule identified in the first example.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule**\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows: Locate all azure (8) colored, L-shaped objects. Preserve these objects. Then place a blue pixel(1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel within each identified L-shape.\n\nThis is the same rule that has been applied before.\n"
