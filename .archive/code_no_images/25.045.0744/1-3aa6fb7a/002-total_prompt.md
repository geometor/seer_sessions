**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected regions of color 8 in the input grid. We will call these regions "blocks".
2. **Order Blocks:** Determine the topmost cell for each block. The topmost cell is defined as the cell with the smallest row index, and in case of a tie, the smallest column index. Order the blocks based on the row index of their topmost cells, and then by the column index in case of a row index tie.
3. **Transform First Block:** For the first block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this topmost cell to color 1.
4. **Transform Second Block:** For the second block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately below this topmost cell to color 1.
5. **No Further Transformation:**  If there are more than two blocks, no further transformations are applied to them.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC grid puzzle transformation"
transformation_rule: "For the first connected component of color 8 (ordered by topmost cell position), change the cell to the right of its topmost cell to color 1. For the second component, change the cell below its topmost cell to color 1."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "topmost cell"
      - "position"
actions:
  - "identify connected regions of color 8"
  - "order regions by topmost cell position (reading order)"
  - "for first region: change cell to the right of topmost cell to color 1"
  - "for second region: change cell below topmost cell to color 1"
predicates:
  - "connected"
  - "color is 8"
  - "topmost cell"
  - "to the right of"
  - "below"
```
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
