Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects.
    *   A 2x1 horizontal shape at the top in columns 5 and 6.
    * A 2x1 vertical object in col 3.
    * A 2x1 object at the bottom in col 4

*   **Output:** The output is the same of the input, but with some cells next to the azure objects set to 1. A blue pixel (color 1) appears immediately to the *right* of the top-most cell of each multi-cell azure object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3.  If a cell is azure (color 8), check if it's the top-most cell of a contiguous azure object composed by 2 or more cells.
4.  If it is, and is not in the last column, paint blue (color 1) the cell to the right of the top-most cell.
