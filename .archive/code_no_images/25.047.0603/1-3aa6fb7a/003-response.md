Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   Both input and output grids are 7x7.
*   The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects.
    *   A 2x2 square object near the top right corner.
    *  A vertical 2x1 object in the third column.
    *   A 2x2 square object at the bottom.
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for three cells that have changed from color 0 (white) to color 1 (blue).

* The positions of the added blue cells relative to the azure objects:
        * One blue cell is placed to the left of the bottom-right element of the top-right azure square.
        * One blue cell is placed to the right of the bottom element of the vertical azure object.
        * One blue cell is placed to the left of the upper-right element of the azure bottom object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  Identify azure (color 8) colored cells.
3.  For each azure object, locate specific corner or edge cells, and if there is a free space, paint that blue(1).
     * Top Right Azure Square: If there's an azure square at the top-right, place a blue cell to the immediate left of the bottom-right corner element of the square.
     *   Vertical Azure Object: If there's a vertical object, add a blue cell to the right of the bottom element of the vertical object.
    *   Bottom Azure Square: If there's an azure object at the bottom, add a blue pixel to the left of the top right blue cell.
