Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: two L-shapes (2x2)
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1)
        - Bottom-right corner at (3,4)
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the remaining cells
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: two L-shapes (2x2)
      position:
        - Top-left corner at (1,1)
        - Bottom-right corner at (3,4)
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,5)
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the remaining cells
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two azure (color 8) "L"-shaped objects composed of four cells each, against the background of white (0).

2.  **Detect corner** For each object, we locate the corner with azure color and turn it into blue. Top-left of each object has blue.

3.  **Preserve Other:** All the other cells remain unchanged.

In essence, the rule identifies azure object and it transforms to blue the top-left most azure cell. The rest of the cells in the grid, remain the same.
