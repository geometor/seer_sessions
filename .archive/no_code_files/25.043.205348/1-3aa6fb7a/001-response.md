Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects in the input grid are squares filled with the color represented by the number 8 (which seems to visually represent cyan).

2.  **Locate Corner Changes:** We can observe a new object (number 1, which appears black) inside two of cyan (8) L shaped objects.

3.  **Describe the Transformation:**
    *   The top right corner of the top left L object changed to 1.
    *   The bottom left corner of the bottom right L object changed to 1.

**Natural Language Program (Concise):**

Locate every "L-shaped" configurations of cyan (number 8) colored pixels. If an L shape is found, change, to black (1), the pixel within the right-angle created by the three cyan pixels -- specifically:
* on the first row of the L, change the last pixel to 1
* on the last row of the L, change the first pixel to 1.
