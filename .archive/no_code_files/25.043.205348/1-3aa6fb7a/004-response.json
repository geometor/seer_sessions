The \"L\" shape isn't a fixed orientation; it can be rotated. The critical aspect is the *relationship* between the pixels:\n\n*   **The \"L\" consists of three cyan pixels.**  Two pixels form a line (either horizontal or vertical), and the third pixel is adjacent to one end of that line, creating the right angle.\n*   **The pixel to be changed is *inside* the right angle.** It's diagonally adjacent to the corner pixel of the \"L\".\n\nThe previous code had separate checks for different L orientations, which was not scalable. The key improvement is to check *around* each cyan pixel for *any* valid \"L\" shape, regardless of its specific rotation.\n\n**Final Refined Python Code:**\n\n"

It doesn't rely on specific \"L\" orientations. It correctly identifies the \"inside\" pixel to change based on the relative positions of the three '8' pixels forming the \"L\".\n*   **Efficient:** It avoids redundant checks. The four `if` conditions cover all possibilities without overlapping.\n* **Test Cases:** Includes the test cases in the main execution block.\n\nThis solution directly implements the most accurate natural language description and is robust to variations in the L-shape's presentation.\n"
