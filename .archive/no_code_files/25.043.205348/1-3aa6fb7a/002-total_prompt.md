Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects in the input grid are squares filled with the color represented by the number 8 (which seems to visually represent cyan).

2.  **Locate Corner Changes:** We can observe a new object (number 1, which appears black) inside two of cyan (8) L shaped objects.

3.  **Describe the Transformation:**
    *   The top right corner of the top left L object changed to 1.
    *   The bottom left corner of the bottom right L object changed to 1.

**Natural Language Program (Concise):**

Locate every "L-shaped" configurations of cyan (number 8) colored pixels. If an L shape is found, change, to black (1), the pixel within the right-angle created by the three cyan pixels -- specifically:
* on the first row of the L, change the last pixel to 1
* on the last row of the L, change the first pixel to 1.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
