We can consider each such block as a separate object.\n2. **Locate Top-Right Cell within each Object:** For each identified block of color 8, determine the cell that is located at the topmost row and the rightmost column within that block. In other words, find the cell within the block that has the smallest row index and the largest column index.\n3. **Transform Cell Color:** Change the color of the identified top-right cell in each block from color 8 (azure) to color 1 (blue).\n4. **Maintain Unchanged Pixels:** All other cells in the grid that are not identified as top-right cells within a color 8 block remain unchanged from the input to the output.\n\n**In simpler terms:** For every isolated '8' shape, color the top-right corner of that shape '1'."
