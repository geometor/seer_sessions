**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. We can consider each such block as a separate object.
2. **Locate Top-Right Cell within each Object:** For each identified block of color 8, determine the cell that is located at the topmost row and the rightmost column within that block. In other words, find the cell within the block that has the smallest row index and the largest column index.
3. **Transform Cell Color:** Change the color of the identified top-right cell in each block from color 8 (azure) to color 1 (blue).
4. **Maintain Unchanged Pixels:** All other cells in the grid that are not identified as top-right cells within a color 8 block remain unchanged from the input to the output.

**In simpler terms:** For every isolated '8' shape, color the top-right corner of that shape '1'.

**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Color Objects:** Detect all distinct, connected regions of color 8 (azure) within the input grid. Each of these regions is considered an independent object.
2. **Determine Top-Right Corner for Each Object:** For every object identified in step 1, locate the cell that is simultaneously in the topmost row and the rightmost column among all cells belonging to that object. This is the "top-right" cell of the object.
3. **Recolor Top-Right Cell:** Change the color of the "top-right" cell identified in step 2 from its original color 8 (azure) to color 1 (blue).
4. **Preserve Other Cells:**  Ensure that all cells in the grid that are not identified as "top-right" cells of color 8 objects remain unchanged from the input grid to the output grid.

**In essence:** For each group of connected '8's, find its top-rightmost cell and repaint it as '1'. All other cells are unaffected.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
