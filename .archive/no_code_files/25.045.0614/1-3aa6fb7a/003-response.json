Each of these regions is considered an independent object.\n2. **Determine Top-Right Corner for Each Object:** For every object identified in step 1, locate the cell that is simultaneously in the topmost row and the rightmost column among all cells belonging to that object. This is the \"top-right\" cell of the object.\n3. **Recolor Top-Right Cell:** Change the color of the \"top-right\" cell identified in step 2 from its original color 8 (azure) to color 1 (blue).\n4. **Preserve Other Cells:**  Ensure that all cells in the grid that are not identified as \"top-right\" cells of color 8 objects remain unchanged from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n**In essence:** For each group of connected '8's, find its top-rightmost cell and repaint it as '1'. All other cells are unaffected."
