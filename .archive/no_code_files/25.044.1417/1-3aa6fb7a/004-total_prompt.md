**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process operates on each row of the input grid independently. For each row, we perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the first occurrence of the number 8.**
2. **Check the cell immediately to the right of this first 8.**
3. **If this cell to the right contains the number 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.**
4. **Identify the last occurrence of the number 8 in the same row.**
5. **Check the cell immediately to the left of this last 8.**
6. **If this cell to the left contains the number 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.**

This process is applied to every row in the input grid to generate the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

For each row in the input grid, perform the following steps:

1. **Locate the First '8':** Identify the index of the first occurrence of the number 8 in the current row, scanning from left to right.
2. **Modify Right Cell (if applicable):** If an '8' is found, examine the cell immediately to its right within the same row. If this cell exists within the row boundaries and its value is 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.
3. **Locate the Last '8':** Identify the index of the last occurrence of the number 8 in the same row, scanning from right to left.
4. **Modify Left Cell (if applicable):** If an '8' is found, examine the cell immediately to its left within the same row. If this cell exists within the row boundaries and its value is 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.
5. **Unchanged Rows:** If no '8' is found in the current row, leave the entire row unchanged in the output grid.

Repeat these steps for every row in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
