The transformation process operates on each row of the input grid independently. For each row, we perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the first occurrence of the number 8.**
2. **Check the cell immediately to the right of this first 8.**
3. **If this cell to the right contains the number 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.**
4. **Identify the last occurrence of the number 8 in the same row.**
5. **Check the cell immediately to the left of this last 8.**
6. **If this cell to the left contains the number 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.**

This process is applied to every row in the input grid to generate the output grid.
