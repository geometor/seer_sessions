**NLP:**
['**Natural Language Program:**\n\nIdentify connected regions of cells with value 8 in the input grid.\nFor each region:\n  Find the cell with the minimum row and then column index; this is the reference cell.\n  If the cell to the right of the reference cell has value 0, change its value to 1.\n  Otherwise, if the cell below the reference cell has value 0, change its value to 1.\n']

================================================================================
**Python Code Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
\"\"\"
Natural language description of the transformation rule goes here.
\"\"\"

# Imports (e.g., numpy, sympy)

def transform(input_grid):
    \"\"\"
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule.
    \"\"\"
    # Implementation goes here


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_grid = [
        # ... Input grid data ...
    ]

    expected_output = [
        # ... Expected output grid data ...
    ]

    transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if transformed_grid == expected_output:
        print("Transformation successful!")
    else:
        print("Transformation failed.")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", transformed_grid)

    assert transformed_grid == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
