Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Corner Object :**
    *   The object color '8' in the second row and second column.

3. **Locate Corner Object :**
    *   The object color '8' in the fifth row and sixth column.

4.  **Change object color :** Change the color of the object '8' that on the right side of object color '8' to the color '1'.

5. **Change object color :** Change the color of the object '8' that on the left side of object color '8' to the color '1'.

In essence, the transformation identifies objects of color '8' and changes colors of two the objects of color '8'.

Okay, I understand the task. You want me to create a Python module that transforms an input grid to an output grid based on the provided natural language program. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the generated Python code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understand the NLP:** The natural language program describes identifying specific blue (color '8') objects in the grid and changing the color of their neighbors to color '1'.

2.  **Plan the Code:**
    *   The `transform` function will take the input grid as a list of lists.
    *   It will initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   It will iterate through the grid to find the two objects of color '8'.
    *   It will find the correct object of color '8' and change the specific neighbor's color to '1'.
    *   It will return the modified output grid.

3.  **Implement the Code:** The code will follow the plan described above, including a docstring with the natural language description, and an assertion block to check if the output matches the expected output.

**Here's the generated Python code:**


```python
