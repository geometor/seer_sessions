This second example's logic is more general. It works for *any* blue object that has another blue object to its right. This demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding the underlying rule.\n*   **Iteration:** The code now iterates through the entire grid, checking each cell, which is essential for handling cases with multiple objects of interest.\n*   **Conditional Logic:** The color change is now conditional, based on the presence of a neighbor.\n* No need to define two different color '8' object\n\nThis improved program correctly handles the provided input and output, and, more importantly, captures the *general* transformation rule, not just a specific instance. It would correctly transform other grids following the same rule.\n"
