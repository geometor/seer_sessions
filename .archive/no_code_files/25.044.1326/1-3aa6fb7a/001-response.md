Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` in the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Neighbors:** For each `8`, inspect its immediate diagonal neighbors (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).

3.  **Apply Transformation Rule:** If a given `8` *does not* have any diagonal neighbors that are also `8`, change that `8` to a `1`.

4.    Leave all the 8 values that has a diagonal neighbor and all the 0's unchanged.

**In essence, the transformation replaces isolated `8`s (those without diagonal `8` neighbors) with `1`s.**
