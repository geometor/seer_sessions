*text:*
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` in the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Neighbors:** For each `8`, inspect its immediate diagonal neighbors (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).

3.  **Apply Transformation Rule:** If a given `8` *does not* have any diagonal neighbors that are also `8`, change that `8` to a `1`.

4.    Leave all the 8 values that has a diagonal neighbor and all the 0's unchanged.

**In essence, the transformation replaces isolated `8`s (those without diagonal `8` neighbors) with `1`s.**

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
