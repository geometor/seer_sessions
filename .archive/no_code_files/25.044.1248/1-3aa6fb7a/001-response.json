Here's my step-by-step description:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (which appears to be light blue).\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Predicates:** Find the '8' colored squares that are:\n    *   Along the top edge of any contiguous block of 8.\n    *   Directly to the left of another '8'\n    And\n    *   Along the bottom edge of any contiguos block of 8.\n    *   Directly to the right of another '8'.\n\n3.  **Transformation Action:**\n    *   Change the color of the square from 8 to 1.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nThe rule appears to be: Change to a '1' the first blue square of the first row of a blue shape and, also, the last blue square of the last row of a blue shape.\n\nI've focused on the actions, properties, and objects. I believe these are sufficient for describing this transformation.\n"
