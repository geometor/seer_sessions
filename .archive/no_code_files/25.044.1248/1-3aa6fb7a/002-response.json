            "text": "\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this code:\n\n*   **`copy.deepcopy()`:**  This is *crucial*.  The original code modified the `input_grid` directly.  When you modify the grid you're iterating over, it leads to incorrect results and skipped cells. `deepcopy` creates a completely independent copy, so modifications to `output_grid` don't affect `input_grid`.\n*   **Clearer Conditionals:** The `if` conditions are now more explicit, directly checking:\n    *   **Top edge:** `r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == 0` (Is there a row above, and is it 0?)\n    *   **right of:**  `(c+1 < cols and grid[r][c+1] == 8 )`\n    *   **Bottom edge:** `r+1 < rows and grid[r+1][c] == 0` (Is there a row below, and is it 0?)\n    *   **Left of:** `(c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == 8)`\n*   **Boundary Checks:**  The code includes checks like `r > 0`, `c > 0`, `r + 1 < rows`, and `c + 1 < cols` to prevent `IndexError` exceptions when checking neighbors at the edges of the grid.  This is essential for robustness.\n*   **Docstring:** The docstring at the top accurately reflects the natural language description.\n* **Concise Main Block**\n\nI've run this code, and it now produces the correct output, passing the assertion. The use of `deepcopy` and the correct conditional logic are the key fixes.\n"
