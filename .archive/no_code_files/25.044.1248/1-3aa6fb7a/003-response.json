            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for this second example. Here's my step-by-step description:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (light blue).\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Predicates:** Find the '8' colored squares that satisfy *either* of these two conditions:\n    *   **Condition 1:** The '8' is along the top edge of a contiguous block of '8's, *and* it is immediately to the left of another '8'.\n    *   **Condition 2:** The '8' is along the bottom edge of a contiguous block of '8's, *and* it is immediately to the right of another '8'.\n\n3.  **Transformation Action:**\n    *   Change the color of the '8' square to '1' *only* if it meets one of the conditions above.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nThe rule is to find the leftmost '8' in the top row of each contiguous blue shape, and the rightmost '8' in the bottom row of each contiguous blue shape. Change those specific '8's to '1's.  Critically, only squares meeting *both* the edge condition and the adjacency condition are changed.\n\nI've made sure to emphasize the combined conditions (top/left, bottom/right) which are essential for a correct transformation. This description is more precise than the previous one.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (light blue).\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Predicates:** Find the '8' colored squares that satisfy *either* of these two conditions:\n    *   **Condition 1:** The '8' is along the top edge of a contiguous block of '8's, *and* it is immediately to the left of another '8'.\n    *   **Condition 2:** The '8' is along the bottom edge of a contiguous block of '8's, *and* it is immediately to the right of another '8'.\n\n3.  **Transformation Action:**\n    *   Change the color of the '8' square to '1' *only* if it meets one of the conditions above.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n]\n\nexpected_output = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n]\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rule.\"\"\"\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 8:\n                # Check for top-left condition\n                if (r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == 0) and (c+1 < cols and grid[r][c+1] == 8):\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1\n                #check for botton-right condition\n                if (r+1 < rows and grid[r+1][c] == 0) and (c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == 8):\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)\n\n    if transformed_grid == expected_output:\n        print(\"SUCCESS!\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"FAILED!\\n\")\n        print(\"Expected Output:\\n\", expected_output)\n        print(\"\\nTransformed Output:\\n\", transformed_grid)\n\n    assert transformed_grid == expected_output, \"Transformed output does not match expected output.\"\n\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this code:\n\n*   **Correct condition:** The conditions to change value of cell, were aplied to wrong cell.\n*   **Docstring:** The docstring at the top accurately reflects the natural language description.\n* **Concise Main Block**\n"
