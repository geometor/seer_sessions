All other 8 should remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Corner Definition:** A corner '8' is defined as one that has zeros on its diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), or be bordered.\n\n3.  **Implementation Strategy:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    *   Check if the cell contains an '8'.\n    *   If it's an '8', check its diagonal neighbors.\n    *   If the diagonal neighbors conditions are met, it is a corner. Change this 8 to a 1 in the output grid.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:** Ensure the code correctly handles '8's at the edges and corners of the entire grid (consider them as valid \"corners\" too).\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n"
