The output grid is identical to the input grid, *except* that some of the '8's have been changed to '1's. By observation the change can be determined to be the following. The '8' at the top is changed to a '1', as is the '8' at the bottom of the formation of digits equalling '8'.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify '8' formations:** Locate all connected formations of the digit '8'.\n2. **Locate start and end:** Locate the beginning and end of each formation, determined by row.\n3.  **Change to '1':** Change the digit '8' at the start and end of the '8' formation, to '1'.\n4. **Preserve other cells:** All the other cells remain unchanged.\n\n**Explanation of the steps:**\n*   The program first looks for any groups of '8's, and from this, extracts the beginning and end of each group.\n*   From the determined digits, the change to '1' is initialised, replacing the values found.\n*   The last step is needed, as otherwise digits that are not equal to '8' are overlooked.\n"
