*text:*
Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids and provide a natural language program describing the rule.

Here's my analysis and the natural language program:

**Analysis:**

The input grid contains several '8's, some isolated and some adjacent. The output grid is identical to the input grid, *except* that some of the '8's have been changed to '1's. By observation the change can be determined to be the following. The '8' at the top is changed to a '1', as is the '8' at the bottom of the formation of digits equalling '8'.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '8' formations:** Locate all connected formations of the digit '8'.
2. **Locate start and end:** Locate the beginning and end of each formation, determined by row.
3.  **Change to '1':** Change the digit '8' at the start and end of the '8' formation, to '1'.
4. **Preserve other cells:** All the other cells remain unchanged.

**Explanation of the steps:**
*   The program first looks for any groups of '8's, and from this, extracts the beginning and end of each group.
*   From the determined digits, the change to '1' is initialised, replacing the values found.
*   The last step is needed, as otherwise digits that are not equal to '8' are overlooked.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
