Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids and provide a natural language program describing the steps.

Here's my analysis of the example provided:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color '8' (presumably a specific color like orange or purple).

2.  **Locate Changes:** Compare the input and output. Notice that some of digits '8' in the input grid have changed to the digit '1' in the output grid. Specifically the top-right 8 and the bottom-center 8.

3. **Describe rule:**
    - Locate the top-rightmost object of color '8'. Change it to the digit '1'.
    - Locate the object color '8' which located center-bottom. Changed it to the digit '1'.
In summary: the program identifies specific elements of color '8' based on position, and change them to '1'.
