If found, change it to '1'.\n    *   Find the bottom-most, leftmost '8'. If found, change it to '1'.\n    *  Find the '8' that is the bottom-most 8 in its column.  If a 8 exist in a column without any change, then change the bottom-most 8 in that column.\n\n**Reasoning for Change:**\n\nThe previous logic (top-right, bottom-center, left-of-bottom-center) doesn't hold for the third example. The third '8' that changes is neither bottom-center nor left-of-bottom-center. It's the *bottom-most* '8' in the *leftmost* column containing an '8'.  Also we have to change the bottom-center rule with bottom-most, leftmost. Then, the third rule needs to change all other bottom most '8's in each column to '1' *only if* no other '8' in that column has already been changed.\n\n"
