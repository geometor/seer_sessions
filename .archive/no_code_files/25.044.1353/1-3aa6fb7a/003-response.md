**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Grid:** We are working with a 7x7 grid of cells.
2. **Identify Cell Values:** Each cell in the grid contains a numerical value, which can be 0, 1, or 8.
3. **Focus on Zero-Valued Cells:**  The transformation rule specifically targets cells that have a value of 0 in the input grid.
4. **Check Neighbors:** For each cell with a value of 0 in the input grid, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) *in the input grid itself*.
5. **Neighbor Condition:** We are looking for a specific neighbor value: 8.
6. **Transformation Rule:** If *any* of the immediate neighbors of a zero-valued cell in the input grid has a value of 8, then change the value of this cell to 1 in the output grid.
7. **No Neighbor Condition or Non-Zero Cells:** If a zero-valued cell does not have any neighbor with a value of 8 in the input grid, or if the cell's value is not 0 initially, then the cell's value remains unchanged in the output grid compared to the input grid.

**In simpler terms:**

For every empty square (represented by 0) in the input grid, check its adjacent squares (up, down, left, right) in the *same input grid*. If any of these adjacent squares is an '8', then change the empty square to a '1' in the output grid. If none of the adjacent squares are '8', or if the square was not empty to begin with, leave it as it was in the output grid.
