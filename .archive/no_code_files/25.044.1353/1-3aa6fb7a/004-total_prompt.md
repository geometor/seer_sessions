**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the objects:** The objects are cells in a 7x7 grid. Each cell has a numerical value (0, 1, or 8).
2. **Identify the predicate:** We are interested in cells that have a value of 0 and their neighbors.
3. **Describe the transformation:** For every cell in the input grid:
    - Check if the cell's value is 0.
    - If it is 0, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the *input* grid.
    - If any of these neighbors has a value of 8, then change the value of the current cell in the *output* grid to 1.
    - If the cell's value is not 0, or if none of its neighbors are 8, keep the cell's original value in the *output* grid.

**In simpler terms:**

For each empty cell (value 0) in the input grid, if any of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) in the input grid is an '8', then fill this empty cell with '1' in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the cell as it is. Cells with values other than 0 are unchanged in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Grid:** We are working with a 7x7 grid of cells.
2. **Identify Cell Values:** Each cell in the grid contains a numerical value, which can be 0, 1, or 8.
3. **Focus on Zero-Valued Cells:**  The transformation rule specifically targets cells that have a value of 0 in the input grid.
4. **Check Neighbors:** For each cell with a value of 0 in the input grid, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) *in the input grid itself*.
5. **Neighbor Condition:** We are looking for a specific neighbor value: 8.
6. **Transformation Rule:** If *any* of the immediate neighbors of a zero-valued cell in the input grid has a value of 8, then change the value of this cell to 1 in the output grid.
7. **No Neighbor Condition or Non-Zero Cells:** If a zero-valued cell does not have any neighbor with a value of 8 in the input grid, or if the cell's value is not 0 initially, then the cell's value remains unchanged in the output grid compared to the input grid.

**In simpler terms:**

For every empty square (represented by 0) in the input grid, check its adjacent squares (up, down, left, right) in the *same input grid*. If any of these adjacent squares is an '8', then change the empty square to a '1' in the output grid. If none of the adjacent squares are '8', or if the square was not empty to begin with, leave it as it was in the output grid.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
