Each cell has a numerical value (0, 1, or 8).\n2. **Identify the predicate:** We are interested in cells that have a value of 0 and their neighbors.\n3. **Describe the transformation:** For every cell in the input grid:\n    - Check if the cell's value is 0.\n    - If it is 0, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the *input* grid.\n    - If any of these neighbors has a value of 8, then change the value of the current cell in the *output* grid to 1.\n    - If the cell's value is not 0, or if none of its neighbors are 8, keep the cell's original value in the *output* grid.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nFor each empty cell (value 0) in the input grid, if any of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) in the input grid is an '8', then fill this empty cell with '1' in the output grid. Otherwise, leave the cell as it is. Cells with values other than 0 are unchanged in the output."
