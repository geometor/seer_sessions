            "text": "Okay, I understand the instructions and the provided example. I'll analyze the relationship between the input and output grids to formulate a natural language description of the transformation rule, and then I'll generate the Python code according to the instructions.\n\n**Analysis of Input and Output Grids:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 5x5 grid containing digits '0' and '8'.\n*   **Output Grid:**  The same size as the input grid. Most of the digits are the same as in the input grid, *except* for a single '1' that appears where a '0' was previously located. This '1' is placed diagonally up-right of an '8'. It is also clear that this only happens when the '8' has both, the up-right diagonal neighbor and the down-right diagonal neighbor.\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify '8's:** Locate all occurrences of the digit '8' in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Check for Diagonal neighbor:** For each identified '8', examine its diagonally adjacent cells to determine if it has, both, up-right and down-right neighbors.\n\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If and only if an '8' has, both, up-right and down-right neighbor:\n    *   Change the value of the up-right diagonal cell to '1' in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells that do not meet the above condition remain unchanged.\n\n**Concise Natural Language Description:**\n\nThe transformation identifies '8's in the input. For '8' that have up-right and down-right diagonal neighbor, the up-right cell of that '8' changes to a '1' in the output grid. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n"
