# 25.044.1231 â€¢ 1-3aa6fb7a â€¢ 004 Response

Okay, I've analyzed the provided images (input_file_2.jpeg and input_file_3.jpeg) and compared them to the previous examples and my existing code. My initial assessment remains correct. The transformation rule and the Python code I provided previously are still valid and accurately describe the process.

Here's the breakdown again, with confirmation based on the new images:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '8's:** Locate all pixels/cells containing the digit '8' in the input image/grid.
2.  **Border Check:** For each '8' found, determine if it's located on any edge (top, bottom, left, or right) of the grid.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If an '8' is *not* on any border (meaning it's surrounded by other cells), replace it with the digit '1'. Otherwise, leave the '8' unchanged.

**Confirmation with New Images:**

The images input_file_2.jpeg and input_file_3.jpeg visually represent the same grid structures as `example_2_input` and `example_2_output`. The '8's that are changed to '1's are precisely those that are not on any of the four borders.

**Python Code (No Changes Needed):**

The code I provided earlier correctly implements this rule. I am providing the code *again* below for completeness, but it is identical to the code in my previous response.


```python
"""

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_array[r, c] == 8:
                # Check if it's on the border
                if r > 0 and r < rows - 1 and c > 0 and c < cols - 1:
