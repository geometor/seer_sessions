Okay, here's my attempt at describing the transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate all instances of the digit '8' in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For every '8', check to see if it exists at the border, for every border it does NOT exist at replace with digit '1'.

**Explanation of the Logic:**

The core of the transformation seems to be based on the following concept to search every number 8 in the grid:

*   If the number 8 is not next to the border, then replace that instance with number 1.

**Example Application (to Input):**

*   In the provided example input, We see six '8's in the Input grid.
*    Only two '8' digits are surrounded, from the left, right, up, and down borders.
*   The transformation changes the numbers 8 that meet the rules described before to number 1.

Okay, I understand the task and the provided example. Here's my attempt to describe the transformation and provide the Python code:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate all instances of the digit '8' in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** Inspect each '8'. If an '8' is *not* on an edge (top, bottom, left, or right border), replace it with the digit '1'.

**Explanation of the Logic:**

The core concept is to identify '8's that are completely surrounded by other cells (not on any edge). These "inner" 8s are replaced by 1s.

**Python Code:**

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`transform(input_grid)` function:**
    *   Takes the input grid (list of lists) as input.
    *   Creates a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    *   Gets the dimensions (rows, cols) of the grid.
    *   Creates a copy of the input array to store the output.
    *   Iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
    *   Checks if the current cell's value is 8.
    *   If it's an 8, it checks if it's *not* on any border using boundary checks (`r > 0 and r < rows - 1 and c > 0 and c < cols - 1`).
    *   If it's not on the border, the corresponding cell in the output array is set to 1.
    * Converts the NumPy array to list of lists
    *   Returns the modified output array (as a list of lists).

2.  **`if __name__ == '__main__':` block:**
    *   Defines the `input_grid` and `expected_output`.
    *   Calls the `transform` function with the input.
    *   Compares the `output` with the `expected_output` and prints a success or failure message.
    *   Includes an assertion to ensure the code fails if the output is incorrect.

I believe this accurately captures the transformation rule and the code should work as expected. I used numpy to avoid verbose code. I am ready for the next step or any further questions.

Okay, I've reviewed the second example and my previous response. My natural language program and code are still valid and applicable to this new example. No changes are needed. The logic of replacing '8' with '1' when it is *not* on a border still holds true.

To reiterate:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Find all occurrences of the digit '8' within the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each identified '8', check if it lies on any of the grid's edges (top, bottom, left, or right). If the '8' is *not* on any edge (i.e., it's an "inner" 8), replace it with the digit '1'.

The provided code already implements this logic correctly.  It iterates through the grid, identifies '8's, and checks their position against the grid boundaries before performing the replacement.  Therefore, I'm confident that the existing solution is accurate and complete.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
