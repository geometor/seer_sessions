            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the value '8'.\n\n2.  **Neighbor Analysis:** For each '8' pixel:\n    *   Count the number of immediately adjacent (horizontal and vertical) neighbors that are also '8'.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   If an '8' pixel has *exactly one* adjacent '8' neighbor, change its value to '1' in the output grid.\n    *   If the '8' has zero or more than one '8' neighbor it remains '8'.\n    *    All '0' pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Key Differences from Previous Example:**\n\nThe critical difference is the condition for changing '8' to '1'. In the first example the condition was less than or equal to one neighbor. Now it is only when the '8' pixels have *exactly one* neighbor.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nIdentify Target Pixels: Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the value '8'.\n\nNeighbor Analysis:\n  For each '8' pixel, Count the number of immediately adjacent (horizontal and vertical) neighbors that are also '8'.\n\nConditional Transformation:\n  - If an '8' pixel has *exactly one* adjacent '8' neighbor, change its value to '1' in the output grid.\n  - All other pixels, including other '8' pixels, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]  # Initialize output with 0s\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 8:\n                neighbors_8 = 0\n                # Check up\n                if r > 0 and input_grid[r - 1][c] == 8:\n                    neighbors_8 += 1\n                # Check down\n                if r < rows - 1 and input_grid[r + 1][c] == 8:\n                    neighbors_8 += 1\n                # Check left\n                if c > 0 and input_grid[r][c - 1] == 8:\n                    neighbors_8 += 1\n                # Check right\n                if c < cols - 1 and input_grid[r][c + 1] == 8:\n                    neighbors_8 += 1\n\n                if neighbors_8 == 1: # This is changed part.\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 8 #Keep other '8' as the same\n            else:\n                output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]  # Copy other values directly\n\n    return output_grid\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    input_grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n    ]\n\n    expected_output_grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n    ]\n    output_grid = transform(input_grid)\n\n    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:\n        print(\"SUCCESS!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"FAILED!\")\n        print(\"Expected Output:\", expected_output_grid)\n        print(\"Transformed Output:\", output_grid)\n\n    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, \"Transformed output does not match expected output.\"\n\n```\n\nThe code is almost identical to the previous one, except for the crucial change in the `if` condition within the nested loops. Now, `output_grid[r][c] = 1` only happens when `neighbors_8 == 1`. This accurately reflects the \"exactly one neighbor\" rule. The rest of the code (initialization, neighbor counting, and copying other values) remains the same. The testing framework is also preserved.\n"
