Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid with the value '8'.

2.  **Check neighbors and Find a pattern:**
    *   The output value '1' appears when the input value is '8' and is vertically or horizontally adjacent to at most one other '8'.

3.  **Apply the change based on the context:**
    - If an '8' pixel is next to at most one other '8', change the pixel color value from 8 to 1.
    - If the '8' pixel matches more than one another '8', then keep value as 8.
    - Keep the '0' in the same places.

**In summary:** The transformation identifies '8' pixels, examines the number of immediate adjacent neighbor with '8', and those that are "alone" or has one neighbor changes that to '1' in the output grid. Other pixels remain unchanged.
