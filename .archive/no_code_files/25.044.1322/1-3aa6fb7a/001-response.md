Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find the '8' (blue) objects that are located diagonally adjacent (specifically, up-and-left or down-and-left) relative to another '8' object.

3. **Apply a color change:** Change the value of these specific adjacent '8' objects with value '1'.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other '8' objects, and cells with '0', remain unchanged.

In essence, the rule identifies '8' colored pixels that reside diagonally, and to the left and are next to the other '8's, and it transforms the most adjacent diagonal '8' cell into '1'.
