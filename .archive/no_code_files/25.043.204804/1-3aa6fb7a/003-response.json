            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example and refine our understanding.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2:**\n\nIn this example, we see '1's appearing near '8's, but not *every* '8' gets a '1' neighbor.  Crucially, the '1's only appear where an '8' borders a '0', and replaces those '0's. It appears as an insertion *between* different numbers, rather than addition beside existing ones.\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through the grid:** Examine each cell in the input grid, row by row, and column by column.\n2.  **Identify '8's:** When an '8' is found, check its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right).\n3. **Check for '0' neighbors**:\n   - If there is a '0' to the left or right of the '8', replace the '0' with a '1' in the output grid.\n4.  **Handle Consecutive '8's:** If there's a sequence of consecutive '8's, process the entire sequence as follows:\n    *   If there is a '0' to the *left* of the *first* '8' in the sequence, replace that '0' with a '1'.\n    *   If there is a '0' to the *right* of the *last* '8' in the sequence, replace that '0' with a '1'.\n\n**Key Differences and Improvements:**\n\n*   **Focus on Replacement:** The refined program explicitly states that '0's are *replaced* by '1's, clarifying the action.\n* **Consecutive '8' Handling:** This now handles cases with multiple '8's in a row correctly, ensuring only the boundaries of the sequence are modified. It emphasizes checking the *start* and *end* of '8' sequences.\n* **Horizontal Neighbors only:** The rule doesn't seem to apply to the verical direction.\n\nThis refined natural language program provides a more accurate and complete description of the transformation rule observed in both examples. It also highlights the importance of looking for the *boundaries* of number sequences, rather than individual number occurrences.\n"
