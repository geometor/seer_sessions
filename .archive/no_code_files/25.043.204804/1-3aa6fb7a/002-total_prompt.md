Okay, here's my analysis of the transformation and a natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The primary change observed between the input and output grids involves the introduction of the number '1'.  It appears to be placed adjacent to '8's, specifically in locations where a '8' transitions from another number. Let's examine the given input and output example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Transitioning '8's:** Scan the input grid and identify all '8' pixels. For each '8', check its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (up, down, left, and right). A transitioning '8' pixel exists in the input example.

2.  **Place '1':**
    *   Examine the four adjacent positions around the transitioning '8'.
    * Find the '0' that is right before the '8'. Replace the '0' with a '1'.
    * Find the '0' that is right after the last consecutive '8'. Replac the '0' with a '1'.

In essence, the rule identifies '8's that neighbour '0's, and those bordering '0's are changed into '1's.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
