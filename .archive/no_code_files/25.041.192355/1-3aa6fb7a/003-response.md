The transformation process involves identifying the first and last occurrences of the number 8 within the input grid. The first occurrence is found by reading row by row from top to bottom, and left to right within each row. The last occurrence is found by reading row by row from bottom to top, and right to left within each row.

Specifically:

1. **Locate the First '8':** Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the top row and moving left to right in each row. Identify the coordinates (row and column index) of the very first cell that contains the value 8.
2. **Modify to the Right of First '8':**  Take the coordinates of the first '8' found.  Examine the cell immediately to the right of this '8'. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and contains the value 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.
3. **Locate the Last '8':** Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the bottom row and moving right to left in each row, then moving upwards row by row. Identify the coordinates (row and column index) of the very first cell encountered in this reverse scan that contains the value 8. This will be the "last" '8' in forward reading order.
4. **Modify to the Left of Last '8':** Take the coordinates of the last '8' found (from step 3). Examine the cell immediately to the left of this '8'. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and contains the value 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.

This process is applied to transform the input grid into the output grid. Note that if there is no cell to the right of the first '8' (i.e., it's in the last column) or no cell to the left of the last '8' (i.e., it's in the first column), or if the adjacent cell is not 0, no change is made at that step.
