Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`.

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The primary objects are squares of the color 8 (likely representing a specific color, e.g., dark gray).

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    The rule is: For the smallest shape of color 8, number 1 is placed in the top left pixel in a line going vertically and number 1 is placed in the bottom right most pixel of the same shape in the line going vertically.

3.  **Step-by-step application of rule:**
    - The input has two shapes of color 8:
        -Shape 1: A vertical line of two pixels on the left side.
        -Shape 2: A vertical line of two pixel on the right side.
    - Apply the rule: The number 1 is placed in the top left pixel in shape 1 and it is also placed in the bottom right pixel of shape 2.

**Natural Language Program (NLP):**

Locate all shapes of color 8. For each shape of color 8, check if there are many or only one shape. Place the number 1 in the top left pixel that composes vertically that color 8 shape and the bottom right most pixel in the shapes of color 8 that are vertically shaped.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_2_input` to `example_2_output`.

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** The primary objects are squares of color 8 (dark gray).

2.  **Transformation Rule:** The rule is: For each shape of color 8, place the number 1 in the top-left-most pixel and bottom-right-most pixel, *only if* the shape forms a vertical line.

3.  **Step-by-step application of rule:**
    -   The input has three shapes of color 8:
        -   Shape 1: A vertical line on the right side.
        -   Shape 2: Two connected pixels in a vertical line on the left side.
        -   Shape 3: A square shape (2x2) with 8s.
    -   Apply the rule:
        -   For Shape 1, a vertical line, place 1 at the top-left and bottom-right.
        -   For Shape 2, place 1 at the top-left and bottom-right.
        -  For Shape 3, No action as this is not considered vertical since it spans multiple columns.

**Natural Language Program (NLP):**

Locate all shapes of color 8. For each shape, determine if it forms a vertical line (all pixels in the shape share the same column). If a shape is a vertical line, place the number 1 in its top-left-most pixel and its bottom-right-most pixel.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
