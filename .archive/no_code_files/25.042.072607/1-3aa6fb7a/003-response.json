Note its position (row and column index).\n3. **Modify Right Neighbor of First '8':** Check if the identified first '8' is not in the last column of the grid. If it is not in the last column, change the value of the cell immediately to its right to '1'.\n4. **Locate Last '8':** Scan the grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right, to find the very last instance of the number '8'. Note its position (row and column index).\n5. **Modify Left Neighbor of Last '8':** Check if the identified last '8' is not in the first column of the grid. If it is not in the first column, change the value of the cell immediately to its left to '1'.\n6. **Output Result:** The grid, after these modifications, is the final output.\n\n**Concise Natural Language Program:**\n\nFind the first '8' in the grid (reading order: top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
