We are interested in cells with the value '8'.\n2. **Find First Object:** Locate the first occurrence of the value '8' in the input grid by reading it row by row from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right.\n3. **Action on First Object:** If the found '8' is not in the last column of the grid, change the value of the cell immediately to its right to '1'.\n4. **Find Last Object:** Locate the last occurrence of the value '8' in the input grid by reading it row by row from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right.\n5. **Action on Last Object:** If the found '8' is not in the first column of the grid, change the value of the cell immediately to its left to '1'.\n6. **Output:** The modified grid is the output.\n\n**Concise Natural Language Program:**\n\nFind the first '8' in the grid (row-major order). If it's not in the last column, change its right neighbor to '1'. Find the last '8' in the grid (row-major order). If it's not in the first column, change its left neighbor to '1'."
