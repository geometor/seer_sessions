**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The objects are grid cells containing numerical values. We are interested in cells with the value '8'.
2. **Find First Object:** Locate the first occurrence of the value '8' in the input grid by reading it row by row from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right.
3. **Action on First Object:** If the found '8' is not in the last column of the grid, change the value of the cell immediately to its right to '1'.
4. **Find Last Object:** Locate the last occurrence of the value '8' in the input grid by reading it row by row from top to bottom, and within each row from left to right.
5. **Action on Last Object:** If the found '8' is not in the first column of the grid, change the value of the cell immediately to its left to '1'.
6. **Output:** The modified grid is the output.

**Concise Natural Language Program:**

Find the first '8' in the grid (row-major order). If it's not in the last column, change its right neighbor to '1'. Find the last '8' in the grid (row-major order). If it's not in the first column, change its left neighbor to '1'.
