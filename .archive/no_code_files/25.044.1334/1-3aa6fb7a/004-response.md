Okay, the analysis and natural language program from the previous response are correct and consistent with this new example. I'll generate the Python code, which will be the same as before since the rule hasn't changed.

```python
"""
1.  **Identify '8's:** Find all cells containing the digit `8` in the input grid.

2.  **Check Left:** For each `8`, check if a '1' can be placed. Check if it is not at the most-left position, and then check if the cell to the immediate left is a `0`. If both are true, place a `1` in the corresponding position in the output grid.

3.  **Check Below:**  For each `8`, Check if it is not at the bottom position, and check the cell immediately below. If that cell contains a `0`, place a `1` in that position in the output grid.

4. **Copy 8's:** All the '8' in input was kept at the same position.

5.  **Preserve '0's:** All cells that were `0` in the input grid remain `0` in the output grid.
