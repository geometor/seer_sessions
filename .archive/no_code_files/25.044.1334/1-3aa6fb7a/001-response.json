Specifically, the `1` appears to be placed to the immediate left or immediate below an `8`, but only if the `8` does not already have adjacent number.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Seeding Object:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Check Left First:** For each `8`, check if the position is not at column 1. If the condition holds, check if the cell immediately to the left is a 0. If it is, replace that `0` with a `1` in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Check the Position Below:** check if the position is not at the maximum row. If the condition holds, check if the cell is available, check the cell immediately below, if there is a '0' at the location, place '1'.\n\n4. **Copy Other 8:** All others 8 were simply kept at the same place.\n\n5.  **Preserve Empty Cells:** All other cells (containing `0`) in the input grid remain unchanged (remain `0`) in the output grid.\n"
