Here's my step-by-step description:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects in the input grid are the non-zero pixels, which have a value of 8.\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find instances of the digit 8 that satisfy *either* of the two following conditions:\n    *   The 8 is at location `input[x][y]` where the pixel beneath it `input[x+1][y]` *and* the pixel to it's right `input[x][y+1]` are both equal to zero.\n    *   The 8 is at location `input[x][y]` where the pixel above it `input[x-1][y]` *and* the pixel to it's left `input[x][y-1]` are both equal to zero.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** change the located 8s to 1.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including 0s and 8s which do not satisfy the specified condition, remain unchanged.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nThe transformation identifies isolated 8's, specifically when it's clear either above and to the left, or below and to the right, and changes those 8's to 1. All other parts of the grid remain the same.\n"
