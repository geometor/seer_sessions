Here's my step-by-step description:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of color 8 (presumably a specific color like, say, purple).\n\n2.  **Predicate - Inside:** Look for any pixel of value '0' that is *surrounded* entirely on its four main sides (up, down, left, right) by pixels of color 8. Diagonally adjacent pixels do not matter. In the provided grids, we can locate 2 pixels that are value 0 and satisfy the predicate.\n\n3.  **Action - Replace:** If any 0 value pixels satisfy the predicate described in step 2, change its value to '1'.\n\n4. **All other pixels are unchanged.** Copy all other pixels from Input to Output without changing values.\n**In summary:** The transformation identifies '0' value pixels that are completely surrounded by '8' value pixels on all four cardinal directions, and changes those '0's to '1's. All the other pixels are unchanged.\n"
