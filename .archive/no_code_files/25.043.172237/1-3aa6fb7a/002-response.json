            "text": "Okay, I understand the task. I need to analyze the given input and output grids, determine the transformation rule, and then express that rule in both natural language and Python code.\n\nHere's my initial analysis of the example:\n\n*   The input and output grids are 7x7.\n*   The input grid contains only 0s and 8s.\n*   The output grid contains 0s, 8s, and 1s.\n*   The 8s appear to be in the same positions in both grids.\n*   The 1s seem to replace some of the 0s that were adjacent to 8s. Specifically it appears there are '1' to the immediate right of the top most '8', and immediately to the left of the bottom most '8'.\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize the following transformation rule:\n\n1.  Copy all 8s from the input grid to the output grid.\n2.  Find the topmost '8', replace the '0' which is located to its immediate right, with '1'.\n3. Find the bottommost '8', replace the '0' which is located to its immediate left, with '1' .\n4. Copy any remaining elements.\n\nNow, I'll translate this into a natural language program and Python code.\n\n"
