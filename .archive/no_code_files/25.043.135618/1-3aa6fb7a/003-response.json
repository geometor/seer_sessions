The 8s form connected objects.\n\n2.  **Observe the Change:**  Some '8' values have been replaced by '1's. There appear to be three connected components of '8'.  The top rightmost '8' in the top right component has been replaced by a '1'. The rightmost 8 of the top row of the component on the top left has been changed to 1. In the bottom component, the leftmost '8' in the top row of the component has been changed to a '1'.\n\n3.  **Describe the Rule:** The rule appears to be to identify all connected components of 8s, and transform a specific 8 within each component to a 1. We determine which component by its approximate location:\n    - top right component: change the rightmost element of the top row to 1\n    - top left component: change the rightmost element of the top row to 1\n    - bottom component: change the leftmost element of the top row to 1\n\n**Natural Language Program (NLP):**\n\nLocate all connected components of '8's. For each component, identify its approximate location as \"top right\", \"top left\" or \"bottom\".\n- For the \"top right\" component, change the rightmost element of the top row from '8' to '1'.\n- For the \"top left\" component, change the rightmost element of the top row from '8' to '1'.\n- For the \"bottom\" component, change the leftmost element of the top row from '8' to '1'.\n"
