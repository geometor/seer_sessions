Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (light blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Positions:**
    *   Find the object in the second row and the first column occupied by the color '8'.
    *   Find the object in the fifth row and second to last column occupied by the color '8'.

3.  **Apply Transformation:**
    + Change pixel color to '1' (dark blue) to the right side of the object in the second row, and to the left side of the object in the fifth row.

**Step-by-step Description in other words:**

Looking at input we can see that there are light blue objects (number 8).
The program find the object in the second row. Then change the first '0' after the object to a '1'.
Also, it find an object in the fifth row, and changes the first '0' before the number '8' to '1'.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
