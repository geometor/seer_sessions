The core concept from the first example seems to apply, but we need to verify and refine it.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all occurrences of the number 8 within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Neighbor Analysis:** For each identified '8', examine its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonal neighbors are *not* considered.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   If a '8' has exactly one neighbor that is also an '8', change the value of the original '8' to '1'.\n    *   If a '8' has zero, two, three, or four neighbors that are '8', its value remains unchanged.\n\n**Key Observations and Refinements:**\n\n*   **Specificity of Neighbors:** The rule strictly applies to immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors.\n*   **Single Neighbor Condition:** The transformation to '1' occurs *only* when there's exactly one '8' neighbor.\n*    The program identifies the transformation and provides a correct explanation.\n"
