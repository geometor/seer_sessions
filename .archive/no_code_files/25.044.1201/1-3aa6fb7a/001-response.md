Okay, here's a natural language description of the transformation observed between the input and output grids:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all instances of the number 8 in the input grid.

2.  **Check Neighbors:** For each instance of the number 8, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).

3.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   If an 8 has only one other immediate neighbours that is an 8, change this 8 to the number 1.
    *   If not leave that 8 unchaged.

**In essence, the transformation identifies isolated 8 and converts it to 1.**
