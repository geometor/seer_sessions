The task is to analyze the provided input and output images (represented as grids) and determine the transformation rule. The examples suggest a rule based on the number of neighbors of a specific value ('8'). Let's verify and refine this rule and then implement it in Python. I will state the transformation as natural language program.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '8's:** Find all cells in the input grid that contain the value 8.
2.  **Count '8' Neighbors:** For each cell with an 8, count how many of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) also have the value 8.
3.  **Conditional Change:** If a cell with an 8 has *exactly one* neighbor that is also an 8, change the cell's value to 1. Otherwise, leave the cell's value unchanged.

Now I will produce corresponding code.


```python
"""
