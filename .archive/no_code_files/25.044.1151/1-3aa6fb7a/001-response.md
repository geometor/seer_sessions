Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Adjacency:**
    For each `8`, we will check the surrounding neighbors. A neighbor means cells that are located diagonally.
    *   Upper Left
    *   Upper Right
    *   Button Left
    *   Button Right

3.  **Transformation/Replacement:**
    If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`

4.  Copy all values

**In simpler terms:** The rule highlights `8`s that have another `8` diagonally. The highlighted `8` will be changed to `1` in the output.

**Example Application:**

*   In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent.
*   In the input, the `8` at position (4,5) changed to `1` because is adjacent with the `8` on his button-right.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation.
