Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Adjacency:**
    For each `8`, we will check the surrounding neighbors. A neighbor means cells that are located diagonally.
    *   Upper Left
    *   Upper Right
    *   Button Left
    *   Button Right

3.  **Transformation/Replacement:**
    If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`

4.  Copy all values

**In simpler terms:** The rule highlights `8`s that have another `8` diagonally. The highlighted `8` will be changed to `1` in the output.

**Example Application:**

*   In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent.
*   In the input, the `8` at position (4,5) changed to `1` because is adjacent with the `8` on his button-right.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation.


*text:*
Okay, I understand the task. You've provided a clear natural language description of the transformation rule, which involves identifying the digit '8' in the input grid and changing it to '1' if another '8' is present diagonally adjacent to it. All other digits remain unchanged.

You've also provided a clear skeleton template, and instructions for writing the Python code, including assertions and error handling.

Before I generate the Python code, I'd like to clarify one minor point about the natural language program description. In step 3 you write, "If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`". And you mention: "In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent." Perhaps there is some confusion in terms of indexes and their origin (0 or 1). Can you provide the input and output grids?


*text:*
You are absolutely right to point out the potential for confusion with the indexing. My apologies, I should have been more precise and consistent.  You've provided the correct input and output grids, and they are essential for clarity. My previous description has minor indexing errors. Let me revise and clarify the natural language program, with explicit indexing starting from 0:

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will become the output grid, and we'll modify it directly.

2.  **Iterate through the Input Grid:** Examine each cell in the input grid, row by row, and column by column.  We can describe the location of each cell using row index `r` (starting from 0) and column index `c` (starting from 0).

3.  **Identify '8's:** For each cell at `(r, c)`, check if the value is equal to `8`.

4.  **Check Diagonal Neighbors:** If the cell at `(r, c)` contains an `8`, check its four diagonally adjacent neighbors:
    *   Upper-Left:  `(r-1, c-1)`
    *   Upper-Right: `(r-1, c+1)`
    *   Lower-Left:  `(r+1, c-1)`
    *   Lower-Right: `(r+1, c+1)`

5.  **Boundary Check:** Before accessing any neighbor, *crucially* check if the neighbor's row and column indices are within the valid bounds of the grid.  For a 7x7 grid, valid row indices are 0-6, and valid column indices are 0-6.  If a neighbor is out of bounds, *do not* consider it.

6.  **Transformation Rule:** If *any* of the valid (in-bounds) diagonally adjacent neighbors also contains an `8`, change the value of the cell in the *output* grid at position `(r, c)` from `8` to `1`.

7.  **Implicit Copy:** Any cell in the input grid that *isn't* an `8`, or is an `8` with *no* diagonally adjacent `8` neighbors (within bounds), is implicitly copied to the output grid with its original value. This is because we started with a copy of the input.

**Example Application (Corrected Indexing):**

*   Input `8` at `(1, 4)`:  The diagonal neighbor at `(2, 5)` is an `8`. Therefore, in the output, `(1, 4)` becomes `1`.
*   Input `8` at `(2, 2)`: The diagonal neighbor at `(3, 3)` is an `8`. Therefore, in the output, `(2, 2)` becomes `1`.
*    Input `8` at `(5,4)`: The diagonal neighbor at `(6,3)` is an `8`. Therefore, in the output, `(5, 4)` becomes `1`.
*   Input `8` at `(0, 4)`:  The diagonal neighbor at `(1, 5)` is an `8`.  *No* other diagonal neighbors are `8`.  Output at `(0, 4)` remains `8`.
*   Input `8` at `(0, 5)`: No diagonal neighbor. Output at `(0, 5)` remains `8`.

**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**

*   **Explicit Indexing (from 0):**  The description now clearly states that row and column indices start from 0.
*   **Output Grid Modification:**  The program explicitly states that we're modifying a *copy* of the input grid, which becomes the output.
*   **Boundary Checks:** The description now *emphasizes* the critical importance of checking boundary conditions before accessing neighbors.
*   **Implicit Copy:** The behavior for non-8 cells, and 8s without diagonal 8 neighbors is clarified.
* **Any Neighbor:** If *any* valid neighbors contains `8`, the cell is changed.

This revised description is much more precise and directly translatable into code, avoiding any ambiguity. It also clearly states the "copy and modify" approach, making the coding task easier.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
