Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed changes:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` within the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Adjacency:**
    For each `8`, we will check the surrounding neighbors. A neighbor means cells that are located diagonally.
    *   Upper Left
    *   Upper Right
    *   Button Left
    *   Button Right

3.  **Transformation/Replacement:**
    If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`

4.  Copy all values

**In simpler terms:** The rule highlights `8`s that have another `8` diagonally. The highlighted `8` will be changed to `1` in the output.

**Example Application:**

*   In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent.
*   In the input, the `8` at position (4,5) changed to `1` because is adjacent with the `8` on his button-right.

This natural language program captures the essence of the transformation.


*text:*
Okay, I understand the task. You've provided a clear natural language description of the transformation rule, which involves identifying the digit '8' in the input grid and changing it to '1' if another '8' is present diagonally adjacent to it. All other digits remain unchanged.

You've also provided a clear skeleton template, and instructions for writing the Python code, including assertions and error handling.

Before I generate the Python code, I'd like to clarify one minor point about the natural language program description. In step 3 you write, "If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`". And you mention: "In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent." Perhaps there is some confusion in terms of indexes and their origin (0 or 1). Can you provide the input and output grids?

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
