Okay, I understand the task. You've provided a clear natural language description of the transformation rule, which involves identifying the digit '8' in the input grid and changing it to '1' if another '8' is present diagonally adjacent to it. All other digits remain unchanged.

You've also provided a clear skeleton template, and instructions for writing the Python code, including assertions and error handling.

Before I generate the Python code, I'd like to clarify one minor point about the natural language program description. In step 3 you write, "If an `8` is found diagonally adjacent to another `8`, change the `8` from the original input to `1`". And you mention: "In the input, the `8` at position (1,1) does *not* change because the `8` in position (2,2) is adjacent." Perhaps there is some confusion in terms of indexes and their origin (0 or 1). Can you provide the input and output grids?
