--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids and describe it step-by-step.

Here's my analysis of the transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are squares of the color 8 (grey).

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    Search the input for instances of the color 8 that are diagonally adjacent to each other, forming 2x1 grids.
    For each pair, the following should happen:
        The color of the 8 at the top should be changed to 1.
        The color of the 8 at the bottom should not be changed.

3.  **Application:** Apply this rule to the entire input grid to generate the output grid.

In essence, the transformation identifies vertically stacked, two-cell instances of color '8' and turns the top cell to color '1'. Other instances of 8 are left unchanged.

Okay, I understand. You've provided a natural language program and an example input/output pair, and you want me to generate a Python module that implements the transformation. Here's the Python code based on your description:


```python

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
