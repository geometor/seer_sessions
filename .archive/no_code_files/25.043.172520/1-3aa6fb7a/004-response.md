Okay, I've analyzed your feedback and the provided `example_2_input` and `example_2_output`. I see where I made a mistake in the previous iteration. The '1' should replace the *lower* value of 8 on a downwards-left diagonal, and it should replace the *higher* value of 8 on a downwards-right diagonal.

Here's the corrected analysis and the updated code:

**Corrected Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Focus on squares with the color 8 (grey).

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Scan the input grid for instances of color 8.
    *   Check for diagonally adjacent pairs of color 8.
    *   If a diagonal pair is found, and it's a top-left to bottom-right diagonal, change the color of the *top* 8 to 1.
    *   If a diagonal pair is found, and it's a top-right to bottom-left diagonal, change the color of the *bottom* 8 to 1.

3.  **Application:** Apply this rule systematically across the entire grid to get the output.

**Corrected Python Code:**

Key Changes:

*   **Corrected Index for Bottom-Left Change:**  The crucial fix is in the line `output_grid[i + 1][j - 1] = 1`. This now correctly targets the *lower* 8 in a top-right to bottom-left diagonal pair.
* **Updated NLP:** The natural language description now clearly specifies which 8 is changed in each diagonal case.
*   **Two Test Cases:** The code includes both the original and the second example to verify that it's working correctly.
*   **Removed Redundant Check:** Removed a redundant check in the example.

This version accurately reflects the transformation rule, correctly handling both types of diagonal adjacencies and modifying the correct cells in each case.
