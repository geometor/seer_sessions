Okay, here's my analysis of the transformation and a natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The primary change observed between the input and output grids is the insertion of the number `1` in specific locations relative to existing `8`s. The `1` appears to be inserted diagonally adjacent to an `8`, specifically to the top-right of a solitary `8` or below and to the left.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Solitary 8s:** Scan the input grid to find all instances of the number `8`. A solitary '8' is defined by the fact that it does not have any adjacent (up, down, left, right) '8'.

2.  **Insert 1 Diagonally:** For each solitary `8` found:
    *   If the `8` is not adjacent to any other 8s on its sides, insert a `1` in the cell diagonally to its top-right, or lower-left.

3. **All the other values and positions are the same.** The values which aren't `8`, solitary and adjacent to another, are all `0` and they stay `0`.
