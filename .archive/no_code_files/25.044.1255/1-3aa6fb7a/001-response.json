The `1` appears to be inserted diagonally adjacent to an `8`, specifically to the top-right of a solitary `8` or below and to the left.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Solitary 8s:** Scan the input grid to find all instances of the number `8`. A solitary '8' is defined by the fact that it does not have any adjacent (up, down, left, right) '8'.\n\n2.  **Insert 1 Diagonally:** For each solitary `8` found:\n    *   If the `8` is not adjacent to any other 8s on its sides, insert a `1` in the cell diagonally to its top-right, or lower-left.\n\n3. **All the other values and positions are the same.** The values which aren't `8`, solitary and adjacent to another, are all `0` and they stay `0`.\n\n"
