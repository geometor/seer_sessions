Okay, here's my analysis of the transformation and a natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The primary change observed between the input and output grids is the insertion of the number `1` in specific locations relative to existing `8`s. The `1` appears to be inserted diagonally adjacent to an `8`, specifically to the top-right of a solitary `8` or below and to the left.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Solitary 8s:** Scan the input grid to find all instances of the number `8`. A solitary '8' is defined by the fact that it does not have any adjacent (up, down, left, right) '8'.

2.  **Insert 1 Diagonally:** For each solitary `8` found:
    *   If the `8` is not adjacent to any other 8s on its sides, insert a `1` in the cell diagonally to its top-right, or lower-left.

3. **All the other values and positions are the same.** The values which aren't `8`, solitary and adjacent to another, are all `0` and they stay `0`.


**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
