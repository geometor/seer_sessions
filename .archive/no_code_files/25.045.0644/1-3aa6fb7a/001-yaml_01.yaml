task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle"
transformation_rule: "Modify cells adjacent to connected '8' regions."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "connectivity"
      - "top-left most cell"
actions:
  - action_type: "change_color"
    target_object: "cell adjacent to '8'-object's top-left cell"
    new_color: 1
    conditions:
      - "target cell is within grid boundaries"
      - "target cell's original color is 0"
transformation_steps:
  - "Identify connected regions of color '8'."
  - "For each region, find the top-left most cell."
  - "For the first region, change the cell to the right of its top-left cell to '1' if possible."
  - "For the second region, change the cell below its top-left cell to '1' if possible."
