We can consider these as distinct objects.\n2. **Locate Top-Left Cell:** For each '8'-object, determine its \"top-left most\" cell. This is the cell within the object with the smallest row index, and among those with the smallest row index, the smallest column index.\n3. **Sequential Modification:**\n    - For the *first* '8'-object identified:  Examine the cell immediately to the right of its top-left cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is '0', change its color to '1'.\n    - For the *second* '8'-object identified: Examine the cell immediately below its top-left cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is '0', change its color to '1'.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"ARC-AGI grid puzzle\"\ntransformation_rule: \"Modify cells adjacent to connected '8' regions.\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"connected region\"\n    color: 8\n    properties:\n      - \"connectivity\"\n      - \"top-left most cell\"\nactions:\n  - action_type: \"change_color\"\n    target_object: \"cell adjacent to '8'-object's top-left cell\"\n    new_color: 1\n    conditions:\n      - \"target cell is within grid boundaries\"\n      - \"target cell's original color is 0\"\ntransformation_steps:\n  - \"Identify connected regions of color '8'.\"\n  - \"For each region, find the top-left most cell.\"\n  - \"For the first region, change the cell to the right of its top-left cell to '1' if possible.\"\n  - \"For the second region, change the cell below its top-left cell to '1' if possible.\"\n```"
