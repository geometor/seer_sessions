            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`. I need to describe the changes in a step-by-step natural language program. I will examine the provided input and output grids to determine the objects, their properties, and the actions that transform the input to the output.\n\nSince I do not have the visual representations of the grid objects, I will create a placeholder description and highlight the areas where I need the visual information. I'll assume there *is* a transformation, and make my best guess about what it might be, and later, when presented with more examples, I will refine this.\n\nHere's a potential NLP, assuming a simple transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Largest Object:** Find the largest contiguous object in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color. \"Largest\" is determined by the number of pixels.\n2.  **Change its color:** Change the color of all pixels within this largest object to a specific, pre-determined color. *(Placeholder: Let's assume for now the color changes to blue. I would note the ACTUAL before and after colors here.)*\n3. **Preserve other pixels**: All other pixels that are *not* part of the largest object maintain their original color.\n\n**Missing information preventing the actual solution:**\n*   **Visual representation of the input grid:**  I need to see the arrangement of colored pixels to determine the objects.\n*   **Visual representation of the output grid:** I need to see the result of the transformation to check the logic and specific new color.\n\nOnce I have this data I will refine my NLP.\n"
