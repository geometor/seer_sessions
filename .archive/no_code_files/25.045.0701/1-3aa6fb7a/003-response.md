**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all cells in the input grid that are colored azure (color 8).
2.  Process these azure cells in reading order, keeping track of the order with a counter starting from 1.
3.  For the 1st azure cell encountered in reading order:
    a. Examine the cell immediately below it.
    b. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is white (color 0), then change its color to blue (color 1).
4.  For the 4th azure cell encountered in reading order:
    a. Examine the cell immediately to its right.
    b. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is white (color 0), then change its color to blue (color 1).
5.  For the 7th azure cell encountered in reading order:
    a. Examine the cell immediately to its left.
    b. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is white (color 0), then change its color to blue (color 1).
6.  If there are fewer than 7 azure cells, only apply the rules for the 1st and 4th (if they exist and are applicable). If fewer than 4, only for the 1st (if applicable).
7.  The grid resulting from these changes is the final output.

**Transformation Rule:** "Iterate through cells with color 8 in reading order. For the 1st color 8 cell, change the color of the cell below it to 1 if it is 0. For the 4th color 8 cell, change the color of the cell to its right to 1 if it is 0. For the 7th color 8 cell, change the color of the cell to its left to 1 if it is 0."
