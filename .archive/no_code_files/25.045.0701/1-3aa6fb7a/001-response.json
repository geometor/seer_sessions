Locate all cells in the input grid that are colored azure (color 8).\n2.  Determine the cell among these azure cells that appears first when reading the grid from top to bottom, and left to right within each row. Let's call this the 'first azure cell'.\n3.  Examine the cell immediately to the right of the 'first azure cell'. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is white (color 0), then change its color to blue (color 1).\n4.  Determine the cell among the azure cells that appears last in the same reading order (top to bottom, left to right). Let's call this the 'last azure cell'.\n5.  Examine the cell immediately to the left of the 'last azure cell'. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is white (color 0), then change its color to blue (color 1).\n6.  The grid resulting from these changes is the final output."
