Okay, here's a natural language description of the transformation observed between the input and output grids, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (cyan).

2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find the '8' that is immediately to the left of another '8' horizontally.

3.  Change Color Right Diagonal:
    If There is a blue pixel to the right, then replace by a '1'.

4.  **Apply to All Instances:** Repeat this process for every instance of an '8' that satisfies the specified condition.

**Step-by-step explanation of the example provided:**
1. We see two set of cyan ('8') in the grid.
2. Locate the number '8' that is next to another '8' at its right. In the first set, the first '8' is located at the coordinates (1,1), with the second at (1,2). In the second set, The first element is at (3,4) and the second at (3,5).
3. The '8' at coordinate (1,1) changes to '1'.
4. The '8' at coordinate (4,5) changes to '1'.
