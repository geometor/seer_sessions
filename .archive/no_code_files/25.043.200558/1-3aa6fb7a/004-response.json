Their original colors are preserved.\n\n**In Summary:** The transformation rule consistently identifies 2x2 squares filled with color '8', and then changes the top-left and bottom-right corners of *those squares only* to color '1', leaving the rest of the grid untouched.\n\n**Python Code (Final):**\n\n"

No further modifications are needed. The logic of finding all 2x2 squares and transforming the corners is already in place.\n*   **Clear Docstrings:** The docstrings clearly explain the rule and the function's behavior.\n*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block now includes the third example's input and expected output, ensuring the code works correctly for all provided cases.\n* **Correct Output**: The code now works as expected for all cases.\n\nThis final version of the code provides a concise, correct, and well-documented solution that accurately implements the transformation rule discovered through the analysis of the three examples. The iterative process of refining the natural language program and the code, based on each example, has led to a robust and general solution.\n"
