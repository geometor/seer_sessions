Okay, I understand the task. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the resulting Python code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understanding the Rule:** The natural language program clearly describes a targeted color change within specific 2x2 squares of color '8'. The key is identifying the correct corner pixels (top-left of the left square, bottom-right of the right square) and changing only their color to '1'.

2.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   I'll create a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original.
    *   I need to iterate through the grid to find the 2x2 squares of color '8'.
    *    Once a square is found, I change the top-left pixel of the left hand square to '1', and bottom-right of the right square to 1.

3.  **Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is crucial. It allows me to directly test the `transform` function with the provided input and expected output, giving immediate feedback on correctness.

**Python Code:**


```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Corner Positions:** Find the two '8' (blue) objects that exist exclusively in the corners of the shapes (2x2 groups) formed by color '8'. These would be in the most upper-left and most bottom-right positions in their respective 2x2 squares.

3. **Apply Color Change** Change the color to '1' of the corners in the previous step.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects, remain unchanged.

**In summary:**
The inputs shows two 2x2 squares of color 8.
Locate the top left object of the 2x2 square on the left, and the bottom right corner on the square on the right.
Change those colors to '1'.
All other cells are unchanged.

    """
