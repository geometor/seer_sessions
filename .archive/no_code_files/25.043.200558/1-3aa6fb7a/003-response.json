Instead of storing the squares in a list and then figuring out which is which, we directly apply the transformation *within* the loop that detects the 2x2 squares.\n*   **Direct Transformation:**  As soon as a 2x2 square of '8' is found, its top-left (`output_grid[i][j]`) and bottom-right (`output_grid[i + 1][j + 1]`) elements are changed to '1'.\n*   **No More Conditional Logic (for square selection):** We no longer need to determine which are \"selected\".  *All* detected squares are transformed.\n* **Correct Output**: The code now produces the expected result.\n\nThis revised code directly implements the core rule discovered in the natural language program, making it both more concise and easier to understand.  It correctly handles all 2x2 squares of the specified color.\n"
