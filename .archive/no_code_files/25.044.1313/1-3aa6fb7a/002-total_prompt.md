*text:*
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (light blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Positions:** Observe the digit '8's that are *not* part of a 2x2 block of '8's. There are exactly two such 8's
    in sample 1, one in the input and another in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   The digit directly to the right of the top-left corner of a 2x1 area with 8 as color is set to '1'.
    *   The digit directly above the bottom-right corner of a 2x1 area with 8 as color is changed to '1'.
    *   All the rest are not changed.

**Step By Step**
1. Input has a 2x1 area composed by 8 in color.
2. Change the number at the right of up-corner to 1
3. Input has another 2x1 area compsed by 8 in color.
4. Change the number above down-corner to 1.

In summary, the transformation identifies specific '8's which are part of two 1x2 areas in color eight.
The '8' at right of the top-left is changed to '1'.
The '8' above bottom-right is changed to '1'.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
