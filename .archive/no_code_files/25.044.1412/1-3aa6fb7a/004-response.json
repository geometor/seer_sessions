Determine Bounding Boxes: For each of these regions, calculate the smallest bounding box that encloses all cells of the region.\n3. Order Regions: Order the regions based primarily on the top row index of their bounding boxes, and secondarily on the left column index in case of a tie in top row indices, to determine the first, second, and subsequent regions.\n4. Modify First Region: For the first ordered region, locate the cell diagonally down and to the left from the top-right corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the top-right corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r+1, c-1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.\n5. Modify Second Region: For the second ordered region, locate the cell diagonally up and to the right from the bottom-left corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the bottom-left corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r-1, c+1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.\n6. Modify Third Region: For the third ordered region, locate the cell diagonally up and to the left from the bottom-right corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the bottom-right corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r-1, c-1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.\n7. Preserve Unchanged Cells: All cells in the grid that are not modified in steps 4, 5, and 6 retain their original values from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n]\n\nexpected_output = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    grid = np.array(input_grid).copy() # Create a copy to avoid modifying the input\n\n    regions = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    # Function to perform BFS for finding connected regions\n    def find_region(r, c):\n        region_cells = []\n        q = deque([(r, c)])\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        while q:\n            row, col = q.popleft()\n            region_cells.append((row, col))\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: # Explore neighbors\n                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                    q.append((nr, nc))\n        return region_cells\n\n    # Identify all regions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                regions.append(find_region(r, c))\n\n    region_bounding_boxes = []\n    for region in regions:\n        min_r = min(r for r, c in region)\n        max_r = max(r for r, c in region)\n        min_c = min(c for r, c in region)\n        max_c = max(c for r, c in region)\n        region_bounding_boxes.append(((min_r, min_c), (max_r, max_c), region)) # Store bounding box coordinates and region cells\n\n    # Order regions\n    def get_sort_key(bbox_data):\n        (min_r, min_c), _, _ = bbox_data\n        return (min_r, min_c)\n    region_bounding_boxes.sort(key=get_sort_key)\n\n    # Modify regions\n    if len(region_bounding_boxes) >= 1:\n        (min_r, min_c), (max_r, max_c), _ = region_bounding_boxes[0]\n        tr_r, tr_c = min_r, max_c # Top-right corner\n        diag_r, diag_c = tr_r + 1, tr_c - 1\n        if 0 <= diag_r < rows and 0 <= diag_c < cols and grid[diag_r, diag_c] == 0:\n            grid[diag_r, diag_c] = 1 # Diagonally down and to the left\n\n    if len(region_bounding_boxes) >= 2:\n        (min_r, min_c), (max_r, max_c), _ = region_bounding_boxes[1]\n        bl_r, bl_c = max_r, min_c # Bottom-left corner\n        diag_r, diag_c = bl_r - 1, bl_c + 1\n        if 0 <= diag_r < rows and 0 <= diag_c < cols and grid[diag_r, diag_c] == 0:\n            grid[diag_r, diag_c] = 1 # Diagonally up and to the right\n\n    if len(region_bounding_boxes) >= 3:\n        (min_r, min_c), (max_r, max_c), _ = region_bounding_boxes[2]\n        br_r, br_c = max_r, max_c # Bottom-right corner\n        diag_r, diag_c = br_r - 1, br_c - 1\n        if 0 <= diag_r < rows and 0 <= diag_c < cols and grid[diag_r, diag_c] == 0:\n            grid[diag_r, diag_c] = 1 # Diagonally up and to the left\n\n\n    return grid.tolist()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    if output == expected_output:\n        print(\"SUCCESS!\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"FAILED!\\n\")\n        print(\"Expected Output:\", expected_output)\n        print(\"Transformed Output:\", output)\n\n    print()\n    assert output == expected_output, \"Transformed output does not match expected output.\"\n```"
