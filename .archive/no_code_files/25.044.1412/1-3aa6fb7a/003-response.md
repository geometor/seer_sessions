**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Connected Regions:** Detect all distinct, connected regions formed by cells with value '8' in the input grid.
2. **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each of these regions, calculate the smallest bounding box that encloses all cells of the region.
3. **Order Regions:** Order the regions based primarily on the top row index of their bounding boxes, and secondarily on the left column index in case of a tie in top row indices, to determine the first, second, and subsequent regions.
4. **Modify First Region:** For the first ordered region, locate the cell diagonally down and to the left from the top-right corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the top-right corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r+1, c-1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.
5. **Modify Second Region:** For the second ordered region, locate the cell diagonally up and to the right from the bottom-left corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the bottom-left corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r-1, c+1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.
6. **Modify Third Region:** For the third ordered region, locate the cell diagonally up and to the left from the bottom-right corner of its bounding box. Specifically, if the bottom-right corner is at row `r` and column `c`, examine the cell at `(r-1, c-1)`. If this cell exists within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', change its value to '1'.
7. **Preserve Unchanged Cells:** All cells in the grid that are not modified in steps 4, 5, and 6 retain their original values from the input grid.

**Explanation of Objects, Properties, and Actions:**

* **Objects:**
    * **Grid:** The input and output 2D array of numbers.
    * **Regions of '8's:** Connected groups of cells with value '8'.
    * **Bounding Box:** Rectangular area defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of a region.
    * **Cell:** Individual element in the grid, identified by its row and column index.
    * **Corner Cells of Bounding Box:** Top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right corners of the bounding box.
    * **Diagonal Cells:** Cells located diagonally adjacent to the corner cells of the bounding boxes.
* **Properties (Predicates):**
    * **Connected:** Property of cells being adjacent (horizontally or vertically) and having the same value ('8').
    * **Value '8':** Property of a cell having the value 8.
    * **Value '0':** Property of a cell having the value 0.
    * **Bounding Box Coordinates:** Top row, bottom row, left column, right column of a bounding box.
    * **Top-Left Corner (of Bounding Box):** The cell at the top-left of a bounding box, used for ordering regions.
    * **Top-Right Corner (of Bounding Box):** The cell at the top-right of a bounding box.
    * **Bottom-Left Corner (of Bounding Box):** The cell at the bottom-left of a bounding box.
    * **Bottom-Right Corner (of Bounding Box):** The cell at the bottom-right of a bounding box.
    * **Diagonal Down-Left Cell:** Cell at (row+1, column-1) relative to a given cell.
    * **Diagonal Up-Right Cell:** Cell at (row-1, column+1) relative to a given cell.
    * **Diagonal Up-Left Cell:** Cell at (row-1, column-1) relative to a given cell.
    * **Within Grid Boundaries:** Property of a cell's coordinates being valid within the grid dimensions.
* **Actions:**
    * **Identify:** Detect regions of '8's.
    * **Calculate:** Determine the bounding box for each region.
    * **Order:** Rank regions based on their bounding box top-left corner.
    * **Locate:** Find specific corner cells of the bounding box (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
    * **Examine:** Check the value of diagonal cells relative to the corner cells.
    * **Change Value:** Modify the value of a cell to '1'.
    * **Preserve:** Keep the value of cells unchanged.
