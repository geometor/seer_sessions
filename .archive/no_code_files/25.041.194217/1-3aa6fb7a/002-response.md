Natural Language Program:

The transformation process is as follows:
Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
If a cell's value is 0, examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.
Count how many of these neighbors have a value of 8 in the input grid.
If this count is exactly 2, then change the value of the cell in the output grid to 1.
If the cell's value in the input grid is 8, then keep its value as 8 in the output grid.
If the cell's value in the input grid is 0 and the count of neighboring 8s is not exactly 2, then keep its value as 0 in the output grid.
Apply this rule to every cell to generate the output grid.
