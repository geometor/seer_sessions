The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the '8's have been changed to '1's. Specifically, a '8' is transformed to a '1' if it is a single, isolated '8', vertically, on a column.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Isolated '8's in Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid. Within each column, identify '8's that do not have another '8' directly above or below them.\n2.  **Transform:** Change the identified isolated '8' to '1'.\n3. **Copy other numbers.** All other numbers, different to the ones identified on columns, should be the same value as original input.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.\n\nIn other words, we could say: The program turns the `8` to a `1` if the number has no adjacent vertical neighbors of value `8`. The rest of the elements remain unchanged.\n"
