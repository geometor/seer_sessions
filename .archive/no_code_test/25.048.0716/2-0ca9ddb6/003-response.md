Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    azure_object:
      color: 8 (azure)
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: 1x1
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: two 1x1
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: two 1x1
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: 9x9

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
     azure_object:
      color: 8 (azure)
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: 1x1
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: two 1x1
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: two 1x1
    yellow_object:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: eight 1x1 cells
    orange_object:
       color: 7 (orange)
       positions: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
       shape: eight 1x1 cells
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: 9x9
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   An azure pixel at (0, 3).
    *   Two red pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Yellow Crosses:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears centered around *each* of the red pixels. The yellow pixels are placed above and below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Crosses:** An orange "cross" (color 7) is created around *each* of the blue pixels. Orange pixels are placed to the left, right, above and below of the blue pixel.

4.  **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and azure pixels remain at their original locations.

**Natural Language Program Summary:**

The rule from the previous example is applied to all instances of colors 1 and 2. Yellow crosses are added, centered on each red pixel, and orange crosses are centered on each blue pixel. All original red, blue, and azure pixels are kept. The azure object doesn't interact.
