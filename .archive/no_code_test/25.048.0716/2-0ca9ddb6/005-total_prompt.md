Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: 9x9

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_object:
      color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    blue_object:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    yellow_object:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: four 1x1 cells
    orange_object:
       color: 7 (orange)
       positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** In the input grid, we have a single red pixel (object) at coordinates (3, 2) and a single blue pixel (object) at (6, 6). The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (background, color 0).

2.  **Yellow Cross:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears, centered around the red pixel. Specifically, yellow pixels are placed one position above, one position below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Cross:** An orange "cross" shape (color 7) appears, centered on the blue pixel. Specifically, orange pixels are placed one position to the left, right, above, and below the blue pixel.

4.  **Preservation:** The original red and blue pixels are preserved at their original locations.

**Natural language program summary**
A yellow cross centered on the red pixel and an orange cross centered on the blue pixel is added to the grid. The red and blue pixel are preserved.

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   An azure pixel at (0, 3).
    *   Two red pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Yellow Crosses:** A yellow "cross" shape (color 4) appears centered around *each* of the red pixels. The yellow pixels are placed above and below the red pixel.

3.  **Orange Crosses:** An orange "cross" (color 7) is created around *each* of the blue pixels. Orange pixels are placed to the left, right, above and below of the blue pixel.

4.  **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and azure pixels remain at their original locations.

**Natural Language Program Summary:**

The rule from the previous example is applied to all instances of colors 1 and 2. Yellow crosses are added, centered on each red pixel, and orange crosses are centered on each blue pixel. All original red, blue, and azure pixels are kept. The azure object doesn't interact.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
