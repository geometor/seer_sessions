One is a 2x1 vertical shape on the left side, and the other one is a 1x2 horizontal shape on the right side of the grid.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Two new blue (color 1) single-cell objects have been added to the output, inside the blank spaces of the azure (color 8) blocks.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    - Copy all of the azure (color 8) objects from the input to the output grid.\n    - Find the empty cells in the grid that are directly to the right or below a single block of color 8. If these are not part of any 2x2 block, turn them to blue (color 1).\n\n**Elaboration of the transformation rule:**\n\nThe core rule seems to be: Maintain the original azure shapes and add a blue cell adjacent to some of the single azure color cells. More specifically the blue color is replacing the white color (0) at a relative position of +1 on the x or y axis.\n"
