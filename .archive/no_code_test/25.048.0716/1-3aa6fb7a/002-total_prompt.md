Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure colored shapes."
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure colored shapes."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 blue colored dots."
  dimensions: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical shape on the left side, and the other one is a 1x2 horizontal shape on the right side of the grid.

2.  **Detect Change:** Two new blue (color 1) single-cell objects have been added to the output, inside the blank spaces of the azure (color 8) blocks.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Copy all of the azure (color 8) objects from the input to the output grid.
    - Find the empty cells in the grid that are directly to the right or below a single block of color 8. If these are not part of any 2x2 block, turn them to blue (color 1).

**Elaboration of the transformation rule:**

The core rule seems to be: Maintain the original azure shapes and add a blue cell adjacent to some of the single azure color cells. More specifically the blue color is replacing the white color (0) at a relative position of +1 on the x or y axis.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
