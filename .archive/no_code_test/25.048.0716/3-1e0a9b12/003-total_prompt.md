Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    blue_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
    magenta_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(2, 2)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 3)]
    white_squares:
      count: 11
      positions: Other cells

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(2,1), (3,1)]
    blue_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
    magenta_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 2)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 3)]
    white_squares:
     count: 11
     positions: Other cells
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify non-white objects:** Locate all colored squares (yellow, blue, magenta, and maroon) in the input grid.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom Row:** For each object, its new coordinates are calculated as (3, x\_input). This moves the object at row *x*, column *y* in the input to row 3, column *y* in the output.

3.  **Clear the original positions**: All other cells that are not updated in the output are turned to white (0).

**Summary of the transformation rule**

The transformation rule involves taking non-white cells on the input grid and moving them to the last row of the output grid, keeping their original column position. All other cells turn white.

                output_grid[rows - 1, j] = input_grid[i, j]

        for i in range(rows-1):
           if input_grid[i,j]!= 0: output_grid[i,j] = 0
    
    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
