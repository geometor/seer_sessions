Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    blue_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
    magenta_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(2, 2)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 3)]
    white_squares:
      count: 11
      positions: Other cells

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    yellow_squares:
      count: 2
      positions: [(2,1), (3,1)]
    blue_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
    magenta_square:
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 2)]
    maroon_square:
      count: 1

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify non-white objects:** Locate all colored squares (yellow, blue, magenta, and maroon) in the input grid.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom Row:** For each object, its new coordinates are calculated as (3, x\_input). This moves the object at row *x*, column *y* in the input to row 3, column *y* in the output.

3.  **Clear the original positions**: All other cells that are not updated in the output are turned to white (0).

**Summary of the transformation rule**

The transformation rule involves taking non-white cells on the input grid and moving them to the last row of the output grid, keeping their original column position. All other cells turn white.

1.  **Identify non-white objects:** Locate all colored squares in the input grid.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom Row if the row index is less than the number of rows -1**: For each colored object, its new coordinates are calculated as (rows-1, x\_input) if the row index is less than the number of rows-1. This moves the object at row *x*, column *y* in the input to row 5, column *y* in the output if x < number of rows -1. Otherwise colored cells are note moved.

3.  **Clear the original positions**: All other cells that are not updated in the output are turned to white (0).

**Summary of the transformation rule**

The transformation rule involves taking non-white cells on the input grid and moving them to the last row of the output grid if the row index is less than number of rows-1, keeping their original column position. Otherwise the coloured cells remain in place. All other cells turn white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
