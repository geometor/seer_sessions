Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      3:  # Green
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      1:  # Blue
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      2:  # Red
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      4:  # Yellow
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      5:  # Gray
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
      6:  # Magenta
        count: 3
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three columns, each filled with a single color. There exist three objects in the input. The first one comprises all cells of color 3 (green). The second object comprises cells of color 1 (blue), and the last object comprises cells of color 2 (red).

2.  **Color Mapping**:
    *   The green color (3) in the input is transformed to yellow (4) in the output.
    *   The blue color (1) in the input is transformed to gray (5) in the output.
    *   The red color (2) in the input is transformed to magenta (6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    - Identify objects and their colors.
    - Transform each color in the object, changing 3 to 4, 1 to 5, and 2 to 6.
    - Output has the same shape and size than the input.

In essence, the transformation is a simple color substitution based on the given mapping, maintaining the grid's structure.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution:
- Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
- Blue (1) becomes Gray (5)
- Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
The grid structure and dimensions remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by applying a color substitution:
    3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.
    """
    # Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.  We modify this copy.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply the color transformations.  NumPy allows this to be done concisely with boolean indexing.
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4  # Change all greens (3) to yellows (4)
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5  # Change all blues (1) to grays (5)
    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 6  # Change all reds (2) to magentas (6)

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
