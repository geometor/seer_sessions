Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical shapes and one 2x1 horizontal shape (if connected)."
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**
Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see objects of color 8 (azure). There are two groups of connected azure colored cells.

2.  **Change Color of one azure element:** At position x,y where we have the color azure, we go to x+1, and if the next position have color equals to 0, it is changed to 1.

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each group of azure colored cells:
   If the next position right is 0:
        Change color of the cell to 1.
```

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
