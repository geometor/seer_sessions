Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and two single 1x1 squares.
        position: 
          - One 2x1 shape at (1,1), (2,1)
          - One 1x1 shape at (2,2)
          - One 2x1 shape at (3,4), (4,4)
          - One 1x1 shape at (3,5)
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

  output_grid:
      - color: 8
        shape: same as input.
        position: same as input.
      - color: 1
        shape: 1x1.
        position: replaces single square objects of color 8.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, locate all the objects that are azure (color 8).
2.  **Categorize:** Identify if an object of colour 8 consists of 2 vertically stacked squares, or a single 1x1 square.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** All single azure (color 8) square objects are replaced by blue (color 1).
4. **Preservation:** All other azure objects, and empty cells maintain their original color.

In essence, single-celled azure objects are replaced with blue, while others, bigger objects, are preserved, as well as the white background.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: >
          Various shapes including single cells, 2x1 vertical,
          and 2x2 blocks.
        position: Distributed across the grid.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Same as input, excluding single cells.
        position: Same as input for non-single cells.
      - color: 1
        shape: 1x1
        position: Replaces single-cell azure objects from input.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is identical to the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  **Categorize Objects:** Determine the size of each azure object.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** Replace single-cell (1x1) azure objects with blue (color 1).
4.  **Preservation:** Keep all other azure objects (those larger than 1x1) and all background (color 0) cells unchanged.

The core concept is the identification and replacement of *single-cell* azure objects with blue ones, leaving larger azure objects and the rest of the grid untouched. The `transform` function provided previously perfectly implements this rule, and therefore correctly transforms the given input grid to the expected output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
