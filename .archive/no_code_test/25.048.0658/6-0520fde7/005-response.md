Okay, let's analyze this third transformation example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: [(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2, 4), (2,6)]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 10
      positions:  [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_objects:
      count: 2
      positions: [(1,0), (2,2)]
    white_objects:
      count: 7
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule, building on the previous example's logic, is:

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0).

2.  **Extract 3x3 Subgrids:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid.  For each cell, consider it as the top-left corner of a potential 3x3 subgrid. Extract this subgrid if it fits within the bounds of the input grid.

3.  **Pattern Check (Three Non-Zero Pixels):** Within each extracted 3x3 subgrid, count the number of non-zero (non-white) pixels.

4.  **Map Matching Subgrids:** If a 3x3 subgrid contains *exactly* three non-zero pixels, then:
    *   Copy the pattern of the subgrid cells that contain non-zero to the output grid, using the same relative positions but change cell color to red(2).

```python
"""
This transformation identifies patterns of non-white pixels in the input grid.
It locates all 3x3 subgrids and identifies those that contain exactly three non-zero cells.
If 3x3 subgrid contains exactly 3 non-zero cells, those are mapped to output grid with color red(2).

    for r in range(rows - 2):

            subgrid = input_grid[r:r+3, c:c+3]

            # Count non-zero pixels in the subgrid
            non_zero_count = np.count_nonzero(subgrid)

            # Check the condition: exactly three non-zero pixels
            if non_zero_count == 3:
