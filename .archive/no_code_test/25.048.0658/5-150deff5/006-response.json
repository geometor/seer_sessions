The background is entirely color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Split the Object:** The object's shape transformation suggests a horizontal split. It's divided into two parts, roughly through its \"middle\". What constitutes the middle isn't immediately obvious by row index, as rows 3 and 4 both seem central. It appears better described as separating the object into sections composed by exclusively 2-contiguous regions, from sections composed of larger contiguous regions.\n\n3.  **Recolor the Top Half:** The top half of the original object is recolored to 8 (azure).\n\n4.  **Recolor the Bottom Half:** The bottom half of the original object is recolored to 2 (red).\n\n5. **No other changes.** The parts of the input that are not color 5, are left the same.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule involves identifying a specific object, conceptually splitting it into two horizontal sections based on contiguity, and recoloring each section with a distinct color. The positions and overall shape is respected, just altering the original object's color, splitted in two.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule involves identifying a specific object, conceptually splitting it into two horizontal sections based on contiguity, and recoloring each section with a distinct color.
