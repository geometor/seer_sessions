            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second transformation.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: 10x8\n  objects:\n    - color: 5\n      shape: Irregular, resembling an \"H\" or two mirrored \"L\" shapes connected.\n      position: Starts at (1,1)\n      notes: Spans multiple rows and columns, symmetrical.\n  background:\n    color: 0\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: 10x8\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      shape: Appears to be the \"arms\" of the input H shape.\n      position: Top and middle-right sections.\n    - color: 2\n      shape: Appears as a vertical line and a block.\n      position:  Central vertical part of the \"H\" and the bottom central-right part.\n  background:\n    color: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's the step-by-step description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** The input grid contains one prominent object of color 5 (gray) against a background of color 0 (white). The object has a somewhat symmetrical shape resembling the letter \"H\".\n\n2.  **Decompose the Object:** Instead of a simple horizontal split, this transformation seems to decompose the object based on its shape features, not just row contiguity. The H shape can be seen to have several parts: the top horizontal 'arms', a central vertical line of single contiguous points, and lower 'arms'. It seems that the parts composed of single contiguous colors get color '2' and the parts with larger contiguity, get color '8'.\n\n3.  **Recolor based on Contiguity:**\n    *   Parts with single-pixel contiguity in one direction (vertical) are recolored to 2 (red).  This applies to the central vertical part of the \"H\".\n    *   The other sections (the \"arms\" of the \"H\") are recolored to 8 (azure).\n\n4. **No other changes.** The parts of the input that are not color 5, are left the same.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves identifying a complex shape, decomposing it into its subcomponents (single vertical contiguous points and others) based on local shape properties, and selectively recoloring these components.\n\n*text:*\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of the same color in a grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):\n        if (r < 0 or r >= grid.shape[0] or c < 0 or c >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], obj)\n                objects.append(obj)\n    return objects\n\ndef split_object_by_contiguity(obj, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits the object into parts based on contiguity.\n    \"\"\"\n    single_contiguous_parts = []\n    other_parts = []\n\n    for r, c in obj:\n        neighbors = 0\n        # Check adjacent cells (not diagonally)\n        if (r + 1, c) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r - 1, c) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r, c + 1) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r, c - 1) in obj: neighbors += 1\n\n        # If a position as only a single vertical connection with\n        # neighbors, it goes into single_contiguous_vertical\n        is_single_vertical = False\n        if neighbors <= 2:\n            if ((r+1,c) in obj and (r-1,c) in obj) and not ((r,c+1) in obj or (r,c-1) in obj):\n                is_single_vertical = True\n            elif neighbors == 1 and ( (r+1, c) in obj or (r-1,c) in obj):\n                is_single_vertical = True\n\n\n        if is_single_vertical:\n            single_contiguous_parts.append((r, c))\n        else:\n            other_parts.append((r, c))\n    return single_contiguous_parts, other_parts\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = get_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        if input_grid[obj[0]] == 5:  # Assuming color 5 is the object to modify\n            single_parts, other_parts = split_object_by_contiguity(obj, input_grid)\n\n            for r, c in single_parts:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 2  # Recolor single contiguous parts to 2\n\n            for r, c in other_parts:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 8 # Recolor other parts to 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
