Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three distinct horizontal lines, each with three cells of the same color. The colors are green (3), blue (1), and red (2), from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Replace all instances of color 3 (green) with color 4 (yellow).
    *   Replace all instances of color 1 (blue) with color 5 (gray).
    *   Replace all instances of color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).

3.  **Output:** The output grid maintains the same 3x3 structure, but with the colors transformed according to the mapping in step 2.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation involves a direct color substitution, following the rule: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, and 2 -> 6. The spatial arrangement of cells remains constant; only the colors change.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
