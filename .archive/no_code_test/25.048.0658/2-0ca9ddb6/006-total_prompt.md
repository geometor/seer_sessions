Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1, arranged around red object
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1, arranged around blue object
     - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the single red (color 2) pixel and the single blue (color 1) pixel in the input grid.

2.  **Red Surroundings:** For the red pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color yellow (value 4).

3.  **Blue Surroundings:** For the blue pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color orange(value 7).

4. **Preservation:** The positions of the original red and blue pixel are preserved.

5. **Background:** All other pixels remain unchanged (color 0).

In essence, the transformation rule involves identifying specific colored pixels (red and blue) and changing the color of their immediate neighbors to a new color, based on which pixel is the "center". The central pixels themselves remain in their input position.

In essence, the transformation rule is a generalization of the first example. It involves identifying specific colored pixels (red and blue) and changing the color of their immediate neighbors to a new color, based on which pixel is the "center".  The central pixels themselves, and any pixels not red or blue, remain in their input position. The azure (8) pixel is unaffected.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml

      shape: 1x1, arranged around blue object
     - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate all red (color 2) pixels and blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Red Surroundings:** For each red pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color yellow (value 4).

3.  **Blue Surroundings:** For each blue pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color orange(value 7).

4. **Preservation:** The positions of the original red and blue pixels, and any other color (magenta), are preserved.

5. **Background:** All other pixels remain unchanged (color 0).

The transformation confirms the generalized rule established by the previous two cases. The presence of the magenta pixel shows that only pixels with color 1 or 2 have an effect on neighbouring pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
