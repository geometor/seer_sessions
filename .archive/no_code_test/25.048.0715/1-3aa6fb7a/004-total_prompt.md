Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects and 1x1 azure.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure objects and 1x1 azure.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x1.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Change color of particular azure objects:**
    *   Locate the most top-right azure object. Change it to blue.
    *   Locate the most bottom-left azure object. Change it to blue.

3.  **Preserve other objects:** All other objects outside those specified are to remain.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation identifies isolated azure (8) colored, change the color to blue (1) for the most top-right element, and the most bottom-left element. All of this while preserving other elements.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects of different shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1).

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects of different shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1).
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: three 1x1 blue objects.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Change the color of particular azure objects:**
      *   Locate the object which has the top-right azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

      * Locate the object which has the top-left azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

      *   Locate the object which has the bottom-left azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

3.  **Preserve other objects:** All other objects outside of those specified are to remain.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation consists of changing to blue, the top-right most, top-left most, and bottom-left most elements of azure color. While preserving all of the other elements.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
