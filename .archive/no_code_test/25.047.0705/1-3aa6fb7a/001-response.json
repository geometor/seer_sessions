The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which acts as the background.\n\n2.  **Change at Specific Locations:**\n    *   Locate the cell to right of top-most cell of first azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.\n    *   Locate the cell to the left of the bottom-most cell of second azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.\n\n3.  **Preservation:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged. The two original azure L-shaped objects are preserved.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation summary**\nThe transformation identifies cells that have specific relations to the L-shape objects and changes the color of cells in the described location. The other elements of the grid remain the same.\n"
