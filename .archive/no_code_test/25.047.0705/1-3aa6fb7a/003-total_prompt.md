Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which acts as the background.

2.  **Change at Specific Locations:**
    *   Locate the cell to right of top-most cell of first azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.
    *   Locate the cell to the left of the bottom-most cell of second azure L-shape. Change this cell from color 0 to color 1.

3.  **Preservation:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged. The two original azure L-shaped objects are preserved.

**Step-by-step transformation summary**
The transformation identifies cells that have specific relations to the L-shape objects and changes the color of cells in the described location. The other elements of the grid remain the same.

Okay, here's the Python code implementing the transformation rule, based on the analysis and description I provided:

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
