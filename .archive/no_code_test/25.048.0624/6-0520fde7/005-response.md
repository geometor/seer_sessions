Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 4], [2,6]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 0 (white)
    positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 5]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 5 (gray)
    positions: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
    shape: vertical line
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the central pixel:** Find the center pixel of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 3x7, so the center is at (1, 3). The color of the center pixel is 5.

2. **Check surrounding blue pixels:**
    - Count the number of the blue pixels to the left and to the right of the gray vertical line object (color 5) in each row.

3.  **Create output grid**: Output grid will be always 3x3 filled with color 0.

4. **Form output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
Count how many blue pixels surround the grey line in each row. If the count of surrounding blue pixels is equal to 1 for any row, then the left pixel if there is a blue pixel to the left, and the right pixel, if there is a blue pixel to the right of that row in output grid will be 2.

**Explanation of the Logic**

The output is always a 3x3 grid. We determine which left and right pixels of rows should change color to 2.
If in the input grid, a row of the object with color 5 which is in the central column, has one neighbor blue pixel to the left, then the color of the left pixel of that row in the output grid will be 2.
If in the input grid, a row of the object with color 5 which is in the central column, has one neighbor blue pixel to the right, then the color of the right pixel of that row in the output grid will be 2.

```python
"""
The updated transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1. Identify the vertical line object (color 5) and its central column.
2. For each row, check if there's exactly one blue pixel (color 1) to the left or right of the gray line.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.
4. For each row:
   - If there's one blue pixel to the left, set the left pixel of that row in the output grid to 2.
   - If there's one blue pixel to the right, set the right pixel of that row in the output grid to 2.
