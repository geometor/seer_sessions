These yellow pixels form a cross shape *around* the position where the red pixel *would have been*, if it had been moved one row up:\n\n    *   Two yellow pixels above the original position.\n    *   Two yellow pixels below the original position.\n    *   The yellow pixels are positioned one column to the left and one column to the right.\n\n3.  **Blue object action:** Each blue pixel triggers the creation of four orange pixels (color 7). These orange pixels create a cross centered at the blue pixel position.\n\n    *   One orange pixel on the top.\n    *   One orange pixel at the bottom.\n    *   One orange pixel to the left.\n    *   One orange pixel to the right.\n\n4.  **Azure object action:** The azure pixel (color 8) does not trigger any action.\n\n5.  **Preservation of Initial Objects:** All colored pixels (red, blue and azure) are kept, including their color and original position.\n\nIn summary, red and blue agents trigger the creation of crosses in different positions, and different colors (yellow and orange, respectively), while the azure agent does not have associated any actions.\n\n*text:*\nThe provided Python code correctly implements the transformation logic described in the natural language program, generalizing for multiple instances of red and blue pixels. No changes are needed.\n```\n"
