Red agents generate a cross pattern of color 4 one row above their position. Blue agents create a cross pattern of color 7 centered on their position. Magenta, similar to azure, does not trigger any change.\n*text:*\nThe previously developed Python code correctly captures and implements the transformation rules observed across all three examples. Thus, no code modification is needed.\n```\n"
