Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml

  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 3 (green)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: left column
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, red) and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   The green line (color 3) in the input is transformed to a yellow line (color 4) in the output.
    *   The blue line (color 1) in the input is transformed to a gray line (color 5) in the output.
    *   The red line (color 2) in the input is transformed to a magenta line (color 6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Observe a consistent increment in the color code: Each color in the input grid is replaced by a color whose code is one unit greater.
	* For each number in input, add +1.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule is a simple color shift: add 1 to the integer that represents its color.

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (red, green, azure) and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**

    *   The red line (color 2) in the input is transformed to a magenta line (color 6) in the output.
    *   The green line (color 3) in the input is transformed to a yellow line (color 4) in the output.
    *   The azure line (color 8) in the input is transformed to a maroon line (color 9) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Examine the differences between input and output color codes:
        *   Red (2) to Magenta (6): Difference of +4
        *   Green (3) to Yellow (4): Difference of +1
        *   Azure (8) to Maroon (9): Difference of +1
    *   The transformation is not uniform across all colors. In this case, we observe that the transformation rule is +4 to the first object and +1 to the rest of the objects.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule involves adding 4 to the color code of the first object (leftmost column, changing red to magenta) and adding 1 to the color codes of the remaining objects (middle and right columns).

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (gray, azure, magenta), and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**

    *   The gray line (color 5) in the input is transformed to a blue line (color 1) in the output.
    *   The azure line (color 8) in the input is transformed to a maroon line (color 9) in the output.
    *   The magenta line (color 6) in the input is transformed to a red line (color 2) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Examine the relationship between input and output color codes:
        *   Gray (5) to Blue (1): Difference of -4.
        *   Azure (8) to Maroon (9): Difference of +1.
        *   Magenta (6) to Red (2): Difference of -4.
    *   The transformation is not uniform across all colors. In this case, we observe that the transformation rule is -4 to the lateral objects and +1 to the object in the middle.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule involves subtracting 4 to the color code of the objects of the first and third columns and adding 1 to the color code of the object in the middle column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**

    *   The yellow line (color 4) in the input is transformed to a green line (color 3) in the output.
    *   The red line (color 2) in the input is transformed to a magenta line (color 6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   Examine the relationship between input and output color codes:
        *   Maroon (9) to Azure (8): Difference of -1.
        *   Yellow (4) to Green (3): Difference of -1.
        *   Red (2) to Magenta (6): Difference of +4.
    *   The transformation is not uniform across all colors. In this case, we observe that the transformation rule is -1 to the objects in the first two columns, and +4 to the object in the third column.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule involves subtracting 1 from the color code of the objects in the first and second columns (maroon to azure, and yellow to green) and adding 4 to the color code of the object in the third column (red to magenta).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
