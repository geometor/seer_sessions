Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 3 (green)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: left column
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: middle column
      - color: 2 (red)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: right column
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: left column
      - color: 5 (gray)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: middle column
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: right column
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, red) and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   The green line (color 3) in the input is transformed to a yellow line (color 4) in the output.
    *   The blue line (color 1) in the input is transformed to a gray line (color 5) in the output.
    *   The red line (color 2) in the input is transformed to a magenta line (color 6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Observe a consistent increment in the color code: Each color in the input grid is replaced by a color whose code is one unit greater.
	* For each number in input, add +1.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule is a simple color shift: add 1 to the integer that represents its color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
