Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 3 (green)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: left column
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: middle column
      - color: 2 (red)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: right column
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: left column
      - color: 5 (gray)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: middle column
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        position: right column
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, red) and occupying a single column.

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   The green line (color 3) in the input is transformed to a yellow line (color 4) in the output.
    *   The blue line (color 1) in the input is transformed to a gray line (color 5) in the output.
    *   The red line (color 2) in the input is transformed to a magenta line (color 6) in the output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Observe a consistent increment in the color code: Each color in the input grid is replaced by a color whose code is one unit greater.
	* For each number in input, add +1.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule is a simple color shift: add 1 to the integer that represents its color.

            # Increment the color code by one.

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
