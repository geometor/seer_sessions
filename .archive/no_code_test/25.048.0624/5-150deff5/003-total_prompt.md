Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular
      position: centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
      notes: Roughly resembles a "plus" sign or a distorted "X" shape.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid
output_grid:
  size: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, L-shape
      position:  Top left part of where the color 5 object was, upper arm of object 5
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular
      position:  Replacing the rest of object 5.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid.
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Object Identification:** In the input grid, identify the contiguous region of color '5' (gray). This forms a single, irregular object.

2.  **Object Segmentation (Top part definition):** Identify the top arm of the object 5. The top arm is defined as:
    *   Starting from row 2 (index 1), identify the two leftmost cells of color 5.
    *   The cells in the following row, under these identified cells, that contains the color 5.

3. **Color transformation**: Change these pixels in the upper arm to the color 8 (azure).

4.  **Color Replacement (Remaining part):** All others cells with the color 5 are replaced with color 2 (red).

5. **Background Persistence:** The background (color '0', white) remains unchanged.

In Essence: the object of color 5 is replaced with color 2, except its "upper arm" that is colored in color 8.

```python
"""
The input grid contains a single object of color 5 (gray) on a background of color 0 (white).
The transformation replaces the gray object with two colors: 8 (azure) and 2 (red).
The "top arm" of the gray object is replaced with color 8, while the rest of the gray object is replaced with color 2.
The background remains unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
