Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular
      position: centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
      notes: Roughly resembles a "plus" sign or a distorted "X" shape.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid
output_grid:
  size: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, L-shape
      position:  Top left part of where the color 5 object was, upper arm of object 5
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular
      position:  Replacing the rest of object 5.
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest of the grid.
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Object Identification:** In the input grid, identify the contiguous region of color '5' (gray). This forms a single, irregular object.

2.  **Object Segmentation (Top part definition):** Identify the top arm of the object 5. The top arm is defined as:
    *   Starting from row 2 (index 1), identify the two leftmost cells of color 5.
    *   The cells in the following row, under these identified cells, that contains the color 5.

3. **Color transformation**: Change these pixels in the upper arm to the color 8 (azure).

4.  **Color Replacement (Remaining part):** All others cells with the color 5 are replaced with color 2 (red).

5. **Background Persistence:** The background (color '0', white) remains unchanged.

In Essence: the object of color 5 is replaced with color 2, except its "upper arm" that is colored in color 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
