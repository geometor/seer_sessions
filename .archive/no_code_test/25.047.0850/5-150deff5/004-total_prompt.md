Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a stylized "S" or a mirrored "2".
      position: Centered, spanning multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Roughly rectangular blocks.
      position: Top-left portion of the original "5" shape.
    - color: 2
      shape: Roughly rectangular blocks and individual cells.
      position:  Replaces other parts of the "5" object, filling the negative space within its approximate bounding box.
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' in the input grid. This forms the primary object.

2.  **Bounding Box (Implicit):** Conceptually, imagine a bounding box around the "5" shaped object.

3. **Color Substitution within the bounding box:** The transformation recolors portions of the object of '5'.

4. **Recolor Rule**: The area defined by color 5 is recolored according to the following rule: The bounding box is divided into two parts:
   + The first part of the shape is the rectangle with the corners in (2,2) and (3,3). And a second shape that are all the rest of the points of color '5'.
   + The first part is recolored to 8.
   + The second part is recolored to 2.

**Step-by-step explanation (symbolic):**

1. Find the connected component of color 5.
2. Consider the coordinates (row, col) = (2,2) and (3,3) of the input. All cells of color 5 in those positions are replaced by color 8 in the output.
3. The rest of the color 5 cells in the original connected component are all replaced by color 2.
4. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a stylized "P".
      position: Centered, spanning multiple rows and columns.
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Roughly rectangular blocks.
      position: Top portions of the original "5" shape.
    - color: 2
      shape: Roughly rectangular blocks and individual cells.
      position:  Replaces other parts of the "5" object.
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the entire grid.

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

The transformation rule appears to be similar to the previous one, but with a slight modification in how the object of color '5' is divided and recolored:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' in the input grid.

2.  **Bounding Box (Implicit):**  As before, a bounding box can be conceptually imagined around the "5" shaped object, though it's not explicitly used in the color-changing logic.

3. **Color Substitution within the bounding box:** The transformation recolors portions of the object of '5'.

4.  **Recolor Rule**:
    *   Consider the coordinates where the color is 5.
    *   If those coordinates have a row index of 1 or 2, then it must be considered whether the column index is 3 or less. If it's less or equal to 3, then it is recolored to 8. If it's more than 3, then the cell is recolored to 2.
    *   If the row index is greater or equal to 3:
        * If the column position is 3, and the color is 5, then change it to 2.
        * if the column position is greater than 3, and the color is 5, then change it to 8.

**Step-by-step explanation (symbolic):**

1.  Find the connected component of color 5.
2.  Iterate through all the color 5 cells of the identified object.
3.  If the cell at (row, col) has color 5:
    *   If `row` is 1 or 2:
        *   If `col` <= 3, change the color to 8.
        *   If `col` > 3, change the color to 2.
    *   If `row` >=3:
        *   If `col`==3, change color to 2.
        *   If `col` > 3, change color to 8.

4.  The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

This refined description captures the conditional recoloring based on both row and column position within the "5" object. It is important to consider relative position.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
