Okay, here's the Python code implementing the transformation rule described above:




*text:*

```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' in the input grid. This forms the primary object.

2.  **Bounding Box (Implicit):** Conceptually, imagine a bounding box around the "5" shaped object.

3. **Color Substitution within the bounding box:** The transformation recolors portions of the object of '5'.

4. **Recolor Rule**: The area defined by color 5 is recolored according to the following rule: The bounding box is divided into two parts:
   + The first part of the shape is the rectangle with the corners in (2,2) and (3,3). And a second shape that are all the rest of the points of color '5'.
   + The first part is recolored to 8.
   + The second part is recolored to 2.

**Step-by-step explanation (symbolic):**

1. Find the connected component of color 5.
2. Consider the coordinates (row, col) = (2,2) and (3,3) of the input. All cells of color 5 in those positions are replaced by color 8 in the output.
3. The rest of the color 5 cells in the original connected component are all replaced by color 2.
4. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.
