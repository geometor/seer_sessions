These are our primary objects.\n\n2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For the red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cell itself remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For the blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to its left, and to its right to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cell itself remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Preserve the rest:** All other cells that are not directly adjacent (not diagonally) to the red and blue objects maintain their original color (which is white/0 in this case).\n\n**Explanation of the reasoning**\n\nThe core idea is that the colored cells (red and blue) \"influence\" their immediate, non-diagonal neighbors. The transformation creates a small cross-shaped aura of a different color around each of the original colored cells. The type of transformation is the same in kind (coloring the cardinal neighbors), but the 'value' is different (yellow for the red, and orange for the blue object). The rest of the grid is not touched.\n"
