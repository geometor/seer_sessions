Okay, let's analyze the second transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: [(2, 6), (7,1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: [(3, 2), (6,6)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: [(2, 6), (7,1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: [(3, 2), (6,6)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      position: [(1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), (5,0), (5,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: 1x1 cells surrounding red cells, not diagonally
    - color: 7 (orange)
      position: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1 cells surrounding blue cells, not diagonally
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the red cells (color 2) and the blue cells (color 1) in the input grid. There are two of each in this case. The azure cell (color 8) does not participate to the transformation.

2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For *each* red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cells themselves remain unchanged.

3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For *each* blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cells themselves remain unchanged.

4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other cells, including those of color 8, maintain their original color.

**Explanation of the Reasoning**

This transformation builds upon the logic observed in the first example. The key difference is that it now applies the "aura" effect to *multiple* instances of the red and blue cells. The transformation is applied independently to each instance of the red and blue colors. The azure cell is a distractor, as it does not affect the transformation.  The rule is consistent with the previous one, just extended to work with multiple trigger objects (of colors 1 and 2).
