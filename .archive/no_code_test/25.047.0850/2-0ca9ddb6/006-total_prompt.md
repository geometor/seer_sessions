Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      position: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: 1x1 cells surrounding red cell, not diagonally
    - color: 7 (orange)
      position: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1 cells surrounding blue cell, not diagonally
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the single red cell (color 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) in the input grid. These are our primary objects.

2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For the red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cell itself remains unchanged.

3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For the blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to its left, and to its right to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cell itself remains unchanged.

4. **Preserve the rest:** All other cells that are not directly adjacent (not diagonally) to the red and blue objects maintain their original color (which is white/0 in this case).

**Explanation of the reasoning**

The core idea is that the colored cells (red and blue) "influence" their immediate, non-diagonal neighbors. The transformation creates a small cross-shaped aura of a different color around each of the original colored cells. The type of transformation is the same in kind (coloring the cardinal neighbors), but the 'value' is different (yellow for the red, and orange for the blue object). The rest of the grid is not touched.


*text:*
Okay, here's the Python code implementing the transformation logic, based on the analysis and natural language program I described:



*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation identifies two key objects: a red cell (color 2) and a blue cell (color 1).
It then changes the color of the non-diagonal neighbors of the red cell to yellow (color 4) and the non-diagonal neighbors of the blue cell to orange (color 7).
The original red and blue cells remain unchanged. All other cells remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the red cells (color 2) and the blue cells (color 1) in the input grid. There are two of each in this case. The azure cell (color 8) does not participate to the transformation.

2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For *each* red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cells themselves remain unchanged.

3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For *each* blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cells themselves remain unchanged.

4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other cells, including those of color 8, maintain their original color.

**Explanation of the Reasoning**

This transformation builds upon the logic observed in the first example. The key difference is that it now applies the "aura" effect to *multiple* instances of the red and blue cells. The transformation is applied independently to each instance of the red and blue colors. The azure cell is a distractor, as it does not affect the transformation.  The rule is consistent with the previous one, just extended to work with multiple trigger objects (of colors 1 and 2).

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the red cell (color 2) and the blue cell (color 1) in the input grid.  The magenta cell (color 6) does not participate to the transformation.

2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For the red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cell itself remains unchanged.

3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For the blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to its left, and to its right to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cell itself remains unchanged.

4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other cells, including the magenta cell, maintain their original color.

**Explanation of the Reasoning**

This transformation is consistent with the previous two examples. The key is identifying the red and blue cells and applying a color change to their immediate, non-diagonal neighbors. The magenta cell acts as a distractor, further solidifying the rule that only the red and blue cells trigger the transformation. The transformation triggered by red and blue is unchanged compared to the previous transformations. This consistency across all three examples allows us to be confident in the identified rule.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
