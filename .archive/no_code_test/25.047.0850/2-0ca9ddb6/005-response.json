The magenta cell (color 6) does not participate to the transformation.\n\n2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For the red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cell itself remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For the blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to its left, and to its right to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cell itself remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other cells, including the magenta cell, maintain their original color.\n\n**Explanation of the Reasoning**\n\nThis transformation is consistent with the previous two examples. The key is identifying the red and blue cells and applying a color change to their immediate, non-diagonal neighbors. The magenta cell acts as a distractor, further solidifying the rule that only the red and blue cells trigger the transformation. The transformation triggered by red and blue is unchanged compared to the previous transformations. This consistency across all three examples allows us to be confident in the identified rule.\n"
