Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one.

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of vertical lines of single colors in each column.
2.  **Color Mapping:** The transformation involves adding +1 to the color of each cell value in the grid:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (2).
    *    Red (2) becomes Magenta (3).
3.  **Apply Transformation:** For each cell in the input grid, increment its value to produce the output grid.

This is equivalent to applying this function: `output_color = input_color + 1`.
