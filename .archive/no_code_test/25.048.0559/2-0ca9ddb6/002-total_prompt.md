Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 #background
      position: all the other cells

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: four single cells forming a cross/plus pattern around the red cell
    - color: 7  # Orange
      positions: [(5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6)]
      shape: four single cells forming a cross/plus pattern around the blue cell
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Locate the single red cell (color 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) in the input grid. These cells remain unchanged in position.

2.  **Construct Cross Patterns:**
    *   Around the red cell, place yellow cells (color 4) in a plus-shaped pattern. Specifically, place yellow cells one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of the red cell. The cells are placed using the coordinate of the original red cell.
    *   Around the blue cell, place orange cells (color 7) in a plus-shaped pattern, using the same way the yellow cells are built around the red cell, described above.

**Step-by-step explanation**
1. Scan the input grid.
2. Find the position of the red pixel.
3. Draw a yellow pixel above, below, left, and right to the red pixel.
4. Find the position of the blue pixel.
5. Draw a orange pixel above, below, left, and right to the blue pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
