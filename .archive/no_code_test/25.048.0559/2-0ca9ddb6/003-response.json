These cells remain unchanged in position in the output grid. Note any other colors present, but not involved in cross formations (like the azure cell, color 8).\n\n2.  **Construct Cross Patterns:**\n    *   Around *each* red cell, place yellow cells (color 4) in a plus-shaped pattern.  Place yellow cells one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of each red cell.\n    *   Around *each* blue cell, place orange cells (color 7) in a plus-shaped pattern, in the same way as described above.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation**\n\n1. Scan the entire input grid.\n2. Find all the positions of the red pixels.\n3. For each red pixel, draw a yellow pixel above, below, left, and right to the red pixel.\n4. Find all the positions of the blue pixel.\n5. For each blue pixel, draw a orange pixel above, below, left, and right to the blue pixel.\n6. Keep pixels that are not of color red or blue.\n\nThe provided Python code correctly implements this logic. It iterates through and identifies the red and blue colors and performs the same operations of surrounding them by their respective + shaped colors. It takes into consideration boundary conditions.\n"
