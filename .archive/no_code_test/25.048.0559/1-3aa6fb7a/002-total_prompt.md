Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored components/objects"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two isolated blue (1) colored cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One object is located at the top-left composed of a 2x1 form. The other is located at the center-right formed of a 1x2 shape.

2.  **Detect Change:** We notice that in the output grid, two new single, isolated, blue (color 1) pixels, have appeared. These two new pixels, are located inside the white (0) areas, close to the azure (8) objects.

3. **Transformation Rule**
    *   Locate the azure (8) colored objects.
    *   For the object formed by cells (1,1) and (2,1), check if the cell to the right of (1,1) which is (1,2) is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).
    * For the other object formed by cells (4,4), (4,5) and (5,4), check if the cell to the bottom of (4,5), which is (5,5), is white (0). If it is, change it to blue (1).

In summary, the transformation paints a blue cell at the specified position if it is available.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
