Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - positions: [(0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6)]
      - shape: single_cells
    gray_objects:
      - positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
      - shape: single_cells
    white_objects:
        - positions: remaining cells
        - shape: background
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      - position: (1,1)
      - shape: single_cell
    white_objects:
        - position: remaining cells
        - shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Significant Columns:** The input grid has a vertical line of gray (color code 5) cells in the 4th column (index 3).

2. **Detect blue cells**: Find the positions of the blue cells (value 1).

2.  **Extract Surrounding Area:** A 3x3 region is extracted from the original grid.

3. **Count blue cells per row around the gray objects**:
    -   First row: Two blue cells to the left and two blue cells to the right.
    - Second row: One blue cells to the left and three blue cells to the right.
    - Third row: One blue cell to the left.

4.  **Determine middle cell**: If there are more blue cells to the right than to the left, paint it red (value 2), otherwise black (value 0).

5.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid and fill all cells with value 0, except the center cell determined in the previous step.

In summary, the transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered around the gray cells, counts related blue cells, and sets the central pixel of the output to red, leaving the rest as background (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
