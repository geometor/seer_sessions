Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**




*text:*

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes, one in the top left and one in the bottom right.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape:  Two separate L-shapes, identical to the input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two single separate pixels

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure). Also, two distinct L shaped are present in the output grid, which looks the same, and two blue single pixel objects are placed at (1,2) and (4,4).

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects have not changed. The blue (1) single pixels are new in the output grid.

3. **Determine the creation rule**: The azure colored objects are the key to the transformation. Find the azure colored pixel in the second row which is part of an L shape, and add a blue pixel to its right. Find the azure colored pixel in the last row containing azure pixels, that is also part of another L-shape, and add a blue pixel to the left of its rightmost azure pixel.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from input to output grid. For the top-left L-shape, add a blue (1) pixel to the right of the azure pixel in its first row. For the bottom-right L-shape, locate the azure pixel in the last row where this shape appears. Then add the blue pixel to the left of its rightmost pixel.

**Python Implementation**

```python
"""
