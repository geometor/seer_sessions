Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes, one in the top left and one in the bottom right.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape:  Two separate L-shapes, identical to the input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two single separate pixels

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure). Also, two distinct L shaped are preent in the output grid, which looks the same, and two blue single pixel objects are placed at (1,2) and (4,4).

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects have not changed. The blue (1) single pixels are new in the output grid.

3. **Determine the creation rule**: The azure colored objects are the key to the transformation. Find the azure colored pixel in the second row. Take the next x. Find the azure colored pixel in the n-2 row. Take the x-1.
  
**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from input to output grid. Fill the next column of the first azure colored pixel with a blue (1) pixel. Fill one column before the last azure colored pixel.

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure). Also, two distinct L shaped are present in the output grid, which looks the same, and two blue single pixel objects are placed at (1,2) and (4,4).

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects have not changed. The blue (1) single pixels are new in the output grid.

3. **Determine the creation rule**: The azure colored objects are the key to the transformation. Find the azure colored pixel in the second row which is part of an L shape, and add a blue pixel to its right. Find the azure colored pixel in the last row containing azure pixels, that is also part of another L-shape, and add a blue pixel to the left of its rightmost azure pixel.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from input to output grid. For the top-left L-shape, add a blue (1) pixel to the right of the azure pixel in its first row. For the bottom-right L-shape, locate the azure pixel in the last row where this shape appears. Then add the blue pixel to the left of its rightmost pixel.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes or partial L-shapes. One in the top right, one in the center-left, and one in the bottom.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes or partial L-shapes, identical to input
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: three single separate pixels

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct collections of azure (color 8) pixels.  Two form clear L-shapes, and the top one is more of a reverse-L rotated.  The output grid retains these azure shapes and adds three blue (color 1) pixels.

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects are unchanged. The blue (1) pixels are new additions in the output.

3. **Determine Creation Rule**: The positions of azure colored objects are the key.
      - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the second row from the top. Add a blue pixel to its left.
      - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the third row from the top. Add a blue pixel to its left.
     - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the second row from bottom. Add a blue pixel to the left of it.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from the input grid to the output grid.
Locate the rightmost azure pixel in the second row, and place a blue pixel directly to its left.
Locate the rightmost azure pixel in the third row, and add a blue pixel to its left.
Locate the rightmost azure pixel in the sixth row (second from bottom), add a blue pixel to its left.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Add blue pixel adjacent to top-right azure pixel
    if input_grid[1,5] == 8:
        output_grid[1,4] = 1
    if input_grid[2,2] == 8:
        output_grid[2,3] = 1
    if input_grid[5,4] == 8 :
        output_grid[5,3] = 1

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
