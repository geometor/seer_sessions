Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**




*text:*

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes or partial L-shapes. One in the top right, one in the center-left, and one in the bottom.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate L-shapes or partial L-shapes, identical to input
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: three single separate pixels

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct collections of azure (color 8) pixels.  Two form clear L-shapes, and the top one is more of a reverse-L rotated.  The output grid retains these azure shapes and adds three blue (color 1) pixels.

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects are unchanged. The blue (1) pixels are new additions in the output.

3. **Determine Creation Rule**: The positions of azure colored objects are the key.
      - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the second row. Add a blue pixel to its left.
      - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the third row. Add a blue pixel to its left.
     - Find the rightmost azure pixel in the sixth row. Add a blue pixel to the left of it.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from the input grid to the output grid. For each azure "object", find the row where it has its rightmost pixel and insert blue pixel to its left. If an azure object spreads in multiple rows, insert a blue pixel only for the rows listed in the creation rule. Specifically, insert blue pixels to the left of the rightmost azure pixels in rows 1, 2, and 5. (Note: 0-indexed)

**Python Implementation**

```python
"""
Copy the azure colored pixels from the input grid to the output grid. For each azure "object", find the row where it has its rightmost pixel and insert blue pixel to its left. If an azure object spreads in multiple rows, insert a blue pixel only for the rows with index 1, 2, and 5.
