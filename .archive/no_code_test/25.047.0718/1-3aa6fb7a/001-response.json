Also, two distinct L shaped are preent in the output grid, which looks the same, and two blue single pixel objects are placed at (1,2) and (4,4).\n\n2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects have not changed. The blue (1) single pixels are new in the output grid.\n\n3. **Determine the creation rule**: The azure colored objects are the key to the transformation. Find the azure colored pixel in the second row. Take the next x. Find the azure colored pixel in the n-2 row. Take the x-1.\n  \n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**\n\nCopy the azure colored pixels from input to output grid. Fill the next column of the first azure colored pixel with a blue (1) pixel. Fill one column before the last azure colored pixel.\n\n"
