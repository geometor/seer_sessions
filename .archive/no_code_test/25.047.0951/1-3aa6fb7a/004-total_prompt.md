Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 shapes, not connected.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background
  
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: single unconnected pixels.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on a natural language program-like structure:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of two primary objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white). The azure objects exist as two separate components: one is composed by the positions (1, 1), and (2, 1), (2, 2), and the other composed of (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4).

2. **Detect singleton objects** The color 8 objects have different shapes.

3. **Observe Changes**: Compare each azure object in the input and output and keep all the pixels of color 8 unchanged.

4.  **Action - Add Blue Pixel:**
    *   The rightmost pixel of color 8 of the first object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).
    *   The leftmost pixel of color 8 of the second object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The rule preserves every pixel of color 8. The input contains two distinct objects composed by pixels of color 8. The program turns to color 1 the rightmost and leftmost pixels of the objects found on the input, iterating the search from top to down.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Three separate objects.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background
  
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]

      shape: single unconnected pixels.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on a natural language program-like structure:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three primary objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white).

2. **Detect singleton objects** The color 8 objects have different shapes.

3. **Observe Changes**: Compare each azure object in the input and output and keep all the pixels of color 8 unchanged.

4.  **Action - Add Blue Pixel:**
    *   The rightmost pixel of color 8 of the first object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).
    *   The leftmost pixel of color 8 of the second and third object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The rule preserves every pixel of color 8. The input contains three distinct objects composed by pixels of color 8. The program turns to color 1 the rightmost pixel of the *first* object and the leftmost pixels of the *other* objects found on the input, iterating the search from top to down.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
