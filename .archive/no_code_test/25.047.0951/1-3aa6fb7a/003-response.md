Okay, let's analyze the second example of transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Three separate objects.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background
  
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: single unconnected pixels.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on a natural language program-like structure:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three primary objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white).

2. **Detect singleton objects** The color 8 objects have different shapes.

3. **Observe Changes**: Compare each azure object in the input and output and keep all the pixels of color 8 unchanged.

4.  **Action - Add Blue Pixel:**
    *   The rightmost pixel of color 8 of the first object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).
    *   The leftmost pixel of color 8 of the second and third object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The rule preserves every pixel of color 8. The input contains three distinct objects composed by pixels of color 8. The program turns to color 1 the rightmost pixel of the *first* object and the leftmost pixels of the *other* objects found on the input, iterating the search from top to down.
