Okay, let's analyze the second transformation.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 2
      position: (7, 1)
      shape: 1x1
  dimensions: 9x9

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 2
      position: (7, 1)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2)]
      shape: forms a partial frame around (3,2)
    - color: 4
      positions: [(1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: forms a partial frames around (2,6) and (7,1)
     - color: 7
       positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
       shape: 1x1, forms a square around object 1 at (6,6)
  dimensions: 9x9
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid consisting of a single cell, as in the previous example.

2.  **Create Frames Conditionally:**
    *   If a single-cell object has color 2, create a 3x3 yellow (color 4) frame *around* the object, but *only* fill positions if empty. Do not modify other existing colors. Preserve existing single cell object.
    *   If a single-cell object has color 1, create a 3x3 orange (color 7) frame *around* the object, but *only* fill positions if empty. Do not modify other existing colors. Preserve existing single cell object.
    * If an object has a color other than 1 or 2, it is preserved, but no action will take place (no surrounding frame).

3.  **Preservation and Non-Interference:** The framing operation must *not* overwrite any existing colored cells. If a frame position overlaps with an existing cell (including the single cell object around which the frame is created), the existing cell's color is maintained.

4. **Other cells:** All other cells that were not part of the identified single-cell objects or new frames remain unchanged (color 0).

In summary, the key difference from the previous example is the conditional framing and the non-interference rule: frames are created based on the color of the single-cell object (1 or 2), and the frame creation process does not overwrite any existing colored cells. The color of the frame depends on the color of the single cell object around which it will be drawn.
