In this case, we have two such objects: a red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6).\n\n2.  **Create a Colored Frame Around Each Identified Object:**\n    *    Around the red cell (color 2), create a 3x3 square frame using yellow (color 4) cells. The original red cell remains at the center of this new frame. The frame cells are those at coordinate positions that make up this 3x3 square centered on (3,2) excluding (3,2) itself - this leaves us with the coordinates: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2) and (4,3). Note that the specification says to \"create a *frame*\". This seems to imply that only the border of a square will be colored and not the inner cells.\n    *    Around the blue cell (color 1), create a 3x3 square frame using orange (color 7) cells.  The original blue cell remains at the center. Similarly to the above, the coordinates will be: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6) and (7,7). Again, only the border will be colored.\n\n3.  **Preserve Original Single-Cell Objects:** The original red (2) and blue (1) cells remain in their original positions within their respective frames.\n\n4. **Other cells:** All other cells that were not part of the identified single-cell objects or new frames remain unchanged (color 0).\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves identifying single-cell objects and drawing a colored frame, a specific shape and of a specific color, around each of them, while preserving the original single-cell objects and leaving everything else at color 0. The colors of the frames are determined depending on the central color.\n"
