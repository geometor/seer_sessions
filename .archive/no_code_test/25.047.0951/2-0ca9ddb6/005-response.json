In this example, there are three such objects: red (color 2) at (2, 2), magenta (color 6) at (5, 6), and blue (color 1) at (7, 3).\n\n2.  **Create Frames Conditionally (Based on Color):**\n    *   If a single-cell object is red (color 2), create a 3x3 yellow (color 4) frame around it. However, *only* fill cells that are currently empty (color 0).\n    *   If a single-cell object is blue (color 1), create a 3x3 orange (color 7) frame around it. Again, fill *only* empty cells.\n    * If an object has color 6, preserve it but no action will be performed.\n\n3.  **Preservation and Non-Interference:**  Just like in the second example, the framing operation must *not* overwrite any existing colored cells. The existing single cell objects must be preserved.\n\n4. **Other cells:** All other cells that were not part of the identified single-cell objects or new frames remain unchanged (color 0).\n\nIn summary, this transformation builds upon the previous rule. Single-cell objects are identified, and frames of a specific color, dependent on the color of the single-cell, are created around them. The framing operation is now confirmed to be additive \u2013 it only fills empty cells and does not replace existing colors. Single cells that are not color 1 or 2 are preserved.\n"
