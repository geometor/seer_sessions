Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing the initial observations:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [0,1], [2,1]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [0,3]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [2,2]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [3,0]

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [2,1], [3,1]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [3,0]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [3,2]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [3,3]
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** Locate all the colored cells (non-zero values) in the input grid. In this example, there is one blue object, two yellow objects, one magenta and one maroon object.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom:** Move all the identified non-zero objects down to the last row of the output grid, and all the white objects to the row above.

3. **Preserve Horizontal Order**: When moving objects maintain their original horizontal order. The objects will stack on top of each other.

**Natural Language Program**
```
Collect all non-zero colored objects.
Move the objects to the last row.
Maintain original horizontal order.
```
