Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing the initial observations:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [0,1], [2,1]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [0,3]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [2,2]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [3,0]

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      shape: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [2,1], [3,1]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [3,0]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [3,2]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [3,3]
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** Locate all the colored cells (non-zero values) in the input grid. In this example, there is one blue object, two yellow objects, one magenta and one maroon object.

2.  **Move Objects to the Bottom:** Move all the identified non-zero objects down to the last row of the output grid, and all the white objects to the row above.

3. **Preserve Horizontal Order**: When moving objects maintain their original horizontal order. The objects will stack on top of each other.

**Natural Language Program**
```
Collect all non-zero colored objects.
Move the objects to the last row.
Maintain original horizontal order.
```

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [0, 4, 0, 9],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 4, 6, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 4, 0, 0],
        [1, 4, 6, 9]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
