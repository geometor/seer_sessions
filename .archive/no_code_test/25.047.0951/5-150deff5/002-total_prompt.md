Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted "E" or a mirrored "3"
      position: Centered in the grid
      size: Occupies a 5x5 block but with some cells missing
  background:
    - color: 0
      shape: Covers the entire grid
      size: 11x11

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Two separate 2x2 squares.
      position: located where the top and bottom horizontal lines of the original 'E' were
      size: 2x2
    - color: 2
      shape: resembles an 'E'
      position: located at the vertical bar, and around the area of the original 'E' was
      size: Occupies approximately the central and middle portions
  background:
    - color: 0
      shape: Covers the entire grid
      size: 11x11
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the single object in the input grid that is not color 0 (the background). In this case, it's the shape made of color 5.

2.  **Decompose into components**: The input 'E' shape is made up of four components: top bar, bottom bar, vertical bar, and middle bar.

3.  **Change the color in horizontal bars:** find the top and bottom horizontal components of this shape. Change the color of the components. The top horizontal bar changes to 8. The bottom horizontal bar also changes to 8.

4.  **Change the color in vertical and middle bars:** change the color of the other parts of the E shape (vertical and middle bars) to color 2.

**Step-by-step Explanation Applied to the Example:**

1.  The input grid has an "E"-shaped object of color 5.
2.  The color of the top 2x2 square is set to 8.
3.  The color of the bottom 2x2 square is set to 8.
4.  The other parts of the E shape (vertical and middle bars) change the color to 2.

This description captures the essence of the transformation, focusing on object recognition, color changes, and spatial relationships. It explains the observed changes without being overly specific to grid coordinates, making it generalizable.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
