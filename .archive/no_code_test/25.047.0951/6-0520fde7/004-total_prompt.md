Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 5
      positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0)]
    grey_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 13
      positions: Remaining cells
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      count: 1
      position: [(1,1)]
    white_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: Remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**
Here the central grey object is an agent. It leaves a red mark at its position, contracts, and then disappears.

1.  **Identify the Agent:** Find the gray (color code 5) object that forms a vertical line in the center of the input grid.

2.  **Locate Agent's Position:** Determine the row and column indices covered by that object.

3.  **Record center position:**. Note the cell in the center of the object.

4.  **Change color:** Change the value of the center position to red (color code 2).

5. **Contract and disappear:** Eliminate all input cells except the ones forming the center of the central object. Fill the rest with white (color code 0).

6.  **Output:** A 3x3 output grid whose cells are white, except the center cell which becomes red.


*text:*
Okay, let's create the Python code based on the natural language program and the provided template.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this new example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml

  size: 3x7

    blue_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,5)]

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

Here, again the central grey object is an agent. It leaves a red mark at its position, duplicates some pixels, contracts, and then disappears.

1.  **Identify the Agent:** Find the gray (color code 5) object that forms a vertical line in the center of the input grid.

2.  **Locate Agent's Position:** Determine the row and column indices covered by that object.

3.  **Record center position:**. Note the cells covered by the object.

4.  **Change color and duplicate:** Change the value of the gray positions to red (color code 2). Add a copy of the bottom red pixel in the middle row.

5. **Contract and disappear:** Eliminate all input cells except the ones forming the vertical grey object. Fill the rest with white (color code 0).

6.  **Output:** A 3x3 output grid whose cells are white, except the cells corresponding to the previous position of the agent, which become red.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**
