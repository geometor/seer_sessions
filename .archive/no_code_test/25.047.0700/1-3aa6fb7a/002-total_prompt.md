Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two 1x1 squares

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two single squares
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: two single squares
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects:
    *   One is the 1x2 azure object at the top-left side.
    *   Another is the 1x2 azure object is at the bottom-right side.
    *   The other two azure objects are next to each other.

2.  **Change First Object**:
    * The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, down, and it is at the top side is changed to a blue pixel.

3. **Change Second Object**:
   *The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, up, and it is at the bottom side is changed to a blue pixel.

In summary, the transformation rule identifies isloated azure pixels in L shape figures and converts them to blue. The azure pixels which have azure neighboors at the top, bottom, left and right remains intact.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
