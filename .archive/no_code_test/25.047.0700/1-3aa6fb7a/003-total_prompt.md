Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two 1x1 squares

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles and two single squares
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: two single squares
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct azure (color 8) objects:
    *   One is the 1x2 azure object at the top-left side.
    *   Another is the 1x2 azure object is at the bottom-right side.
    *   The other two azure objects are next to each other.

2.  **Change First Object**:
    * The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, down, and it is at the top side is changed to a blue pixel.

3. **Change Second Object**:
   *The single azure pixel that has no azure neighboors at its right, its left, up, and it is at the bottom side is changed to a blue pixel.

In summary, the transformation rule identifies isloated azure pixels in L shape figures and converts them to blue. The azure pixels which have azure neighboors at the top, bottom, left and right remains intact.


*text:*
Okay, let's craft the Python code based on the natural language program and the provided template.



*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies isolated azure pixels (color 8) and converts them to blue (color 1).
An isolated azure pixel is defined as one that does not have azure neighbors to its immediate top, bottom, left, and right.
Azure blocks remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
