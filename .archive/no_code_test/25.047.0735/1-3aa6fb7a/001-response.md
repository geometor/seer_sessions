Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure colored L-shapes.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
        shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure colored L-shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixel

  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects formed by azure (color 8) pixels. One is in the top-left and the other in the bottom right.

2.  **Check upper-left object:** Check the cell at the right of the first detected azure cell in the upper-left object.

3. **Paint with Blue** Paint that cell with color blue (value = 1).

4.  **Check bottom-right object:** Check the cell at the left of the last detected azure cell in the bottom-right object (reading by rows).

5. **Paint with Blue** Paint that cell with color blue (value = 1).

6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged (i.e., keep their original color, which is 0 in this case).
