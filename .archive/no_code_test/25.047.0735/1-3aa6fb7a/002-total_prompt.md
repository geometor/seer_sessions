Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure colored L-shapes.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
        shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure colored L-shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixel

  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects formed by azure (color 8) pixels. One is in the top-left and the other in the bottom right.

2.  **Check upper-left object:** Check the cell at the right of the first detected azure cell in the upper-left object.

3. **Paint with Blue** Paint that cell with color blue (value = 1).

4.  **Check bottom-right object:** Check the cell at the left of the last detected azure cell in the bottom-right object (reading by rows).

5. **Paint with Blue** Paint that cell with color blue (value = 1).

6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged (i.e., keep their original color, which is 0 in this case).

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
