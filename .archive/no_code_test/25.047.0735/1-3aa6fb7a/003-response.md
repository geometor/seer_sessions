Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate azure colored objects: two L-shapes (one inverted) and a 2x1 rectangle.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Three separate azure colored objects: two L-shapes (one inverted) and a 2x1 rectangle.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixel

  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct objects formed by azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Iterate through Azure Objects:** The transformation identifies azure objects sequentially, starting from the object with upper and lefter pixel.

3. **Check upper-left object:** Check the cell at the left of the rightmost azure pixel on the first row where it finds an azure pixel.

4. **Paint with Blue** Paint that cell with color blue (value = 1).

5.  **Check other objects:** Repeat for the next objects. Find the rightmost azure pixel on the first row where it finds an azure pixel and paint with color blue the cell to the left.

6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

The python program can be the same, it works in both cases.
