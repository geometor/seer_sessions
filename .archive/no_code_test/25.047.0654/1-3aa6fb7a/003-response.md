Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the provided input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several disconnected and connected azure pixels.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** The input grid contains several azure (color 8) pixels, some connected and others isolated.

2.  **Locate Down-Right Diagonal:** For *every* azure pixel, identify its down-right diagonal neighbor.

3.  **Transform to Blue:** Change the color of the down-right diagonal neighbor of the azure pixel to blue (color 1) in the output grid. Azure pixels stays azure.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The rule is: For each azure pixel in the input grid, change the color of its down-right diagonal neighbor to blue in the output grid, while keeping all of the azure pixels.
