Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal shapes.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, there are two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One on the top left is a vertical 2x1 and second one on the right is a 1x2 horizontal shape.

2.  **Change based on relative position:** For each such shape, find its down-right diagonal position.

3.  **Create Blue Pixel:** In output, set to blue (color 1) the down-right diagonal for both shapes.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation involves identifying the down-right diagonal neighbor from azure shapes, and turning those pixels from background to blue.
