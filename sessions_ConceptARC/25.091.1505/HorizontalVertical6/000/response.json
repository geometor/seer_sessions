            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves analyzing the spatial distribution of blue pixels within an input grid to determine where to add a line of green pixels in the output grid. The original content of the input grid is otherwise preserved in the output.\n\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    1.  The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n    2.  All blue (1) and white (0) pixels from the input are present in the same locations in the output, *unless* they are overwritten by the added green line.\n    3.  A single line (either a full row or a full column) of green (3) pixels is added to the output grid.\n    4.  The location of this green line depends on the overall shape formed by the blue pixels.\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Comparing `train_1` with `train_2` and `train_3`, the determining factor seems related to the bounding box of the blue pixels.\n    *   In `train_1`, the blue shape is taller than it is wide. The green line is added to the rightmost column.\n    *   In `train_2`, the blue shape is wider than it is tall. The green line is added to the topmost row.\n    *   In `train_3`, the blue shape is wider than it is tall. The green line is added to the topmost row.\n    *   This suggests a rule based on comparing the height and width of the bounding box encompassing all blue pixels.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Find the minimum bounding box containing all blue (1) pixels. Calculate its height and width. If the height is strictly greater than the width, add a green (3) vertical line to the rightmost column of the grid. Otherwise (if height is less than or equal to width), add a green (3) horizontal line to the topmost row of the grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
