*   **Perception:** The task involves analyzing the spatial distribution of blue pixels within an input grid to determine where to add a line of green pixels in the output grid. The original content of the input grid is otherwise preserved in the output.

*   **Key Observations:**
    1.  The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    2.  All blue (1) and white (0) pixels from the input are present in the same locations in the output, *unless* they are overwritten by the added green line.
    3.  A single line (either a full row or a full column) of green (3) pixels is added to the output grid.
    4.  The location of this green line depends on the overall shape formed by the blue pixels.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Comparing `train_1` with `train_2` and `train_3`, the determining factor seems related to the bounding box of the blue pixels.
    *   In `train_1`, the blue shape is taller than it is wide. The green line is added to the rightmost column.
    *   In `train_2`, the blue shape is wider than it is tall. The green line is added to the topmost row.
    *   In `train_3`, the blue shape is wider than it is tall. The green line is added to the topmost row.
    *   This suggests a rule based on comparing the height and width of the bounding box encompassing all blue pixels.

*   **Hypothesis:** Find the minimum bounding box containing all blue (1) pixels. Calculate its height and width. If the height is strictly greater than the width, add a green (3) vertical line to the rightmost column of the grid. Otherwise (if height is less than or equal to width), add a green (3) horizontal line to the topmost row of the grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size_invariant: True
      input_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
      output_colors: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
      modification: Adds a single line (row or column) of green pixels.

    elements:
      - object: blue_pixels
        description: The set of all pixels with value 1 (blue).
        properties:
          - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all blue pixels.
            attributes:
              - min_row
              - max_row
              - min_col
              - max_col
              - height: (max_row - min_row + 1)
              - width: (max_col - min_col + 1)

    transformation:
      - action: calculate_bounding_box
        input: blue_pixels
        output: bounding_box_dimensions (height, width)
      - action: determine_green_line_location
        based_on: comparison of bounding_box height and width
        condition_1:
          if: height > width
          location: rightmost column
        condition_2:
          if: height <= width
          location: topmost row
      - action: generate_output_grid
        steps:
          - copy input grid
          - overwrite pixels at the determined location (top row or right column) with green (3)

    edge_cases:
      - condition: No blue pixels in input.
        outcome: Output grid is identical to the input grid. (Implied by bounding box calculation - if no blue pixels, height/width might be 0 or undefined depending on implementation, default could be top row or no change. Needs clarification, but based on examples, the rule applies *when* blue pixels exist. Safest assumption: no change if no blue pixels).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    2.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
    3.  If no blue pixels are found, return the copied grid as is.
    4.  If blue pixels are found, determine the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) among them.
    5.  Calculate the height of the bounding box: `height = max_r - min_r + 1`.
    6.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `width = max_c - min_c + 1`.
    7.  Compare the calculated height and width.
    8.  If `height` is strictly greater than `width`, iterate through all rows of the copied grid and set the pixel in the last column (index `grid_width - 1`) to green (3).
    9.  Otherwise (if `height` is less than or equal to `width`), iterate through all columns of the copied grid and set the pixel in the first row (index 0) to green (3).
    10. Return the modified grid.
