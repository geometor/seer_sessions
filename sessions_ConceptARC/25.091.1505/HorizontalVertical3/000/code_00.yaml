task_context:
  - The input grid contains a white background (0) and one or more objects composed of a single non-white color.
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying either the first row or the first column.
  - The modification involves changing all pixels in the selected row or column to blue (1).
  - The choice between modifying the first row or the first column depends on the geometry of the non-white shapes.

input_elements:
  - background: white pixels (0)
  - objects: contiguous groups of non-white pixels (colors 2, 3, 4 in examples)

transformation_logic:
  - Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all these non-white pixels.
  - Calculate the width (number of columns) and height (number of rows) of this bounding box.
  - condition:
      - if width > height:
          - target: first row (row index 0)
      - else (if height >= width):
          - target: first column (column index 0)
  - action:
      - Copy the input grid to the output grid.
      - Change all pixels in the target row or column to blue (1).

output_elements:
  - modified_grid: The input grid with either the first row or first column changed to blue (1).
