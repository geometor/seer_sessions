The input grid contains one or more shapes made of a single color (red, green, or yellow in the examples) on a white background. The output grid is identical to the input, except for either the entire first row or the entire first column being changed to blue. The decision of whether to modify the row or the column depends on the overall dimensions (width vs. height) of the area occupied by the non-white shapes.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
