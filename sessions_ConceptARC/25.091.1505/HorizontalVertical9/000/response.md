Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.
2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0) and it remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes, specifically straight lines, either vertical or horizontal. These lines are composed of a single color in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of these lines. The original color of the line does not seem to determine the *final* color directly (e.g., blue lines become orange in example 1 but yellow in example 2).
5.  **Orientation Dependency:** The key factor determining the output color appears to be the orientation of the line.
    *   In both examples, all *vertical* lines (Red, Green, Blue in ex2) are transformed into yellow (4) lines.
    *   In both examples, all *horizontal* lines (Blue in ex1, Azure, Magenta, Maroon) are transformed into orange (7) lines.
6.  **Shape Preservation:** The position, shape (line), and extent of the colored objects are preserved; only their color changes based on their orientation.

Derived_Rule:
  Action: Recolor non-background pixels based on line orientation.
  Conditions:
    - If a non-white pixel is part of a vertical line segment (has a same-colored neighbor above or below), change its color to yellow (4).
    - If a non-white pixel is part of a horizontal line segment (has a same-colored neighbor left or right) AND NOT part of a vertical segment, change its color to orange (7).
  Object_Properties_Used: Color, Position, Adjacency, Orientation (implicit).
  Invariant: Grid size, Background pixels, Shape/Position of lines.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid. Let the color of the input cell be `C`.
3.  If the input cell color `C` is white (0), set the corresponding output cell `(r, c)` to white (0).
4.  If the input cell color `C` is not white (0):
    a.  Check if there is a cell immediately above `(r-1, c)` or immediately below `(r+1, c)` within the grid bounds that has the same color `C`.
    b.  If such a *vertical* same-colored neighbor exists, set the output cell `(r, c)` color to yellow (4).
    c.  If no such *vertical* same-colored neighbor exists, then check if there is a cell immediately to the left `(r, c-1)` or immediately to the right `(r, c+1)` within the grid bounds that has the same color `C`.
    d.  If such a *horizontal* same-colored neighbor exists, set the output cell `(r, c)` color to orange (7).
    e.  (Implicitly handles isolated non-white pixels, if they were to exist, by potentially falling through, though examples suggest only lines are present. If an isolated pixel needed a specific rule, it would default to the horizontal check failing, leaving the pixel uncolored in the output based on this logic. A safer default might be needed if isolated pixels are possible, e.g., copying original color or defaulting to orange. Based *only* on examples, this logic covers all observed cases).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
