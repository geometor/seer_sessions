Derived_Rule:
  Action: Recolor non-background pixels based on line orientation.
  Conditions:
    - If a non-white pixel is part of a vertical line segment (has a same-colored neighbor above or below), change its color to yellow (4).
    - If a non-white pixel is part of a horizontal line segment (has a same-colored neighbor left or right) AND NOT part of a vertical segment, change its color to orange (7).
  Object_Properties_Used: Color, Position, Adjacency, Orientation (implicit).
  Invariant: Grid size, Background pixels, Shape/Position of lines.
