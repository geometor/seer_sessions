The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0) and it remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes, specifically straight lines, either vertical or horizontal. These lines are composed of a single color in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of these lines. The original color of the line does not seem to determine the *final* color directly (e.g., blue lines become orange in example 1 but yellow in example 2).\n5.  **Orientation Dependency:** The key factor determining the output color appears to be the orientation of the line.\n    *   In both examples, all *vertical* lines (Red, Green, Blue in ex2) are transformed into yellow (4) lines.\n    *   In both examples, all *horizontal* lines (Blue in ex1, Azure, Magenta, Maroon) are transformed into orange (7) lines.\n6.  **Shape Preservation:** The position, shape (line), and extent of the colored objects are preserved; only their color changes based on their orientation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

(Implicitly handles isolated non-white pixels, if they were to exist, by potentially falling through, though examples suggest only lines are present. If an isolated pixel needed a specific rule, it would default to the horizontal check failing, leaving the pixel uncolored in the output based on this logic. A safer default might be needed if isolated pixels are possible, e.g., copying original color or defaulting to orange. Based *only* on examples, this logic covers all observed cases).\n5.
