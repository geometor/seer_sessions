task_description: Fill specific internal white regions (holes) based on boundary color, where the fill rule depends on the set of boundary colors present globally across all filled holes.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: unchanged between input and output

  - element: object
    description: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels. In examples, these form shapes with boundaries.
    properties:
      - color: Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7) observed in examples.
      - role: Form boundaries that may enclose fillable holes.

  - element: background_white
    description: White (0) pixels connected to the grid border via 4-way adjacency.
    properties:
      - state: Remains white in the output.

  - element: fillable_hole
    description: A connected component of white (0) pixels that is NOT background_white AND satisfies the fillable condition.
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - boundary_color: The single non-white color C adjacent (8-way) to the hole pixels.
      - fillable_condition: All 8-way neighbors of all pixels within the component are either white pixels belonging to the same component OR pixels of the single boundary_color C.
      - state_change: Filled with a new color F in the output.

relationships:
  - relationship: boundary_to_fill_mapping
    description: The fill color F depends on the boundary color C of the fillable_hole. This mapping itself is conditional on the global set S of boundary colors from *all* fillable_holes found in the grid.
    conditions:
      - condition: Global set S = {Red(2), Yellow(4)}
        mapping: {Red(2): Green(3), Yellow(4): Orange(7)}
      - condition: Global set S = {Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7)}
        mapping: {Red(2): Orange(7), Yellow(4): Green(3), Orange(7): Green(3)}
    target_fill_colors: Green(3), Orange(7)

actions:
  - action: identify_background
    description: Find all white pixels connected to the border (4-way) and mark them.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: boolean grid indicating background pixels.

  - action: identify_potential_holes
    description: Find connected components of white pixels that are not marked as background.
    inputs: input_grid, background_mask
    outputs: list of potential_hole_regions (each a list of pixel coordinates).

  - action: filter_fillable_holes
    description: For each potential_hole_region, check if it meets the fillable_condition (all 8-way neighbors are either internal white or the same single non-white color C). Collect the boundary color C for valid holes.
    inputs: input_grid, list of potential_hole_regions
    outputs: list of (fillable_hole_pixels, boundary_color), set of all boundary_colors S found.

  - action: determine_fill_map
    description: Select the correct boundary_color -> fill_color mapping based on the global set S.
    inputs: set S
    outputs: mapping function/dictionary

  - action: fill_holes
    description: Apply the determined fill color F to each identified fillable_hole_region in the output grid.
    inputs: input_grid, identified_fillable_holes, fill_map
    outputs: output_grid
