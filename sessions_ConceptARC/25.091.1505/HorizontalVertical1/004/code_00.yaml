task_description: Fill isolated white regions (holes) based on a conditional boundary color mapping.

definitions:
  - definition: background_white
    criteria: White (0) pixels connected to the grid border via a 4-way adjacent path of white pixels.
  - definition: hole_candidate
    criteria: A connected component of white (0) pixels where none are background_white.
  - definition: fillable_hole
    criteria:
      - Is a hole_candidate.
      - All non-white pixels adjacent (8-way) to any pixel in the hole_candidate have the same single color C (the boundary_color).
      - No pixel in the hole_candidate is adjacent (8-way) to any background_white pixel.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0) exists as background_white and potential holes.
      - dimensions: unchanged between input and output.

  - element: object
    description: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels (e.g., Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7)).
    properties:
      - role: Can form boundaries around white regions.

  - element: fillable_hole
    description: A region meeting the criteria defined above.
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - boundary_color: The single color C surrounding the region.
      - state_change: Filled with a new color F in the output.

relationships:
  - relationship: boundary_to_fill_mapping
    description: The fill color F depends on the boundary color C of a fillable_hole. This mapping itself depends on the global set S of all boundary_colors found across *all* fillable_holes in the grid.
    conditions:
      - condition: Global set of fillable_hole boundary colors S = {Red(2), Yellow(4)}
        mapping: {Red(2): Green(3), Yellow(4): Orange(7)}
      - condition: Global set of fillable_hole boundary colors S = {Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7)}
        mapping: {Red(2): Orange(7), Yellow(4): Green(3), Orange(7): Green(3)}
    target_fill_colors: Green(3), Orange(7)

actions:
  - action: identify_background_and_holes
    description: Differentiate background_white pixels from hole_candidate pixels using BFS/connectivity checks.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: map of background pixels, list of hole_candidate components (pixel lists).

  - action: filter_fillable_holes
    description: Apply criteria (single boundary color, no adjacency to background) to identify fillable_holes from hole_candidates.
    inputs: input_grid, background_map, hole_candidates
    outputs: list of (fillable_hole_pixels, boundary_color), set S of all boundary_colors found.

  - action: determine_fill_map
    description: Select the correct boundary_color -> fill_color mapping based on the global set S.
    inputs: set S
    outputs: mapping function/dictionary

  - action: fill_regions
    description: Apply the determined fill color to each identified fillable_hole in the output grid.
    inputs: input_grid, identified_fillable_holes, fill_map
    outputs: output_grid
