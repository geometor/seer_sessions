"""
Identifies connected regions of white (0) pixels that are 'holes' within shapes (i.e., not connected to the grid border background).
For each such hole, determines if it is enclosed by a single non-white color C.
Collects all such unique boundary colors C found across all qualifying holes into a global set S.
Determines a fill color mapping based on the global set S:
 - If S = {Red(2), Yellow(4)}, map: Red(2)->Green(3), Yellow(4)->Orange(7).
 - If S = {Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7)}, map: Red(2)->Orange(7), Yellow(4)->Green(3), Orange(7)->Green(3).
Fills only the qualifying holes (white pixels not connected to the border, enclosed by a single color) using the determined fill color based on their boundary color C.
The original shapes/boundaries remain unchanged.
