            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same.\n2.  **Background Color:** The background is consistently white (0).\n3.  **Objects:** The inputs contain distinct shapes (objects) made of non-white colors (Red=2, Yellow=4, Orange=7 in the examples). These shapes often form boundaries or enclosures.\n4.  **Transformation Core:** The primary transformation involves identifying regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by a single non-white color.\n5.  **Filling Action:** These enclosed white regions are filled with a new color in the output grid. The original enclosing boundary shape remains unchanged.\n6.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used to fill the enclosed region depends on the color of the enclosing boundary. However, the specific mapping rule (boundary color -> fill color) appears to depend on the *set* of all boundary colors present in the entire input grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, the boundary colors are Red (2) and Yellow (4). The mapping is Red->Green(3), Yellow->Orange(7).\n    *   In `train_2`, the boundary colors are Red (2), Yellow (4), and Orange (7). The mapping is Red->Orange(7), Yellow->Green(3), Orange->Green(3).\n7.  **Fill Colors Used:** The colors used for filling are Green (3) and Orange (7).\n8.  **Connectivity:** Identifying enclosed regions requires checking 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). A white region is considered enclosed by color C if all its adjacent non-white pixels are of color C.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
