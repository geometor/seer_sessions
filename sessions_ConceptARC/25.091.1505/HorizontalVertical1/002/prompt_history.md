Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same.
2.  **Background Color:** The background is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** The inputs contain distinct shapes (objects) made of non-white colors (Red=2, Yellow=4, Orange=7 in the examples). These shapes often form boundaries or enclosures.
4.  **Transformation Core:** The primary transformation involves identifying regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by a single non-white color.
5.  **Filling Action:** These enclosed white regions are filled with a new color in the output grid. The original enclosing boundary shape remains unchanged.
6.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used to fill the enclosed region depends on the color of the enclosing boundary. However, the specific mapping rule (boundary color -> fill color) appears to depend on the *set* of all boundary colors present in the entire input grid.
    *   In `train_1`, the boundary colors are Red (2) and Yellow (4). The mapping is Red->Green(3), Yellow->Orange(7).
    *   In `train_2`, the boundary colors are Red (2), Yellow (4), and Orange (7). The mapping is Red->Orange(7), Yellow->Green(3), Orange->Green(3).
7.  **Fill Colors Used:** The colors used for filling are Green (3) and Orange (7).
8.  **Connectivity:** Identifying enclosed regions requires checking 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). A white region is considered enclosed by color C if all its adjacent non-white pixels are of color C.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all connected regions of white (0) pixels.
3.  For each white region, examine all adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). Collect the colors of all non-white adjacent pixels.
4.  If a white region has adjacent non-white pixels, and *all* of these non-white pixels are of the *same* single color `C`, then this white region is an "enclosed region" bounded by color `C`.
5.  Keep track of all unique boundary colors `C` found across all enclosed regions in the grid. Let `S` be the set of these unique boundary colors.
6.  Determine the rule for mapping boundary colors (`C`) to fill colors (`F`) based on the set `S`:
    *   If the set `S` contains only Red (2) and Yellow (4), use the mapping: Red(2) -> Green(3), Yellow(4) -> Orange(7).
    *   If the set `S` contains Red (2), Yellow (4), and Orange (7), use the mapping: Red(2) -> Orange(7), Yellow(4) -> Green(3), Orange(7) -> Green(3).
    *   (Assume these are the only relevant cases based on training data).
7.  For each identified enclosed region:
    *   Get its boundary color `C`.
    *   Find the corresponding fill color `F` using the mapping rule determined in step 6.
    *   Change the color of all white pixels within this enclosed region to the fill color `F` in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.

Identifies connected regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by a single non-white color.
The fill color used for these enclosed regions depends on the global set of boundary colors found in the entire grid.

1. Find all connected components of white pixels.
2. For each white component, check its adjacent non-white neighbors.
3. If all non-white neighbors of a component have the same single color C, it's an "enclosed region" with boundary color C.
4. Collect all unique boundary colors C found across the grid into a set S.
5. Determine the fill color mapping based on S:
   - If S = {Red(2), Yellow(4)}, map: Red(2)->Green(3), Yellow(4)->Orange(7).
   - If S = {Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7)}, map: Red(2)->Orange(7), Yellow(4)->Green(3), Orange(7)->Green(3).
6. Create a copy of the input grid.
7. For each enclosed region, fill its white pixels with the corresponding fill color determined by the mapping rule in the copied grid.
8. Return the modified grid.
