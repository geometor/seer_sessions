The background is white (0).\n2.  **Core Content Preservation**: In both examples, the central colored shapes present in the input grid are exactly preserved in their original positions and colors in the output grid.\n3.  **Modification**: The key difference between input and output is the addition of a single line (either a full row or a full column) filled with the color azure (8).\n4.  **Conditional Modification Location**:\n    *   In `train_1`, the color azure (8) is *not* present in the input grid. The modification is the addition of an azure (8) line in the *rightmost column*.\n    *   In `train_2`, the color azure (8) *is* present in the input grid (as part of the central shape). The modification is the addition of an azure (8) line in the *topmost row*.\n5.  **Hypothesis**: The transformation rule appears to depend on the presence or absence of the color azure (8) within the input grid. If azure (8) is absent, the rightmost column is filled with azure (8). If azure (8) is present, the topmost row is filled with azure (8). The original content of the input grid remains otherwise unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
