These colors often form boundaries or enclosures around areas containing red pixels.\n    *   The transformation specifically targets connected groups (objects) of red (2) pixels.\n    *   The key determining factor for the color change is the shape/orientation of the red object: horizontal lines of red pixels are changed to green (3), while vertical lines or single red pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Other colors and structures in the grid (like the yellow diamonds or blue rectangles) serve as context but are not directly modified. They seem to define distinct regions where the red-to-green transformation rule is applied independently.\n    *   The output grid retains the structure and colors of the input grid, except for the red pixels that meet the horizontal line criteria, which become green (3).\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
