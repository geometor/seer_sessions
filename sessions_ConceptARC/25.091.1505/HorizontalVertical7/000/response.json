The rest of the grid contains other colors (azure, yellow, green) forming shapes, surrounded by a white background (value 0).\n    *   The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, except that either the first row or the second column is entirely filled with red pixels.\n    *   In examples 1 and 2, the two red pixels in the input share the same column index. In the output, the second column (index 1) is filled with red.\n    *   In example 3, the two red pixels in the input share the same row index. In the output, the first row (index 0) is filled with red.\n    *   The transformation rule depends on the relative positions of the two initial red pixels.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
