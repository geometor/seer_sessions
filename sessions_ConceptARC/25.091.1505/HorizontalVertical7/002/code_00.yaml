task_description: Modify the first row or first column based on the alignment of two existing red pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Varying, examples are 10x10
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - object: marker_pixels
    count: 2
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - location: Coordinates (row, column)
      - alignment: Can be aligned horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column).
  - object: background_shapes
    count: 1 per example (implicitly defined by non-white, non-red pixels)
    color: Varies (azure (8), yellow (4), green (3))
    properties:
      - Surrounds or contains the two red marker pixels.
actions:
  - action: locate_markers
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of the two red pixels [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]
  - action: check_alignment
    input: coordinates of red pixels
    output: alignment_type ('row' if r1 == r2, 'column' if c1 == c2)
  - action: modify_grid
    input: input_grid, alignment_type
    process:
      - Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
      - If alignment_type is 'row', set all pixels in the first row (index 0) of the output grid to red (2).
      - If alignment_type is 'column', set all pixels in the first column (index 0) of the output grid to red (2).
    output: modified_output_grid
relationships:
  - The alignment (row or column) of the two red pixels determines which line (row 0 or column 0) is modified in the output.
  - If red pixels are in the same row, modify row 0.
  - If red pixels are in the same column, modify column 0.
