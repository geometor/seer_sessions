*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous attempt failed because the underlying logic was incorrect. The code successfully implemented the "keep adjacent objects" rule, but the examples showed this rule was wrong.
    *   The failure analysis revealed that objects adjacent to the top and bottom of the largest green object were removed, while objects adjacent to the sides (within the same row span) were kept.
    *   A new hypothesis was formulated: Keep the largest green object, and keep any other object *only if* its entire vertical extent (min\_row to max\_row) falls within the vertical extent of the largest green object.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   Refine the object identification process to calculate the min/max row for each object.
    *   Identify the largest green object and its min/max rows (`min_ref_row`, `max_ref_row`).
    *   Create a new blank output grid.
    *   Iterate through all identified objects. If an object is the largest green object OR if its `min_row >= min_ref_row` and `max_row <= max_ref_row`, draw it onto the output grid.

*   **Metrics Calculation & Verification:**
    *   The provided code execution (`code_execution` block) was used to analyze the input/output pairs based on the *new* hypothesis (vertical containment).
    *   It confirmed the largest green object's row ranges for each example: Ex1 (4, 9), Ex2 (1, 13), Ex3 (3, 9).
    *   It verified that the objects kept in the expected output either *are* the largest green object or have row ranges strictly within the corresponding green object's range.
    *   It verified that the objects removed from the input either have rows entirely outside the range or span rows both inside and outside the range.
    *   The new hypothesis correctly explains the transformation for all three training examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Retain the largest green object and any other object whose vertical extent (all rows it occupies) is fully contained within the vertical extent of the largest green object.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
  - role: objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)
      - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
      - size: count of pixels
      - is_green: boolean (color == 3)
      - is_largest_green: boolean (largest size among green objects, determined during transformation)
      - min_row: minimum row index occupied by the object's pixels
      - max_row: maximum row index occupied by the object's pixels

transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, pixels, size, min_row, and max_row.
  - step: 2
    action: Filter the identified objects to find all green objects (color == 3).
  - step: 3
    condition: If no green objects exist.
    action: Return an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - step: 4
    condition: If green objects exist.
    action: Identify the green object with the maximum size ('largest_green_object'). Handle ties deterministically (e.g., select the first one encountered during the object finding process).
  - step: 5
    action: Determine the minimum row ('min_ref_row') and maximum row ('max_ref_row') occupied by the 'largest_green_object'.
  - step: 6
    action: Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
  - step: 7
    action: Iterate through all objects identified in Step 1.
    condition: Check if the current object meets the keep criteria: (is the 'largest_green_object') OR (its 'min_row' >= 'min_ref_row' AND its 'max_row' <= 'max_ref_row').
    effect: If the condition is true, iterate through the object's 'pixels' and set the corresponding (row, col) in the output grid to the object's 'color'.
  - step: 8
    action: Return the final output grid.

relationships:
  - type: vertical_containment
    description: An object 'A' is vertically contained by object 'B' if A.min_row >= B.min_row and A.max_row <= B.max_row.
  - type: selection_criterion
    description: Objects are kept (drawn onto the output grid) if they are the largest green object OR if they are vertically contained within the largest green object's row range. Objects not meeting this criterion are implicitly removed because the output grid starts blank.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all separate objects in the input grid, where an object is a connected group of pixels of the same non-white color. For each object, note its color, its size (number of pixels), and the lowest and highest row numbers it occupies.
2.  Find all the objects that are green (color 3).
3.  If there are no green objects, create a new grid the same size as the input, fill it with white (color 0), and this is the final output.
4.  If there are green objects, select the one with the largest size. Call this the 'primary green object'. (If there's a tie for largest size, pick one consistently, like the first one found).
5.  Note the lowest row number (`min_ref_row`) and the highest row number (`max_ref_row`) occupied by the 'primary green object'.
6.  Create a new grid the same size as the input and fill it entirely with white (color 0). This will become the output grid.
7.  Examine every object identified in step 1:
    a.  Check if the current object is the 'primary green object'.
    b.  If not, check if its lowest row number is equal to or greater than `min_ref_row` AND its highest row number is equal to or less than `max_ref_row`.
    c.  If the object is the 'primary green object' OR if it satisfies the row condition in step 7b, then for each pixel belonging to this object, set the pixel at the same coordinate in the output grid to this object's color.
8.  The final output is the grid constructed in steps 6 and 7.
