Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors. The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), red (2), green (3) in the first example, and white (0), yellow (4), azure (8), blue (1), magenta (6) in the second example. White (0) consistently acts as the background color.
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct contiguous regions or "objects" separated by the white background. In both examples, the input grid contains exactly two such distinct regions. These regions appear to be separated vertically by at least one full column of white pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting *one* of the non-white regions from the input and preserving it in the output, while discarding the other region(s) by replacing them with the white background color. The position and pixel values within the selected region remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key challenge is determining the rule for selecting which region to keep.
    *   In example 1, the right region is kept. It has fewer total pixels (36 vs 60) and spans fewer rows (6 vs 11) than the left region. The count of the most frequent color (Red=24) is tied between the two regions. The kept region contains the overall rightmost pixel.
    *   In example 2, the left region is kept. It has more total pixels (45 vs 40) and spans more rows (9 vs 8) than the right region. The count of the most frequent color is higher in the kept region (Yellow=30) compared to the discarded region (Blue=24). The kept region contains the overall leftmost pixel.
6.  **Synthesized Rule:** The selection seems based on the frequency of the most common color within each region. The region where the most frequent color appears the *most* times is selected. If there's a tie in these maximum frequency counts, the region that extends furthest to the right (contains the rightmost non-white pixel among the tied regions) is chosen.

## YAML Facts Block


```yaml
task_description: Filter the input grid to keep only one specific contiguous region of non-white pixels, replacing all other pixels with the background color (white).

definitions:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object: A contiguous region (connected orthogonally or diagonally) of non-white pixels.
  - region_properties:
      - pixels: List of coordinates and colors for pixels within the region.
      - color_counts: A map of each color within the region to its frequency (count).
      - max_color_frequency: The highest frequency count among all colors in the region.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the region.
      - rightmost_column: The maximum column index occupied by any pixel in the region.

processing_steps:
  - step: Identify all distinct 'objects' (contiguous non-white regions) in the input grid. Assume regions are separated by the background_color.
  - step: For each identified region, calculate its 'region_properties', specifically 'color_counts' and 'max_color_frequency'.
  - step: Compare the 'max_color_frequency' values across all identified regions.
  - step: Select the primary candidate region(s) - those with the highest 'max_color_frequency'.
  - step: If only one primary candidate region exists, select it.
  - step: If multiple primary candidate regions exist (tie in 'max_color_frequency'), apply a tie-breaker:
      - For each tied region, determine its 'rightmost_column'.
      - Select the region with the largest 'rightmost_column' value.
  - step: Generate the output grid:
      - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the 'background_color'.
      - Copy the pixels belonging to the finally selected region from the input grid into the output grid at their original coordinates.

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    - regions_identified: 2 (Left, Right)
    - region_properties:
        - Left: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Red), rightmost_column = 5
        - Right: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Red), rightmost_column = 12
    - selection: Tie in max_color_frequency (24 vs 24). Apply tie-breaker. Right region has larger rightmost_column (12 > 5). Select Right region.
    - output: Matches the provided output.
  - example: train_2
    - regions_identified: 2 (Left, Right)
    - region_properties:
        - Left: max_color_frequency = 30 (color Yellow), rightmost_column = 5
        - Right: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Blue), rightmost_column = 11
    - selection: No tie in max_color_frequency (30 > 24). Select Left region.
    - output: Matches the provided output.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all separate contiguous regions composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. Treat pixels connected side-by-side or diagonally as part of the same region. Assume regions are separated from each other by white pixels.
2.  For each identified region:
    a.  Count how many times each non-white color appears within that region.
    b.  Determine the highest count found (this is the region's "maximum color frequency").
    c.  Record this maximum color frequency for the region.
3.  Find the overall highest maximum color frequency among all regions.
4.  Identify all regions that have this overall highest maximum color frequency.
5.  **Selection Rule:**
    a.  If exactly one region has the overall highest maximum color frequency, select this region.
    b.  If multiple regions tie for the highest maximum color frequency, compare these tied regions based on their position. Find the rightmost column index touched by each tied region. Select the region whose rightmost column index is the largest (i.e., the one extending furthest to the right).
6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the white background color (0).
7.  For the single region selected in step 5, copy all of its pixels (preserving their colors and positions) from the input grid onto the new output grid.
8.  The resulting new grid is the final output.
