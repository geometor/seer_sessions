task_description: Filter the input grid to keep only one specific contiguous region of non-white pixels, replacing all other pixels with the background color (white).

definitions:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object: A contiguous region (connected orthogonally or diagonally) of non-white pixels.
  - region_properties:
      - pixels: List of coordinates and colors for pixels within the region.
      - color_counts: A map of each color within the region to its frequency (count).
      - max_color_frequency: The highest frequency count among all colors in the region.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the region.
      - rightmost_column: The maximum column index occupied by any pixel in the region.

processing_steps:
  - step: Identify all distinct 'objects' (contiguous non-white regions) in the input grid. Assume regions are separated by the background_color.
  - step: For each identified region, calculate its 'region_properties', specifically 'color_counts' and 'max_color_frequency'.
  - step: Compare the 'max_color_frequency' values across all identified regions.
  - step: Select the primary candidate region(s) - those with the highest 'max_color_frequency'.
  - step: If only one primary candidate region exists, select it.
  - step: If multiple primary candidate regions exist (tie in 'max_color_frequency'), apply a tie-breaker:
      - For each tied region, determine its 'rightmost_column'.
      - Select the region with the largest 'rightmost_column' value.
  - step: Generate the output grid:
      - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the 'background_color'.
      - Copy the pixels belonging to the finally selected region from the input grid into the output grid at their original coordinates.

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    - regions_identified: 2 (Left, Right)
    - region_properties:
        - Left: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Red), rightmost_column = 5
        - Right: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Red), rightmost_column = 12
    - selection: Tie in max_color_frequency (24 vs 24). Apply tie-breaker. Right region has larger rightmost_column (12 > 5). Select Right region.
    - output: Matches the provided output.
  - example: train_2
    - regions_identified: 2 (Left, Right)
    - region_properties:
        - Left: max_color_frequency = 30 (color Yellow), rightmost_column = 5
        - Right: max_color_frequency = 24 (color Blue), rightmost_column = 11
    - selection: No tie in max_color_frequency (30 > 24). Select Left region.
    - output: Matches the provided output.
