            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors. The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), red (2), green (3) in the first example, and white (0), yellow (4), azure (8), blue (1), magenta (6) in the second example. White (0) consistently acts as the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct contiguous regions or \"objects\" separated by the white background. In both examples, the input grid contains exactly two such distinct regions. These regions appear to be separated vertically by at least one full column of white pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting *one* of the non-white regions from the input and preserving it in the output, while discarding the other region(s) by replacing them with the white background color. The position and pixel values within the selected region remain unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key challenge is determining the rule for selecting which region to keep.\n    *   In example 1, the right region is kept. It has fewer total pixels (36 vs 60) and spans fewer rows (6 vs 11) than the left region. The count of the most frequent color (Red=24) is tied between the two regions. The kept region contains the overall rightmost pixel.\n    *   In example 2, the left region is kept. It has more total pixels (45 vs 40) and spans more rows (9 vs 8) than the right region. The count of the most frequent color is higher in the kept region (Yellow=30) compared to the discarded region (Blue=24). The kept region contains the overall leftmost pixel.\n6.  **Synthesized Rule:** The selection seems based on the frequency of the most common color within each region. The region where the most frequent color appears the *most* times is selected. If there's a tie in these maximum frequency counts, the region that extends furthest to the right (contains the rightmost non-white pixel among the tied regions) is chosen.\n\n## YAML Facts Block\n\n"

If multiple regions tie for the highest maximum color frequency, compare these tied regions based on their position. Find the rightmost column index touched by each tied region. Select the region whose rightmost column index is the largest (i.e., the one extending furthest to the right).\n6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the white background color (0).\n7.
