Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background:** All grids use white (0) as the primary background color.
2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous object composed of yellow (4) pixels. The shape and position of this yellow object vary across examples.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding a line of green (3) pixels to the grid. The yellow object itself remains unchanged in shape and position in the output grid.
4.  **Green Line Placement:** The key variation is the placement of the green line.
    *   In examples 1 and 3, the entire top row (row 0) is filled with green, except where the original yellow object might be present in that row.
    *   In example 2, the entire rightmost column (last column) is filled with green, except where the original yellow object might be present in that column.
5.  **Determining Factor:** The choice between filling the top row or the rightmost column seems to depend on a property of the yellow object. Comparing the examples, the distinguishing factor appears related to the position of the object, specifically its leftmost extent.

    *   Example 1: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 2. Output: Top row green.
    *   Example 2: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 1. Output: Rightmost column green.
    *   Example 3: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 0. Output: Top row green.

    The pattern suggests that if the object starts exactly at column index 1, the rightmost column is filled green. Otherwise, the top row is filled green.

**YAML Facts Block:**


```yaml
task_description: Add a line of green pixels based on the position of a yellow object.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    count: 1 per input grid
    property: location (specifically the minimum column index)
  - type: added_element
    color: green (3)
    shape: full row or full column
    placement_rule: conditioned on the minimum column index of the yellow object
relationships:
  - The yellow object is preserved from input to output.
  - The placement of the green line (top row vs. rightmost column) depends solely on whether the minimum column index occupied by the yellow object is exactly 1.
actions:
  - Identify the yellow object.
  - Find the minimum column index (min_col) of the yellow object.
  - If min_col equals 1, fill the background (white pixels) of the rightmost column with green.
  - If min_col is not equal to 1, fill the background (white pixels) of the top row with green.
  - Preserve the original yellow object in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create a copy to serve as the output grid.
2.  Locate all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the input grid.
3.  Find the minimum column index among all identified yellow pixels. Let this be `min_col`.
4.  Check if `min_col` is equal to 1.
5.  If `min_col` is equal to 1:
    *   Identify the index of the rightmost column (`last_col`).
    *   Iterate through each row `r` of the grid.
    *   If the pixel at `(r, last_col)` in the input grid is white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3).
6.  If `min_col` is *not* equal to 1:
    *   Identify the index of the top row (which is always 0).
    *   Iterate through each column `c` of the grid.
    *   If the pixel at `(0, c)` in the input grid is white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3).
7.  The resulting grid, containing the original yellow object and the added green line on the white background, is the final output.
