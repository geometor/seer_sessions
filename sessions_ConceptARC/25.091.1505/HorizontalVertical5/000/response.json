The shape and position of this yellow object vary across examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding a line of green (3) pixels to the grid. The yellow object itself remains unchanged in shape and position in the output grid.\n4.  **Green Line Placement:** The key variation is the placement of the green line.\n    *   In examples 1 and 3, the entire top row (row 0) is filled with green, except where the original yellow object might be present in that row.\n    *   In example 2, the entire rightmost column (last column) is filled with green, except where the original yellow object might be present in that column.\n5.  **Determining Factor:** The choice between filling the top row or the rightmost column seems to depend on a property of the yellow object. Comparing the examples, the distinguishing factor appears related to the position of the object, specifically its leftmost extent.\n\n    *   Example 1: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 2. Output: Top row green.\n    *   Example 2: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 1. Output: Rightmost column green.\n    *   Example 3: The leftmost yellow pixel is in column 0. Output: Top row green.\n\n    The pattern suggests that if the object starts exactly at column index 1, the rightmost column is filled green. Otherwise, the top row is filled green.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"
