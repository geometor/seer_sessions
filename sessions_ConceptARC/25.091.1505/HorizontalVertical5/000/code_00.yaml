task_description: Add a line of green pixels based on the position of a yellow object.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    count: 1 per input grid
    property: location (specifically the minimum column index)
  - type: added_element
    color: green (3)
    shape: full row or full column
    placement_rule: conditioned on the minimum column index of the yellow object
relationships:
  - The yellow object is preserved from input to output.
  - The placement of the green line (top row vs. rightmost column) depends solely on whether the minimum column index occupied by the yellow object is exactly 1.
actions:
  - Identify the yellow object.
  - Find the minimum column index (min_col) of the yellow object.
  - If min_col equals 1, fill the background (white pixels) of the rightmost column with green.
  - If min_col is not equal to 1, fill the background (white pixels) of the top row with green.
  - Preserve the original yellow object in the output.
