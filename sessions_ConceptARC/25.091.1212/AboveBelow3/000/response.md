*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    *   The background color is white (0).
    *   Each input grid contains multiple distinct objects composed of non-white pixels.
    *   The transformation focuses on a single object within the input grid: the "topmost" object. The topmost object is the one containing pixels with the smallest row index. If multiple objects share the same minimum row index, they are collectively treated as the topmost object component (though in the examples, the topmost object is always a single contiguous block).
    *   All objects other than the topmost object remain unchanged in their position and color from input to output.
    *   The topmost object is moved vertically downwards. Its horizontal position and shape remain the same.
    *   The distance the topmost object moves downwards depends on the number of completely white rows situated immediately below it in the input grid.
    *   Specifically, the downward shift distance is equal to the count of consecutive, entirely white rows starting from the row directly below the lowest row occupied by the topmost object.

```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        - dimensions: Consistent between input and output.
        - background_color: white (0).
      object_properties:
        - type: Discrete, contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
        - count: Multiple objects per grid.
    transformation:
      target_object:
        - identification: The object(s) containing the minimum row index with non-white pixels (topmost object).
      action:
        - name: Vertical shift downwards.
        - target: Only the identified topmost object.
        - other_objects: Remain static.
      shift_determination:
        - basis: Rows immediately below the target object in the input.
        - condition: Rows must be entirely composed of the background color (white).
        - calculation: Count the number of consecutive, entirely white rows starting from the row directly beneath the lowest extent of the topmost object. This count equals the downward shift distance.
      process:
        - Step 1: Identify the topmost object and its vertical extent (min_row, max_row).
        - Step 2: Count consecutive all-white rows starting from row `max_row + 1`. Let the count be `shift`.
        - Step 3: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input.
        - Step 4: Erase the original topmost object from the output grid (set its pixels to white).
        - Step 5: Redraw the topmost object in the output grid, shifted down by `shift` rows.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the set of pixels belonging to the topmost non-white object(s) in the input grid (those pixels with the minimum row index). Determine the maximum row index (`max_row`) occupied by any pixel of this topmost object.
    2.  Initialize a counter `shift` to 0.
    3.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid starting from the row immediately below the topmost object (`row_index = max_row + 1`).
    4.  For each `row_index`, check if all pixels in that row are the background color (white, 0).
    5.  If the row is entirely white, increment the `shift` counter and proceed to the next row (`row_index + 1`).
    6.  If the row is not entirely white, or if the bottom of the grid is reached, stop counting. The final value of `shift` is the required vertical displacement.
    7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    8.  Set all pixels corresponding to the original position of the topmost object in the output grid to the background color (white, 0).
    9.  For each pixel `(r, c)` that was part of the original topmost object, set the pixel at `(r + shift, c)` in the output grid to the original color of the pixel at `(r, c)`.
