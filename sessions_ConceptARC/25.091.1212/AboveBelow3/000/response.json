The topmost object is the one containing pixels with the smallest row index. If multiple objects share the same minimum row index, they are collectively treated as the topmost object component (though in the examples, the topmost object is always a single contiguous block).\n    *   All objects other than the topmost object remain unchanged in their position and color from input to output.\n    *   The topmost object is moved vertically downwards. Its horizontal position and shape remain the same.\n    *   The distance the topmost object moves downwards depends on the number of completely white rows situated immediately below it in the input grid.\n    *   Specifically, the downward shift distance is equal to the count of consecutive, entirely white rows starting from the row directly below the lowest row occupied by the topmost object.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
