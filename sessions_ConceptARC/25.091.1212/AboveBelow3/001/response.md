    Identifies the topmost non-white object(s) in the input grid, calculates 
    a vertical downward shift distance based on the number of consecutive 
    all-white rows immediately below the object, and moves only the topmost 
    object(s) down by that distance. Other objects remain stationary.

    1. Find all non-white pixels. If none, return the input grid.
    2. Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`) containing non-white pixels.
    3. Identify all connected non-white pixels starting from those at `min_r`. 
       This constitutes the "topmost object".
    4. Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) occupied by the topmost object.
    5. Count the number of consecutive rows composed entirely of the background 
       color (0) starting from the row immediately below the object (`max_r + 1`). 
       This count is the `shift` distance.
    6. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
    7. Erase the topmost object from its original position in the output grid 
       by setting its pixels to the background color (0).
    8. Redraw the topmost object in the output grid at its new position, 
       shifted down by `shift` rows.
