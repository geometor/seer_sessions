The reported error \"transform function not found\" suggests an issue with the execution environment or the way the function was defined/called, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic derived from the first example.\n\n    The strategy is to:\n    1.  Re-verify the transformation rule against *all* provided training examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to ensure its general applicability.\n    2.  Use code execution to extract key metrics from each example to confirm the rule's parameters (topmost object location, maximum row of the object, number of subsequent white rows, calculated shift).\n    3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this comprehensive analysis, ensuring clarity and precision.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n\n    Let's gather metrics for each training example using code execution to confirm the rule.\n\n    **Train 1:**\n    "
