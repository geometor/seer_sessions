*   **Assessment and Strategy:**
    The initial analysis derived a rule from the first training example: identify the topmost non-white object, count the number of fully white rows immediately beneath it, and shift that object down by that count, leaving other objects untouched. The reported error "transform function not found" suggests an issue with the execution environment or the way the function was defined/called, rather than a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic derived from the first example.

    The strategy is to:
    1.  Re-verify the transformation rule against *all* provided training examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_3`) to ensure its general applicability.
    2.  Use code execution to extract key metrics from each example to confirm the rule's parameters (topmost object location, maximum row of the object, number of subsequent white rows, calculated shift).
    3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on this comprehensive analysis, ensuring clarity and precision.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    Let's gather metrics for each training example using code execution to confirm the rule.

Train 3 Metrics:

    The metrics confirm the initial hypothesis across all training examples. The topmost object (defined by the minimum row index containing non-white pixels and connectivity) is identified, its maximum row extent (`max_r`) is found, and the number of fully white rows immediately following `max_r` corresponds exactly to the downward shift observed in the output grids.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        - dimensions: Consistent between input and output.
        - background_color: white (0).
      object_properties:
        - definition: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same non-white color, connected cardinally (up, down, left, right).
        - identification: Objects are distinct blocks separated by the background color.
    transformation:
      target_object:
        - selection_criterion: The object(s) containing pixels at the minimum row index that is not entirely background color. If multiple non-background pixels exist at this minimum row index, the target object includes all connected non-background pixels reachable from these initial pixels.
        - properties: Shape and color remain unchanged. Position changes vertically.
      action:
        - name: Vertical translation (downward shift).
        - scope: Applied exclusively to the target object(s). All other objects remain static in their original positions.
      shift_determination:
        - anchor_point: The maximum row index occupied by the target object (`max_row`).
        - condition: Rows below the target object, starting from `max_row + 1`.
        - rule: Count the number of consecutive rows immediately following `max_row` that are composed entirely of the background color (white, 0).
        - result: The count obtained is the vertical shift distance (`shift`).
      output_generation:
        - Step 1: Copy the input grid to create the initial output grid.
        - Step 2: Identify the target object's pixels and their original colors.
        - Step 3: Overwrite the target object's original pixels in the output grid with the background color.
        - Step 4: Determine the shift distance as described above.
        - Step 5: Draw the target object's pixels (with their original colors) at their new positions `(original_row + shift, original_column)` in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find all non-background pixels in the input grid. If none exist, return the original grid.
    3.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`) that contains at least one non-background pixel.
    4.  Identify the "topmost object": Start a search (e.g., BFS or DFS) from all non-background pixels located at `min_r`. Collect all connected non-background pixels reachable through cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right). Store the coordinates and original colors of these pixels.
    5.  If no topmost object is found (e.g., grid only contains background), return the original grid.
    6.  Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) among all pixels belonging to the identified topmost object.
    7.  Calculate the downward shift distance (`shift`): Initialize `shift` to 0. Iterate through the rows of the input grid starting from `row_index = max_r + 1`. For each row, if it consists entirely of the background color (0), increment `shift`. Stop counting as soon as a row with non-background pixels is encountered or the bottom of the grid is reached.
    8.  Modify the output grid:
        a.  For every pixel coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to the topmost object, set the value at `output_grid[r, c]` to the background color (0).
        b.  For every pixel coordinate `(r, c)` with original color `clr` belonging to the topmost object, calculate the new row `new_r = r + shift`. If `new_r` is within the grid's height bounds, set the value at `output_grid[new_r, c]` to `clr`.
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
