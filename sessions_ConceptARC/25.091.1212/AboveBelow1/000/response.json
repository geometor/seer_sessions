            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid appears to be divided into three main sections: an upper area containing colored objects, a distinct horizontal line, and a lower area also containing colored objects. The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Dividing Line:** There's a unique horizontal line in each input grid that spans the entire width.\n    *   In `train_1`, it's a solid red (2) line.\n    *   In `train_2`, it's a solid green (3) line.\n    *   In `train_3`, it's an alternating azure (8) and white (0) line.\n    This line acts as a clear separator. The color or pattern of this line seems distinct within each grid, not appearing as the main color of the other objects.\n3.  **Objects:** Above and below the dividing line, there are distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of a single color (yellow, magenta, blue). These objects vary in shape, size, and position across examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation preserves the upper section of the grid (including the objects within it) and the dividing line itself. However, the entire section *below* the dividing line is cleared, meaning all pixels in the rows below the dividing line are set to white (0).\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the dimensions of the input grid. It consists of the original upper section, the original dividing line, and a lower section filled entirely with white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the row index of this dividing line.\n3.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n4.  Copy all rows from the input grid, starting from the top row (index 0) down to and including the identified dividing line row, into the new grid.\n5.  Fill all remaining rows in the new grid (those below the dividing line row) entirely with the white color (0).\n6.  The resulting new grid is the output."
