"""
Identifies a unique horizontal dividing line in the input grid. 
This line is characterized by either consisting of a single solid color 
(not the background color 0) or an alternating two-color pattern 
(where at least one color is not 0) that spans the full width. 
The transformation keeps all rows from the top of the grid down to 
and including the dividing line, and replaces all rows below the 
dividing line with the background color (0).
