task_description: Swap the vertical positions of two distinct colored objects/groups, moving the upper one below the lower one.

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input:
      grid_size: [10, 15]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: yellow (4)
          shape: horizontal line segment
          bounding_box: [row_start: 3, row_end: 3, col_start: 4, col_end: 11]
          position: Above the green object
        - color: green (3)
          shape: hollow rectangle
          bounding_box: [row_start: 4, row_end: 8, col_start: 4, col_end: 11]
          position: Below the yellow object
    output:
      grid_size: [10, 15]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: green (3)
          shape: hollow rectangle
          bounding_box: [row_start: 4, row_end: 8, col_start: 4, col_end: 11]
          position: Remains stationary (now above the yellow object)
        - color: yellow (4)
          shape: horizontal line segment
          bounding_box: [row_start: 9, row_end: 9, col_start: 4, col_end: 11]
          position: Moved below the green object
    transformation:
      action: Vertical repositioning
      moved_object_color: yellow (4)
      stationary_object_color: green (3)
      rule: The yellow object moves from row 3 to row 9 (row 8 of green object + 1).

  - id: train_2
    input:
      grid_size: [14, 12]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          shape: multiple disconnected shapes forming a cluster
          bounding_box: [row_start: 0, row_end: 2, col_start: 2, col_end: 10] # Approximate bounding box of the group
          position: Above the red object
        - color: red (2)
          shape: hollow 'C' shape
          bounding_box: [row_start: 3, row_end: 8, col_start: 1, col_end: 10] # Approximate bounding box
          position: Below the azure object group
    output:
      grid_size: [14, 12]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: red (2)
          shape: hollow 'C' shape
          bounding_box: [row_start: 3, row_end: 8, col_start: 1, col_end: 10]
          position: Remains stationary (now above the azure group)
        - color: azure (8)
          shape: multiple disconnected shapes forming a cluster
          bounding_box: [row_start: 9, row_end: 11, col_start: 2, col_end: 10] # Approximate bounding box of the moved group
          position: Moved below the red object
    transformation:
      action: Vertical repositioning
      moved_object_color: azure (8)
      stationary_object_color: red (2)
      rule: The azure group moves down. Its top row moves from 0 to 9 (row 8 of red object + 1). The relative positions within the azure group are preserved.

general_properties:
  - The input grid contains exactly two non-background colors.
  - Pixels of the same color form one or more potentially disconnected components, treated collectively as a single group for positioning.
  - One color group is located entirely above the other color group (their row ranges do not overlap).
  - The transformation swaps the vertical order: the upper group moves below the lower group.
  - The lower group's position remains unchanged.
  - The upper group is translated vertically downwards. Its new top boundary is one row below the original bottom boundary of the lower group.
  - Horizontal positions are preserved for all pixels.
