            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The input grid contains two distinct objects on a white background: a yellow horizontal line segment (1x8) and a green hollow rectangle (5x8) located directly below the yellow line. In the output grid, the green rectangle remains in the same position, but the yellow line has moved to the position directly below the green rectangle.\n*   **Example 2:** The input grid contains two distinct color groups on a white background: several azure shapes clustered together at the top and a red shape (resembling a 'C') located below the azure shapes. In the output grid, the red 'C' shape remains in its original position, while the entire cluster of azure shapes has moved to occupy the space directly below the red 'C' shape. The relative arrangement of the azure shapes within their cluster is preserved.\n\n**Common Pattern:** In both examples, there are two distinct non-background color objects (or groups of objects treated as one). One object/group is positioned vertically above the other. The transformation involves moving the *upper* object/group to the position directly *below* the *lower* object/group, while the lower object/group remains stationary. The horizontal position of the moved object/group is maintained.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
