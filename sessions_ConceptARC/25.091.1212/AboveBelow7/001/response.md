Identifies two distinct non-background colored objects/groups in the input grid.
One group is positioned vertically above the other.
The transformation moves the upper object/group vertically downwards, positioning it directly below the lower object/group.
The lower object/group remains stationary.
Horizontal positions are preserved for all pixels.
