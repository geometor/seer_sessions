Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (typically white 0).
    - Contains a single, unique horizontal line spanning the full grid width.
      - Name: Reference_Line
      - Properties:
        - Color: C_line (e.g., yellow 4, magenta 6)
        - Row_Index: R_line
        - Orientation: Horizontal
        - Extent: Full grid width
    - Contains one or more discrete, monochromatic, horizontal blocks.
      - Name: Target_Blocks
      - Properties:
        - Color: C_block (e.g., red 2, green 3; C_block != 0 and C_block != C_line)
        - Orientation: Horizontal
        - Height: 1 pixel
        - Row_Index: R_block
        - Column_Indices: [Col_start, ..., Col_end]

Transformation:
  Action: Modify pixels within Target_Blocks based on their vertical position relative to Reference_Line.
  Condition:
    - IF R_block < R_line (Block is above Reference_Line):
      - Action: Change the color of the leftmost pixel of the block (at Col_start) to C_line.
    - IF R_block > R_line (Block is below Reference_Line):
      - Action: Change the color of the rightmost pixel of the block (at Col_end) to C_line.
  Unaffected_Pixels:
    - Background pixels (color 0).
    - Pixels belonging to the Reference_Line.
    - All pixels within Target_Blocks except for the single modified pixel (leftmost or rightmost).

Output_Grid:
  - Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
  - Contains the modified Target_Blocks.
  - Reference_Line and Background remain unchanged.
