Specifically, *one* pixel within each block changes color.\n    *   The new color assigned to the modified pixel is the same as the color of the horizontal reference line (yellow in `train_1`, magenta in `train_2`).\n5.  **Modification Logic:**\n    *   The position of the modified pixel within a block depends on the block's vertical position relative to the horizontal reference line.\n    *   Blocks *above* the line have their *leftmost* pixel changed.\n    *   Blocks *below* the line have their *rightmost* pixel changed.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
