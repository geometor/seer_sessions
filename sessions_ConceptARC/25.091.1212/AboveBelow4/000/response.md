Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids containing a background color (white), a single distinct horizontal line spanning the grid width, and several smaller, horizontal, monochromatic blocks.
2.  **Horizontal Line:**
    *   In `train_1`, the line is yellow (4) at row 4.
    *   In `train_2`, the line is magenta (6) at row 2.
    *   This line seems to act as a reference or separator.
3.  **Monochromatic Blocks:**
    *   In `train_1`, the blocks are red (2).
    *   In `train_2`, the blocks are green (3).
    *   All blocks are purely horizontal (1 pixel high).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The background and the horizontal line remain unchanged in the output.
    *   The monochromatic blocks are modified. Specifically, *one* pixel within each block changes color.
    *   The new color assigned to the modified pixel is the same as the color of the horizontal reference line (yellow in `train_1`, magenta in `train_2`).
5.  **Modification Logic:**
    *   The position of the modified pixel within a block depends on the block's vertical position relative to the horizontal reference line.
    *   Blocks *above* the line have their *leftmost* pixel changed.
    *   Blocks *below* the line have their *rightmost* pixel changed.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (typically white 0).
    - Contains a single, unique horizontal line spanning the full grid width.
      - Name: Reference_Line
      - Properties:
        - Color: C_line (e.g., yellow 4, magenta 6)
        - Row_Index: R_line
        - Orientation: Horizontal
        - Extent: Full grid width
    - Contains one or more discrete, monochromatic, horizontal blocks.
      - Name: Target_Blocks
      - Properties:
        - Color: C_block (e.g., red 2, green 3; C_block != 0 and C_block != C_line)
        - Orientation: Horizontal
        - Height: 1 pixel
        - Row_Index: R_block
        - Column_Indices: [Col_start, ..., Col_end]

Transformation:
  Action: Modify pixels within Target_Blocks based on their vertical position relative to Reference_Line.
  Condition:
    - IF R_block < R_line (Block is above Reference_Line):
      - Action: Change the color of the leftmost pixel of the block (at Col_start) to C_line.
    - IF R_block > R_line (Block is below Reference_Line):
      - Action: Change the color of the rightmost pixel of the block (at Col_end) to C_line.
  Unaffected_Pixels:
    - Background pixels (color 0).
    - Pixels belonging to the Reference_Line.
    - All pixels within Target_Blocks except for the single modified pixel (leftmost or rightmost).

Output_Grid:
  - Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
  - Contains the modified Target_Blocks.
  - Reference_Line and Background remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the unique horizontal line that spans the full width of the input grid. Record its color (`line_color`) and row index (`line_row`).
2.  Identify all distinct horizontal, contiguous blocks of pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor `line_color`.
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  For each identified block:
    a.  Determine the block's row index (`block_row`).
    b.  Find the column index of the leftmost pixel (`col_start`) and the rightmost pixel (`col_end`) of the block.
    c.  Compare the block's row to the line's row:
        i.  If `block_row` is less than `line_row` (block is above the line), update the pixel at (`block_row`, `col_start`) in the output grid to `line_color`.
        ii. If `block_row` is greater than `line_row` (block is below the line), update the pixel at (`block_row`, `col_end`) in the output grid to `line_color`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
