*   **Perception:** The input grids contain various colored shapes (yellow, gray, red) on a white background. The output grids show that the red color (2) seems to "drip" or "bleed" downwards, replacing any non-white pixels directly below it. This dripping effect propagates downwards column by column until it hits the white background or the bottom edge of the grid. Other colors remain unchanged unless they are overwritten by the dripping red.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - type: grid
        background_color: white (0)
        objects:
          - color: yellow (4)
            shape: rectangle (train_1)
          - color: gray (5)
            shape: complex, multiple disconnected parts (train_2)
          - color: red (2)
            shape: horizontal line (train_1), multiple small patterns (train_2)
    transformation:
      type: color propagation
      source_color: red (2)
      target_colors: any color except white (0)
      direction: downwards
      mechanism: overwrite
      scope: column-wise
      termination: stops at white (0) pixel or grid boundary
    relationships:
      - vertical adjacency is key for propagation
      - white (0) acts as a barrier to propagation
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each column of the grid.
    3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom, up to the second-to-last row.
    4.  For each cell `(row, column)` being examined in the *output* grid:
        a.  If the color of the cell `(row, column)` is red (2):
        b.  Examine the cell directly below it at `(row + 1, column)`.
        c.  If the color of the cell below `(row + 1, column)` is *not* white (0):
        d.  Change the color of the cell `(row + 1, column)` in the output grid to red (2).
    5.  After checking all relevant cells, return the modified output grid.
