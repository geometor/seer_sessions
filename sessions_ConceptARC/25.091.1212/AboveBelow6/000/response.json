The output grids show that the red color (2) seems to \"drip\" or \"bleed\" downwards, replacing any non-white pixels directly below it. This dripping effect propagates downwards column by column until it hits the white background or the bottom edge of the grid. Other colors remain unchanged unless they are overwritten by the dripping red.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
