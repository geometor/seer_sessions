    Processes the input grid based on the 'dripping red' rule.

    For each column in the grid, finds red (2) pixels. 
    If a red pixel is found, it propagates downwards, changing any non-white (0) 
    pixel below it in the same column to red (2).
    This propagation continues downwards until it encounters a white (0) pixel, 
    or the bottom edge of the grid.
