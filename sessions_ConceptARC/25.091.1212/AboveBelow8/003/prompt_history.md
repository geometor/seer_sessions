**Perception**

The task involves processing an input grid containing various colors and producing an output grid of the same dimensions. Observing the input-output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid retains only the pixels that were 'azure' (color 8) in the input grid, keeping them in their original positions. All other pixels in the input grid, regardless of their original color (including 'white' or color 0), are replaced with 'white' (color 0) in the output grid. The transformation acts as a color filter, specifically isolating the 'azure' pixels against a 'white' background.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Color Filtering

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - Contains various colored objects/pixels.
  - Contains 'azure' (8) colored pixels.

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only 'white' (0) and 'azure' (8) pixels.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Isolate 'azure' pixels.
  - Process: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - Condition: Check if the pixel color is 'azure' (8).
  - Action_True: If the pixel is 'azure', copy its color (8) to the corresponding position in the output grid.
  - Action_False: If the pixel is not 'azure', set the corresponding position in the output grid to 'white' (0).

Relationships:
  - The position of 'azure' pixels is preserved from input to output.
  - All non-'azure' pixels in the input map to 'white' pixels in the output.
  - The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical for each example pair.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same height and width as the input grid, filling it entirely with 'white' pixels (color 0).
2.  Examine each pixel in the input grid, row by row, column by column.
3.  For each pixel, check if its color is 'azure' (color 8).
4.  If the input pixel's color is 'azure', update the pixel at the corresponding position (same row and column) in the output grid to 'azure' (color 8).
5.  If the input pixel's color is not 'azure', leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid as 'white' (color 0).
6.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, the resulting output grid is the final result.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial hypothesis, that the transformation simply filters for azure (8) pixels, was incorrect. The provided code `code_00.py` implemented this simple filter, and the results show significant discrepancies (`Pixels Off` > 0, `Match: False`) between the transformed output and the expected output for all training examples.

The key observation from comparing the inputs and expected outputs is that the output grid contains *only a subset* of the azure pixels present in the input grid. The azure pixels that *are* retained in the output always form a single contiguous object (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals). This suggests the transformation involves:

1.  Identifying all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input.
2.  Applying a selection criterion to choose *one* of these objects (or potentially none if no azure pixels exist).
3.  Creating the output grid containing only the pixels of the selected object against a white background.

The most plausible selection criterion, based on visual inspection of the examples, is to select the *largest* contiguous object (the one containing the most azure pixels).

**Strategy:**

1.  Implement an algorithm (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to find all connected components (objects) of azure pixels in the input grid. Consider 8-way adjacency.
2.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified azure object.
3.  Find the object with the maximum size. If there are multiple objects with the same maximum size, the examples provided don't explicitly cover this tie-breaking scenario, but typically the first one found or one based on position might be chosen (we'll assume for now there's a unique largest or any largest will do).
4.  Construct the output grid by placing the pixels of the largest identified azure object onto a white background grid of the same dimensions.

**Metrics Gathering**

To verify the "largest component" hypothesis, let's find the connected components of azure pixels and their sizes for each training example.

**Revised Assessment:**

The metrics gathered using the connected components algorithm show that my refined hypothesis (keep *only* the single largest azure component) is also **incorrect**.

*   **Example 1:** Input has one azure component of size 15. Expected output has 12 azure pixels.
*   **Example 2:** Input has one azure component of size 26. Expected output has 19 azure pixels.
*   **Example 3:** Input has one azure component of size 17. Expected output has 8 azure pixels.

In all cases, the input grid contains only *one* contiguous object of azure pixels (using 8-way connectivity). The output grid retains a *subset* of the pixels from this single input object.

**New Hypothesis Generation:**

What kind of subset could it be?

1.  **Filtering based on local neighborhood:** Maybe only azure pixels with a certain number/configuration of azure neighbors are kept?
    *   Let's check Example 1 Output: Some retained azure pixels have only 1 azure neighbor (e.g., top-left of the 2x1 vertical bar), some have 2, some have 3, some have 4, etc. This doesn't seem consistent.
2.  **Filtering based on position:** Maybe only pixels within a certain subgrid or bounding box? No, the shapes are irregular.
3.  **Removing specific patterns:** Perhaps certain local patterns of azure pixels are removed?
    *   Look at Example 1 Input vs Output:
        *   Input row 3: `8 8` -> Output row 3: `0 0` (pixels removed)
        *   Input row 4: `8` -> Output row 4: `0` (pixel removed)
        *   Input row 5: `8` -> Output row 5: `8` (pixel kept)
        *   Input row 6: `8` -> Output row 6: `8` (pixel kept)
        *   Input row 7: `8 8 8` -> Output row 7: `8 8 8` (pixels kept)
        *   Input row 8: `8` -> Output row 8: `8` (pixel kept)
        *   Input row 9: `8 8` -> Output row 9: `8 8` (pixels kept)
        *   Input row 10: `8 8 8 8` -> Output row 10: `8 8 8 8` (pixels kept)
    *   The pixels removed in Ex1 are `(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)`.
    *   Let's examine the 3x3 neighborhood of these removed pixels in the *input*.
    *   Pixel (3, 2): Color 8. Neighbors: (3,3)=8, (4,3)=8. Others are non-8. Has 2 azure neighbors (diagonal included).
    *   Pixel (3, 3): Color 8. Neighbors: (3,2)=8, (4,3)=8. Others are non-8. Has 2 azure neighbors.
    *   Pixel (4, 3): Color 8. Neighbors: (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8, (5,3)=8. Others non-8. Has 3 azure neighbors.
    *   Now check some *kept* pixels in Ex1:
    *   Pixel (5, 3): Color 8. Neighbors: (4,3)=8, (6,3)=8, (7,3)=8. Has 3 azure neighbors. Kept.
    *   Pixel (7, 3): Color 8. Neighbors: (6,3)=8, (5,3)=8, (7,4)=8, (7,5)=8, (8,5)=8. Has 5 azure neighbors. Kept.
    *   Pixel (10, 6): Color 8. Neighbors: (9,5)=8, (9,6)=8, (10,5)=4, (10,7)=8, (10,8)=8. Has 4 azure neighbors. Kept.

4.  **Noise Removal / Skeletonization / Filtering Small Features:** The process seems to remove "thin" or "protruding" parts of the azure object. The pixels removed in Example 1 (`(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)`) form a sort of small L-shape attached to the main body.
    *   Consider a 2x2 block rule. If an azure pixel is part of a 2x2 block of azure pixels, is it always kept?
        *   In Ex1: Input pixels (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4 is 7) - no 2x2 block here involving (7,4).
        *   Input pixels (9,5), (9,6), (10,5 is 4), (10,6) - no 2x2 block involving (9,6).
        *   Input pixels (9,6), (9,7 is 4), (10,6), (10,7) - no 2x2 block involving (9,6).
        *   Input pixels (10,6), (10,7), (11,6 is 8), (11,7 is 8) - Forms a 2x2 block. Pixels (10,6), (10,7) are kept. Let's recheck coords. Input grid is 11 rows (0-10), 13 cols (0-12). Ah, `input_1[10,6]` is 8, `input_1[10,7]` is 8, `input_1[10,8]` is 8, `input_1[10,9]` is 8.
        *   Consider the 2x2 block at input `(9,5), (9,6), (10,5), (10,6)`. Colors are `(8, 8, 8, 8)`. All four pixels are azure. These correspond to output pixels `(9,5), (9,6), (10,5), (10,6)` which are `(8, 8, 0, 8)`. Wait, my coords are off?
        *   Let's re-align Input/Output 1:
            Input:
            
```
            ...
            (7) 0 7 7 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 7 7 0  -> Output: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            (8) 0 7 7 7 7 8 7 7 7 7 7 7 0  -> Output: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            (9) 0 4 4 4 4 8 8 4 4 4 4 4 0  -> Output: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
            (10)0 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 4 4 0  -> Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0
            ```

            Input pixel `(9,5)` (value 8) maps to Output `(9,5)` (value 8). Input `(9,6)` (value 8) maps to Output `(9,6)` (value 8). Input `(10,6)` (value 8) maps to Output `(10,6)` (value 8). Input `(10,7)` (value 8) maps to Output `(10,7)` (value 8). Input `(10,8)` (value 8) maps to Output `(10,8)` (value 8). Input `(10,9)` (value 8) maps to Output `(10,9)` (value 8).

            Consider the 2x2 block of input 8s at `(9,5), (9,6), (10,5), (10,6)`. Input `(10,5)` is color 4, not 8. So no 2x2 block there.
            Consider the 2x2 block of input 8s at `(10,6), (10,7), (?, ?)` - Need row 11, doesn't exist.
            Consider the 2x2 block of input 8s at `(7,4), (7,5), (8,4), (8,5)`. Input `(8,4)` is 7. No.
            Consider the 2x2 block of input 8s at `(9,6), (9,7 is 4), (10,6), (10,7)`. No.

            Let's test the 2x2 hypothesis more directly: An azure pixel is kept if and only if it is part of at least one 2x2 block composed entirely of azure pixels in the input grid.

            *   **Example 1:**
                *   Removed pixels: `(3,2), (3,3), (4,3)`.
                    *   `(3,2)`: Needs `(3,3)`, `(4,2)`, `(4,3)` to be 8. Input `(4,2)` is 3. Fails.
                    *   `(3,3)`: Needs `(3,2)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)` to be 8. Input `(4,4)` is 3. Fails. Needs `(3,4)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)` to be 8. Input `(3,4)` is 3. Fails.
                    *   `(4,3)`: Needs `(3,3)`, `(4,4)`, `(3,4)` to be 8. Input `(4,4)` is 3. Fails. Needs `(4,2)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)` to be 8. Input `(4,2)` is 3. Fails. Needs `(4,4)`, `(5,4)`, `(5,3)` to be 8. Input `(4,4)` is 3. Fails.
                *   Kept pixels (sample): `(5,3)`
                    *   Needs `(5,4)`, `(6,4)`, `(6,3)` to be 8. Input `(5,4)` is 6. Fails. Needs `(4,3)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,4)` to be 8. Input `(4,4)` is 3. Fails. Needs `(4,2)`, `(5,2)`, `(4,3)` to be 8. Input `(4,2)` is 3. Fails. Needs `(5,2)`, `(6,2)`, `(6,3)` to be 8. Input `(5,2)` is 6. Fails.
                *   My check or hypothesis seems wrong. Pixel `(5,3)` is kept, but doesn't seem to be part of any 2x2 azure block. Let me re-read the problem... Maybe I'm missing something simple.

            *Rethink*: The output looks like the "core" or "solid part" of the input azure shape. Thin lines or single-pixel protrusions seem to be removed. The 2x2 block idea feels close.

            What if we check the four possible 2x2 squares that a pixel `(r, c)` can be the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner of? An azure pixel `(r, c)` is kept if it participates in *any* 2x2 square composed entirely of azure pixels.

            Let's re-test pixel `(5,3)` (kept) in Ex1:
            1.  Is `(5,3)` top-left? Check `(5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)`. Input colors: `8, 6, 8, 6`. No.
            2.  Is `(5,3)` top-right? Check `(5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3)`. Input colors: `6, 8, 6, 8`. No.
            3.  Is `(5,3)` bottom-left? Check `(4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4)`. Input colors: `8, 3, 8, 6`. No.
            4.  Is `(5,3)` bottom-right? Check `(4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)`. Input colors: `3, 8, 6, 8`. No.

            This hypothesis is also **wrong**. Pixel `(5,3)` is kept, but does not participate in any 2x2 azure block.

            Let's re-examine the removed pixels in Ex1: `(3,2), (3,3), (4,3)`. They form a 3-pixel L-shape.
            Examine removed pixels in Ex2 (comparing input azure shape and output azure shape): It seems more complex, but again, "thinner" parts are removed.
            Examine removed pixels in Ex3: Input pixels `(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (9,6)` are azure but not in output. Again, these seem to be parts of the shape that are only 1 pixel thick locally.

            **Final Hypothesis:** An azure pixel is kept if and only if it has at least two orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors that are also azure.

            Let's test this hypothesis:
            *   **Ex1, Removed Pixel (3,2):** Orthogonal neighbors: `(2,2)=0`, `(4,2)=3`, `(3,1)=3`, `(3,3)=8`. Only one orthogonal azure neighbor (`(3,3)`). Hypothesis says REMOVE. Matches.
            *   **Ex1, Removed Pixel (3,3):** Orthogonal neighbors: `(2,3)=0`, `(4,3)=8`, `(3,2)=8`, `(3,4)=3`. Two orthogonal azure neighbors (`(4,3)`, `(3,2)`). Hypothesis says KEEP. **Mismatch.** Output removes it.

            Hypothesis failed. This is trickier. Back to the 2x2 idea. What if the rule applies iteratively? Or maybe it's about 3x3 blocks?

            **Alternative 2x2 Hypothesis:** Keep an azure pixel `(r, c)` if the 2x2 block starting at `(r, c)` (i.e., `(r,c), (r+1,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c+1)`) consists entirely of azure pixels.

            *   **Ex1, Pixel (7,4):** Value 8. Kept. Block: `(7,4)=8, (8,4)=7, (7,5)=8, (8,5)=8`. Not all 8. Fails check.
            *   **Ex1, Pixel (10,8):** Value 8. Kept. Block: `(10,8)=8, (11,8)=?, (10,9)=8, (11,9)=?`. Need row 11. Can't check fully. Let's check one fully inside.
            *   **Ex1, Pixel (7,5):** Value 8. Kept. Block: `(7,5)=8, (8,5)=8, (7,6)=7, (8,6)=7`. Not all 8. Fails check.

            This simpler 2x2 rule also fails.

            **Let's reconsider the task visually.** The output shape looks like a "thickened" or "core" version of the input azure shape. This often relates to morphological operations like erosion/dilation in image processing. However, ARC tasks usually rely on simpler grid logic.

            What if it's about the number of *non-azure* neighbors?
            What if it's related to the input colors *surrounding* the azure object? (No, other colors change arbitrarily between examples).

            Could it be finding the azure object and then filling its bounding box? No, the output shape isn't rectangular.

            **Let's re-examine the successful 2x2 check:**
            Input `(10,6), (10,7), (11,6), (11,7)` - wait, grid indices are 0-based. Max row index is 10.
            Input grid:
            
```
            (9) ... 8 8 ...
            (10)... 4 8 8 8 8 ...
            ```

            Consider the 2x2 block formed by `(9,5), (9,6), (10,5), (10,6)`. Input values: `8, 8, 4, 8`. Not all 8.
            Consider the 2x2 block formed by `(9,6), (9,7), (10,6), (10,7)`. Input values: `8, 4, 8, 8`. Not all 8.

            There are **NO** 2x2 blocks of all azure pixels in input 1. Yet, many azure pixels are kept. The 2x2 block hypothesis in any form tested seems fundamentally flawed.

            **What else changes?** The background becomes white. All non-azure colors are removed. Only some azure pixels are kept. The kept azure pixels form a single connected component in the output. This output component is a sub-component of the single input azure component.

            **Possibility: Recursive Trimming**
            Maybe pixels are removed iteratively? Like, remove all azure pixels with less than N (maybe 3 or 4?) azure neighbors (8-way), repeat until no more pixels can be removed?
            Let's try N=4 neighbors for removal (keep if >= 4 neighbors).
            *   **Ex1 Input:**
                *   (3,2): Neighbors (3,3)=8, (4,3)=8. Total 2 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   (3,3): Neighbors (3,2)=8, (4,3)=8. Total 2 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   (4,3): Neighbors (3,2)=8, (3,3)=8, (5,3)=8. Total 3 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   (5,3): Neighbors (4,3)=8, (6,3)=8, (7,3)=8. Total 3 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   (6,3): Neighbors (5,3)=8, (7,3)=8, (7,4)=8. Total 3 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   (7,3): Neighbors (5,3)=8, (6,3)=8, (7,4)=8, (7,5)=8, (8,5)=8. Total 5 azure neighbors. Keep.
                *   (7,4): Neighbors (6,3)=8, (7,3)=8, (8,4)=7, (8,5)=8, (7,5)=8. Total 4 azure neighbors. Keep.
                *   (7,5): Neighbors (7,3)=8, (7,4)=8, (8,5)=8. Total 3 azure neighbors. Remove.
                *   ... This seems closer ... let's apply this rule (keep if >= 4 azure neighbors, including diagonals) once.

**Revised Assessment 2:**

The hypothesis based on keeping azure pixels with >= 4 azure neighbors (8-way connectivity) is also **incorrect**. The resulting grids do not match the expected outputs. The number of pixels kept is much lower than expected.

Let's try a lower threshold. Keep if >= 3 azure neighbors?

**Final Assessment:**

Simple filtering failed. Keeping the largest component failed. Filtering based on a single pass of neighbor counts (>=4 or >=3, using 8-way adjacency) also failed.

The transformation must be different. Let's reconsider the relationship between input and output azure pixels.

*   All output azure pixels were azure in the input.
*   The output azure pixels form a single connected component.
*   This output component is a subset of the single input azure component.

Could it be related to *internal* vs *external* pixels of the azure shape? Or perhaps removing pixels that touch non-azure colors?

Let's try: Keep an azure pixel `(r, c)` if *all* of its 8 neighbors are also azure. This would be like strong erosion.
*   Ex1: Pixel (7,4). Neighbors include (8,4)=7. Removed.
*   Ex1: Pixel (10,8). Neighbors include (10,9)=8, (9,8)=4, (11,8)=?. Maybe (10,7)=8, (9,7)=4, (11,7)=?. (10,7) is 8. (9,8) is 4. Removed.
This removes far too many pixels.

**Hypothesis: Keep pixels that are part of a 2x2 azure square**
I discarded this earlier, but let me re-read my analysis. My check for pixel (5,3) in Ex1 seemed to show it wasn't part of *any* 2x2 block, yet it was kept. Let me re-verify the neighbors of (5,3). Input:
Row 4: `... 3 8 3 ...`
Row 5: `... 6 8 6 ...`
Row 6: `... 6 8 6 ...`
Pixel `(5,3)` is 8.
1. Top-Left? Needs `(5,4), (6,3), (6,4)` to be 8. Input: `6, 8, 6`. No.
2. Top-Right? Needs `(5,2), (6,2), (6,3)` to be 8. Input: `6, 6, 8`. No.
3. Bottom-Left? Needs `(4,3), (4,4), (5,4)` to be 8. Input: `8, 3, 6`. No.
4. Bottom-Right? Needs `(4,2), (4,3), (5,2)` to be 8. Input: `3, 8, 6`. No.

Okay, the simple 2x2 rule is definitively wrong unless my coordinate understanding or neighbor check is flawed.

Let's assume the rule is correct and *my check* was wrong. Which pixels *are* part of a 2x2 azure square in Input 1?
*   `(7,4)`: No (neighbor (8,4)=7)
*   `(7,5)`: No (neighbor (7,6)=7)
*   `(8,5)`: Neighbors are `(7,4)=8, (7,5)=8, (7,6)=7, (8,4)=7, (8,6)=7, (9,4)=4, (9,5)=8, (9,6)=8`.
    *   Check if `(8,5)` is part of 2x2:
        *   TL at (8,5): Needs `(8,6)=7`, `(9,5)=8`, `(9,6)=8`. No.
        *   TR at (8,5): Needs `(8,4)=7`, `(9,4)=4`, `(9,5)=8`. No.
        *   BL at (8,5): Needs `(7,5)=8`, `(7,6)=7`, `(8,6)=7`. No.
        *   BR at (8,5): Needs `(7,4)=8`, `(7,5)=8`, `(8,4)=7`. No.
*   `(9,5)`: Neighbors `(8,4)=7, (8,5)=8, (8,6)=7, (9,4)=4, (9,6)=8, (10,4)=4, (10,5)=4, (10,6)=8`.
    *   Check if `(9,5)` is part of 2x2:
        *   TL at (9,5): Needs `(9,6)=8, (10,5)=4, (10,6)=8`. No.
        *   TR at (9,5): Needs `(9,4)=4, (10,4)=4, (10,5)=4`. No.
        *   BL at (9,5): Needs `(8,5)=8, (8,6)=7, (9,6)=8`. No.
        *   BR at (9,5): Needs `(8,4)=7, (8,5)=8, (9,4)=4`. No.
*   `(9,6)`: Neighbors `(8,5)=8, (8,6)=7, (8,7)=7, (9,5)=8, (9,7)=4, (10,5)=4, (10,6)=8, (10,7)=8`.
    *   Check if `(9,6)` is part of 2x2:
        *   TL at (9,6): Needs `(9,7)=4, (10,6)=8, (10,7)=8`. No.
        *   TR at (9,6): Needs `(9,5)=8, (10,5)=4, (10,6)=8`. No.
        *   BL at (9,6): Needs `(8,6)=7, (8,7)=7, (9,7)=4`. No.
        *   BR at (9,6): Needs `(8,5)=8, (8,6)=7, (9,5)=8`. No.
*   `(10,6)`: Neighbors `(9,5)=8, (9,6)=8, (9,7)=4, (10,5)=4, (10,7)=8, (?,?), (?,?), (?,?)`.
    *   Check if `(10,6)` is part of 2x2:
        *   BL at (10,6): Needs `(9,6)=8, (9,7)=4, (10,7)=8`. No.
        *   BR at (10,6): Needs `(9,5)=8, (9,6)=8, (10,5)=4`. No.

It appears **NO** azure pixel in Input 1 participates in a 2x2 square of only azure pixels. Yet, the output contains many azure pixels.

**Conclusion:** The transformation rule is not based on identifying the largest component, nor on simple neighbor counts, nor on participation in 2x2 azure blocks. The logic must be different. Given the consistent removal of "thin" parts, it might be a more complex shape analysis or perhaps related to distance from the "edge" of the azure shape. However, without further insight or examples, precisely defining this is difficult. The most robust observation remains: identify the single connected azure object in the input and remove some of its pixels based on an unknown local geometric property, leaving a "thicker" core.

Let's stick to the description that seems most accurate, even if the exact mechanism for *which* pixels are removed is unclear: identify the single azure component and somehow "filter" or "erode" it. The most likely filter seems related to local density or thickness.

```yaml
Task: Azure Object Core Extraction

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - Contains various colored pixels.
  - Contains azure (8) pixels, typically forming a single connected object (using 8-way adjacency).

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - The azure pixels form a single connected object (subset of the input azure object).

Transformation:
  - Find the single connected component (object) made of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. (Assumption: Input examples only show one such object).
  - Apply a filtering process to this object to remove certain pixels, primarily those in "thin" sections or protrusions.
  - The exact rule for removal is not definitively identified but appears related to local pixel density or geometry (e.g., pixels not part of locally "thick" structures are removed). Standard neighbor counts (>=3, >=4) or 2x2 block participation do not fully explain the results.
  - Create an output grid initialized to white (0).
  - Place the azure (8) pixels that *remain* after the filtering process onto the output grid at their original coordinates.

Relationships:
  - The output azure shape is a sub-shape of the input azure shape.
  - Output azure pixels maintain their original relative positions.
  - All non-azure input pixels become white (0) in the output.
  - Pixels removed from the input azure object also become white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color azure (8).
3.  *(Filtering Step - Precise rule unclear)* Analyze the spatial arrangement of the input azure pixels. Select a subset of these azure pixels based on a local geometric property that preserves the "core" or "thicker" parts of the shape and removes pixels from "thin" areas (e.g., parts less than 2 pixels thick, or pixels with fewer than a certain number/configuration of azure neighbors - although simple thresholds tested were incorrect).
4.  For each input azure pixel that is selected by the filtering rule in step 3, set the color of the corresponding pixel (same row and column) in the output grid to azure (8).
5.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid as white (0).
6.  Return the output grid.
