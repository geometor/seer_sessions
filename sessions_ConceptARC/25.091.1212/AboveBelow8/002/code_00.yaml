Task: Azure Object Core Extraction

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - Contains various colored pixels.
  - Contains azure (8) pixels, typically forming a single connected object (using 8-way adjacency).

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - The azure pixels form a single connected object (subset of the input azure object).

Transformation:
  - Find the single connected component (object) made of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. (Assumption: Input examples only show one such object).
  - Apply a filtering process to this object to remove certain pixels, primarily those in "thin" sections or protrusions.
  - The exact rule for removal is not definitively identified but appears related to local pixel density or geometry (e.g., pixels not part of locally "thick" structures are removed). Standard neighbor counts (>=3, >=4) or 2x2 block participation do not fully explain the results.
  - Create an output grid initialized to white (0).
  - Place the azure (8) pixels that *remain* after the filtering process onto the output grid at their original coordinates.

Relationships:
  - The output azure shape is a sub-shape of the input azure shape.
  - Output azure pixels maintain their original relative positions.
  - All non-azure input pixels become white (0) in the output.
  - Pixels removed from the input azure object also become white (0).
