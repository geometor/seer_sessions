Observing the input-output pairs reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid retains only the pixels that were 'azure' (color 8) in the input grid, keeping them in their original positions. All other pixels in the input grid, regardless of their original color (including 'white' or color 0), are replaced with 'white' (color 0) in the output grid. The transformation acts as a color filter, specifically isolating the 'azure' pixels against a 'white' background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If the input pixel's color is 'azure', update the pixel at the corresponding position (same row and column) in the output grid to 'azure' (color 8).\n5.
