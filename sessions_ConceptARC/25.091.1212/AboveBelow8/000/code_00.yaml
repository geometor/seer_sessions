Task: Color Filtering

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - Contains various colored objects/pixels.
  - Contains 'azure' (8) colored pixels.

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only 'white' (0) and 'azure' (8) pixels.

Transformation:
  - Rule: Isolate 'azure' pixels.
  - Process: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - Condition: Check if the pixel color is 'azure' (8).
  - Action_True: If the pixel is 'azure', copy its color (8) to the corresponding position in the output grid.
  - Action_False: If the pixel is not 'azure', set the corresponding position in the output grid to 'white' (0).

Relationships:
  - The position of 'azure' pixels is preserved from input to output.
  - All non-'azure' pixels in the input map to 'white' pixels in the output.
  - The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical for each example pair.
