Input_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Background
        Color: white (0)
        Extent: Most of the grid
      - Type: Line
        Color: Non-white (yellow/4 or green/3)
        Shape: Diagonal (contiguous pixels)
        Properties:
          - Single color
          - Single contiguous line object
          - Direction: Down-right or Down-left
Output_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Type: Background
        Color: white (0)
        Extent: Varies, potentially none in some rows/columns
      - Type: Filled_Region
        Color: Same as the input Line color
        Shape: Derived from the input Line
        Formation_Rule: Dependent on the input Line's direction
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Identify: The single non-white color (C) in the input.
  - Identify: The positions (row, col) of all pixels with color C.
  - Determine: The direction of the diagonal line formed by pixels of color C.
    - If pixels follow (r, c), (r+1, c+1), ... -> Direction is Down-right.
    - If pixels follow (r, c), (r+1, c-1), ... -> Direction is Down-left.
  - Action (Conditional Fill):
    - IF Direction is Down-right:
        For each input pixel of color C at (r, c):
          Fill output grid row 'r' from column 0 to column 'c' (inclusive) with color C.
    - IF Direction is Down-left:
        For each input pixel of color C at (r, c):
          Fill output grid row 'r' from column 'c' to the last column (inclusive) with color C.
        Identify the maximum row index 'max_r' containing an input pixel of color C.
        Fill all output grid rows from 'max_r + 1' to the bottom row completely with color C.
  - State_Preservation: Pixels not explicitly changed retain their original color (which is white/0 in the background areas not affected by filling).
