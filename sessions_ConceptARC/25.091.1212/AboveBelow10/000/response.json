            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Both input examples feature a grid primarily composed of the background color (white, 0). Within this background, there is a single, contiguous diagonal line formed by pixels of a single non-background color (yellow/4 in the first, green/3 in the second).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original diagonal line pixels. Additionally, areas adjacent to these diagonal pixels are filled with the same color. The pattern of filling differs between the two examples.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern 1 (Example 1):** The diagonal line goes from the top-left towards the bottom-right. For each pixel on this line, all pixels in the *same row* to its *left* (including the original pixel's column) are changed to the line's color. This creates a filled right-angled triangle shape.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern 2 (Example 2):** The diagonal line goes from the top-right towards the bottom-left. For each pixel on this line, all pixels in the *same row* to its *right* (including the original pixel's column) are changed to the line's color. Furthermore, all rows *below* the last row containing an original diagonal pixel are completely filled with the line's color.\n5.  **Key Difference:** The primary difference seems linked to the direction of the input diagonal line. A down-right diagonal triggers a \"fill-left\" operation within rows. A down-left diagonal triggers a \"fill-right\" operation within rows *and* a \"fill-below\" operation for subsequent rows.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
