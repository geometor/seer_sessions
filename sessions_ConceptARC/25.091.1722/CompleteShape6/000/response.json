            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided example pair to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Composition:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct \"objects\". Each object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color (e.g., blue, green, yellow, magenta).\n2.  **Object Shapes:** The objects in the examples have irregular shapes (L-shapes, lines, other clusters).\n3.  **Output Grid Composition:** The output grids also contain a white background and colored objects.\n4.  **Transformation Effect:** Comparing input and output grids, the original colored pixels seem to remain in place, but the area they occupy expands. The expansion appears to form solid rectangles.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** The expansion seems related to the minimum and maximum row and column coordinates of each distinct colored object in the input. The output grid fills the rectangular area defined by these coordinates (the bounding box) with the object's color.\n6.  **Multiple Objects:** When multiple objects are present (like in `train_1` with blue and green, and `train_2` with yellow and magenta), each object independently has its bounding box calculated and filled with its color in the output. The bounding boxes in the examples do not overlap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or as a new grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color (white, 0). The examples suggest starting fresh or overwriting completely might be simpler. Let's assume we start with a white grid.\n2.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.\n3.  For each unique non-white color:\n    a.  Find all pixels in the input grid that have this color.\n    b.  Determine the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index among these pixels. This defines the bounding box for the object(s) of this color.\n    c.  Iterate through all cells within this bounding box (from minimum row to maximum row, and minimum column to maximum column, inclusive).\n    d.  Set the color of each cell within the bounding box in the output grid to the current unique non-white color. If multiple bounding boxes cover the same cell, the color applied last (depending on the order of color processing) will be the final color for that cell. (The examples do not show overlapping bounding boxes, so the order might not matter or could follow color index order, e.g., blue before green).\n4.  Return the final output grid."
