"""
Transforms colored objects in the input grid based on specific rules:
1. Identifies all distinct connected objects (contiguous groups of same-colored pixels), excluding the background color (white, 0).
2. Ignores any objects colored gray (5).
3. For every other non-background, non-gray object:
    a. Calculates the bounding box of the object.
    b. Determines the top-left corner of this bounding box.
    c. Draws a 3x3 square of the object's original color onto the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner.
4. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is initialized with the background color (white, 0). Gray objects from the input are effectively removed.
