Identifies all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0) and gray (5). These are 'target colors'.\n2. For each target color:\n    a. Finds all pixels in the input grid matching that color.\n    b. Calculates the top-left corner (minimum row, minimum column) of the bounding box containing *all* pixels of that color collectively.\n    c. Draws a single 3x3 square of that target color onto an initially white output grid, starting at the calculated overall top-left corner. If squares for different colors overlap, later colors (processed in numerical order) will overwrite earlier ones.\n3. Gray pixels (5) from the input are ignored and effectively removed in the output.\n4.
