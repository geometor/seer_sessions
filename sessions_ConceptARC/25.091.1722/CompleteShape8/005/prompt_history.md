**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in both examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background. Other colors present in the inputs are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and orange (7). Gray (5) is present in the input but *never* in the output. Yellow, magenta, and orange objects in the input correspond to objects of the *same* color in the output, but their shapes change.
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple discrete objects (contiguous blocks or scattered pixels of the same color, excluding white). The gray objects appear somewhat complex or scattered. The other colored objects vary in shape (e.g., 'T'-like, 'L'-like, dots, bars).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   Gray objects are consistently removed (replaced with the white background).
    *   All other non-white colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange in the examples) are transformed into solid 3x3 squares of their original color.
    *   The position of the output 3x3 square seems determined by the original object's position. Specifically, the top-left corner of the 3x3 square in the output corresponds to the top-left corner of the *bounding box* of the original object in the input.
5.  **Overlap:** In the provided examples, the resulting 3x3 squares in the output do not overlap.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform colored objects into 3x3 squares based on their bounding box, ignoring gray objects.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: white (0)

object_types:
  - type: target_object
    description: Non-white (0), non-gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., yellow, magenta, orange).
      - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the object's pixels.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all the object's pixels.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) coordinate.
          - height: max_row - min_row + 1
          - width: max_col - min_col + 1
    transformation: Replaced by a 3x3 square of the same color in the output. The square's top-left corner aligns with the original object's bounding box top-left corner.
  - type: ignored_object
    description: Gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    transformation: Removed entirely in the output, replaced by the background color (white).
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels.
    transformation: Remains white, unless overwritten by a transformed object's 3x3 square.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - filter_objects: Separate objects into 'target_objects' (non-gray) and 'ignored_objects' (gray).
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each target_object, determine its bounding box and identify the top-left corner coordinates.
  - generate_output_square: For each target_object, create a 3x3 square of its color.
  - place_output_square: Position the generated 3x3 square onto an initially white output grid, using the calculated top-left corner as the anchor point.

relationships:
  - Each target_object in the input maps to exactly one 3x3 square of the same color in the output.
  - The position of the output square is determined by the top-left coordinate of the input object's bounding box.
  - Ignored_objects (gray) have no corresponding object in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct objects (connected groups of same-colored pixels) in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check the color of the object.
    b.  If the object's color is gray (5), ignore it and proceed to the next object.
    c.  If the object's color is *not* gray (5):
        i.  Determine the bounding box of the object. Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the object's pixels.
        ii. The top-left corner of the bounding box is (`min_row`, `min_col`).
        iii. In the output grid, fill a 3x3 area starting at the coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the object's original color. This means coloring the pixels from (`min_row`, `min_col`) to (`min_row + 2`, `min_col + 2`).
4.  Return the final output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms colored objects in the input grid based on specific rules:
1. Identifies all distinct connected objects (contiguous groups of same-colored pixels), excluding the background color (white, 0).
2. Ignores any objects colored gray (5).
3. For every other non-background, non-gray object:
    a. Calculates the bounding box of the object.
    b. Determines the top-left corner of this bounding box.
    c. Draws a 3x3 square of the object's original color onto the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner.
4. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is initialized with the background color (white, 0). Gray objects from the input are effectively removed.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code successfully transformed the first example but failed on the second. The failure in the second example stems from how objects of the same color were handled. The previous logic determined the bounding box based on *all* pixels of a given color, regardless of whether they formed separate connected components. This resulted in a single large bounding box for the orange (7) pixels and a single bounding box for the magenta (6) pixels, leading to only one 3x3 square being drawn for each color, covering the extent of all pixels of that color.

The expected output for the second example clearly shows *multiple* 3x3 squares for colors where the input had distinct, separate groups of pixels of that color (two orange squares, two magenta squares).

The strategy is to revise the process to first identify individual *connected components* (objects) for each non-background, non-gray color. Then, for each distinct object identified, calculate its specific bounding box and draw the corresponding 3x3 square based on that object's top-left corner. Gray objects (5) remain ignored.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-examine Example 2's input and expected output, focusing on object identification.

**Example 2 Input Analysis:**

*   **Orange (7):**
    *   Object 1: Pixel at (2, 1)
    *   Object 2: Pixel at (3, 2)
*   **Magenta (6):**
    *   Object 1: Pixel at (4, 6)
    *   Object 2: Pixels at (6, 4)
*   **Gray (5):** Multiple scattered pixels, ignored.

**Assessment and Strategy (Revised):**

My apologies, the code execution results show that neither the simple per-object bounding box rule nor the overlap rule correctly reproduces the expected outputs for *both* examples. The initial code actually produced the *correct* output for Example 1 but failed Example 2. The revised hypotheses failed Example 1 and still failed Example 2, just differently.

Let's re-examine the discrepancy and the initial code's logic. The initial code worked by finding *all* pixels of a given target color, calculating a single bounding box encompassing *all* those pixels, and then drawing one 3x3 square at the top-left of that *overall* bounding box.

*   **Example 1 Analysis (Initial Code Logic):**
    *   Yellow (4): Pixels at (1,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Overall BBox top-left: (1, 3). Output: 3x3 yellow at (1,3). -> Matches expected.
    *   Magenta (6): Pixels at (6,4), (6,5), (8,6). Overall BBox top-left: (6, 4). Output: 3x3 magenta at (6,4). -> Matches expected.
    *   Gray (5): Ignored. -> Matches expected.
    *   Result: Initial code logic works for Example 1.

*   **Example 2 Analysis (Initial Code Logic):**
    *   Orange (7): Pixels at (2,1), (3,2). Overall BBox top-left: (2, 1). Output: 3x3 orange at (2,1). -> Does *not* match expected (expected has two squares).
    *   Magenta (6): Pixels at (4,6), (6,4). Overall BBox top-left: (4, 4). Output: 3x3 magenta at (4,4). -> Does *not* match expected (expected has squares starting at (4,6) and (6,4) partially, plus one at (4,4)? This is confusing).
    *   Gray (5): Ignored. -> Matches expected.
    *   Result: Initial code logic fails for Example 2.

There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the rule based on the provided examples. The transformation in Example 1 appears simpler than in Example 2. Let's reconsider the core elements.

Could it be related to the *shape* or *type* of object?
*   Ex 1: Yellow objects are a single pixel and a horizontal bar. Magenta objects are a horizontal bar and a single pixel.
*   Ex 2: Orange objects are single pixels. Magenta objects are single pixels.

Let's re-run the object detection but check the bounding box sizes.
