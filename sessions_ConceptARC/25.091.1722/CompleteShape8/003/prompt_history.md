**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in both examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background. Other colors present in the inputs are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and orange (7). Gray (5) is present in the input but *never* in the output. Yellow, magenta, and orange objects in the input correspond to objects of the *same* color in the output, but their shapes change.
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple discrete objects (contiguous blocks or scattered pixels of the same color, excluding white). The gray objects appear somewhat complex or scattered. The other colored objects vary in shape (e.g., 'T'-like, 'L'-like, dots, bars).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   Gray objects are consistently removed (replaced with the white background).
    *   All other non-white colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange in the examples) are transformed into solid 3x3 squares of their original color.
    *   The position of the output 3x3 square seems determined by the original object's position. Specifically, the top-left corner of the 3x3 square in the output corresponds to the top-left corner of the *bounding box* of the original object in the input.
5.  **Overlap:** In the provided examples, the resulting 3x3 squares in the output do not overlap.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform colored objects into 3x3 squares based on their bounding box, ignoring gray objects.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: white (0)

object_types:
  - type: target_object
    description: Non-white (0), non-gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., yellow, magenta, orange).
      - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the object's pixels.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all the object's pixels.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) coordinate.
          - height: max_row - min_row + 1
          - width: max_col - min_col + 1
    transformation: Replaced by a 3x3 square of the same color in the output. The square's top-left corner aligns with the original object's bounding box top-left corner.
  - type: ignored_object
    description: Gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    transformation: Removed entirely in the output, replaced by the background color (white).
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels.
    transformation: Remains white, unless overwritten by a transformed object's 3x3 square.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - filter_objects: Separate objects into 'target_objects' (non-gray) and 'ignored_objects' (gray).
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each target_object, determine its bounding box and identify the top-left corner coordinates.
  - generate_output_square: For each target_object, create a 3x3 square of its color.
  - place_output_square: Position the generated 3x3 square onto an initially white output grid, using the calculated top-left corner as the anchor point.

relationships:
  - Each target_object in the input maps to exactly one 3x3 square of the same color in the output.
  - The position of the output square is determined by the top-left coordinate of the input object's bounding box.
  - Ignored_objects (gray) have no corresponding object in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct objects (connected groups of same-colored pixels) in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check the color of the object.
    b.  If the object's color is gray (5), ignore it and proceed to the next object.
    c.  If the object's color is *not* gray (5):
        i.  Determine the bounding box of the object. Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the object's pixels.
        ii. The top-left corner of the bounding box is (`min_row`, `min_col`).
        iii. In the output grid, fill a 3x3 area starting at the coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the object's original color. This means coloring the pixels from (`min_row`, `min_col`) to (`min_row + 2`, `min_col + 2`).
4.  Return the final output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed because it treated each disconnected group of pixels of the same color as a separate object, calculated a bounding box for each, and drew a 3x3 square for each. This led to multiple overlapping squares for colors that appeared in disjoint locations in the input.

The correct strategy, deduced from comparing the failed output with the expected output across both examples, is to consider *all* pixels of a specific target color (i.e., non-white and non-gray) together as a single conceptual unit for the transformation. For each target color present in the input:
1. Identify all pixel coordinates containing that color.
2. Calculate the single bounding box that encompasses *all* pixels of that color.
3. Determine the top-left corner of this overall bounding box.
4. Draw a single 3x3 square of that color on the output grid, anchored at the calculated top-left corner.
5. Gray pixels (color 5) are ignored entirely and do not appear in the output.

This revised approach correctly handles cases where pixels of the same target color are separated in the input grid, producing only one 3x3 output square per color, positioned according to the overall extent of that color's pixels.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the bounding box calculations based on the revised strategy (grouping all pixels of a color).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Transform groups of colored pixels into single 3x3 squares based on their overall bounding box, ignoring gray pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids share the same height and width.
  - background_color: white (0)

object_types:
  - type: color_group
    description: All pixels of a specific color in the input grid, excluding white (0) and gray (5). Considered as a single unit for transformation.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the group (e.g., yellow, magenta, orange).
      - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of all pixels of this color.
      - overall_bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of this color group.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) coordinate encompassing all pixels of the color.
    transformation: Replaced by a single 3x3 square of the group's color in the output. The square's top-left corner aligns with the overall bounding box's top-left corner calculated from all pixels of that color.
  - type: ignored_color_group
    description: All gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
    transformation: Removed entirely in the output, replaced by the background color (white).
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels.
    transformation: Remains white, unless overwritten by a transformed color_group's 3x3 square.

actions:
  - identify_colors: Find all distinct colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
  - group_pixels_by_color: For each identified target color, collect all (row, col) coordinates where that color appears.
  - calculate_overall_bounding_box: For each color group, determine the bounding box encompassing all its pixels and identify the top-left corner coordinate (min_row, min_col).
  - generate_output_square: For each target color group, create a 3x3 square of its color.
  - place_output_square: Position the generated 3x3 square onto an initially white output grid, using the calculated overall top-left corner for that color group as the anchor point.

relationships:
  - Each target color (non-white, non-gray) present in the input maps to exactly one 3x3 square of that same color in the output.
  - The position of the output square for a given color is determined by the top-left coordinate of the bounding box containing *all* pixels of that color in the input.
  - Gray pixels (ignored_color_group) have no corresponding output; they are replaced by the background.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and gray (5). Let these be the 'target colors'.
3.  For each 'target color' identified:
    a.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels in the input grid that have this target color.
    b.  If no pixels of this color are found, continue to the next target color.
    c.  Determine the overall bounding box for these pixels: find the minimum row index (`min_row`) and minimum column index (`min_col`) among all found coordinates for this color.
    d.  In the output grid, fill a 3x3 area starting at the coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the current target color. Ensure that drawing stays within the grid boundaries (i.e., only color pixels from (`min_row`, `min_col`) up to (`min_row + 2`, `min_col + 2`) that are within the grid's height and width).
4.  Return the final output grid.
