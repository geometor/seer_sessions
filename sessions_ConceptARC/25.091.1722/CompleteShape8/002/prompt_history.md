**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in both examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background. Other colors present in the inputs are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and orange (7). Gray (5) is present in the input but *never* in the output. Yellow, magenta, and orange objects in the input correspond to objects of the *same* color in the output, but their shapes change.
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple discrete objects (contiguous blocks or scattered pixels of the same color, excluding white). The gray objects appear somewhat complex or scattered. The other colored objects vary in shape (e.g., 'T'-like, 'L'-like, dots, bars).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   Gray objects are consistently removed (replaced with the white background).
    *   All other non-white colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange in the examples) are transformed into solid 3x3 squares of their original color.
    *   The position of the output 3x3 square seems determined by the original object's position. Specifically, the top-left corner of the 3x3 square in the output corresponds to the top-left corner of the *bounding box* of the original object in the input.
5.  **Overlap:** In the provided examples, the resulting 3x3 squares in the output do not overlap.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform colored objects into 3x3 squares based on their bounding box, ignoring gray objects.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: white (0)

object_types:
  - type: target_object
    description: Non-white (0), non-gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., yellow, magenta, orange).
      - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the object's pixels.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all the object's pixels.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) coordinate.
          - height: max_row - min_row + 1
          - width: max_col - min_col + 1
    transformation: Replaced by a 3x3 square of the same color in the output. The square's top-left corner aligns with the original object's bounding box top-left corner.
  - type: ignored_object
    description: Gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    transformation: Removed entirely in the output, replaced by the background color (white).
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels.
    transformation: Remains white, unless overwritten by a transformed object's 3x3 square.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - filter_objects: Separate objects into 'target_objects' (non-gray) and 'ignored_objects' (gray).
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each target_object, determine its bounding box and identify the top-left corner coordinates.
  - generate_output_square: For each target_object, create a 3x3 square of its color.
  - place_output_square: Position the generated 3x3 square onto an initially white output grid, using the calculated top-left corner as the anchor point.

relationships:
  - Each target_object in the input maps to exactly one 3x3 square of the same color in the output.
  - The position of the output square is determined by the top-left coordinate of the input object's bounding box.
  - Ignored_objects (gray) have no corresponding object in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct objects (connected groups of same-colored pixels) in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check the color of the object.
    b.  If the object's color is gray (5), ignore it and proceed to the next object.
    c.  If the object's color is *not* gray (5):
        i.  Determine the bounding box of the object. Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the object's pixels.
        ii. The top-left corner of the bounding box is (`min_row`, `min_col`).
        iii. In the output grid, fill a 3x3 area starting at the coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the object's original color. This means coloring the pixels from (`min_row`, `min_col`) to (`min_row + 2`, `min_col + 2`).
4.  Return the final output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Transforms colored objects in the input grid based on specific rules:
1. Identifies all distinct connected objects (contiguous groups of same-colored pixels), excluding the background color (white, 0).
2. Ignores any objects colored gray (5).
3. For every other non-background, non-gray object:
    a. Calculates the bounding box of the object.
    b. Determines the top-left corner of this bounding box.
    c. Draws a 3x3 square of the object's original color onto the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner.
4. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and is initialized with the background color (white, 0). Gray objects from the input are effectively removed.
