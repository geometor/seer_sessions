            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code successfully transformed the first example but failed on the second. The failure in the second example stems from how objects of the same color were handled. The previous logic determined the bounding box based on *all* pixels of a given color, regardless of whether they formed separate connected components. This resulted in a single large bounding box for the orange (7) pixels and a single bounding box for the magenta (6) pixels, leading to only one 3x3 square being drawn for each color, covering the extent of all pixels of that color.\n\nThe expected output for the second example clearly shows *multiple* 3x3 squares for colors where the input had distinct, separate groups of pixels of that color (two orange squares, two magenta squares).\n\nThe strategy is to revise the process to first identify individual *connected components* (objects) for each non-background, non-gray color. Then, for each distinct object identified, calculate its specific bounding box and draw the corresponding 3x3 square based on that object's top-left corner. Gray objects (5) remain ignored.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-examine Example 2's input and expected output, focusing on object identification.\n\n**Example 2 Input Analysis:**\n\n*   **Orange (7):**\n    *   Object 1: Pixel at (2, 1)\n    *   Object 2: Pixel at (3, 2)\n*   **Magenta (6):**\n    *   Object 1: Pixel at (4, 6)\n    *   Object 2: Pixels at (6, 4)\n*   **Gray (5):** Multiple scattered pixels, ignored.\n\n"
