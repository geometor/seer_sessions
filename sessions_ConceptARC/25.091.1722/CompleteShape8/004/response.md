**Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code successfully transformed the first example but failed on the second. The failure in the second example stems from how objects of the same color were handled. The previous logic determined the bounding box based on *all* pixels of a given color, regardless of whether they formed separate connected components. This resulted in a single large bounding box for the orange (7) pixels and a single bounding box for the magenta (6) pixels, leading to only one 3x3 square being drawn for each color, covering the extent of all pixels of that color.

The expected output for the second example clearly shows *multiple* 3x3 squares for colors where the input had distinct, separate groups of pixels of that color (two orange squares, two magenta squares).

The strategy is to revise the process to first identify individual *connected components* (objects) for each non-background, non-gray color. Then, for each distinct object identified, calculate its specific bounding box and draw the corresponding 3x3 square based on that object's top-left corner. Gray objects (5) remain ignored.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-examine Example 2's input and expected output, focusing on object identification.

**Example 2 Input Analysis:**

*   **Orange (7):**
    *   Object 1: Pixel at (2, 1)
    *   Object 2: Pixel at (3, 2)
*   **Magenta (6):**
    *   Object 1: Pixel at (4, 6)
    *   Object 2: Pixels at (6, 4)
*   **Gray (5):** Multiple scattered pixels, ignored.

**Assessment and Strategy (Revised):**

My apologies, the code execution results show that neither the simple per-object bounding box rule nor the overlap rule correctly reproduces the expected outputs for *both* examples. The initial code actually produced the *correct* output for Example 1 but failed Example 2. The revised hypotheses failed Example 1 and still failed Example 2, just differently.

Let's re-examine the discrepancy and the initial code's logic. The initial code worked by finding *all* pixels of a given target color, calculating a single bounding box encompassing *all* those pixels, and then drawing one 3x3 square at the top-left of that *overall* bounding box.

*   **Example 1 Analysis (Initial Code Logic):**
    *   Yellow (4): Pixels at (1,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Overall BBox top-left: (1, 3). Output: 3x3 yellow at (1,3). -> Matches expected.
    *   Magenta (6): Pixels at (6,4), (6,5), (8,6). Overall BBox top-left: (6, 4). Output: 3x3 magenta at (6,4). -> Matches expected.
    *   Gray (5): Ignored. -> Matches expected.
    *   Result: Initial code logic works for Example 1.

*   **Example 2 Analysis (Initial Code Logic):**
    *   Orange (7): Pixels at (2,1), (3,2). Overall BBox top-left: (2, 1). Output: 3x3 orange at (2,1). -> Does *not* match expected (expected has two squares).
    *   Magenta (6): Pixels at (4,6), (6,4). Overall BBox top-left: (4, 4). Output: 3x3 magenta at (4,4). -> Does *not* match expected (expected has squares starting at (4,6) and (6,4) partially, plus one at (4,4)? This is confusing).
    *   Gray (5): Ignored. -> Matches expected.
    *   Result: Initial code logic fails for Example 2.

There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the rule based on the provided examples. The transformation in Example 1 appears simpler than in Example 2. Let's reconsider the core elements.

Could it be related to the *shape* or *type* of object?
*   Ex 1: Yellow objects are a single pixel and a horizontal bar. Magenta objects are a horizontal bar and a single pixel.
*   Ex 2: Orange objects are single pixels. Magenta objects are single pixels.

Let's re-run the object detection but check the bounding box sizes.
