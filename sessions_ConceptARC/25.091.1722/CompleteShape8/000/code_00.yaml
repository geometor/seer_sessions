task_description: Transform colored objects into 3x3 squares based on their bounding box, ignoring gray objects.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: white (0)

object_types:
  - type: target_object
    description: Non-white (0), non-gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color of the object (e.g., yellow, magenta, orange).
      - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates of the object's pixels.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all the object's pixels.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col) coordinate.
          - height: max_row - min_row + 1
          - width: max_col - min_col + 1
    transformation: Replaced by a 3x3 square of the same color in the output. The square's top-left corner aligns with the original object's bounding box top-left corner.
  - type: ignored_object
    description: Gray (5) clusters of pixels in the input.
    transformation: Removed entirely in the output, replaced by the background color (white).
  - type: background
    description: White (0) pixels.
    transformation: Remains white, unless overwritten by a transformed object's 3x3 square.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct contiguous clusters of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - filter_objects: Separate objects into 'target_objects' (non-gray) and 'ignored_objects' (gray).
  - calculate_bounding_box: For each target_object, determine its bounding box and identify the top-left corner coordinates.
  - generate_output_square: For each target_object, create a 3x3 square of its color.
  - place_output_square: Position the generated 3x3 square onto an initially white output grid, using the calculated top-left corner as the anchor point.

relationships:
  - Each target_object in the input maps to exactly one 3x3 square of the same color in the output.
  - The position of the output square is determined by the top-left coordinate of the input object's bounding box.
  - Ignored_objects (gray) have no corresponding object in the output.
