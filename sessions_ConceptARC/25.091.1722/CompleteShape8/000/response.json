Other colors present in the inputs are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and orange (7). Gray (5) is present in the input but *never* in the output. Yellow, magenta, and orange objects in the input correspond to objects of the *same* color in the output, but their shapes change.\n3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple discrete objects (contiguous blocks or scattered pixels of the same color, excluding white). The gray objects appear somewhat complex or scattered. The other colored objects vary in shape (e.g., 'T'-like, 'L'-like, dots, bars).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Gray objects are consistently removed (replaced with the white background).\n    *   All other non-white colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange in the examples) are transformed into solid 3x3 squares of their original color.\n    *   The position of the output 3x3 square seems determined by the original object's position. Specifically, the top-left corner of the 3x3 square in the output corresponds to the top-left corner of the *bounding box* of the original object in the input.\n5.  **Overlap:** In the provided examples, the resulting 3x3 squares in the output do not overlap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
