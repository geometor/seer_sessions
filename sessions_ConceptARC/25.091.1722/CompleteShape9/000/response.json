            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show a 2D grid input and a corresponding 2D grid output of the same dimensions (12x12). The grids contain numerical values representing colors, with 0 (white) typically acting as the background.\n2.  **Core Object:** In each example, there is a prominent, large, connected object of a single non-white color (red '2' in example 1, green '3' in example 2) surrounded by a white background.\n3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation appears to be a 'repair' or 'hole-filling' operation. The output grids are nearly identical to the input grids, with only one specific pixel changing color in each case.\n4.  **Changed Pixel:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the pixel at (row 7, column 8) changes from white (0) to red (2).\n    *   In `train_2`, the pixel at (row 5, column 10) changes from white (0) to green (3).\n5.  **Context of Change:** The pixels that change are initially white (0) and are located within or adjacent to the main colored object.\n    *   In `train_1`, the changed pixel (7, 8) is completely surrounded by red (2) pixels (all 4 cardinal neighbors are red). It looks like a 1x1 hole inside the red object.\n    *   In `train_2`, the changed pixel (5, 10) is white (0), but it's part of a larger internal white region within the green (3) frame. Its cardinal neighbors are North=green(3), South=green(3), West=white(0), East=white(0). It has exactly two opposite neighbors (North and South) matching the main object color (green).\n6.  **Inferred Goal:** The transformation seems to identify specific white pixels that are considered 'defects' or 'holes' relative to the main colored object and fills them with the color of that object. The criteria for identifying these defects appear based on the configuration of the pixel's immediate cardinal neighbors.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
