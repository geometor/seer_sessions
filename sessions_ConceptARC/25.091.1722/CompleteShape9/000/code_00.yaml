task_type: object_completion_or_repair

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input_grid_size: [12, 12]
    output_grid_size: [12, 12]
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: 0 # white
        location: border and one internal pixel at (7, 8)
      - type: main_object
        color: 2 # red
        shape: large rectangle with a hole
        location: fills most of the grid inside the border
    transformation:
      changed_pixels:
        - coordinates: [7, 8]
          from_color: 0 # white
          to_color: 2 # red
      rule_trigger: The pixel at (7, 8) was white, and all 4 cardinal neighbors were red (2).
  - id: train_2
    input_grid_size: [12, 12]
    output_grid_size: [12, 12]
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: 0 # white
        location: border and internal rectangular region
      - type: main_object
        color: 3 # green
        shape: hollow rectangle or frame
        location: surrounds the internal white region
    transformation:
      changed_pixels:
        - coordinates: [5, 10]
          from_color: 0 # white
          to_color: 3 # green
      rule_trigger: The pixel at (5, 10) was white, and its North and South cardinal neighbors were green (3), while its East and West neighbors were white (0).

derived_properties:
  - consistency: Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - color_palette: Colors used in the output are present in the input.
  - main_object_color_determination: In both cases, the color used for filling is the color of the single largest connected non-white object.
  - identification_criteria: White pixels are candidates for change based on their cardinal neighbors relative to the main object's color.

potential_rules:
  - rule_1: If a white pixel has all 4 cardinal neighbors matching the main object color, change the pixel to the main object color.
  - rule_2: If a white pixel has exactly 2 cardinal neighbors matching the main object color, AND these neighbors are opposite each other (North/South or East/West), change the pixel to the main object color.
  - combined_rule: Apply both rule_1 and rule_2.
