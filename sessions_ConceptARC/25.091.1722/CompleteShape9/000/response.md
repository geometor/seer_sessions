Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show a 2D grid input and a corresponding 2D grid output of the same dimensions (12x12). The grids contain numerical values representing colors, with 0 (white) typically acting as the background.
2.  **Core Object:** In each example, there is a prominent, large, connected object of a single non-white color (red '2' in example 1, green '3' in example 2) surrounded by a white background.
3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation appears to be a 'repair' or 'hole-filling' operation. The output grids are nearly identical to the input grids, with only one specific pixel changing color in each case.
4.  **Changed Pixel:**
    *   In `train_1`, the pixel at (row 7, column 8) changes from white (0) to red (2).
    *   In `train_2`, the pixel at (row 5, column 10) changes from white (0) to green (3).
5.  **Context of Change:** The pixels that change are initially white (0) and are located within or adjacent to the main colored object.
    *   In `train_1`, the changed pixel (7, 8) is completely surrounded by red (2) pixels (all 4 cardinal neighbors are red). It looks like a 1x1 hole inside the red object.
    *   In `train_2`, the changed pixel (5, 10) is white (0), but it's part of a larger internal white region within the green (3) frame. Its cardinal neighbors are North=green(3), South=green(3), West=white(0), East=white(0). It has exactly two opposite neighbors (North and South) matching the main object color (green).
6.  **Inferred Goal:** The transformation seems to identify specific white pixels that are considered 'defects' or 'holes' relative to the main colored object and fills them with the color of that object. The criteria for identifying these defects appear based on the configuration of the pixel's immediate cardinal neighbors.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_completion_or_repair

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input_grid_size: [12, 12]
    output_grid_size: [12, 12]
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: 0 # white
        location: border and one internal pixel at (7, 8)
      - type: main_object
        color: 2 # red
        shape: large rectangle with a hole
        location: fills most of the grid inside the border
    transformation:
      changed_pixels:
        - coordinates: [7, 8]
          from_color: 0 # white
          to_color: 2 # red
      rule_trigger: The pixel at (7, 8) was white, and all 4 cardinal neighbors were red (2).
  - id: train_2
    input_grid_size: [12, 12]
    output_grid_size: [12, 12]
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: 0 # white
        location: border and internal rectangular region
      - type: main_object
        color: 3 # green
        shape: hollow rectangle or frame
        location: surrounds the internal white region
    transformation:
      changed_pixels:
        - coordinates: [5, 10]
          from_color: 0 # white
          to_color: 3 # green
      rule_trigger: The pixel at (5, 10) was white, and its North and South cardinal neighbors were green (3), while its East and West neighbors were white (0).

derived_properties:
  - consistency: Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - color_palette: Colors used in the output are present in the input.
  - main_object_color_determination: In both cases, the color used for filling is the color of the single largest connected non-white object.
  - identification_criteria: White pixels are candidates for change based on their cardinal neighbors relative to the main object's color.

potential_rules:
  - rule_1: If a white pixel has all 4 cardinal neighbors matching the main object color, change the pixel to the main object color.
  - rule_2: If a white pixel has exactly 2 cardinal neighbors matching the main object color, AND these neighbors are opposite each other (North/South or East/West), change the pixel to the main object color.
  - combined_rule: Apply both rule_1 and rule_2.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single largest connected object composed of a non-white color in the input grid. Let its color be `C`.
2.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will be the output grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `P` at location (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid.
4.  If the color of pixel `P` is white (0):
    a.  Check the colors of its four cardinal neighbors (North, South, East, West) in the input grid.
    b.  **Condition 1:** If all four cardinal neighbors have the color `C`.
    c.  **Condition 2:** If exactly two cardinal neighbors have the color `C`, AND these two neighbors are directly opposite each other (i.e., North and South neighbors are `C`, or East and West neighbors are `C`).
    d.  If either Condition 1 or Condition 2 is met for pixel `P`, change the color of the pixel at location (r, c) in the output grid to `C`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
