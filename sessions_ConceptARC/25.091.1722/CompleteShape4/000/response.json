Then, it constructs two new lines in the output grid. These output lines have the same color as the input lines but are rotated 90 degrees. Crucially, the endpoints of the output lines are adjusted inwards by one pixel relative to the boundaries defined by the input lines.\n4.  **Example 1 Specifics**: Input has two horizontal yellow lines. The output has two vertical yellow lines. The columns of the vertical lines correspond to the start and end columns of the input horizontal lines. The rows of the vertical lines span from one row below the top input line to one row above the bottom input line.\n5.  **Example 2 Specifics**: Input has two vertical magenta lines. The output has two horizontal magenta lines. The rows of the horizontal lines correspond to the start and end rows of the input vertical lines. The columns of the horizontal lines span from one column to the right of the left input line to one column to the left of the right input line.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
