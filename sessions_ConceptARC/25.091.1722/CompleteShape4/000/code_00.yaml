task_description: Identify two parallel lines (horizontal or vertical) of the same color in the input grid and replace them with two parallel lines of the same color but rotated 90 degrees, with their span adjusted inwards by one unit relative to the original lines' boundaries.

elements:
  - object: parallel_lines
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: non-white (consistent between the two lines)
      - orientation: either horizontal or vertical (consistent between the two lines)
      - location: defined by start and end coordinates (rows/columns)
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two lines are parallel and separated by background pixels.
  - type: transformation
    action: rotate_and_adjust
    input_object: parallel_lines (input)
    output_object: parallel_lines (output)
    details:
      - The orientation of the output lines is 90 degrees rotated from the input lines.
      - The color of the output lines is identical to the input lines.
      - The extent (length) and position of the output lines are derived from the input lines' boundaries, adjusted inwards by one pixel at each end of the span.
