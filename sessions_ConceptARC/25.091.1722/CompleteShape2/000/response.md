Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples. The transformation involves changing some white pixels (color 0) to other colors based on patterns within rows and columns.

1.  **Rows:** In each example, there is at least one row that initially contains pixels of a single non-white color interspersed with white pixels. In the output, all the white pixels in that specific row are replaced by that non-white color, effectively "completing" the horizontal line of color.
2.  **Columns:** Similarly, there is at least one column in each input that contains pixels of a single non-white color mixed with white pixels. In the output, the white pixels within that column are filled with the non-white color, completing the vertical line.
3.  **Independence:** The row-filling and column-filling operations appear to happen based on the *original* state of the input grid. A white pixel that belongs to both a "completable" row and a "completable" column might be targeted by both operations. The examples show that the operation related to the specific row or column takes precedence for filling that pixel. Example 1 is key: the pixel at (3, 5) is white. Row 3 should be filled with red (2), and Column 5 should be filled with green (3). In the output, pixel (3, 5) becomes red (2), and the other white pixels in column 5 become green (3). This suggests row operations might have priority, or perhaps both operations happen concurrently on a copy of the grid. A simpler explanation matching the output is that row changes affect the row, and column changes affect the column, and the effects are combined. Let's assume the operations are applied independently to a copy of the input.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: true # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid
pixel_colors_used:
  - white (0)
  - red (2)
  - green (3)
  - yellow (4)
  - gray (5)
  - magenta (6)
  - maroon (9)
objects:
  - type: line_segment
    attributes:
      orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
      composition: Consists of pixels of a single non-white color and potentially white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_completable_lines
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_rows, list_of_columns
    criteria:
      - A row or column contains pixels of exactly one non-white color, plus potentially white pixels.
  - name: fill_line_gaps
    inputs: grid, line_identifier (row index or column index), fill_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: Replaces all white (0) pixels along the specified line (row or column) in the grid with the fill_color.
relationships:
  - The fill_color for a line is determined by the single non-white color present in that line in the original input grid.
  - The filling action is applied independently for each identified completable row and column, modifying a copy of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a working copy of the input grid. This copy will become the output grid.
2.  Examine each row of the **original input grid**.
3.  For a given row, determine the set of unique non-white colors present within it.
4.  If this set contains exactly one color (let's call this `row_color`), then iterate through all pixels in this row **in the working copy grid**. For any pixel in this row that is currently white (0), change its color to `row_color`.
5.  Examine each column of the **original input grid**.
6.  For a given column, determine the set of unique non-white colors present within it.
7.  If this set contains exactly one color (let's call this `col_color`), then iterate through all pixels in this column **in the working copy grid**. For any pixel in this column that is currently white (0), change its color to `col_color`.
8.  Return the final state of the working copy grid as the result.
