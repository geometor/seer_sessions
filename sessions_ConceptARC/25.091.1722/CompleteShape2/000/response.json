            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples. The transformation involves changing some white pixels (color 0) to other colors based on patterns within rows and columns.\n\n1.  **Rows:** In each example, there is at least one row that initially contains pixels of a single non-white color interspersed with white pixels. In the output, all the white pixels in that specific row are replaced by that non-white color, effectively \"completing\" the horizontal line of color.\n2.  **Columns:** Similarly, there is at least one column in each input that contains pixels of a single non-white color mixed with white pixels. In the output, the white pixels within that column are filled with the non-white color, completing the vertical line.\n3.  **Independence:** The row-filling and column-filling operations appear to happen based on the *original* state of the input grid. A white pixel that belongs to both a \"completable\" row and a \"completable\" column might be targeted by both operations. The examples show that the operation related to the specific row or column takes precedence for filling that pixel. Example 1 is key: the pixel at (3, 5) is white. Row 3 should be filled with red (2), and Column 5 should be filled with green (3). In the output, pixel (3, 5) becomes red (2), and the other white pixels in column 5 become green (3). This suggests row operations might have priority, or perhaps both operations happen concurrently on a copy of the grid. A simpler explanation matching the output is that row changes affect the row, and column changes affect the column, and the effects are combined. Let's assume the operations are applied independently to a copy of the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
