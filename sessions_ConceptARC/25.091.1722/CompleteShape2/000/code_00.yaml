task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: true # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid
pixel_colors_used:
  - white (0)
  - red (2)
  - green (3)
  - yellow (4)
  - gray (5)
  - magenta (6)
  - maroon (9)
objects:
  - type: line_segment
    attributes:
      orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
      composition: Consists of pixels of a single non-white color and potentially white (0) pixels.
actions:
  - name: identify_completable_lines
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_rows, list_of_columns
    criteria:
      - A row or column contains pixels of exactly one non-white color, plus potentially white pixels.
  - name: fill_line_gaps
    inputs: grid, line_identifier (row index or column index), fill_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    description: Replaces all white (0) pixels along the specified line (row or column) in the grid with the fill_color.
relationships:
  - The fill_color for a line is determined by the single non-white color present in that line in the original input grid.
  - The filling action is applied independently for each identified completable row and column, modifying a copy of the input grid.
