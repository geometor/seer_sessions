"""
Transforms the input grid based on row and column completion rules.

1. Creates a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Identifies rows in the original input grid that contain exactly one unique non-white color alongside white (0) pixels.
3. For each such identified row, fills all white (0) pixels in that corresponding row of the output grid with the identified non-white color.
4. Identifies columns in the original input grid that contain exactly one unique non-white color alongside white (0) pixels.
5. For each such identified column, fills all white (0) pixels in that corresponding column of the output grid with the identified non-white color.
6. Returns the modified output grid.

The row and column filling operations are performed sequentially (rows first, then columns), modifying the same output grid. The check for whether a pixel should be filled is based on its state in the *current* output grid (i.e., it must be white (0) at the time of the fill operation). The determination of *which* rows/columns to fill and *what* color to use is based solely on the original input grid.
