It correctly identified that rows/columns containing a single unique non-white color were targets for filling white cells, but it missed a crucial condition observed across all examples: this rule only applies if the row/column *already contains multiple instances* of that non-white color in the input grid. Lines with only a single non-white pixel (along with white pixels) are not modified. The execution trace confirmed the code implemented the faulty rule, leading to incorrect transformations. The strategy is to modify the rule to include the \"multiple instances\" check.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the count of non-white pixels for the relevant lines in the inputs.\n\n"
