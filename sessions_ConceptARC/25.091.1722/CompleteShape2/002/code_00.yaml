task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: true # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid
pixel_colors_used:
  - white (0)
  - red (2)
  - green (3)
  - yellow (4)
  - gray (5)
  - magenta (6)
  - maroon (9)
objects:
  - type: line_segment
    attributes:
      orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
      composition: Consists of pixels of a single non-white color and potentially white (0) pixels.
      completable: Defined by conditions below.
conditions_for_action:
  - line_type: row_or_column
    criteria_on_input:
      - Contains exactly one unique non-white color (e.g., only red, or only green, etc.).
      - Contains at least two pixels of that single non-white color.
actions:
  - name: fill_line_gaps
    inputs: grid, line_identifier (row index or column index), fill_color
    outputs: modified_grid
    condition: The line (identified by `line_identifier`) must meet the `conditions_for_action` based on the *original input grid*.
    description: Replaces all white (0) pixels along the specified line in the *working copy* grid with the determined `fill_color`.
    execution_order: Row fills are applied first, then column fills. Both modify the same working grid.
relationships:
  - The `fill_color` for a line is the single non-white color identified in the input grid for that line.
