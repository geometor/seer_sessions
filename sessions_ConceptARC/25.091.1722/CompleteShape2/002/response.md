**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because the initial rule identification was incomplete. It correctly identified that rows/columns containing a single unique non-white color were targets for filling white cells, but it missed a crucial condition observed across all examples: this rule only applies if the row/column *already contains multiple instances* of that non-white color in the input grid. Lines with only a single non-white pixel (along with white pixels) are not modified. The execution trace confirmed the code implemented the faulty rule, leading to incorrect transformations. The strategy is to modify the rule to include the "multiple instances" check.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the count of non-white pixels for the relevant lines in the inputs.


``` python
import numpy as np

def count_non_white(line):
    counts = {}
    for pixel in line:
        if pixel != 0:
            counts[pixel] = counts.get(pixel, 0) + 1
    return counts

# Example 1 Input
grid1_in = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
    [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
])

# Example 2 Input
grid2_in = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
])

# Example 3 Input
grid3_in = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],
    [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

results = {}

# Analyze Grid 1
results['grid1'] = {'rows': [], 'cols': []}
h, w = grid1_in.shape
for r in range(h):
    results['grid1']['rows'].append(count_non_white(grid1_in[r, :]))
for c in range(w):
    results['grid1']['cols'].append(count_non_white(grid1_in[:, c]))

# Analyze Grid 2
results['grid2'] = {'rows': [], 'cols': []}
h, w = grid2_in.shape
for r in range(h):
    results['grid2']['rows'].append(count_non_white(grid2_in[r, :]))
for c in range(w):
    results['grid2']['cols'].append(count_non_white(grid2_in[:, c]))

# Analyze Grid 3
results['grid3'] = {'rows': [], 'cols': []}
h, w = grid3_in.shape
for r in range(h):
    results['grid3']['rows'].append(count_non_white(grid3_in[r, :]))
for c in range(w):
    results['grid3']['cols'].append(count_non_white(grid3_in[:, c]))

print(results)
```
```
{'grid1': {'rows': [{np.int64(3): 1}, {}, {np.int64(3): 1}, {np.int64(2): 4}, {np.int64(3): 1}, {}, {np.int64(3): 1}], 'cols': [{np.int64(2): 1}, {}, {np.int64(2): 1}, {}, {np.int64(2): 1}, {np.int64(3): 4}, {np.int64(2): 1}]}, 'grid2': {'rows': [{}, {np.int64(6): 1}, {np.int64(4): 3}, {np.int64(6): 1}, {}, {np.int64(6): 1}], 'cols': [{np.int64(4): 1}, {}, {np.int64(4): 1}, {}, {np.int64(4): 1}, {np.int64(6): 3}]}, 'grid3': {'rows': [{}, {np.int64(9): 1}, {np.int64(5): 3}, {np.int64(9): 1}, {}, {np.int64(9): 1}], 'cols': [{np.int64(9): 3}, {np.int64(5): 1}, {}, {np.int64(5): 1}, {}, {np.int64(5): 1}]}}

```
**Metrics Analysis:**

The code execution confirms the counts:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Rows with single non-white color: Row 0 (1x green), Row 2 (1x green), Row 3 (4x red), Row 4 (1x green), Row 6 (1x green).
    *   Cols with single non-white color: Col 0 (1x red), Col 2 (1x red), Col 4 (1x red), Col 5 (4x green), Col 6 (1x red).
    *   Lines with >1 instance of single non-white color: Row 3 (red), Col 5 (green). These match the lines modified in the expected output.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Rows with single non-white color: Row 1 (1x magenta), Row 2 (3x yellow), Row 3 (1x magenta), Row 5 (1x magenta).
    *   Cols with single non-white color: Col 0 (1x yellow), Col 2 (1x yellow), Col 4 (1x yellow), Col 5 (3x magenta).
    *   Lines with >1 instance of single non-white color: Row 2 (yellow), Col 5 (magenta). These match the lines modified in the expected output.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Rows with single non-white color: Row 1 (1x maroon), Row 2 (3x gray), Row 3 (1x maroon), Row 5 (1x maroon).
    *   Cols with single non-white color: Col 0 (3x maroon), Col 1 (1x gray), Col 3 (1x gray), Col 5 (1x gray).
    *   Lines with >1 instance of single non-white color: Row 2 (gray), Col 0 (maroon). These match the lines modified in the expected output.

The metrics strongly support the hypothesis that a line is only filled if it contains exactly one non-white color AND multiple instances of that color in the input grid.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a working copy of the input grid. This copy will be modified and eventually become the output grid.
2.  **Row Processing:**
    *   Examine each row of the **original input grid**.
    *   For a given row, determine the set of unique non-white colors present and count the occurrences of each.
    *   If the set contains exactly one color (`row_color`) AND the count of `row_color` pixels in that row is greater than 1:
        *   Iterate through all pixels in this corresponding row **in the working copy grid**.
        *   For any pixel in this row that is currently white (0), change its color to `row_color`.
3.  **Column Processing:**
    *   Examine each column of the **original input grid**.
    *   For a given column, determine the set of unique non-white colors present and count the occurrences of each.
    *   If the set contains exactly one color (`col_color`) AND the count of `col_color` pixels in that column is greater than 1:
        *   Iterate through all pixels in this corresponding column **in the working copy grid**.
        *   For any pixel in this column that is currently white (0), change its color to `col_color`.
4.  Return the final state of the working copy grid as the result.
