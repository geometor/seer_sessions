            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show an input grid containing a large shape made of a single color (green=3 in ex1, blue=1 in ex2) on a white (0) background. This main shape contains one or more enclosed areas (holes) of the background color (white). The output grid is largely identical to the input, except that some or all of these white holes within the main shape have been filled with the color of the main shape.\n2.  **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   The main shape is green (3).\n    *   There are two distinct enclosed white regions (holes) within the green shape. One is larger (6 pixels at rows 10-11, cols 7-9) and another is smaller (2 pixels at row 15, cols 6-7).\n    *   In the output, only the smaller hole (at row 15) is filled with green. The larger hole remains white.\n3.  **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   The main shape is blue (1).\n    *   There are two distinct enclosed white regions (holes) within the blue shape. One is at row 7, cols 8-11 (4 pixels). The other is at row 8, cols 8-11 (4 pixels). They are of equal size.\n    *   In the output, *both* holes are filled with blue.\n4.  **Identifying the Pattern:** The transformation identifies enclosed regions (holes) of the background color within the largest non-background object. It seems to fill these holes based on their size relative to other holes. Specifically, it appears to fill all internal holes *except* for the uniquely largest one. If there is a tie for the largest hole (as in example 2), or only one hole exists, then all holes are filled.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the largest connected component among these (by pixel count). Let this be the 'main object' and note its color, C. If there's a tie for the largest component, choose any one (the rule seems independent of which tied component is chosen, as holes are defined relative to *one* component).\n4.  Find all connected components of the background color (white).\n5.  For each white component, determine if it is an 'internal hole' relative to the main object. A white component is an internal hole if all its neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and optionally diagonal - need to confirm, but examples suggest cardinal neighbors are sufficient to define enclosure) are either part of the white component itself or part of the main object. Equivalently, check if the white component can reach the grid boundary by moving only through white cells; if it cannot, it is internal.\n6.  Create a list of all identified internal holes.\n7.  If no internal holes are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n8.  If internal holes are found, calculate the size (number of pixels) of each internal hole.\n9.  Find the maximum size among these internal holes.\n10. Count how many internal holes share this maximum size.\n11. Prepare the output grid by copying the input grid.\n12. If exactly one internal hole has the maximum size (i.e., there is a unique largest hole), iterate through all *other* internal holes (those not uniquely largest) and change the color of their pixels to color C in the output grid.\n13. If there is *not* a unique largest hole (either because there was a tie for the largest size, or there was only one hole to begin with), iterate through *all* internal holes and change the color of their pixels to color C in the output grid.\n14. Return the final output grid."
