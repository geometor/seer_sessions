            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids with a background color (White/0).\n2.  **Objects/Patterns:** The grids contain colored patterns or shapes. In Example 1, there are symmetrical patterns on the left and right separated by a vertical gap. In Example 2, there's a frame-like structure with a central empty area and a vertical gap within the frame.\n3.  **Central Gap:** A key feature in both inputs is a vertical gap, specifically columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed), which are initially either empty (White/0) or filled with a specific color in certain rows. This gap has a consistent width of 2 columns.\n4.  **Flanking Pixels:** The pixels immediately to the left (column 3) and right (column 6) of this gap seem important.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves filling the gap (columns 4 and 5) in certain rows. The color used for filling seems dependent on the colors of the flanking pixels (columns 3 and 6) in that row, based on a rule learned from rows where the gap is *already* filled in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Identify the vertical gap columns, which are columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed). Define the flanking columns as column 3 (left) and column 6 (right).\n3.  Create an empty lookup map to store the fill rules (e.g., `fill_rule_map`).\n4.  Iterate through each row of the input grid:\n    a.  Check if the pixels in the gap columns (4 and 5) for the current row are *not* both the background color (0).\n    b.  If the gap is filled, record the color of the left flanking pixel (column 3) and the right flanking pixel (column 6). Record the color of the pixel in the first gap column (column 4) as the fill color. Add an entry to the `fill_rule_map`: `(left_flank_color, right_flank_color) -> fill_color`.\n5.  Iterate through each row of the input grid again:\n    a.  Check if the pixels in the gap columns (4 and 5) for the current row *are* both the background color (0).\n    b.  If the gap is empty, get the colors of the left flanking pixel (column 3, `current_left_flank`) and the right flanking pixel (column 6, `current_right_flank`).\n    c.  Check if the pair (`current_left_flank`, `current_right_flank`) exists as a key in the `fill_rule_map`.\n    d.  If the key exists, retrieve the corresponding `fill_color` from the map. Modify the output grid by setting the pixels in columns 4 and 5 of the current row to this `fill_color`.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
