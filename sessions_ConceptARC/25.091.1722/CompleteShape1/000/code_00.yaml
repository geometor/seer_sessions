task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (12x10 in Ex1, 6x8 in Ex2).
  background_color: 0 (White).
  gap:
    location: Vertical strip, Columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed).
    width: 2 columns.
    content: Can be background color (0) or a non-background color.
  flanking_columns:
    left: Column 3 (immediately left of the gap).
    right: Column 6 (immediately right of the gap).
  transformation_type: Conditional gap filling.

objects_and_properties:
  - object: Vertical Gap
    property: Located at columns 4 and 5.
    property: Acts as a separator or incomplete bridge.
  - object: Flanking Pixels
    property: Located at columns 3 and 6 relative to a specific row.
    property: Their colors determine the gap filling logic.
  - object: Filled Gap Row (in Input)
    property: A row where columns 4 and 5 contain non-background color(s).
    property: Serves as a template or rule example.
    relationship: The fill color is associated with the flanking pixel colors in that row.
  - object: Empty Gap Row (in Input)
    property: A row where columns 4 and 5 contain the background color (0).
    property: Is a candidate for modification based on the learned rule.

actions_and_rules:
  - action: Identify Template Rows
    description: Find rows where the gap (cols 4, 5) is already filled with a non-background color in the input.
  - action: Learn Fill Rule
    description: Create a mapping from the pair of flanking colors (col 3, col 6) to the fill color (cols 4, 5) using the template rows. Assume the fill color is consistent across the gap width for a given template row.
  - action: Identify Target Rows
    description: Find rows where the gap (cols 4, 5) is currently empty (background color 0).
  - action: Apply Fill Rule
    description: For each target row, check if its flanking colors (col 3, col 6) match a pair in the learned rule map. If a match exists, fill the gap (cols 4, 5) in that row with the corresponding mapped fill color.
  - action: Output Construction
    description: The output grid is the input grid potentially modified by the 'Apply Fill Rule' action. Rows with already filled gaps in the input remain unchanged. Rows with empty gaps that don't match any rule also remain unchanged.
