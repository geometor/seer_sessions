Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids with a background color (White/0).
2.  **Objects/Patterns:** The grids contain colored patterns or shapes. In Example 1, there are symmetrical patterns on the left and right separated by a vertical gap. In Example 2, there's a frame-like structure with a central empty area and a vertical gap within the frame.
3.  **Central Gap:** A key feature in both inputs is a vertical gap, specifically columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed), which are initially either empty (White/0) or filled with a specific color in certain rows. This gap has a consistent width of 2 columns.
4.  **Flanking Pixels:** The pixels immediately to the left (column 3) and right (column 6) of this gap seem important.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves filling the gap (columns 4 and 5) in certain rows. The color used for filling seems dependent on the colors of the flanking pixels (columns 3 and 6) in that row, based on a rule learned from rows where the gap is *already* filled in the input.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (12x10 in Ex1, 6x8 in Ex2).
  background_color: 0 (White).
  gap:
    location: Vertical strip, Columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed).
    width: 2 columns.
    content: Can be background color (0) or a non-background color.
  flanking_columns:
    left: Column 3 (immediately left of the gap).
    right: Column 6 (immediately right of the gap).
  transformation_type: Conditional gap filling.

objects_and_properties:
  - object: Vertical Gap
    property: Located at columns 4 and 5.
    property: Acts as a separator or incomplete bridge.
  - object: Flanking Pixels
    property: Located at columns 3 and 6 relative to a specific row.
    property: Their colors determine the gap filling logic.
  - object: Filled Gap Row (in Input)
    property: A row where columns 4 and 5 contain non-background color(s).
    property: Serves as a template or rule example.
    relationship: The fill color is associated with the flanking pixel colors in that row.
  - object: Empty Gap Row (in Input)
    property: A row where columns 4 and 5 contain the background color (0).
    property: Is a candidate for modification based on the learned rule.

actions_and_rules:
  - action: Identify Template Rows
    description: Find rows where the gap (cols 4, 5) is already filled with a non-background color in the input.
  - action: Learn Fill Rule
    description: Create a mapping from the pair of flanking colors (col 3, col 6) to the fill color (cols 4, 5) using the template rows. Assume the fill color is consistent across the gap width for a given template row.
  - action: Identify Target Rows
    description: Find rows where the gap (cols 4, 5) is currently empty (background color 0).
  - action: Apply Fill Rule
    description: For each target row, check if its flanking colors (col 3, col 6) match a pair in the learned rule map. If a match exists, fill the gap (cols 4, 5) in that row with the corresponding mapped fill color.
  - action: Output Construction
    description: The output grid is the input grid potentially modified by the 'Apply Fill Rule' action. Rows with already filled gaps in the input remain unchanged. Rows with empty gaps that don't match any rule also remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify the vertical gap columns, which are columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed). Define the flanking columns as column 3 (left) and column 6 (right).
3.  Create an empty lookup map to store the fill rules (e.g., `fill_rule_map`).
4.  Iterate through each row of the input grid:
    a.  Check if the pixels in the gap columns (4 and 5) for the current row are *not* both the background color (0).
    b.  If the gap is filled, record the color of the left flanking pixel (column 3) and the right flanking pixel (column 6). Record the color of the pixel in the first gap column (column 4) as the fill color. Add an entry to the `fill_rule_map`: `(left_flank_color, right_flank_color) -> fill_color`.
5.  Iterate through each row of the input grid again:
    a.  Check if the pixels in the gap columns (4 and 5) for the current row *are* both the background color (0).
    b.  If the gap is empty, get the colors of the left flanking pixel (column 3, `current_left_flank`) and the right flanking pixel (column 6, `current_right_flank`).
    c.  Check if the pair (`current_left_flank`, `current_right_flank`) exists as a key in the `fill_rule_map`.
    d.  If the key exists, retrieve the corresponding `fill_color` from the map. Modify the output grid by setting the pixels in columns 4 and 5 of the current row to this `fill_color`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
