"""
The transformation identifies a consistent vertical gap of width 2, located at columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed). 
It learns a fill rule based on rows where this gap is already filled in the input. 
The rule maps the pair of colors in the flanking columns (column 3 and column 6) to the color used to fill the gap in that row. 
Then, it iterates through the rows where the gap is currently empty (filled with background color 0). 
If the flanking colors of an empty gap row match a learned rule, the gap in that row (columns 4 and 5) is filled with the corresponding color in the output grid. 
Rows that don't match any rule or were already filled remain unchanged.
