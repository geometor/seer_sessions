They act like markers or points.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The non-background pixels in the output grids form a hollow rectangle.\n5.  **Relationship:** The rectangle in the output appears to be defined by the extent of the non-background pixels in the input. Specifically, the rectangle's edges align with the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the input's non-background pixels.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the spatial bounds (minimum and maximum rows and columns) defined by the non-background pixels in the input and then draws the perimeter of the resulting bounding box using that same non-background color in the output grid. The interior of the rectangle and the area outside remain the background color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
