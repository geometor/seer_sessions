*   **Perception:**
    The task involves modifying pixels within specific rows based on information derived from specific columns. Each input grid contains a background color (white/0), one color forming sparse vertical elements (magenta/6, azure/8, or maroon/9), and another color forming horizontal lines (blue/1, orange/7, or green/3). The transformation focuses on the intersections between the rows containing the horizontal line color and the columns containing the vertical element color. If a pixel at such an intersection originally has the horizontal line color, its color is changed to the vertical element color. Otherwise, pixels remain unchanged.

    transformation_rule:
      goal: Change the color of specific pixels based on row and column patterns.
      steps:
        1. Identify the background color (usually 0).
        2. Identify the color C_vert which appears sparsely, defining specific columns (Cols_vert).
        3. Identify the color C_horz which forms horizontal patterns, defining specific rows (Rows_horz).
        4. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
        5. For each row index `r` in Rows_horz:
        6.   For each column index `c` in Cols_vert:
        7.     If the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is C_horz:
        8.       Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to C_vert.
        9. Return the modified output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify three key colors in the input grid: the background color (BKG, typically white/0), the color forming sparse vertical elements (C_vert), and the color forming horizontal lines/patterns (C_horz).
    2.  Determine the set of column indices (`Cols_vert`) where C_vert appears at least once.
    3.  Determine the set of row indices (`Rows_horz`) where C_horz appears at least once.
    4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  Iterate through each pixel location `(r, c)` such that `r` is in `Rows_horz` and `c` is in `Cols_vert`.
    6.  Check the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
    7.  If the color is C_horz, update the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to C_vert.
    8.  If the color is not C_horz, leave the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid unchanged from its copied input value.
    9.  Return the final output grid.
