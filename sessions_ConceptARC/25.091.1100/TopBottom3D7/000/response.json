            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The task involves modifying pixels within specific rows based on information derived from specific columns. Each input grid contains a background color (white/0), one color forming sparse vertical elements (magenta/6, azure/8, or maroon/9), and another color forming horizontal lines (blue/1, orange/7, or green/3). The transformation focuses on the intersections between the rows containing the horizontal line color and the columns containing the vertical element color. If a pixel at such an intersection originally has the horizontal line color, its color is changed to the vertical element color. Otherwise, pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
