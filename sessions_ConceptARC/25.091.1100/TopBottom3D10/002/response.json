            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code attempted a flood-fill approach based on identifying an enclosed region and a \"leak point\" on its border. The results show this was incorrect for two main reasons:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Scope of Change:** The transformation does not necessarily affect the *entire* enclosed region. Instead, changes are localized to the border pixels involved in the leak and the immediately adjacent inner pixels.\n2.  **Incorrect Target Color Identification:** The previous code incorrectly identified the background color (White - 0) as a potential \"leak\" color, leading to unexpected changes (Red -> White in Example 1, Yellow -> White in Example 2). It also seems to have misidentified regions in Example 2.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe new strategy focuses on identifying the specific local configuration that triggers a change, abandoning the broader \"enclosed region\" concept as the primary driver.\n\n1.  **Identify \"Triads\":** Iterate through each pixel `P_center` in the grid. Check if it forms a \"triad\" with two adjacent neighbors, `P1` and `P2`, such that `Color(P_center)`, `Color(P1)`, and `Color(P2)` are all distinct, and `Color(P2)` (the \"leaking\" color) is not the background color (White - 0).\n2.  **Determine Roles:** In this triad `P1 - P_center - P2`, `P_center` acts as the \"border\" pixel, `P1` as the \"inner\" pixel, and `P2` as the \"adjacent/leaking\" pixel.\n3.  **Mark Changes:** When such a triad is found, mark *both* `P_center` and `P1` to be changed to `Color(P2)`.\n4.  **Apply Changes:** Collect all marked changes and apply them simultaneously to a copy of the input grid to produce the output. This prevents changes from one triad affecting the detection of another triad within the same step.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\n"
