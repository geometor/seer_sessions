            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Relationship:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with a specific, localized change.\n2.  **Key Structures:** Both examples feature distinct regions (objects) of color. A recurring pattern is a smaller region completely surrounded by a \"frame\" or \"border\" region of a different color. There's also usually a third distinct color region adjacent to this frame.\n    *   *Example 1:* A red (2) rectangle inside a blue (1) frame, with a green (3) shape nearby touching the frame.\n    *   *Example 2:* A yellow (4) rectangle inside an azure (8) frame, with a magenta (6) shape nearby touching the frame.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The change occurs *inside* the enclosed region (the red area in Ex1, the yellow area in Ex2).\n4.  **Nature of Change:** The color of the enclosed region is entirely replaced by the color of the *third* region that touches the frame from the outside, adjacent to the enclosed region. It looks like the adjacent color \"leaks\" or \"floods\" into the enclosed area through specific points on the border.\n5.  **Mechanism:** The trigger for the color change seems to be the existence of a pixel on the border (frame) that is simultaneously adjacent to the inner color, the border color itself, *and* the external adjacent color. Let's call this a \"leak point\". If such a point exists, the inner region's color changes to the external adjacent color.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"

To do this, examine all pixels `P_neighbor` that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any pixel in `R` but are not part of `R`. If all such `P_neighbor` pixels have the same single color `C_border` (where `C_border` is different from `C_inner`), then `R` is enclosed by a border region `B` of color `C_border`.\n    b.

Check if `P_border` has at least one neighbor `P_inner` in region `R` AND at least one neighbor `P_adjacent` whose color `C_adjacent` is neither `C_inner` nor `C_border`.\n        iii. If such a `P_border` is found: Set `leak_found` to true, store the color `C_adjacent` in `adjacent_color`, and break the search for leak points (assuming only one adjacent color leaks per region).\n        iv. If `leak_found` is true after checking all border pixels: Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels corresponding to region `R` to the determined `adjacent_color`.\n4.
