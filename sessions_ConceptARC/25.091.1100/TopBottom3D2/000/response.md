Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (7x7 in all examples). The grids contain pixels represented by integer color codes (0-9).
2.  **Color Palette**: The examples use white (0), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), blue (1), magenta (6), and maroon (9). White (0) appears to be the background color.
3.  **Transformation Nature**: The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels in the input grid to white (0) in the output grid. Many pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Key Pattern - Columns**: Comparing columns seems important. In train_1 and train_3, column 3 is unique compared to other columns. In train_2, columns 1 and 4 are unique, with column 1 being the leftmost unique one. The changes seem localized to *one* specific column in each case (column 3, 1, 3 respectively). This suggests identifying a single "target column" is the first step, likely based on uniqueness, potentially prioritizing the leftmost unique column if multiple exist.
5.  **Key Pattern - Rows**: The changes within the target column don't affect *all* pixels in that column. In train_1, red pixels in column 3 are changed only if their row contains just red and white; rows containing red and green are unaffected in that column. In train_2, yellow pixels in column 1 are changed only if their row contains just yellow and white; rows containing yellow and blue are unaffected. In train_3, maroon pixels in column 3 are changed only if their row contains just maroon and white; the row containing only magenta is unaffected. This indicates a row-level condition for applying the change within the target column: the row must contain the background color (white=0) and at most one other color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - height: integer
    - width: integer
    - pixels: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Relationships:
    - Contains Columns
    - Contains Rows
    - Contains Pixels

Column:
  Properties:
    - index: integer
    - values: list of integers (colors)
    - is_unique: boolean (true if its sequence of values is not identical to any other column)
  Relationships:
    - Belongs to Grid
    - Composed of Pixels

Row:
  Properties:
    - index: integer
    - values: list of integers (colors)
    - color_composition: set of unique colors present
    - meets_condition: boolean (true if color_composition includes white (0) and at most one non-white color)
  Relationships:
    - Belongs to Grid
    - Composed of Pixels

Pixel:
  Properties:
    - color: integer (0-9)
    - row_index: integer
    - column_index: integer
  Action:
    - Can be changed to white (0) under specific conditions

Transformation:
  Input: Grid
  Output: Grid (same dimensions)
  Rule:
    - Identify the unique columns in the input grid.
    - Select the leftmost unique column as the 'target column'.
    - Identify rows that contain white (0) and at most one other color.
    - For each pixel located at the intersection of the target column and an identified row, change its color to white (0) in the output grid.
    - All other pixels retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Analyze the columns of the input grid to find all columns that are unique (their sequence of pixel colors does not match any other column).
3.  If no unique columns are found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
4.  If one or more unique columns are found, identify the one with the smallest column index (the leftmost unique column). Let this be the `target_column_index`.
5.  Create a copy of the input grid; this will become the output grid.
6.  For each row in the input grid, determine the set of unique colors present in that row.
7.  Check if the set of unique colors for the current row contains the color white (0) and contains no more than one non-white color (i.e., the set is either `{0}` or `{0, C}` for some `C > 0`).
8.  If this condition is met for the current row (let its index be `row_index`), then update the pixel in the output grid at position (`row_index`, `target_column_index`) to have the color white (0).
9.  After checking all rows, return the modified output grid.
