Grid:
  Properties:
    - height: integer
    - width: integer
    - pixels: 2D array of integers (colors)
  Relationships:
    - Contains Columns
    - Contains Rows
    - Contains Pixels

Column:
  Properties:
    - index: integer
    - values: list of integers (colors)
    - is_unique: boolean (true if its sequence of values is not identical to any other column)
  Relationships:
    - Belongs to Grid
    - Composed of Pixels

Row:
  Properties:
    - index: integer
    - values: list of integers (colors)
    - color_composition: set of unique colors present
    - meets_condition: boolean (true if color_composition includes white (0) and at most one non-white color)
  Relationships:
    - Belongs to Grid
    - Composed of Pixels

Pixel:
  Properties:
    - color: integer (0-9)
    - row_index: integer
    - column_index: integer
  Action:
    - Can be changed to white (0) under specific conditions

Transformation:
  Input: Grid
  Output: Grid (same dimensions)
  Rule:
    - Identify the unique columns in the input grid.
    - Select the leftmost unique column as the 'target column'.
    - Identify rows that contain white (0) and at most one other color.
    - For each pixel located at the intersection of the target column and an identified row, change its color to white (0) in the output grid.
    - All other pixels retain their original color.
