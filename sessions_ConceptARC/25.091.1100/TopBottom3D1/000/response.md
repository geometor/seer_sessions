Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Colors**: Each input grid uses exactly three colors: the background color (white, 0) and two other distinct colors.
2.  **Shapes**: The two non-background colors form distinct shapes or patterns. One color often forms a sort of "frame," "boundary," or "area marker," while the other color forms a shape "inside" or "intersecting with" the first shape.
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves changing the color of some pixels from the "inside" color to the "frame" color.
4.  **Containment/Intersection**: The key determinant for which pixels change color seems to be related to the spatial extent or bounding box of the "frame" color. Pixels of the "inside" color that fall within the bounding box of the "frame" color are the ones that get recolored.
5.  **Consistency**: This pattern holds across all three examples:
    *   Example 1: Red (inside) pixels within the Blue (frame) bounding box turn Blue.
    *   Example 2: Yellow (inside) pixels within the Green (frame) bounding box turn Green.
    *   Example 3: Magenta (inside) pixels within the Orange (frame) bounding box turn Orange. The Magenta pixels outside this box are unchanged.
