"""
The transformation identifies all unique non-background colored objects in the input grid.
For each object, it determines its color and the dimensions (height, width) of its bounding box.
A selection rule is applied to choose one 'determining' object:
1. If exactly one object's bounding box height matches the input grid height OR its bounding box width matches the input grid width, that object is selected.
2. Otherwise (if zero or multiple objects match the grid edges), the object with the largest bounding box area is selected.
3. If there's a tie in maximum bounding box area, the object with the highest color index among the tied objects is selected.
Finally, an output grid is created with the dimensions of the selected object's bounding box, filled entirely with the selected object's color.
