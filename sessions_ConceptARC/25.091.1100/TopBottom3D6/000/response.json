The input grids are 6x6. The output grid dimensions vary (6x2, 3x5, 3x5). The fill color of the output grid corresponds to one of the colors present in the input grid (excluding the white background). The key seems to be identifying which input color determines the output color and dimensions. By examining the examples, it appears the output dimensions (Height x Width) and the fill color are determined by the bounding box of exactly one of the colored objects in the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
