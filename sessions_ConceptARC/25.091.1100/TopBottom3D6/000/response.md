*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing multiple colored objects on a white background into a smaller output grid filled with a single color. The input grids are 6x6. The output grid dimensions vary (6x2, 3x5, 3x5). The fill color of the output grid corresponds to one of the colors present in the input grid (excluding the white background). The key seems to be identifying which input color determines the output color and dimensions. By examining the examples, it appears the output dimensions (Height x Width) and the fill color are determined by the bounding box of exactly one of the colored objects in the input grid.

    task_description: Transform an input grid with multiple colored objects into an output grid filled with a single color, where the color and dimensions are determined by the bounding box of one specific object from the input.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        role: input
        properties:
          - shape: square (6x6 in examples)
          - background_color: white (0)
          - content: multiple contiguous objects of different non-background colors (1-9)
      - element: grid
        role: output
        properties:
          - shape: rectangular (dimensions vary, e.g., 6x2, 3x5)
          - content: filled entirely with a single non-background color from the input grid
    
    transformation:
      - step: 1
        action: identify_objects
        input: input grid
        output: list of non-background colored objects (identified by their color)
      - step: 2
        action: calculate_bounding_boxes
        input: list of non-background colored objects and the input grid
        output: for each object, its color and the dimensions (height, width) of its bounding box
        details: The bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of that object's color.
      - step: 3
        action: select_determining_object
        input: list of (color, bounding_box_height, bounding_box_width) tuples
        output: the single tuple (selected_color, output_height, output_width) that uniquely determines the output grid based on its bounding box dimensions.
        rationale: In each example, there is one object whose bounding box dimensions directly correspond to the output grid's dimensions.
          - example_1: Green object BBox is 6x2 -> Output is 6x2 filled with Green.
          - example_2: Magenta object BBox is 3x5 -> Output is 3x5 filled with Magenta.
          - example_3: Orange object BBox is 3x5 -> Output is 3x5 filled with Orange.
      - step: 4
        action: create_output_grid
        input: selected_color, output_height, output_width
        output: output grid
        details: Create a grid with dimensions output_height x output_width, filled entirely with the selected_color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
    2.  For each unique non-background color:
        a.  Find all pixels in the input grid that have this color.
        b.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these pixels.
        c.  Calculate the height of the bounding box as `max_row - min_row + 1`.
        d.  Calculate the width of the bounding box as `max_col - min_col + 1`.
        e.  Store the color and its calculated bounding box dimensions (height, width).
    3.  Iterate through the stored results from step 2. Identify the specific color (`selected_color`) and its bounding box dimensions (`output_height`, `output_width`) that will define the output grid. (Based on the examples, there appears to be a unique object whose bounding box dimensions dictate the output).
    4.  Create a new grid with `output_height` rows and `output_width` columns.
    5.  Fill every cell of this new grid with the `selected_color`. This new grid is the final output.
