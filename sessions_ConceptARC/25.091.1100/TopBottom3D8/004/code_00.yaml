Task: Modify pixels at the intersection of a unique vertical line and horizontal segments based on row color composition.

Global Properties:
  Grid Size: Fixed 6x6 in examples, but logic should be general.
  Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Vertical Line
    Definition: The unique column `C` in the grid where exactly one non-background color `V_color` appears more than once.
    Properties:
      - Column Index: `C`
      - Dominant Color: `V_color`
  - Type: Horizontal Segment/Line
    Definition: A row `R` containing non-background pixels.
    Properties:
      - Row Index: `R`
      - Non-Background Colors: Set of unique non-background colors in the row.
      - Purity (relative to intersection):
          - Pure Condition Met: If the row contains exactly one non-background color `H_color`, AND the intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` is `H_color`.
          - Non-Pure Condition Met: If the row contains multiple non-background colors, AND the intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` is `V_color`, AND exactly one *other* non-background color `H_dom_color` exists in the row.
  - Type: Intersection Point
    Definition: A pixel at location `(R, C)` where a Horizontal Segment (row `R`) crosses the Vertical Line (column `C`).
    Properties:
      - Location: `(R, C)`
      - Input Color: `grid[R, C]`
      - Output Color: `output_grid[R, C]` (potentially modified)

Actions/Transformation Rules:
  1. Identify: Find the Vertical Line (`C`, `V_color`).
  2. Analyze Intersections: For each row `R`:
     - If `grid[R, C]` is non-background:
       - Check if the "Pure Condition" is met for row `R`. If yes, record a required change: `(R, C) -> V_color`.
       - Check if the "Non-Pure Condition" is met for row `R`. If yes, record a required change: `(R, C) -> H_dom_color`.
  3. Apply Changes with Priority:
     - If any "Pure Condition" changes were recorded: Apply *only* these changes to the output grid.
     - Else (if no "Pure Condition" changes were recorded): Apply any recorded "Non-Pure Condition" changes to the output grid.
  4. Default: If a pixel `(R, C)` is not subject to a prioritized change, its value remains the same as in the input grid.
