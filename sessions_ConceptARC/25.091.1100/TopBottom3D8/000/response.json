            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 6x6 grids.\n2.  **Key Elements:** Each input grid features exactly one prominent vertical line and one or more prominent horizontal lines. These lines consist of a single, non-background color (white, 0).\n3.  **Intersection:** The vertical and horizontal lines intersect at one or more points.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation happens only at the intersection point(s) between the vertical and horizontal lines. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The color of the intersection pixel(s) changes based on the colors of the intersecting lines and the nature of the horizontal line.\n    *   If the intersection involves a \"pure\" horizontal line (a row containing only the background color and one other color), the intersection pixel takes the color of the vertical line. This happens in examples 1, 3, and the intersection at (3,1) in example 4.\n    *   If the intersection involves a \"non-pure\" horizontal line (a row where the intersection pixel has the vertical line's color, but other pixels in the row have a different non-background color), the intersection pixel takes the color of the *other* non-background color present in that row. This happens in example 2.\n    *   If both types of intersections occur (as in example 4), the \"pure line\" rule takes precedence for its intersection, and the \"non-pure line\" intersection remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each, update the output grid at `(R, C)` to `V_color`. Set `pure_intersection_found = True`.\n7.  Process non-pure intersections (only if no pure intersections were found): If `pure_intersection_found` is `False`, iterate through the stored non-pure intersections `(R, C, H_dom_color)`.
