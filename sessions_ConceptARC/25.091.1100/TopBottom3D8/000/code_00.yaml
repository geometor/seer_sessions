  - Description: Train_4
    Input:
      Grid Size: 6x6
      Objects:
        - Type: Vertical Line
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Column 1
        - Type: Horizontal Line Segment (Row 1)

        - Location: (3, 1) # With pure row 3
          Initial Color: Gray (5) # Matches horizontal line color

      Changes:
        - Location: (3, 1)

        - Location: (1, 1)
          New Color: Azure (8) # No change (non-pure rule not applied because a pure rule was applicable elsewhere)

Derived Rule:
  Identify Vertical Line: Find the single column `C` containing only background (0) and one other color `V_color`.
  Identify Horizontal Lines: Find all rows `R` containing non-background colors.
    - Pure Horizontal Line: Row `R` contains only background (0) and one other color `H_color`.
    - Non-Pure Horizontal Line: Row `R` contains the pixel `(R, C)` with `V_color` and at least one other non-background color `H_dom_color`.
  Apply Transformation:
    1. Prioritize Pure Lines: If any pure horizontal line (row `R`, color `H_color`) intersects the vertical line at `(R, C)`, change the color of pixel `(R, C)` to `V_color`.
    2. Apply Non-Pure Rule (only if no pure lines intersected): If no pure horizontal lines intersect the vertical line, then for any non-pure horizontal line (row `R`, dominant color `H_dom_color`) intersecting the vertical line at `(R, C)` (where `grid[R][C] == V_color`), change the color of pixel `(R, C)` to `H_dom_color`.
    3. No Change: If an intersection exists but doesn't fit criteria 1 or 2 (e.g., the intersection on the non-pure line in train_4 when a pure line intersection also exists), it remains unchanged.
