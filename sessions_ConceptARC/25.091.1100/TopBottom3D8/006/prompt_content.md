Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the unique vertical line in the input grid. The vertical line is defined as the unique column `C` where exactly one non-background color `V_color` appears more than once.
2. Iterate through each row `R` of the grid.
3. Analyze the intersection point `(R, C)` and the composition of colors in row `R`.
4. Determine required changes based on two rules:
    a. **Pure Rule:** If row `R` contains exactly one unique non-background color `H_color`, AND the intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` has this color `H_color`, then a change is required: set the intersection pixel to `V_color`.
    b. **Non-Pure Rule:** If row `R` contains multiple unique non-background colors, AND the intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` has the vertical line's color `V_color`, AND there is exactly one *other* non-background color `H_dom_color` present in the row, then a change is required: set the intersection pixel to `H_dom_color`.
5. Collect all required changes identified by the Pure Rule into a `pure_changes` list and those by the Non-Pure Rule into a `non_pure_changes` list.
6. Apply the changes with priority: If the `pure_changes` list is not empty, apply *only* those changes to the output grid. Otherwise (if `pure_changes` is empty), apply all the changes from the `non_pure_changes` list.
7. Return the modified grid. Pixels not part of a prioritized change remain unchanged.
