Grid Properties:
  - Size: 6x6 (consistent across examples)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Vertical Line
    Identification: The unique column `C` containing multiple instances of exactly one non-background color `V_color`.
    Properties:
      - Column Index (`C`)
      - Line Color (`V_color`)

  - Type: Horizontal Line/Segment
    Identification: Any row `R` containing non-background pixels.
    Properties:
      - Row Index (`R`)
      - Set of non-background colors in the row.
      - Intersection Pixel Color: `grid[R, C]`

Interactions & Actions:
  - Location: At the intersection pixel `(R, C)` between the Vertical Line (column `C`) and a Horizontal Line/Segment (row `R`).
  - Conditions for Action:
    1. Pure Rule Condition:
        - Row `R` contains exactly one unique non-background color, `H_color`.
        - The intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` is equal to `H_color`.
       Action: Change the color of the output pixel `output[R, C]` to `V_color`.
    2. Non-Pure Rule Condition:
        - Row `R` contains more than one unique non-background color.
        - The intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` is equal to `V_color`.
        - There is exactly one *other* unique non-background color (`H_dom_color`) in row `R`.
       Action: Change the color of the output pixel `output[R, C]` to `H_dom_color`.
  - Application: Evaluate both rules for all rows `R` that intersect the vertical line `C` with a non-background color. Apply *all* indicated actions independently. Pixels where neither condition is met remain unchanged.
