Task: Modify intersection points between a unique vertical line and intersecting horizontal features based on row color composition.

Input_Features:
  - Grid_Size: 6x6 (consistent across examples).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
    - Vertical_Line:
        Property: Exactly one column index `C`.
        Property: Contains only background (0) and one unique non-background color `V_color`.
    - Horizontal_Features:
        Property: Rows `R` that contain non-background colors.
        Property: Intersects the Vertical_Line at `(R, C)`.

Intersection_Analysis:
  - Location: Point `(R, C)` where a Horizontal_Feature (row `R`) crosses the Vertical_Line (column `C`).
  - Precondition: The pixel `grid[R, C]` must be non-background (not 0).
  - Row_Classification (at intersection R):
    - Type: Pure
        Condition: Row `R` contains exactly one unique non-background color, `H_color`.
        Condition: The intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` must have the color `H_color`.
    - Type: Non-Pure
        Condition: Row `R` contains more than one unique non-background color.
        Condition: The intersection pixel `grid[R, C]` must have the color `V_color`.
        Condition: The set of non-background colors in row `R`, excluding `V_color`, must contain exactly one color, `H_dom_color`.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule_1:
      Applies_To: Pure Intersections `(R, C)`.
      Action: Change the color of the output pixel `output[R, C]` to `V_color`.
  - Rule_2:
      Applies_To: Non-Pure Intersections `(R, C)`.
      Action: Change the color of the output pixel `output[R, C]` to `H_dom_color`.
  - Execution_Priority:
      Step 1: Identify all Pure intersections and store their required transformation (`R, C, V_color`).
      Step 2: Identify all Non-Pure intersections and store their required transformation (`R, C, H_dom_color`).
      Step 3: If any Pure transformations were identified in Step 1, apply *only* those transformations to the output grid.
      Step 4: If *no* Pure transformations were identified in Step 1, apply all Non-Pure transformations identified in Step 2 to the output grid.
  - Default_Action: Pixels not identified for transformation by the prioritized rules remain unchanged from the input grid.
