            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples. While the code correctly identified the vertical line and seemed to classify intersections as \"pure\" or \"non-pure\" according to the logic derived from the examples, the expected pixel modifications in the output grid did not occur. The outputs produced were either identical to the inputs or, in one case (Example 2), contained an unexpected modification unrelated to the intersection logic.\n\nThis pattern suggests the core logic for identifying *what* needs to change might be largely correct, but there's a flaw in *how* the changes are applied or persisted in the output grid within the code's execution, or a subtle misunderstanding of the rule's edge cases or priorities.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Re-verify Rule Logic:** Carefully re-examine the rules for \"pure\" and \"non-pure\" intersections and the priority between them, ensuring they precisely match all input/output pairs.\n2.  **Focus on Implementation:** Since the logic seems plausible but execution failed, the focus should be on ensuring the code correctly implements the identified logic, particularly the steps involving modification of the output grid based on the priority rules. The unexpected change in Example 2's output needs particular attention, although it might be an artifact of another bug.\n3.  **Refine Definitions:** Ensure the definitions of \"pure row\" and \"non-pure row\" are unambiguous and correctly captured in the analysis.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nNo code execution is needed for basic metrics; observation suffices.\n\n*   **Grid Size:** All examples use 6x6 grids.\n*   **Vertical Line:** Present in all examples, always one column wide, defined by a single non-background color against the background. Colors: Blue (1), Green (3), Azure (8).\n*   **Horizontal Features:** Rows intersecting the vertical line contain either one non-background color (pure) or multiple (non-pure). Colors involved: Red (2), Yellow (4), Orange (7), Gray (5).\n*   **Intersection Types & Priority:**\n    *   Example 1: Pure intersection (Red row, intersect=Red) -> changes to Blue (Vertical color). *Code failed.*\n    *   Example 2: Non-pure intersection (Yellow/Green row, intersect=Green) -> changes to Yellow (Other horizontal color). *Code failed.*\n    *   Example 3: Pure intersection (Orange row, intersect=Orange) -> changes to Azure (Vertical color). *Code failed.*\n    *   Example 4: Has both a Pure (Gray row, intersect=Gray) and Non-pure (Gray/Azure row, intersect=Azure). Only the pure intersection changes -> Gray pixel becomes Azure (Vertical color). The non-pure intersection remains unchanged due to priority. *Code failed.*\n\nThe failures consistently occur at the point of applying the transformation, even when the prior analysis seems correct.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Identify the unique vertical line by finding the column index `C` and the single non-background color `V_color` present in that column (along with background color 0).\n3.  Initialize two empty lists: `pure_rule_changes` to store tuples `(row, col, new_color)` for pure intersections, and `non_pure_rule_changes` for non-pure intersections.\n4.  Iterate through each row index `R` of the grid.\n    a.  Let `intersect_color` be the color of the pixel at `input_grid[R, C]`.\n    b.  If `intersect_color` is the background color (0), skip to the next row.\n    c.  Determine the set of unique non-background colors present in the entire row `R`. Let this set be `unique_row_colors`.\n    d.  **Check for Pure Intersection Rule:** If `unique_row_colors` contains exactly one color (`H_color`) and `intersect_color` equals `H_color`, then record a required change for a pure intersection: add `(R, C, V_color)` to the `pure_rule_changes` list.\n    e.  **Check for Non-Pure Intersection Rule:** If `unique_row_colors` contains more than one color and `intersect_color` equals `V_color`:\n        i.
