task_description: Identify two distinct colored objects on a white background. One object remains stationary, while the other moves one step to the left, overwriting any pixels in its new path.
objects:
  - type: stationary_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels that does not change position.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0).
      - shape: Variable (L-shape, rectangle, U-shape seen).
      - position: Remains fixed from input to output.
  - type: moving_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels that changes position.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and different from the stationary object's color.
      - shape: Variable (L-shape, pixel, rectangle seen).
      - position: Shifts one column to the left in the output.
    identification_rule: Determined by comparing the top-left corners of the two objects. The object whose top-left corner (min_row, min_col) has a higher row index moves. If row indices are equal, the one with the higher column index moves.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The stationary and moving objects are initially touching or adjacent in the input grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    actor: system
    description: Find the two distinct non-white contiguous objects in the input grid.
  - action: determine_roles
    actor: system
    description: Compare the top-left corners of the objects to identify which is stationary and which is moving.
  - action: clear_original_position
    actor: moving_object
    target: input_grid_pixels
    description: Set the pixels originally occupied by the moving object to white (0) in the output grid.
  - action: move_left
    actor: moving_object
    target: output_grid_pixels
    description: Place the pixels of the moving object one column to the left of their original position in the output grid, overwriting existing pixel values at the destination.
transformation_rule:
  - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Pixels belonging to the identified moving object in the input grid are set to white (0) in the output grid.
  - For each pixel (row r, column c) that was part of the moving object in the input grid, the pixel at (row r, column c-1) in the output grid is set to the color of the moving object.
