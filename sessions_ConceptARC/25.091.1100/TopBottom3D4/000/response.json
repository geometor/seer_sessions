            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nEach training example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.\nThe grids contain a white background (0) and two distinct colored objects.\nThe objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (non-white).\nIn all examples, the two objects are adjacent or touching each other.\nThe transformation involves one of the objects moving relative to the other.\n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1.  **Object Interaction:** The core interaction seems to be a positional shift of one object.\n2.  **Identifying the Moving Object:** By comparing the input and output grids, we can identify which object changes its position.\n    *   Train 1: The blue object moves left.\n    *   Train 2: The green object moves left.\n    *   Train 3: The magenta object moves left.\n    *   Train 4: The blue object moves left.\n3.  **Identifying the Stationary Object:** The other object remains in its original place.\n    *   Train 1: The red object stays.\n    *   Train 2: The yellow object stays.\n    *   Train 3: The yellow object stays.\n    *   Train 4: The gray object stays.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:** The moving object consistently shifts exactly one pixel column to the left.\n5.  **Overlap Handling:** When the moving object shifts left, its pixels overwrite any pixels they move onto, whether those pixels were background (white) or part of the stationary object.\n6.  **Vacated Space:** The pixels previously occupied by the moving object become background (white).\n7.  **Determining Which Object Moves:** Let's analyze the relative positions. We can find the top-left corner (minimum row, minimum column) of each object's bounding box.\n    *   Train 1: Red (2,0), Blue (4,1). Blue moves (higher row index).\n    *   Train 2: Yellow (3,3), Green (5,5). Green moves (higher row index).\n    *   Train 3: Yellow (0,1), Magenta (2,3). Magenta moves (higher row index).\n    *   Train 4: Gray (2,2), Blue (3,3). Blue moves (higher row index).\n    The object whose top-left corner has the higher row index appears to be the moving object. If row indices were the same (not seen in examples, but good to consider), the one with the higher column index would likely move. Essentially, the object positioned relatively lower and/or further right is the one that moves left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
