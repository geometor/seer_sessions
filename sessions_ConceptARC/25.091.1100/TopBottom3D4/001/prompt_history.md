Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

Each training example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
The grids contain a white background (0) and two distinct colored objects.
The objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (non-white).
In all examples, the two objects are adjacent or touching each other.
The transformation involves one of the objects moving relative to the other.

**Detailed Observations:**

1.  **Object Interaction:** The core interaction seems to be a positional shift of one object.
2.  **Identifying the Moving Object:** By comparing the input and output grids, we can identify which object changes its position.
    *   Train 1: The blue object moves left.
    *   Train 2: The green object moves left.
    *   Train 3: The magenta object moves left.
    *   Train 4: The blue object moves left.
3.  **Identifying the Stationary Object:** The other object remains in its original place.
    *   Train 1: The red object stays.
    *   Train 2: The yellow object stays.
    *   Train 3: The yellow object stays.
    *   Train 4: The gray object stays.
4.  **Movement Pattern:** The moving object consistently shifts exactly one pixel column to the left.
5.  **Overlap Handling:** When the moving object shifts left, its pixels overwrite any pixels they move onto, whether those pixels were background (white) or part of the stationary object.
6.  **Vacated Space:** The pixels previously occupied by the moving object become background (white).
7.  **Determining Which Object Moves:** Let's analyze the relative positions. We can find the top-left corner (minimum row, minimum column) of each object's bounding box.
    *   Train 1: Red (2,0), Blue (4,1). Blue moves (higher row index).
    *   Train 2: Yellow (3,3), Green (5,5). Green moves (higher row index).
    *   Train 3: Yellow (0,1), Magenta (2,3). Magenta moves (higher row index).
    *   Train 4: Gray (2,2), Blue (3,3). Blue moves (higher row index).
    The object whose top-left corner has the higher row index appears to be the moving object. If row indices were the same (not seen in examples, but good to consider), the one with the higher column index would likely move. Essentially, the object positioned relatively lower and/or further right is the one that moves left.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify two distinct colored objects on a white background. One object remains stationary, while the other moves one step to the left, overwriting any pixels in its new path.
objects:
  - type: stationary_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels that does not change position.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0).
      - shape: Variable (L-shape, rectangle, U-shape seen).
      - position: Remains fixed from input to output.
  - type: moving_object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels that changes position.
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and different from the stationary object's color.
      - shape: Variable (L-shape, pixel, rectangle seen).
      - position: Shifts one column to the left in the output.
    identification_rule: Determined by comparing the top-left corners of the two objects. The object whose top-left corner (min_row, min_col) has a higher row index moves. If row indices are equal, the one with the higher column index moves.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The stationary and moving objects are initially touching or adjacent in the input grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    actor: system
    description: Find the two distinct non-white contiguous objects in the input grid.
  - action: determine_roles
    actor: system
    description: Compare the top-left corners of the objects to identify which is stationary and which is moving.
  - action: clear_original_position
    actor: moving_object
    target: input_grid_pixels
    description: Set the pixels originally occupied by the moving object to white (0) in the output grid.
  - action: move_left
    actor: moving_object
    target: output_grid_pixels
    description: Place the pixels of the moving object one column to the left of their original position in the output grid, overwriting existing pixel values at the destination.
transformation_rule:
  - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Pixels belonging to the identified moving object in the input grid are set to white (0) in the output grid.
  - For each pixel (row r, column c) that was part of the moving object in the input grid, the pixel at (row r, column c-1) in the output grid is set to the color of the moving object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid. There should be exactly two objects.
3.  For each object, find its color and the coordinates of all its pixels. Also, determine the coordinates of its top-left corner (minimum row, minimum column).
4.  Compare the top-left corners of the two objects. Identify the object with the higher row index as the "moving object". If the row indices are the same, identify the object with the higher column index as the "moving object". The other object is the "stationary object".
5.  Let the color of the moving object be `move_color`.
6.  Iterate through all the pixel coordinates (r, c) that belong to the moving object in the *input* grid.
7.  For each such pixel (r, c):
    a.  Change the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to white (0).
8.  Iterate again through all the pixel coordinates (r, c) that belong to the moving object in the *input* grid.
9.  For each such pixel (r, c):
    a.  Change the pixel at (r, c-1) in the *output* grid to `move_color`. (This overwrites whatever was previously at (r, c-1)).
10. Return the modified output grid.
