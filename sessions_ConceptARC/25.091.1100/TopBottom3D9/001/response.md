"""
Identify the background color (assumed to be 0) and the two non-background colors (C1, C2) in the input grid.

Check if there are any internal regions of the background color (holes) that are exclusively surrounded by only C1 or only C2.
A hole is a region of background color not connected to the grid's border.
Exclusive surrounding means all non-background pixels directly adjacent to the hole pixels have the same color (either all C1 or all C2).

Rule 1: If exactly one non-background color (e.g., C1) exclusively surrounds at least one background hole, replace all pixels of the other non-background color (C2) with C1. Similarly, if C2 exclusively surrounds a hole, replace C1 with C2.

Rule 2: If no non-background color exclusively surrounds a background hole (either no holes exist, or holes are bordered by both C1 and C2), then:
  a. Count the number of pixels for C1 and C2.
  b. Identify the color with the maximum pixel count (C_max) and the color with the minimum pixel count (C_min).
  c. Replace all pixels of C_max with C_min.
  d. If counts are equal, assume replacement based on color value (replace higher value color with lower value color, although this case is not explicitly covered by examples).

The background color pixels remain unchanged throughout the process.
Return the modified grid.
