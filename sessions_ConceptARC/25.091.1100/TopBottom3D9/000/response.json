These regions are adjacent to each other. The background color forms the main canvas and potentially small isolated regions (holes) within the non-background objects.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves a color replacement. One of the two non-background colors completely replaces the other non-background color in the output grid. The background color remains unchanged.\n5.  **Distinguishing Feature:** The key is to determine which non-background color replaces the other. This depends on specific properties of the color regions:\n    *   **Hole Enclosure:** In one example (train\\_2), one color region (yellow, 4) completely surrounds an internal region of the background color (a \"hole\"). This seems to be a deciding factor.\n    *   **Pixel Count:** In the absence of such a hole, the relative pixel counts of the two non-background colors appear to determine the replacement rule.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

One is the background color (typically white, 0), and the other two are non-background colors (let's call them Color A and Color B).\n2.  Examine the input grid to determine if any region of background-colored pixels exists that is *not* connected to the main outer background frame and is completely surrounded *only* by pixels of Color A. Perform the same check for Color B.\n3.  **Condition 1: Hole Enclosure:** If exactly one non-background color (e.g., Color A) exclusively surrounds such a background hole, then the transformation rule is: Replace all pixels of Color B with Color A.\n4.  **Condition 2: No Exclusive Hole Enclosure:** If neither Color A nor Color B exclusively surrounds a background hole (or if both do, or the hole borders both), then proceed as follows:\n    a.  Count the total number of pixels of Color A in the input grid.\n    b.  Count the total number of pixels of Color B in the input grid.\n    c.  Identify the color with the maximum pixel count (let's call it Color Max) and the color with the minimum pixel count (let's call it Color Min).\n    d.  The transformation rule is: Replace all pixels of Color Max with Color Min.\n5.  Pixels originally having the background color remain unchanged. Pixels originally having the \"replacing\" color (Color A in Condition 1, Color Min in Condition 2) also remain unchanged.\n6.  Output the modified grid."
