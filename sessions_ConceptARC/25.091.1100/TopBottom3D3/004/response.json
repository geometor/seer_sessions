            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the presence of two distinct non-background colors but incorrectly determined the rule for identifying which color serves as the 'frame' and which is 'inner'. The initial hypothesis relied on adjacency to the background, which failed because often both colors touch the background. The code failed because the logic to distinguish the colors was flawed, leading it to return the input grid unchanged.\n\nThe key insight comes from analyzing the *topology* of the color shapes. Calculating the number of connected components for each color reveals a consistent pattern: one color always forms a single contiguous object (1 component), while the other forms multiple disconnected components (2 components in all examples).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Adopt the component-counting method to distinguish the two colors. The color with 1 component is the 'inner' color, and the color with >1 component is the 'frame' color.\n2.  Revise the transformation rule: The output grid should contain the combined shape of *both* the inner and frame color pixels from the input, filled entirely with the 'frame' color. Background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n"
