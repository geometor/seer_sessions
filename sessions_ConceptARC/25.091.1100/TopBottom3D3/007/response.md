"""
The transformation identifies two distinct non-background colors in the input grid.
It distinguishes these colors based on the number of connected components each color forms (using 4-way adjacency).
One color ('inner_color') forms exactly one connected component, while the other ('frame_color') forms multiple disconnected components.
The output grid is created by taking the union of the pixels occupied by both the inner_color and frame_color in the input grid, 
and filling this combined area entirely with the 'frame_color'. Background pixels (0) remain unchanged.
