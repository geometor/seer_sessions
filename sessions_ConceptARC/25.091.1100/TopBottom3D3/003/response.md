"""
The transformation identifies two distinct non-background colors in the input grid.
One color acts as a 'frame' and the other as an 'inner' color.
The 'inner' color is defined as the non-background color where NONE of its pixels are adjacent (N, S, E, W) to the background color (0).
The 'frame' color is the other non-background color (which will have at least one pixel adjacent to the background).
The transformation replaces all pixels of the 'inner' color with the 'frame' color.
Pixels of the 'frame' color and background pixels remain unchanged.
