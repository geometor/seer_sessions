The modification depends on the presence of yellow (color 4) pixels within this boundary in the input and the coordinates of white (color 0) pixels inside. Specifically, if yellow pixels are present inside the boundary, certain white pixels within that boundary are changed to yellow based on a checkerboard pattern determined by coordinate parity. If no yellow pixels are initially inside the boundary, no changes are made.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
