*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input grid contains multiple distinct objects of different colors (yellow, gray, green) on a white background.
    *   These objects appear to be geometric shapes, specifically rectangles or variations thereof. Some are solid blocks of color, while others have a frame of color surrounding an interior area of white pixels.
    *   The output grid maintains the same dimensions and background color. The positions of the objects are also preserved.
    *   The transformation modifies the objects based on whether they were initially "solid" or "hollow".
    *   Objects that were initially hollow (like the top-left yellow rectangle and the bottom-left green 'C') have their internal white space filled with the object's color.
    *   Objects that were initially solid (like the top-right gray rectangle and the bottom-center yellow rectangle) have their internal pixels changed to white, effectively making them hollow frames.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Modifies objects based on whether they are solid or hollow. Hollow objects are filled, solid objects are hollowed out.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - background_color: white (0)
          - dimensions: constant between input and output
      - element: object
        properties:
          - type: contiguous block of non-white pixels
          - color: variable (yellow, gray, green observed)
          - shape: rectangular or partial rectangular observed
          - state: can be 'solid' or 'hollow'
            definition:
              hollow: contains enclosed white pixels (pixels surrounded only by the object's color)
              solid: does not contain enclosed white pixels
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_objects
        description: Find all contiguous blocks of the same non-white color.
      - action: classify_object_state
        description: Determine if an object is 'solid' or 'hollow' by checking for enclosed white pixels.
      - action: fill_hollow_object
        input: a hollow object
        output: object with its enclosed white pixels changed to the object's color.
      - action: hollow_solid_object
        input: a solid object
        output: object with its interior pixels (pixels surrounded only by the object's color) changed to white.
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: object_modification
        description: Each object in the input is transformed based on its 'state' (solid/hollow) to produce the corresponding object in the output. The transformation preserves the object's color and outer boundary.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a connected component of pixels having the same non-white color.
    3.  For each identified object:
        a.  Determine the color of the object.
        b.  Determine if the object is 'hollow' or 'solid'. An object is 'hollow' if it encloses one or more white pixels (i.e., there exist white pixels such that all their neighbors, including diagonals, are either part of the object or other enclosed white pixels). Otherwise, the object is 'solid'.
        c.  If the object is 'hollow':
            i.  Identify all the enclosed white pixels within this object.
            ii. Change the color of these enclosed white pixels in the output grid to the object's color.
        d.  If the object is 'solid':
            i.  Identify all the interior pixels of the object (pixels of the object's color that are only adjacent, including diagonals, to pixels of the same object).
            ii. Change the color of these interior object pixels in the output grid to white (0).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
