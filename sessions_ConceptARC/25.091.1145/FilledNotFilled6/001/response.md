"""
Modifies objects based on whether they are solid or hollow. 
Hollow objects are filled with their color, while solid objects have their interior pixels changed to white (hollowed out).

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct objects (connected components of non-white pixels).
3. For each object:
    a. Determine its color and the set of its pixel coordinates.
    b. Determine if the object is 'hollow' by checking for enclosed white pixels adjacent to the object.
    c. If hollow, fill the enclosed white pixels with the object's color in the output grid.
    d. If solid, identify the object's interior pixels (object pixels not adjacent to non-object pixels) and change them to white in the output grid.
4. Return the modified output grid.
