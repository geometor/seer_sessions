Some are solid blocks of color, while others have a frame of color surrounding an interior area of white pixels.\n    *   The output grid maintains the same dimensions and background color. The positions of the objects are also preserved.\n    *   The transformation modifies the objects based on whether they were initially \"solid\" or \"hollow\".\n    *   Objects that were initially hollow (like the top-left yellow rectangle and the bottom-left green 'C') have their internal white space filled with the object's color.\n    *   Objects that were initially solid (like the top-right gray rectangle and the bottom-center yellow rectangle) have their internal pixels changed to white, effectively making them hollow frames.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
