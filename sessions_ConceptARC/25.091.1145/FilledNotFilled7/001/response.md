"""
This transformation identifies a single non-white colored region within the input grid. 
It determines the bounding box of this region and counts the number of distinct rows 
within this box that contain the non-white color. 
If exactly two rows contain the color, the rectangular area between these two rows 
(and within the horizontal bounds of the region) is filled with the same color. 
If more than two rows contain the color, the rectangular area between the topmost 
and bottommost rows containing the color (excluding those rows themselves, and 
within the horizontal bounds) is filled with white (color 0). 
If only one row contains the color, or no non-white color exists, the grid remains unchanged.
