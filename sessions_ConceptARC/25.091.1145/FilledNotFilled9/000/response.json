The blue pixels act as a boundary or fence. If the boundary is complete, any white space inside gets filled. If the boundary is incomplete or there's no enclosed white space, the grid remains unchanged. The red pixels (2) already present within the boundary are not affected, nor are pixels outside the boundary.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
