*   **Perception:**
    The task involves identifying regions enclosed by blue pixels (1) and filling any white pixels (0) within those enclosed regions with red pixels (2). The blue pixels act as a boundary or fence. If the boundary is complete, any white space inside gets filled. If the boundary is incomplete or there's no enclosed white space, the grid remains unchanged. The red pixels (2) already present within the boundary are not affected, nor are pixels outside the boundary.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_enclosed_region
    elements:
      - object: background
        color: 0 # white
        role: fillable_space/exterior
      - object: border
        color: 1 # blue
        role: boundary
      - object: interior_fill
        color: 2 # red
        role: existing_fill/fill_color
    actions:
      - identify_boundary: Find the structure formed by blue (1) pixels.
      - identify_regions: Determine areas enclosed by the blue boundary.
      - flood_fill: Fill white (0) pixels within the identified enclosed regions.
    transformation_rule:
      - If a white (0) pixel is fully enclosed by a boundary of blue (1) pixels (possibly including existing red (2) pixels as part of the inside), change its color to red (2).
      - Enclosed means there is no path from the white pixel to the edge of the grid consisting solely of white pixels.
    relationships:
      - containment: Blue pixels define regions that contain red and potentially white pixels.
      - adjacency: The filling process depends on the adjacency of white pixels to the boundary and other interior pixels.
    unchanged_elements:
      - Blue (1) pixels.
      - Red (2) pixels already present in the input.
      - White (0) pixels not enclosed by the blue boundary.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are connected to the border of the grid through a path of only white (0) pixels. Mark these as "exterior" white pixels. Use a flood fill or similar connectivity algorithm starting from all white pixels on the grid's edges (top, bottom, left, right).
    2.  Identify all remaining white (0) pixels that were not marked as "exterior". These are the "interior" or "enclosed" white pixels.
    3.  Change the color of all identified "interior" white (0) pixels to red (2).
    4.  Leave all other pixels (blue, existing red, and "exterior" white) unchanged.
    5.  Output the modified grid.
```python
"""
Identify all white (0) pixels that are connected to the border of the grid through a path of only white (0) pixels (exterior white pixels). 
Change the color of all remaining white (0) pixels (interior or enclosed white pixels) to red (2).

## General Assessment

The previous code attempt, based on filling a bounding box derived from all non-white pixels, failed on three out of four examples. It incorrectly filled white pixels that were outside the intended "enclosed" area but inside the overall bounding box. The initial flood-fill hypothesis also proved incorrect when tested, as it didn't account for the specific way white pixels were filled in examples 2 and 4.

A revised analysis, prompted by the failures, identified a pattern of horizontal filling. Specifically, white pixels are filled *between* the leftmost and rightmost blue pixels within each row, provided that row contains at least two blue pixels.

A code-based test (`analyze_example_horizontal_fill`) confirmed that this "horizontal fill between blue posts" logic correctly reproduces the output for all four training examples. This revised strategy appears robust for the given examples.

## Metrics

Metrics gathered using the `analyze_example_horizontal_fill` function support the horizontal fill hypothesis:

*   **Consistency:** The logic (`horizontal_fill_logic_matches_output`) successfully predicted the output grid for all 4 training examples.
*   **Row-based Operation:** The transformation only affects rows containing two or more blue pixels (`rows_with_>=2_blue`).
    *   Example 1: Rows 1-8 affected.
    *   Example 2: Rows 0-4 affected.
    *   Example 3: Rows 1-7 affected.
    *   Example 4: Rows 4-12 affected.
*   **Targeted Filling:** Within affected rows, only white pixels strictly between the minimum (`min_blue_col`) and maximum (`max_blue_col`) blue pixel column indices are changed to red.
    *   Example 1: No white pixels were found between the blue boundaries in affected rows (`input_white_coords_between` is empty), resulting in no changes, matching the output.
    *   Example 2: White pixels were found and filled in rows 0 and 1 (`input_white_coords_between` matches `output_red_coords_between`). Rows 2, 3, 4 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.
    *   Example 3: No white pixels were found between blue boundaries in affected rows.
    *   Example 4: White pixels were found and filled in rows 4 and 5. Rows 6-12 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.

properties:
  - scope: row_based # Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: requires_markers # A row must contain at least two blue (1) pixels to be modified.
  - range: horizontal_extent # The fill range is between the leftmost and rightmost blue (1) pixels in a row.
actions:
  - scan_rows: Iterate through each row of the grid.
  - find_markers: In the current row, locate all blue (1) pixels.
  - check_condition: Proceed only if two or more blue (1) pixels are found in the row.
  - define_range: Determine the minimum (`min_col`) and maximum (`max_col`) column indices of the blue (1) pixels.
  - fill_horizontal_segment: For each column `c` where `min_col < c < max_col`, if the input pixel at `(row, c)` is white (0), change it to red (2).
transformation_rule:
  - Process the grid one row at a time.
  - For each row, identify the column positions of all blue (1) pixels.
  - If a row contains fewer than two blue pixels, it remains unchanged.
  - If a row contains two or more blue pixels, find the column index of the leftmost blue pixel (`min_col`) and the rightmost blue pixel (`max_col`).
  - Change the color of all white (0) pixels located at `(row, c)` where `min_col < c < max_col` to red (2).
unchanged_elements:
  - Blue (1) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels already present.
  - White (0) pixels in rows with fewer than two blue (1) pixels.
  - White (0) pixels in columns less than or equal to `min_col` or greater than or equal to `max_col` in rows that *do* contain two or more blue pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row index `r` from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row `r`:
    a.  Find the list of column indices `blue_cols` where the pixel value is blue (1).
    b.  If the number of elements in `blue_cols` is less than 2, continue to the next row.
    c.  Otherwise (if there are 2 or more blue pixels):
        i.  Determine the minimum value in `blue_cols`, let it be `min_c`.
        ii. Determine the maximum value in `blue_cols`, let it be `max_c`.
        iii. Iterate through column indices `c` starting from `min_c + 1` up to (but not including) `max_c`.
        iv. Check the value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original input* grid.
        v.  If the value is white (0), set the value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to red (2).
4.  Return the final output grid.
