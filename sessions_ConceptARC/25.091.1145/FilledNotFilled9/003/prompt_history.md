*   **Perception:**
    The task involves identifying regions enclosed by blue pixels (1) and filling any white pixels (0) within those enclosed regions with red pixels (2). The blue pixels act as a boundary or fence. If the boundary is complete, any white space inside gets filled. If the boundary is incomplete or there's no enclosed white space, the grid remains unchanged. The red pixels (2) already present within the boundary are not affected, nor are pixels outside the boundary.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: fill_enclosed_region
    elements:
      - object: background
        color: 0 # white
        role: fillable_space/exterior
      - object: border
        color: 1 # blue
        role: boundary
      - object: interior_fill
        color: 2 # red
        role: existing_fill/fill_color
    actions:
      - identify_boundary: Find the structure formed by blue (1) pixels.
      - identify_regions: Determine areas enclosed by the blue boundary.
      - flood_fill: Fill white (0) pixels within the identified enclosed regions.
    transformation_rule:
      - If a white (0) pixel is fully enclosed by a boundary of blue (1) pixels (possibly including existing red (2) pixels as part of the inside), change its color to red (2).
      - Enclosed means there is no path from the white pixel to the edge of the grid consisting solely of white pixels.
    relationships:
      - containment: Blue pixels define regions that contain red and potentially white pixels.
      - adjacency: The filling process depends on the adjacency of white pixels to the boundary and other interior pixels.
    unchanged_elements:
      - Blue (1) pixels.
      - Red (2) pixels already present in the input.
      - White (0) pixels not enclosed by the blue boundary.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are connected to the border of the grid through a path of only white (0) pixels. Mark these as "exterior" white pixels. Use a flood fill or similar connectivity algorithm starting from all white pixels on the grid's edges (top, bottom, left, right).
    2.  Identify all remaining white (0) pixels that were not marked as "exterior". These are the "interior" or "enclosed" white pixels.
    3.  Change the color of all identified "interior" white (0) pixels to red (2).
    4.  Leave all other pixels (blue, existing red, and "exterior" white) unchanged.
    5.  Output the modified grid.
```python
"""
Identify all white (0) pixels that are connected to the border of the grid through a path of only white (0) pixels (exterior white pixels). 
Change the color of all remaining white (0) pixels (interior or enclosed white pixels) to red (2).

## General Assessment

The initial code, based on a flood-fill from the border to identify 'exterior' white pixels, correctly solved examples 1 and 3 but failed on examples 2 and 4. The failures occurred because the 'boundary' formed by blue (1) pixels was not topologically complete in those cases, yet the expected output showed white pixels being filled with red (2).

This indicates the initial interpretation of "enclosed" was too strict. The transformation is not based on flood-fill enclosure but rather on filling white space *within the rectangular area defined by the extents of the non-white pixels*.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify all non-white pixels (blue=1, red=2).
2.  Determine the minimum bounding box containing these non-white pixels.
3.  Iterate through all pixels *within* this bounding box.
4.  If a pixel inside the bounding box is white (0), change its color to red (2).
5.  Leave all other pixels (non-white pixels inside the box, and all pixels outside the box) unchanged.

*Bounding box calculated using the provided `get_bounding_box` function.*
*White Pixels Filled is the count of pixels that change from 0 in the input to 2 in the output.*

The failures in examples 2 and 4 correspond exactly to the cases where white pixels exist *inside* the calculated bounding box of the non-white pixels.

actions:
  - identify_structure_pixels: Find all pixels with color 1 or 2.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the min/max row and column indices from the structure pixels.
  - fill_within_box: Iterate through all pixels within the calculated bounding box.
transformation_rule:
  - If a pixel is within the calculated bounding box and its color is white (0), change its color to red (2).
  - All other pixels remain unchanged (structure pixels within the box, and all pixels outside the box).
relationships:
  - containment: The bounding box contains a subset of the grid's pixels.
unchanged_elements:
  - Blue (1) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels already present in the input.
  - White (0) pixels outside the calculated bounding box.
edge_cases:
  - If there are no non-white pixels (grid is all white), the bounding box is undefined, and the grid remains unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (0). These are the "structure pixels" (colors blue=1 and red=2).
2.  If no structure pixels are found, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by any of the structure pixels. This defines the "bounding box".
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel location (`r`, `c`) within the bounding box (where `min_row <= r <= max_row` and `min_col <= c <= max_col`).
6.  For each pixel within the bounding box, check if its color in the *input* grid is white (0).
7.  If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) is white (0) and within the bounding box, change its color to red (2) in the *output* grid.
8.  Pixels outside the bounding box, and non-white pixels inside the bounding box, remain unchanged in the output grid.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
