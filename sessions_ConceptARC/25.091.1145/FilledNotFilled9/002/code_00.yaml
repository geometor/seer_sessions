elements:
  - object: background
    color: 0 # white
    role: potential_fill_space
  - object: structure_pixels
    color: [1, 2] # blue, red

  - object: bounding_box
    definition: Smallest rectangle containing all structure_pixels (1 and 2).
    properties: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
actions:
  - identify_structure_pixels: Find all pixels with color 1 or 2.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the min/max row and column indices from the structure pixels.
  - fill_within_box: Iterate through all pixels within the calculated bounding box.
transformation_rule:
  - If a pixel is within the calculated bounding box and its color is white (0), change its color to red (2).
  - All other pixels remain unchanged (structure pixels within the box, and all pixels outside the box).
relationships:
  - containment: The bounding box contains a subset of the grid's pixels.
unchanged_elements:
  - Blue (1) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels already present in the input.
  - White (0) pixels outside the calculated bounding box.
edge_cases:
  - If there are no non-white pixels (grid is all white), the bounding box is undefined, and the grid remains unchanged.
