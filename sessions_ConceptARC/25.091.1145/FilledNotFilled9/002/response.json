            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code, based on a flood-fill from the border to identify 'exterior' white pixels, correctly solved examples 1 and 3 but failed on examples 2 and 4. The failures occurred because the 'boundary' formed by blue (1) pixels was not topologically complete in those cases, yet the expected output showed white pixels being filled with red (2).\n\nThis indicates the initial interpretation of \"enclosed\" was too strict. The transformation is not based on flood-fill enclosure but rather on filling white space *within the rectangular area defined by the extents of the non-white pixels*.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify all non-white pixels (blue=1, red=2).\n2.  Determine the minimum bounding box containing these non-white pixels.\n3.  Iterate through all pixels *within* this bounding box.\n4.  If a pixel inside the bounding box is white (0), change its color to red (2).\n5.  Leave all other pixels (non-white pixels inside the box, and all pixels outside the box) unchanged.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Colors  | Output Colors | Bounding Box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) | White Pixels Filled | Code Matches Expected |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |\n| 1       | 10x13       | 10x13        | 0, 1, 2       | 0, 1, 2       | (1, 8, 1, 10)                             | 0                     | Yes (Original Code)   |\n| 2       | 7x13        | 7x13         | 0, 1, 2       | 0, 1, 2       | (0, 5, 2, 10)                             | 14                    | No (Original Code)    |\n| 3       | 10x9        | 10x9         | 0, 1, 2       | 0, 1, 2       | (1, 7, 0, 5)                              | 0                     | Yes (Original Code)   |\n| 4       | 13x14       | 13x14        | 0, 1, 2       | 0, 1, 2       | (4, 12, 0, 13)                            | 24                    | No (Original Code)    |\n\n*Bounding box calculated using the provided `get_bounding_box` function.*\n*White Pixels Filled is the count of pixels that change from 0 in the input to 2 in the output.*\n\nThe failures in examples 2 and 4 correspond exactly to the cases where white pixels exist *inside* the calculated bounding box of the non-white pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
