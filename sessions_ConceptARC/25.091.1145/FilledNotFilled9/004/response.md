## General Assessment

The previous code attempt, based on filling a bounding box derived from all non-white pixels, failed on three out of four examples. It incorrectly filled white pixels that were outside the intended "enclosed" area but inside the overall bounding box. The initial flood-fill hypothesis also proved incorrect when tested, as it didn't account for the specific way white pixels were filled in examples 2 and 4.

A revised analysis, prompted by the failures, identified a pattern of horizontal filling. Specifically, white pixels are filled *between* the leftmost and rightmost blue pixels within each row, provided that row contains at least two blue pixels.

A code-based test (`analyze_example_horizontal_fill`) confirmed that this "horizontal fill between blue posts" logic correctly reproduces the output for all four training examples. This revised strategy appears robust for the given examples.

## Metrics

Metrics gathered using the `analyze_example_horizontal_fill` function support the horizontal fill hypothesis:

*   **Consistency:** The logic (`horizontal_fill_logic_matches_output`) successfully predicted the output grid for all 4 training examples.
*   **Row-based Operation:** The transformation only affects rows containing two or more blue pixels (`rows_with_>=2_blue`).
    *   Example 1: Rows 1-8 affected.
    *   Example 2: Rows 0-4 affected.
    *   Example 3: Rows 1-7 affected.
    *   Example 4: Rows 4-12 affected.
*   **Targeted Filling:** Within affected rows, only white pixels strictly between the minimum (`min_blue_col`) and maximum (`max_blue_col`) blue pixel column indices are changed to red.
    *   Example 1: No white pixels were found between the blue boundaries in affected rows (`input_white_coords_between` is empty), resulting in no changes, matching the output.
    *   Example 2: White pixels were found and filled in rows 0 and 1 (`input_white_coords_between` matches `output_red_coords_between`). Rows 2, 3, 4 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.
    *   Example 3: No white pixels were found between blue boundaries in affected rows.
    *   Example 4: White pixels were found and filled in rows 4 and 5. Rows 6-12 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.

properties:
  - scope: row_based # Transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition: requires_markers # A row must contain at least two blue (1) pixels to be modified.
  - range: horizontal_extent # The fill range is between the leftmost and rightmost blue (1) pixels in a row.
actions:
  - scan_rows: Iterate through each row of the grid.
  - find_markers: In the current row, locate all blue (1) pixels.
  - check_condition: Proceed only if two or more blue (1) pixels are found in the row.
  - define_range: Determine the minimum (`min_col`) and maximum (`max_col`) column indices of the blue (1) pixels.
  - fill_horizontal_segment: For each column `c` where `min_col < c < max_col`, if the input pixel at `(row, c)` is white (0), change it to red (2).
transformation_rule:
  - Process the grid one row at a time.
  - For each row, identify the column positions of all blue (1) pixels.
  - If a row contains fewer than two blue pixels, it remains unchanged.
  - If a row contains two or more blue pixels, find the column index of the leftmost blue pixel (`min_col`) and the rightmost blue pixel (`max_col`).
  - Change the color of all white (0) pixels located at `(row, c)` where `min_col < c < max_col` to red (2).
unchanged_elements:
  - Blue (1) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels already present.
  - White (0) pixels in rows with fewer than two blue (1) pixels.
  - White (0) pixels in columns less than or equal to `min_col` or greater than or equal to `max_col` in rows that *do* contain two or more blue pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row index `r` from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row `r`:
    a.  Find the list of column indices `blue_cols` where the pixel value is blue (1).
    b.  If the number of elements in `blue_cols` is less than 2, continue to the next row.
    c.  Otherwise (if there are 2 or more blue pixels):
        i.  Determine the minimum value in `blue_cols`, let it be `min_c`.
        ii. Determine the maximum value in `blue_cols`, let it be `max_c`.
        iii. Iterate through column indices `c` starting from `min_c + 1` up to (but not including) `max_c`.
        iv. Check the value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original input* grid.
        v.  If the value is white (0), set the value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to red (2).
4.  Return the final output grid.
