            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt, based on filling a bounding box derived from all non-white pixels, failed on three out of four examples. It incorrectly filled white pixels that were outside the intended \"enclosed\" area but inside the overall bounding box. The initial flood-fill hypothesis also proved incorrect when tested, as it didn't account for the specific way white pixels were filled in examples 2 and 4.\n\nA revised analysis, prompted by the failures, identified a pattern of horizontal filling. Specifically, white pixels are filled *between* the leftmost and rightmost blue pixels within each row, provided that row contains at least two blue pixels.\n\nA code-based test (`analyze_example_horizontal_fill`) confirmed that this \"horizontal fill between blue posts\" logic correctly reproduces the output for all four training examples. This revised strategy appears robust for the given examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using the `analyze_example_horizontal_fill` function support the horizontal fill hypothesis:\n\n*   **Consistency:** The logic (`horizontal_fill_logic_matches_output`) successfully predicted the output grid for all 4 training examples.\n*   **Row-based Operation:** The transformation only affects rows containing two or more blue pixels (`rows_with_>=2_blue`).\n    *   Example 1: Rows 1-8 affected.\n    *   Example 2: Rows 0-4 affected.\n    *   Example 3: Rows 1-7 affected.\n    *   Example 4: Rows 4-12 affected.\n*   **Targeted Filling:** Within affected rows, only white pixels strictly between the minimum (`min_blue_col`) and maximum (`max_blue_col`) blue pixel column indices are changed to red.\n    *   Example 1: No white pixels were found between the blue boundaries in affected rows (`input_white_coords_between` is empty), resulting in no changes, matching the output.\n    *   Example 2: White pixels were found and filled in rows 0 and 1 (`input_white_coords_between` matches `output_red_coords_between`). Rows 2, 3, 4 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.\n    *   Example 3: No white pixels were found between blue boundaries in affected rows.\n    *   Example 4: White pixels were found and filled in rows 4 and 5. Rows 6-12 had blue boundaries but no white pixels between them.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
