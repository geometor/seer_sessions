The provided code implemented an 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) flood fill to identify exterior white pixels. However, in `train_4`, the internal white pixels are diagonally connected to the exterior white area. This suggests that the flood fill should use 4-way connectivity (horizontal and vertical only) to correctly identify enclosed regions. The strategy is to modify the identification logic to use 4-way connectivity and verify this resolves the failure in `train_4` while maintaining correctness for the other examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity in `train_4` more closely.\n\nInput `train_4`:\n"
