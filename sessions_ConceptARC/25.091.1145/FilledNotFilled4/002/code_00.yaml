task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within yellow shapes with yellow, where enclosure is defined by 4-way connectivity.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_color: yellow (4)
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous block of yellow pixels forming a boundary.
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    description: Areas of white pixels. Categorized as 'exterior' (connected to grid boundary via 4-way paths) or 'interior' (not connected to boundary via 4-way paths).
transformations:
  - action: fill
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: yellow (4)
    condition: The white pixel belongs to an 'interior' region.
identification_logic:
  - method: region_connectivity
    description: Identify white regions connected to the grid boundary. Any white pixels not connected to the boundary are considered enclosed ('interior').
    connectivity: Uses 4-way connectivity (horizontal and vertical only) between pixels of the same color (white).
unchanged_condition:
  - If no white regions are identified as 'interior', the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - Yellow pixels and 'exterior' white pixels remain unchanged.
