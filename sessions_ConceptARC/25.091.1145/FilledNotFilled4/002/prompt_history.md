Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming grids containing white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. In some examples (train\_2, train\_4), the transformation involves filling areas of white pixels that are enclosed within the yellow shape. In other examples (train\_1, train\_3), where the yellow shape doesn't seem to enclose any white areas, the output grid is identical to the input grid. The core operation appears to be identifying and filling enclosed white regions within a yellow boundary.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within yellow shapes with yellow.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_color: yellow (4)
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous block of yellow pixels. Can be solid or contain internal white pixels.
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    description: Areas of white pixels. Can be external (background) or internal (potentially enclosed by yellow).
transformations:
  - action: fill
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: yellow (4)
    condition: The white pixel belongs to a region completely enclosed by yellow pixels.
identification_logic:
  - method: region_connectivity
    description: Identify white regions connected to the grid boundary. Any white pixels not connected to the boundary are considered enclosed.
    connectivity: Allows horizontal, vertical, and diagonal movement between pixels of the same color (white).
unchanged_condition:
  - If no white regions are fully enclosed by yellow, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all white pixels (color 0) that are located on the boundary (edges) of the input grid.
3.  Perform a flood fill starting from these boundary white pixels. Mark all reachable white pixels (moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally through other white pixels) as "exterior".
4.  Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
5.  If a pixel is white (color 0) and has *not* been marked as "exterior" by the flood fill, change its color to yellow (color 4) in the output grid.
6.  Leave all other pixels (yellow pixels and "exterior" white pixels) unchanged in the output grid.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

def transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Transforms the input grid by filling enclosed white regions within yellow shapes with yellow.

    The transformation identifies white pixels (color 0) that are connected to the boundary of the grid
    using 8-way connectivity (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Any white pixel that is not
    connected to the boundary is considered enclosed by the yellow shape (color 4) or other enclosed
    white regions. These enclosed white pixels are then changed to yellow (color 4).

    If there are no enclosed white regions, the output grid will be identical to the input grid.
