task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within yellow shapes with yellow.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_color: yellow (4)
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous block of yellow pixels. Can be solid or contain internal white pixels.
  - type: region
    color: white (0)
    description: Areas of white pixels. Can be external (background) or internal (potentially enclosed by yellow).
transformations:
  - action: fill
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: yellow (4)
    condition: The white pixel belongs to a region completely enclosed by yellow pixels.
identification_logic:
  - method: region_connectivity
    description: Identify white regions connected to the grid boundary. Any white pixels not connected to the boundary are considered enclosed.
    connectivity: Allows horizontal, vertical, and diagonal movement between pixels of the same color (white).
unchanged_condition:
  - If no white regions are fully enclosed by yellow, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
