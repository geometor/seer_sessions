In some examples (train\\_2, train\\_4), the transformation involves filling areas of white pixels that are enclosed within the yellow shape. In other examples (train\\_1, train\\_3), where the yellow shape doesn't seem to enclose any white areas, the output grid is identical to the input grid. The core operation appears to be identifying and filling enclosed white regions within a yellow boundary.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
