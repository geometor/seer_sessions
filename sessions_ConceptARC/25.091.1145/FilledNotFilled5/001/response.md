"""
This program transforms a grid containing a single non-background colored object.
If the object is 'hollow' (contains background-colored pixels fully enclosed within its shape), it fills these enclosed areas with the object's color.
If the object is 'solid' (does not contain enclosed background-colored pixels), it hollows the object out, keeping only the perimeter pixels of the object's color and changing the interior pixels to the background color.
The background color is assumed to be 0 (white).
