Okay, let's break down the perception and logic for this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
    *   The input grids primarily consist of a background color (`white` - 0).
    *   There is one prominent foreground color in each example (`magenta` - 6 in `train_1`, `green` - 3 in `train_2`).
    *   In `train_1`, the `magenta` pixels are sparsely distributed, forming a disconnected pattern.
    *   In `train_2`, the `green` pixels form a single, connected object â€“ a filled diamond shape.

2.  **Output Grid Analysis:**
    *   The output grids also have a `white` background and use the same foreground color as their corresponding inputs.
    *   In `train_1`, the output shows a solid, filled `magenta` diamond shape. The original input pixels seem to lie on or within the boundary of this output diamond.
    *   In `train_2`, the output shows only the outline or perimeter of the `green` diamond shape seen in the input. The interior pixels of the input diamond have been turned `white`.

3.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The task appears to involve geometric shapes, specifically diamonds aligned with the grid axes (like those defined by Manhattan distance).
    *   There seem to be two distinct modes of operation based on the input's structure:
        *   **Mode 1 (Fill/Complete):** If the input pixels are scattered points, the transformation finds the smallest diamond shape enclosing all these points and fills it completely with the input color. (`train_1` demonstrates this).
        *   **Mode 2 (Hollow/Perimeter):** If the input pixels already form a filled diamond shape, the transformation removes the interior pixels, leaving only the perimeter of the diamond in the input color. (`train_2` demonstrates this).
    *   The key is distinguishing between scattered points and a pre-filled diamond in the input.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: "Transforms input based on whether non-background pixels form scattered points or a filled diamond."
grid_elements:
  - type: background
    color_value: 0
    color_name: white
  - type: shape_pixels
    color_value: non-zero (e.g., 6/magenta, 3/green)
    role: defines or constitutes a diamond shape
input_patterns:
  - type: scattered_points
    description: Non-background pixels are sparse and potentially disconnected.
    example: train_1 input
  - type: filled_diamond
    description: Non-background pixels form a single connected component representing a solid diamond shape (defined by Manhattan distance from a center).
    example: train_2 input
transformations:
  - condition: input pattern is scattered_points
    action: compute and fill bounding diamond
    steps:
      - Identify the non-background color (C).
      - Find all pixels with color C (InputPixels).
      - Calculate the minimal bounding diamond (center (rc, cc), radius k) enclosing InputPixels based on Manhattan distance.
      - Generate the set of all pixels within this diamond (FilledDiamondPixels).
      - Output grid: color pixels in FilledDiamondPixels with C, others white.
  - condition: input pattern is filled_diamond
    action: extract perimeter of the diamond
    steps:
      - Identify the non-background color (C).
      - Identify the set of input pixels forming the diamond (InputPixels). (This set should match the theoretical FilledDiamondPixels calculated as above).
      - Output grid: Keep only those pixels from InputPixels that are adjacent (8-way) to at least one pixel *not* in InputPixels (i.e., background or outside the grid). Color these perimeter pixels C, others white.
relationships:
  - The output shape is directly derived from the spatial arrangement of the input's non-background pixels.
  - The transformation applied depends on the classification of the input pattern (scattered vs. filled diamond).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single non-`white` color (let's call it `ShapeColor`) present in the input grid. If no such color exists, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  Locate all pixels having `ShapeColor`. Let the set of their coordinates be `InputShapePixels`.
3.  Calculate the parameters (center `(rc, cc)` and radius `k`) of the smallest diamond shape (defined using Manhattan distance: `|row - rc| + |col - cc| <= k`) that perfectly encloses all coordinates in `InputShapePixels`.
    *   *Detail: Calculate center `(rc, cc)` based on the midpoint of the bounding box of `InputShapePixels`. Calculate radius `k` as the maximum Manhattan distance from `(rc, cc)` to any pixel in `InputShapePixels`.*
4.  Generate the set of all coordinates (`TheoreticalDiamondPixels`) that fall within the calculated diamond (`|row - rc| + |col - cc| <= k`).
5.  Compare the set `InputShapePixels` with the set `TheoreticalDiamondPixels`.
6.  **If** `InputShapePixels` is *not* identical to `TheoreticalDiamondPixels` (i.e., the input was scattered or incomplete):
    a. Create a new output grid of the same size, filled with `white`.
    b. For each coordinate in `TheoreticalDiamondPixels`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to `ShapeColor`.
7.  **Else** (i.e., `InputShapePixels` *is* identical to `TheoreticalDiamondPixels`, meaning the input was a filled diamond):
    a. Create a new output grid of the same size, filled with `white`.
    b. Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `TheoreticalDiamondPixels`.
    c. Check if `(r, c)` has at least one 8-directionally adjacent neighbor `(nr, nc)` such that `(nr, nc)` is *not* in `TheoreticalDiamondPixels` (or is outside the grid bounds).
    d. If such a neighbor exists (meaning `(r, c)` is on the perimeter), set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `ShapeColor`.
8.  Return the final output grid.
