            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception and logic for this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**\n    *   The input grids primarily consist of a background color (`white` - 0).\n    *   There is one prominent foreground color in each example (`magenta` - 6 in `train_1`, `green` - 3 in `train_2`).\n    *   In `train_1`, the `magenta` pixels are sparsely distributed, forming a disconnected pattern.\n    *   In `train_2`, the `green` pixels form a single, connected object \u2013 a filled diamond shape.\n\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:**\n    *   The output grids also have a `white` background and use the same foreground color as their corresponding inputs.\n    *   In `train_1`, the output shows a solid, filled `magenta` diamond shape. The original input pixels seem to lie on or within the boundary of this output diamond.\n    *   In `train_2`, the output shows only the outline or perimeter of the `green` diamond shape seen in the input. The interior pixels of the input diamond have been turned `white`.\n\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The task appears to involve geometric shapes, specifically diamonds aligned with the grid axes (like those defined by Manhattan distance).\n    *   There seem to be two distinct modes of operation based on the input's structure:\n        *   **Mode 1 (Fill/Complete):** If the input pixels are scattered points, the transformation finds the smallest diamond shape enclosing all these points and fills it completely with the input color. (`train_1` demonstrates this).\n        *   **Mode 2 (Hollow/Perimeter):** If the input pixels already form a filled diamond shape, the transformation removes the interior pixels, leaving only the perimeter of the diamond in the input color. (`train_2` demonstrates this).\n    *   The key is distinguishing between scattered points and a pre-filled diamond in the input.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
