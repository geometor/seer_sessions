## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully solved the first training example (`train_1`), which involved filling scattered points into the minimal bounding diamond. However, it failed on the second example (`train_2`), which required hollowing a filled diamond.

The failure in `train_2` occurred because the perimeter identification logic (`_is_perimeter`) kept not only the outermost layer but also the layer immediately inside it. The transformed output had 10 extra pixels compared to the expected output.

The strategy is to refine the definition of the "perimeter" for the hollowing operation. Instead of selecting pixels adjacent to the background, the correct approach seems to be selecting pixels that lie exactly on the boundary defined by the calculated `u,v` bounds (where `u = row + col`, `v = row - col`). Pixels on the perimeter satisfy `r+c == min_u` or `r+c == max_u` or `r-c == min_v` or `r-c == max_v`.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's gather metrics using the provided code structure and analyze the failure case.
