"""
Transforms an input grid based on a diamond shape derived from its non-background pixels.

The transformation identifies the single non-background color (ShapeColor) and the set of pixels with this color (InputShapePixels).
It calculates the minimum and maximum values for u = row + col and v = row - col based on InputShapePixels.
Using these bounds (min_u, max_u, min_v, max_v), it generates a theoretical set of pixels (TheoreticalDiamondPixels) within the grid that satisfy min_u <= r+c <= max_u, min_v <= r-c <= max_v, and where r+c and r-c have the same parity.

If InputShapePixels is identical to TheoreticalDiamondPixels, the input is considered a 'perfect' filled diamond. The output grid will contain only the perimeter pixels of this diamond, colored with ShapeColor. A perimeter pixel is one within the diamond that has at least one 8-directionally adjacent neighbor outside the diamond or outside the grid bounds.

If InputShapePixels is not identical to TheoreticalDiamondPixels (e.g., the input pixels are scattered or form an incomplete diamond), the output grid will be the completely filled TheoreticalDiamondPixels, colored with ShapeColor.

The background color is assumed to be 0.
