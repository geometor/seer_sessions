            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed on both training examples, indicating a fundamental issue in how the \"diamond\" shape is being calculated or defined based on the input pixels.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The output diamond generated by the code is different from the target output. Specifically, the code's diamond seems shifted or incorrectly sized. This points to an error in the `_calculate_diamond_params_from_bbox` function, which uses the simple bounding box midpoint and extent. This method doesn't guarantee finding the *minimal* bounding diamond in terms of Manhattan distance.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The output perimeter generated by the code is incorrect. Since the perimeter calculation relies on the set of `theoretical_diamond_pixels`, the error likely originates from the same incorrect diamond parameter calculation as in Example 1. The logic for determining the perimeter (`_is_perimeter`) might be correct, but it operates on the wrong set of base pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Diamond Calculation:** Replace the bounding-box-based diamond parameter calculation (`_calculate_diamond_params_from_bbox`) with a method that correctly finds the minimal bounding diamond based on Manhattan distance. This involves finding the center `(rc, cc)` and radius `k` such that `max(|r - rc| + |c - cc|)` over all input pixels `(r, c)` is minimized. A robust way to do this involves transforming coordinates to `u = r + c` and `v = r - c` and finding the center and radius in that space, then transforming back.\n2.  **Verify Calculation:** Use `tool_code` to apply the *current* and the *revised* diamond calculation logic to the input pixels of both examples and compare the resulting parameters (center, radius) and generated pixel sets (`theoretical_diamond_pixels`) against the expected shapes.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected diamond calculation method.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the current code's behavior on the examples.\n\n"

It yields radius 4 for Example 1 and 3 for Example 2.\n*   For Example 1, the generated diamond (center (4,6), radius 4) has 41 pixels, while the expected output has 39 pixels. The generated diamond does not match the expected one. Even the visually estimated parameters (which matched the bbox calculation) don't produce the correct pixel set. This strongly suggests the definition of the target diamond might not be simply the *minimal* bounding diamond based on Manhattan distance from a single center point calculated from the bbox. Let's reconsider the diamond definition. Perhaps it's the diamond defined by the `min/max` of `r+c` and `r-c`.\n*   For Example 2, the input shape has 23 pixels. The bounding box method generates a diamond (center (3,4), radius 3) with 25 pixels. Critically, `generated_diamond_2 != pixels_2`. This means the crucial step `is_perfect_diamond_input = (input_shape_pixels == theoretical_diamond_pixels)` would evaluate to `False`, causing the code to incorrectly try to *fill* the diamond instead of hollowing it. Furthermore, the generated diamond doesn't even match the input shape, confirming the calculation is wrong.\n\n**Revised Diamond Calculation Approach:**\n\nLet's use the `u = r+c`, `v = r-c` method. The diamond is defined by `min_u <= r+c <= max_u` and `min_v <= r-c <= max_v`, where the mins/maxs are taken over the input pixels. The center is `rc = (u_center + v_center) / 2`, `cc = (u_center - v_center) / 2`, where `u_center = (min_u + max_u) / 2` and `v_center = (min_v + max_v) / 2`. The \"radius\" in Manhattan distance terms isn't straightforward here, but we can directly generate the pixels within the `u, v` bounds.\n\n"
