The output grid will contain only the boundary pixels of this diamond, colored with ShapeColor. A boundary pixel is one within the diamond that satisfies r+c = min_u OR r+c = max_u OR r-c = min_v OR r-c = max_v.\n\nIf InputShapePixels is not identical to TheoreticalDiamondPixels (e.g., the input pixels are scattered or form an incomplete diamond), the output grid will be the completely filled TheoreticalDiamondPixels, colored with ShapeColor.\n\nThe background color is assumed to be 0.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_shape_pixels(grid: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[Optional[int], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:\n    \"\"\"Finds the non-background color and coordinates of shape pixels.\"\"\"\n    # Find coordinates where the grid is not equal to the background color (0)\n    non_background_indices = np.where(grid != 0)\n    \n    # If no non-background pixels are found, return None for color and an empty set\n    if len(non_background_indices[0]) == 0:\n        return None, set()\n\n    # Extract the coordinates as a set of (row, col) tuples\n    pixel_coords = set(zip(non_background_indices[0], non_background_indices[1]))\n    \n    # Get the color of the first non-background pixel found (assuming only one color)\n    shape_color = int(grid[non_background_indices[0][0], non_background_indices[1][0]])\n    \n    return shape_color, pixel_coords\n\ndef _calculate_uv_bounds(pixels: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the min/max bounds for u=r+c and v=r-c.\"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return None # No pixels, no bounds\n    # Calculate u = r+c for all pixels\n    u_coords = [r + c for r, c in pixels]\n    # Calculate v = r-c for all pixels\n    v_coords = [r - c for r, c in pixels]\n    # Return the min/max of u and v\n    return min(u_coords), max(u_coords), min(v_coords), max(v_coords)\n\ndef _generate_diamond_pixels_uv(uv_bounds: Tuple[int, int, int, int], grid_shape: Tuple[int, int]) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Generates pixels within the diamond defined by u,v bounds.\"\"\"\n    min_u, max_u, min_v, max_v = uv_bounds\n    rows, cols = grid_shape\n    diamond_pixels = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through all grid pixels\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            u = r + c\n            v = r - c\n            # Check if the pixel's u,v fall within the calculated bounds\n            # Also need parity check: u and v must have the same parity\n            # This is automatically true if r and c are integers:\n            # u+v = 2r (even), u-v = 2c (even).
