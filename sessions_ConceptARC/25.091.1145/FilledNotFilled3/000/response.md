Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels, set against a white background.
2.  **Objects:** The objects are typically simple geometric shapes (squares, rectangles) and can be solid or hollow. Some objects appear to contain smaller objects of a different color within their boundaries.
3.  **Colors:** Various colors (green, blue, yellow, orange, magenta, azure, gray, maroon) are used for the objects. The background is always white.
4.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are significantly smaller than the inputs.
    *   In examples 1 and 3, the output is a single pixel (1x1 grid) of a specific non-white color (blue and gray, respectively).
    *   In example 2, the output is a 2x2 grid of white pixels.
5.  **Relationship:** The output seems related to a specific configuration within the input grid. In examples 1 and 3, the output color matches the color of a small object completely enclosed within a larger object of a different non-white color. In example 1, a blue pixel is inside a green shape. In example 3, a gray pixel is inside an azure shape. In example 2, no such enclosure of a non-white object within another non-white object exists (the yellow shape encloses white pixels). The 2x2 white output appears to be the default case when the specific enclosure condition is not met.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify an object B completely enclosed within another object A, where A and B have different non-white colors, and output the color of B. If no such enclosure exists, output a 2x2 white grid.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - enclosed: An object B is enclosed by object A if all pixels adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel of B are either part of B itself or part of A.
  - background_color: white (0)

examples:
  - example_index: 1
    input_features:
      - object_A: color=green (3), shape=square
      - object_B: color=blue (1), shape=pixel
      - relationship: object_B is enclosed by object_A
      - other_objects:
        - color=yellow (4), shape=square
        - color=orange (7), shape=square
    output_feature:
      - grid: [[1]] # color of enclosed object B (blue)
  - example_index: 2
    input_features:
      - object_A: color=yellow (4), shape=hollow_square, encloses=white(0)
      - other_objects:
        - color=yellow (4), shape=rectangle
        - color=magenta (6), shape=square
      - relationship: No non-white object encloses another non-white object.
    output_feature:
      - grid: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] # Default output when enclosure condition not met.
  - example_index: 3
    input_features:
      - object_A: color=azure (8), shape=square
      - object_B: color=gray (5), shape=pixel
      - relationship: object_B is enclosed by object_A
      - other_objects:
        - color=green (3), shape=rectangle
        - color=maroon (9), shape=square
    output_feature:
      - grid: [[5]] # color of enclosed object B (gray)

constraints:
  - The enclosing object (A) and the enclosed object (B) must both be non-white.
  - The enclosing object (A) and the enclosed object (B) must have different colors.
  - There appears to be at most one such enclosure pair (A, B) per input grid in the examples.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects made of non-white pixels.
2.  Iterate through all pairs of identified non-white objects, let's call them object A and object B.
3.  Check if the color of object A is different from the color of object B.
4.  If the colors are different, check if object B is completely enclosed by object A. This means that every pixel directly or diagonally adjacent to any pixel of object B must either be another pixel of object B or a pixel of object A.
5.  If such a pair (A, B) is found where B is enclosed by A:
    *   Create a 1x1 output grid containing the color of the enclosed object B.
    *   Stop searching and return this grid.
6.  If, after checking all pairs, no such enclosed object B is found:
    *   Create a 2x2 output grid filled entirely with the white color (0).
    *   Return this grid.
