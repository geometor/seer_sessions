            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels, set against a white background.\n2.  **Objects:** The objects are typically simple geometric shapes (squares, rectangles) and can be solid or hollow. Some objects appear to contain smaller objects of a different color within their boundaries.\n3.  **Colors:** Various colors (green, blue, yellow, orange, magenta, azure, gray, maroon) are used for the objects. The background is always white.\n4.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are significantly smaller than the inputs.\n    *   In examples 1 and 3, the output is a single pixel (1x1 grid) of a specific non-white color (blue and gray, respectively).\n    *   In example 2, the output is a 2x2 grid of white pixels.\n5.  **Relationship:** The output seems related to a specific configuration within the input grid. In examples 1 and 3, the output color matches the color of a small object completely enclosed within a larger object of a different non-white color. In example 1, a blue pixel is inside a green shape. In example 3, a gray pixel is inside an azure shape. In example 2, no such enclosure of a non-white object within another non-white object exists (the yellow shape encloses white pixels). The 2x2 white output appears to be the default case when the specific enclosure condition is not met.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
