*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a grid containing several distinct objects composed of colored pixels on a white (0) background.
    *   Each object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
    *   The output is a single integer, which corresponds to one of the colors present in the input grid's objects.
    *   The relationship between input and output seems to depend on the properties of these colored objects, specifically their size (number of pixels).
    *   Comparing the sizes of the objects in each example, the output color consistently corresponds to the object with the smallest size (fewest pixels).
    *   In `train_1`, there's a tie for the smallest size (6 pixels) between the magenta (6) object and the green (3) object. The output is 6. This suggests a tie-breaking rule. Comparing color values, 6 > 3.
    *   In `train_2`, the yellow (4) object has the minimum size (4 pixels). Output is 4.
    *   In `train_3`, the maroon (9) object has the minimum size (4 pixels). Output is 9.
    *   The consistent pattern appears to be: find the object(s) with the minimum pixel count. If there's only one such object, output its color. If there's a tie (multiple objects share the minimum size), output the color with the highest numerical value among those tied objects.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Identify a specific color based on object properties.
    Input: Grid containing colored objects on a white background.
    Output: A single integer representing a color.
    Elements:
      - name: Grid
        type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - name: Pixel
        type: Integer (0-9) representing a color. White (0) is background.
      - name: Object
        definition: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
        properties:
          - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels comprising the object.
          - size: The total number of pixels in the object.
          - position: Coordinates of the pixels belonging to the object.
    Relationships:
      - Objects are distinct entities within the grid.
      - The task focuses on comparing the 'size' property of different objects.
    Transformation:
      - Identify all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
      - Calculate the size (pixel count) for each identified object.
      - Determine the minimum size among all objects.
      - Filter the objects to find all those that have this minimum size.
      - From the filtered set of minimum-sized objects, select the one whose color has the highest numerical value.
      - The output is the color value of the selected object.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous groups of connected, non-white pixels. Each such group constitutes an "object". Record the color and count the number of pixels (size) for each object.
    2.  Find the minimum size recorded among all identified objects.
    3.  Identify all objects whose size is equal to this minimum size.
    4.  From this set of minimum-sized objects, determine the one whose color has the largest integer value.
    5.  Return the integer color value of that object as the output.
