The output is 6. This suggests a tie-breaking rule. Comparing color values, 6 > 3.\n    *   In `train_2`, the yellow (4) object has the minimum size (4 pixels). Output is 4.\n    *   In `train_3`, the maroon (9) object has the minimum size (4 pixels). Output is 9.\n    *   The consistent pattern appears to be: find the object(s) with the minimum pixel count. If there's only one such object, output its color. If there's a tie (multiple objects share the minimum size), output the color with the highest numerical value among those tied objects.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
