Okay, let's break down this task.

### Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 2D grids containing a white background (color 0) and several distinct shapes (objects) made of contiguous blocks of single colors (1-9).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are smaller 2D grids filled entirely with the white background color (0).
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to determine the correct dimensions (height and width) for the output grid based on properties of the objects found in the input grid. The content of the output grid is always uniform white.
4.  **Key Observations:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple colored objects.
    *   The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples.
    *   The output dimensions do not seem directly related to the input grid dimensions, the total number of objects, or the simple count of distinct colors.
    *   There appears to be a relationship between the numerical value of an object's color and its geometric properties (specifically, its bounding box height and width).
5.  **Identifying Relevant Objects:** Through analysis, two specific objects in the input seem crucial:
    *   **The "Height-Matched" Object:** There is a unique object in each input grid where its color's numerical value is exactly equal to the height of its bounding box.
    *   **The "Minimum Color" Object:** This is the object whose color has the lowest numerical value among all colored objects in the input grid (excluding the background color 0).
6.  **Determining Output Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are derived from these two key objects:
    *   The **height** of the output grid is determined by the bounding box height of the "Minimum Color" object.
    *   The **width** of the output grid is determined by the bounding box width of the "Height-Matched" object.

### Factual Documentation


```yaml
task_description: Determine the dimensions of a uniform white output grid based on properties of specific objects within the input grid.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color (value > 0).
  - background: Pixels with color 0 (white).
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
    - properties:
      - height: Number of rows spanned by the bounding box.
      - width: Number of columns spanned by the bounding box.
  - color_value: The numerical integer value (1-9) representing an object's color.

input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - objects: Multiple distinct colored objects on a white background.

output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - content: Uniformly filled with the background color (0).
  - dimensions: Height and width determined by specific input object properties.

key_objects_identification:
  - height_matched_object:
      description: The unique object where its color_value equals its bounding_box.height.
      property_used: bounding_box.width (W_target)
  - min_color_object:
      description: The object with the minimum color_value among all objects in the input.
      property_used: bounding_box.height (H_min)

transformation_rule:
  - step 1: Identify all distinct colored objects (color > 0) in the input grid.
  - step 2: For each object, calculate its color_value, bounding_box.height, and bounding_box.width.
  - step 3: Uniquely identify the 'height_matched_object' (where color_value == bounding_box.height) and note its bounding_box.width (W_target).
  - step 4: Identify the 'min_color_object' (with the minimum color_value) and note its bounding_box.height (H_min).
  - step 5: Create the output grid with dimensions H_min x W_target.
  - step 6: Fill the output grid entirely with the background color (0).

  - example 1:
      objects: {Blue(1,h=3,w=4), Red(2,h=3,w=3), Green(3,h=3,w=2)}
      height_matched: Green(3), W_target=2
      min_color: Blue(1), H_min=3
      output_dims: 3x2 -> Matches
  - example 2:
      objects: {Yellow(4,h=4,w=4), Orange(7,h=6,w=3), Azure(8,h=3,w=3)}
      height_matched: Yellow(4), W_target=4
      min_color: Yellow(4), H_min=4
      output_dims: 4x4 -> Matches
  - example 3:
      objects: {Red(2,h=5,w=3), Yellow(4,h=4,w=3), Magenta(6,h=3,w=5), Azure(8,h=3,w=3)}
      height_matched: Yellow(4), W_target=3
      min_color: Red(2), H_min=5
      output_dims: 5x3 -> Matches

### Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find all distinct groups of connected, non-background pixels (these are the objects).
2.  For every object found, determine its color (the numerical value C), and calculate
