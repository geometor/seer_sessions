            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n### Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 2D grids containing a white background (color 0) and several distinct shapes (objects) made of contiguous blocks of single colors (1-9).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are smaller 2D grids filled entirely with the white background color (0).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to determine the correct dimensions (height and width) for the output grid based on properties of the objects found in the input grid. The content of the output grid is always uniform white.\n4.  **Key Observations:**\n    *   Each input grid contains multiple colored objects.\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples.\n    *   The output dimensions do not seem directly related to the input grid dimensions, the total number of objects, or the simple count of distinct colors.\n    *   There appears to be a relationship between the numerical value of an object's color and its geometric properties (specifically, its bounding box height and width).\n5.  **Identifying Relevant Objects:** Through analysis, two specific objects in the input seem crucial:\n    *   **The \"Height-Matched\" Object:** There is a unique object in each input grid where its color's numerical value is exactly equal to the height of its bounding box.\n    *   **The \"Minimum Color\" Object:** This is the object whose color has the lowest numerical value among all colored objects in the input grid (excluding the background color 0).\n6.  **Determining Output Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are derived from these two key objects:\n    *   The **height** of the output grid is determined by the bounding box height of the \"Minimum Color\" object.\n    *   The **width** of the output grid is determined by the bounding box width of the \"Height-Matched\" object.\n\n### Factual Documentation\n\n"
