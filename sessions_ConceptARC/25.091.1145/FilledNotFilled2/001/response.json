Scan the input grid to find all distinct groups of connected, non-background pixels (objects).\n2.  For each object, determine its color (C) and calculate the height (H) and width (W) of its bounding box.\n3.  Identify the unique object where its color value C equals its bounding box height H. Record its bounding box width (W_target).\n4.  Identify the object with the minimum color value C among all objects. Record its bounding box height (H_min).\n5.  Create a new grid with dimensions H_min rows and W_target columns.\n6.  Fill this new grid entirely with the background color (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies connected components (objects) of the same non-background color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are colors (1-9) and values are lists of\n        lists of (row, col) coordinates for each object of that color.\n        e.g., {color: [[(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...], [(r3, c3), ...]]}\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool)\n    objects_by_color = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            # If not background and not visited yet, start a flood fill\n            if color != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                object_pixels = []\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.pop(0)\n                    object_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    \n                    # Explore neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                if object_pixels:\n                     objects_by_color[color].append(object_pixels)\n\n    return objects_by_color\n\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box for a set of pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        pixels: A list of (row, col) coordinates for an object.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return None\n    rows = [r for r, c in pixels]\n    cols = [c for r, c in pixels]\n    return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)\n\ndef get_object_properties(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all objects and calculates their properties (color, height, width).\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, each representing an object with keys:\n        'color', 'height', 'width', 'pixels'.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects_data = []\n    objects_by_color = find_objects(grid)\n\n    for color, object_list in objects_by_color.items():\n        for pixels in object_list:\n            if not pixels:\n                continue\n            min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = get_bounding_box(pixels)\n            height = max_r - min_r + 1\n            width = max_c - min_c + 1\n            objects_data.append({\n                'color': color,\n                'height': height,\n                'width': width,\n                'pixels': pixels # Store pixels if needed later, though not for this task\n            })\n    return objects_data\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the identified rules.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid_list: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid_list, dtype=int)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Find objects and calculate their properties\n    all_objects = get_object_properties(input_grid)\n\n    if not all_objects:\n         # Handle cases with no colored objects (though unlikely based on examples)\n         # Return a minimal 1x1 white grid as a default?
