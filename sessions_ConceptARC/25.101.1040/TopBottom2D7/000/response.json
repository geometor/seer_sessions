The input grids contain at least one blue object and one green object, represented by contiguous pixels of value 1 (blue) or 3 (green), respectively, on a white (0) background. The output grid consists solely of the selected object, cropped to its minimum bounding box. The selection criterion appears to be based on which object is located higher in the grid (i.e., has the minimum row index for its topmost pixel).\n\n**Facts:**\n"

Compare the topmost row indices of all objects. Select the object with the smallest topmost row index. (If multiple objects share the same minimum topmost row index, the provided examples don't specify a tie-breaking rule, but based on the examples, it seems only one object is highest).\n4.  Determine the bounding box of the selected object (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).\n5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box size.\n6.  Copy the pixels of the selected object from the input grid into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box."
