Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels with values 0 (white), 1 (blue), 3 (green).
  - Contains distinct objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels.
  - In the examples, there are always at least one blue object and one green object.
  - Objects can be lines, rectangles, or single pixels.

Output Grid:
  - Contains pixels from only one of the non-white objects present in the input.
  - Represents the selected object cropped to its bounding box.

Transformation:
  - Identifies all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  - Determines the topmost row index for each identified object.
  - Selects the object whose topmost row index is the minimum (i.e., the object highest in the grid).
  - Creates the output grid by extracting the pixels corresponding to the selected object, maintaining their relative positions within the object's bounding box.
