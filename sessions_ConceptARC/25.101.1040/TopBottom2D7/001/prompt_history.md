**Perception:**
The task involves identifying distinct colored objects (blue and green) within an input grid and selecting one based on its vertical position. The input grids contain at least one blue object and one green object, represented by contiguous pixels of value 1 (blue) or 3 (green), respectively, on a white (0) background. The output grid consists solely of the selected object, cropped to its minimum bounding box. The selection criterion appears to be based on which object is located higher in the grid (i.e., has the minimum row index for its topmost pixel).

**Facts:**

```yaml
Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels with values 0 (white), 1 (blue), 3 (green).
  - Contains distinct objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels.
  - In the examples, there are always at least one blue object and one green object.
  - Objects can be lines, rectangles, or single pixels.

Output Grid:
  - Contains pixels from only one of the non-white objects present in the input.
  - Represents the selected object cropped to its bounding box.

Transformation:
  - Identifies all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  - Determines the topmost row index for each identified object.
  - Selects the object whose topmost row index is the minimum (i.e., the object highest in the grid).
  - Creates the output grid by extracting the pixels corresponding to the selected object, maintaining their relative positions within the object's bounding box.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify all contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each group represents an object. Record the color and the coordinates of all pixels for each object.
2.  For each identified object, determine its topmost row index (the minimum row index among all its pixels).
3.  Compare the topmost row indices of all objects. Select the object with the smallest topmost row index. (If multiple objects share the same minimum topmost row index, the provided examples don't specify a tie-breaking rule, but based on the examples, it seems only one object is highest).
4.  Determine the bounding box of the selected object (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).
5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions matching the bounding box size.
6.  Copy the pixels of the selected object from the input grid into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box.
