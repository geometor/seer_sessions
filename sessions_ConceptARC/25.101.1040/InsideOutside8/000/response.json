Each example features a background color (white, 0) and at least two other colors. One non-background color appears more frequently ('deleter' color, D) and another appears less frequently ('target' color, T).\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be:\n1.  Identify the most frequent non-background color (D) and the second most frequent non-background color (T).\n2.  Remove all pixels of color D.\n3.  Remove all pixels of color T that are located on the border of the grid.\n4.  Remove all pixels of color T that are located in the interior of the grid but have two or more neighbors (including diagonals) of color D.\n5.  Keep only the pixels of color T that are located in the interior of the grid AND have either zero or one neighbor of color D.\n6.  All other pixels become the background color (white, 0).\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Background: 0 (white)\n*   Colors: 3 (green, count=6), 4 (yellow, count=36)\n*   Deleter (D): 4 (yellow)\n*   Target (T): 3 (green)\n*   Green pixels at (0,5), (0,8), (7,11), (12,0) are on the border -> removed.\n*   Green pixel at (4,4) is interior, has 0 yellow neighbors -> kept.\n*   Green pixel at (9,8) is interior, has 0 yellow neighbors -> kept.\n*   Result: Only greens at (4,4) and (9,8) remain.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Background: 0 (white)\n*   Colors: 8 (azure, count=5), 6 (magenta, count=11)\n*   Deleter (D): 6 (magenta)\n*   Target (T): 8 (azure)\n*   Azure pixel at (0,1) is on the border -> removed.\n*   Azure pixel at (10,3) is on the border -> removed.\n*   Azure pixel at (1,8) is interior, has 3 magenta neighbors -> removed.\n*   Azure pixel at (3,4) is interior, has 0 magenta neighbors -> kept.\n*   Azure pixel at (4,5) is interior, has 1 magenta neighbor (at 5,6) -> kept.\n*   Azure pixel at (9,7) is interior, has 3 magenta neighbors -> removed.\n*   Result: Only azures at (3,4) and (4,5) remain.\n\nThe perception matches the outputs for both examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
