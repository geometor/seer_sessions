objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
      is_border_pixel: boolean
      neighbors: list of 8 neighboring pixels (or fewer for edge/corner pixels)
  - type: color_group
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      pixel_locations: list of (row, column)
      count: integer
      frequency_rank: integer (among non-background colors)

roles:
  - deleter_color (D): The non-background color with the highest frequency.
  - target_color (T): The non-background color with the second highest frequency.

relationships:
  - adjacency: 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) between pixels.
  - border_status: A pixel is on the border if its row or column index is 0 or the maximum index for the grid.
  - neighbor_color_count: For a target pixel, the count of its neighbors that have the deleter color.

actions:
  - count_colors: Determine the frequency of each non-background color.
  - identify_roles: Assign D and T based on frequency counts.
  - filter_pixels:
      - Iterate through each pixel of the target color (T).
      - Check if the pixel is on the border.
      - Check the number of neighbors with the deleter color (D).
      - Keep the pixel (copy to output grid) only if it is NOT on the border AND has 0 or 1 D-colored neighbors.
  - generate_output: Create a new grid of the same size, initially filled with the background color, and place the kept T pixels.
