Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (assumed to be 0).
2.  Count the frequency of all non-background colors in the input grid.
3.  Identify the 'deleter' color (D) as the non-background color with the highest frequency.
4.  Identify the 'target' color (T) as the non-background color with the second highest frequency. If fewer than two non-background colors exist, return an empty grid (all background).
5.  Calculate the counts of D (`count_D`) and T (`count_T`).
6.  Determine if the count of D is more than double the count of T: `high_frequency_ratio = (count_D > 2 * count_T)`.
7.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
8.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
9.  If a pixel has the 'target' color (T):
    a. Check if it's on the border of the grid. Border pixels are always removed.
    b. If it's *not* on the border (it's an interior pixel):
        i.  Count its 8 neighbors (including diagonals) that have the 'deleter' color (D) -> `deleter_neighbor_count`.
        ii. Count its 8 neighbors that have the 'target' color (T) -> `target_neighbor_count`.
        iii. Apply the keep condition: The pixel is kept (copied to the output grid) if `deleter_neighbor_count == 0` AND (`target_neighbor_count >= 1` OR `high_frequency_ratio` is true).
10. Return the output grid.
