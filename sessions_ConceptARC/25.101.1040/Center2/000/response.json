The goal is to determine a single output number based on the frequency of occurrence of the numbers within the input sequence. The core idea seems to be identifying the numbers that appear least frequently and then selecting one of those based on its numerical value relative to others with the same minimum frequency.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
