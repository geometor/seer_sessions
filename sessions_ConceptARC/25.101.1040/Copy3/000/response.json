            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both examples involve transforming a grid into another grid of the *same dimensions*.\n2.  **Example 1 (train_1)**:\n    *   The input grid has a width of 16 (even).\n    *   Various patterns (yellow 'L' shapes, a blue dotted line, a green bar, small yellow dots/lines) exist, mostly concentrated on the left half (columns 0-7).\n    *   The output grid appears to be created by taking the left half of the input grid (columns 0-7) and copying it onto the right half (columns 8-15), overwriting the original content of the right half. The left half remains unchanged.\n3.  **Example 2 (train_2)**:\n    *   The input grid has a width of 13 (odd).\n    *   It contains several distinct objects/patterns: magenta rectangles, a complex shape made of green, yellow, and orange pixels ('Object A') on the left, and scattered orange pixels and magenta rectangles on the right.\n    *   The output grid shows that 'Object A' from the left side (specifically, the content within the bounding box from row 2, col 0 to row 7, col 2) has been copied to a new location starting at row 5, col 6.\n    *   The original content at the destination location (mostly white space, but including some orange pixels) is overwritten by the copied pattern. Other elements, like the magenta rectangles, remain in their original positions.\n4.  **Key Difference**: The transformation logic seems to differ based on some property of the input grid. In train_1 (even width, no magenta), a simple half-grid copy occurs. In train_2 (odd width, contains magenta), a specific complex pattern is identified and copied to a location possibly determined by a magenta marker object. The copy destination in train_2 appears related to the magenta `6 6` block at (3, 6) in the input, with the copy starting 2 rows below it.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine the width `W` of the grid.\n    b. Define the left half of the grid as columns from 0 to `W/2 - 1`.\n    c. Define the right half of the grid as columns from `W/2` to `W - 1`.\n    d. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    e. For each row `r` from 0 to `height - 1`:\n        i. For each column `c` from 0 to `W/2 - 1`:\n            - Set the pixel value at `(r, c + W/2)` in the output grid to the value of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n3.  **If magenta pixels are present**:\n    a. Identify all connected components of non-white pixels. Find the component `P` that is the \"main pattern\" (heuristic: largest bounding box area containing non-magenta colors, as seen in example 2). Determine the bounding box of `P`: `(min_row_P, min_col_P)` to `(max_row_P, max_col_P)`.\n    b. Identify all magenta objects/pixels. Find the specific \"marker\" magenta object `M` (heuristic: the top-most magenta object whose column is greater than `max_col_P` and whose row is closest to `min_row_P`, as seen in example 2). Let the top-left corner of `M` be `(row_M, col_M)`.\n    c. Calculate the destination top-left corner `(dest_row, dest_col)` as `(row_M + 2, col_M)`.\n    d. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    e. Iterate through the pixels within the bounding box of the source pattern `P`. For each source pixel at `(r_src, c_src)` within the bounding box (where `r_src` ranges from `min_row_P` to `max_row_P`, and `c_src` ranges from `min_col_P` to `max_col_P`):\n        i. Calculate the corresponding destination coordinates: `(r_dest, c_dest) = (dest_row + (r_src - min_row_P), dest_col + (c_src - min_col_P))`.\n        ii. If `(r_dest, c_dest)` is within the grid boundaries, set the pixel value at `(r_dest, c_dest)` in the output grid to the value of the pixel at `(r_src, c_src)` in the input grid.\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
