# Analysis of the transformation process across examples

# Example 1:
Input_Objects:
  - Object: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Location: Surrounds the main shape.
  - Object: Shape
    Color: azure (8)
    Structure: Large rectangle.
  - Object: Key_Pixels
    Color: red (2)
    Count: 2
    Locations: [(2, 5), (6, 5)] # row, col
    Alignment: Vertical (share column 5)
Output_Change:
  Action: Fill_Column
  Target: Column 0
  Color: red (2)
  Relationship: Triggered by vertical alignment of Key_Pixels.

# Example 2:
Input_Objects:
  - Object: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Location: Surrounds the main shape.
  - Object: Shape
    Color: yellow (4)
    Structure: Diamond-like.
  - Object: Key_Pixels
    Color: red (2)
    Count: 2
    Locations: [(3, 6), (5, 6)]
    Alignment: Vertical (share column 6)
Output_Change:
  Action: Fill_Column
  Target: Column 0
  Color: red (2)
  Relationship: Triggered by vertical alignment of Key_Pixels.

# Example 3:
Input_Objects:
  - Object: Background
    Color: white (0)
    Location: Surrounds the main shape.
  - Object: Shape
    Color: green (3)
    Structure: G-like/Spiral.
  - Object: Key_Pixels
    Color: red (2)
    Count: 2
    Locations: [(4, 1), (4, 5)]
    Alignment: Horizontal (share row 4)
Output_Change:
  Action: Fill_Row
  Target: Row 0
  Color: red (2)
  Relationship: Triggered by horizontal alignment of Key_Pixels.

# General Observation:
- The transformation identifies the alignment (horizontal or vertical) of all red (2) pixels present in the input.
- If all red pixels share the same row index, the first row (index 0) of the output grid is filled with red (2).
- If all red pixels share the same column index, the first column (index 0) of the output grid is filled with red (2).
- All other pixels retain their original color and position from the input grid.
