The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with one significant modification: either the first row (row 0) or the first column (column 0) is entirely filled with red pixels (2).\n\nThe determining factor for whether the first row or the first column is modified appears to be the spatial arrangement of the red pixels in the input grid.\n- In examples 1 and 2, the red pixels are vertically aligned (share the same column index). In the corresponding outputs, the first column (column 0) is filled with red.\n- In example 3, the red pixels are horizontally aligned (share the same row index). In the corresponding output, the first row (row 0) is filled with red.\n\nThe transformation rule seems to be:\n1.  Locate all red pixels (2) in the input grid.\n2.  Determine if all these red pixels lie on the same row or the same column.\n3.  If they lie on the same row, modify the input grid by changing all pixels in the first row (row 0) to red (2).\n4.  If they lie on the same column, modify the input grid by changing all pixels in the first column (column 0) to red (2).\n5.  If there are no red pixels, or if they do not all share the same row or column, the output is likely identical to the input (though this case is not explicitly shown).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
