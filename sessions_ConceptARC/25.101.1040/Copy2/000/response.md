Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Composition:** Each input grid contains two distinct, separate objects placed on a white background (color 0).
2.  **Object 1 (Pattern Object):** This object has varying shapes and colors (red/yellow cross in example 1, magenta/blue diamond in example 2). It appears relatively small.
3.  **Object 2 (Frame Object):** This object is consistently a hollow rectangle made of azure pixels (color 8). It is larger than the Pattern Object.
4.  **Output Grid Transformation:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with one key addition: a copy of the Pattern Object appears inside the hollow space of the Frame Object.
5.  **Placement:** The copied Pattern Object seems to be placed centrally within the white space enclosed by the Frame Object.
6.  **No Modification:** The original Pattern Object and the Frame Object remain unchanged in their original positions in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
Version: 1.0
Objects:
  - id: pattern_object
    description: A contiguous shape composed of non-white pixels, not being the azure frame. Its specific shape and colors vary between examples.
    attributes:
      colors: [present_colors] # e.g., [red, yellow] or [magenta, blue]
      shape: variable # e.g., cross, diamond
      size: variable # e.g., 3x3, 5x5
      location: variable # e.g., top-left region
  - id: frame_object
    description: A hollow rectangle acting as a frame.
    attributes:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: hollow_rectangle
      size: variable, but larger than pattern_object # e.g., 7x7 outer dimensions
      location: variable, distinct from pattern_object # e.g., bottom-right region
  - id: background
    description: The empty space surrounding and separating the objects.
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
  - id: hollow_space
    description: The area inside the frame_object, initially filled with the background color.
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      location: bounded by frame_object
      size: determined by frame_object's inner dimensions

Relationships:
  - type: separation
    objects: [pattern_object, frame_object]
    details: Separated by background pixels in the input.
  - type: containment
    objects: [frame_object, hollow_space]
    details: The frame_object encloses the hollow_space.
  - type: transformation_target
    objects: [hollow_space]
    details: This is the area where the copied pattern will be placed.
  - type: transformation_source
    objects: [pattern_object]
    details: This object's pattern is copied.

Actions:
  - action: identify
    objects: [pattern_object, frame_object, hollow_space]
    details: Locate and determine the properties (bounding box, pixels) of each key object/area.
  - action: copy
    source: pattern_object
    details: Create a duplicate of the pattern_object's pixel data relative to its bounding box.
  - action: place
    target: hollow_space
    object_to_place: copy_of_pattern_object
    details: Position the copied pattern within the hollow_space, centered horizontally and vertically.
  - action: compose_output
    details: Start with the input grid, then overlay the placed copy_of_pattern_object into the hollow_space.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels.
3.  Distinguish the "Frame Object," which is the hollow rectangle made entirely of azure (8) pixels.
4.  Identify the "Pattern Object," which is the other non-white object found in step 2.
5.  Determine the bounding box of the Pattern Object.
6.  Determine the bounding box of the "Hollow Space" within the Frame Object (the rectangular area of white pixels fully enclosed by the azure pixels).
7.  Calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the Pattern Object's bounding box.
8.  Calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the Hollow Space's bounding box.
9.  Calculate the top-left coordinates (`target_row`, `target_col`) within the output grid where the Pattern Object should be placed so it appears centered within the Hollow Space.
    *   `target_row = hollow_space_top_row + floor((hollow_space_height - pattern_object_height) / 2)`
    *   `target_col = hollow_space_left_col + floor((hollow_space_width - pattern_object_width) / 2)`
10. Iterate through each pixel (`r`, `c`) within the Pattern Object's bounding box in the input grid.
11. If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid belongs to the Pattern Object (i.e., is not white), copy its color value to the output grid at the corresponding position relative to the calculated target coordinates: `output[target_row + (r - pattern_object_top_row)][target_col + (c - pattern_object_left_col)]`.
12. Return the modified output grid.
