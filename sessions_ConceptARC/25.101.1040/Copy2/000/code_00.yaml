Objects:
  - id: pattern_object
    description: A contiguous shape composed of non-white pixels, not being the azure frame. Its specific shape and colors vary between examples.
    attributes:
      colors: [present_colors] # e.g., [red, yellow] or [magenta, blue]
      shape: variable # e.g., cross, diamond
      size: variable # e.g., 3x3, 5x5
      location: variable # e.g., top-left region
  - id: frame_object
    description: A hollow rectangle acting as a frame.
    attributes:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: hollow_rectangle
      size: variable, but larger than pattern_object # e.g., 7x7 outer dimensions
      location: variable, distinct from pattern_object # e.g., bottom-right region
  - id: background
    description: The empty space surrounding and separating the objects.
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
  - id: hollow_space
    description: The area inside the frame_object, initially filled with the background color.
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      location: bounded by frame_object
      size: determined by frame_object's inner dimensions

Relationships:
  - type: separation
    objects: [pattern_object, frame_object]
    details: Separated by background pixels in the input.
  - type: containment
    objects: [frame_object, hollow_space]
    details: The frame_object encloses the hollow_space.
  - type: transformation_target
    objects: [hollow_space]
    details: This is the area where the copied pattern will be placed.
  - type: transformation_source
    objects: [pattern_object]
    details: This object's pattern is copied.

Actions:
  - action: identify
    objects: [pattern_object, frame_object, hollow_space]
    details: Locate and determine the properties (bounding box, pixels) of each key object/area.
  - action: copy
    source: pattern_object
    details: Create a duplicate of the pattern_object's pixel data relative to its bounding box.
  - action: place
    target: hollow_space
    object_to_place: copy_of_pattern_object
    details: Position the copied pattern within the hollow_space, centered horizontally and vertically.
  - action: compose_output
    details: Start with the input grid, then overlay the placed copy_of_pattern_object into the hollow_space.
