It appears relatively small.\n3.  **Object 2 (Frame Object):** This object is consistently a hollow rectangle made of azure pixels (color 8). It is larger than the Pattern Object.\n4.  **Output Grid Transformation:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with one key addition: a copy of the Pattern Object appears inside the hollow space of the Frame Object.\n5.  **Placement:** The copied Pattern Object seems to be placed centrally within the white space enclosed by the Frame Object.\n6.  **No Modification:** The original Pattern Object and the Frame Object remain unchanged in their original positions in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
