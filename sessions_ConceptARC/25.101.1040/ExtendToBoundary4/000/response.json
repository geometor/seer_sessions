In each example, there is one horizontal line and one vertical line.\n3.  **Object Separation:** The two lines are separated by a single row or a single column composed entirely of white pixels along the shortest path between them.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves filling the separating white pixels with the color of one of the adjacent lines.\n5.  **Rule for Filling:**\n    *   If the separating gap consists of white pixels in a *row* (horizontal separation), these pixels are filled with the color of the *vertical* line.\n    *   If the separating gap consists of white pixels in a *column* (vertical separation), these pixels are filled with the color of the *horizontal* line.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the separating white pixels are now filled with the determined color, effectively making the two lines touch or \"connect\".\n\n## Facts\n\n"
