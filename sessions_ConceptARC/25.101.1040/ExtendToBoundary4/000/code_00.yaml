task_description: Fill the gap between a horizontal and a vertical line.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors. Contains a background, two lines, and a gap.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: line_1
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color, forming a straight line.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical
      - location: defined by coordinates of its pixels

  - element: line_2
    description: A second contiguous block of pixels of a different non-white color, forming a straight line.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9), different from line_1
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical (opposite to line_1)
      - location: defined by coordinates of its pixels

  - element: gap
    description: A set of white pixels forming the shortest path separating line_1 and line_2.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - axis: horizontal | vertical (The axis along which the white pixels form a line)
      - pixels: list of coordinates of the white pixels in the gap

relationship:
  - type: separation
    between: [line_1, line_2]
    via: gap
    details: The gap pixels lie directly between line_1 and line_2. The separation distance is the number of pixels in the gap along its axis.

action:
  - name: fill_gap
    actor: grid_transformation_process
    target: gap pixels
    details: Change the color of the pixels identified in the 'gap' element.
    rule:
      - if: gap.axis == horizontal
        then: fill gap.pixels with color of the vertical line
      - if: gap.axis == vertical
        then: fill gap.pixels with color of the horizontal line
