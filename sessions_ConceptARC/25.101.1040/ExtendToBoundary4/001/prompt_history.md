## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and exactly two distinct non-white "objects".
2.  **Object Shape:** These objects consistently appear as straight lines, either perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical. In each example, there is one horizontal line and one vertical line.
3.  **Object Separation:** The two lines are separated by a single row or a single column composed entirely of white pixels along the shortest path between them.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves filling the separating white pixels with the color of one of the adjacent lines.
5.  **Rule for Filling:**
    *   If the separating gap consists of white pixels in a *row* (horizontal separation), these pixels are filled with the color of the *vertical* line.
    *   If the separating gap consists of white pixels in a *column* (vertical separation), these pixels are filled with the color of the *horizontal* line.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the separating white pixels are now filled with the determined color, effectively making the two lines touch or "connect".

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill the gap between a horizontal and a vertical line.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors. Contains a background, two lines, and a gap.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: line_1
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color, forming a straight line.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical
      - location: defined by coordinates of its pixels

  - element: line_2
    description: A second contiguous block of pixels of a different non-white color, forming a straight line.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9), different from line_1
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical (opposite to line_1)
      - location: defined by coordinates of its pixels

  - element: gap
    description: A set of white pixels forming the shortest path separating line_1 and line_2.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - axis: horizontal | vertical (The axis along which the white pixels form a line)
      - pixels: list of coordinates of the white pixels in the gap

relationship:
  - type: separation
    between: [line_1, line_2]
    via: gap
    details: The gap pixels lie directly between line_1 and line_2. The separation distance is the number of pixels in the gap along its axis.

action:
  - name: fill_gap
    actor: grid_transformation_process
    target: gap pixels
    details: Change the color of the pixels identified in the 'gap' element.
    rule:
      - if: gap.axis == horizontal
        then: fill gap.pixels with color of the vertical line
      - if: gap.axis == vertical
        then: fill gap.pixels with color of the horizontal line
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  Locate the pixels corresponding to each of these two colors, identifying them as two separate line objects (one horizontal, one vertical).
3.  Determine the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of each line.
4.  Identify the white pixels (color 0) that lie directly on the shortest path between the horizontal line and the vertical line. These constitute the "gap".
5.  Determine the axis of the gap:
    *   If the gap pixels share the same row index and differ only by column index, the gap axis is `horizontal`.
    *   If the gap pixels share the same column index and differ only by row index, the gap axis is `vertical`.
6.  Fill the gap pixels based on the gap's axis:
    *   If the gap axis is `horizontal` (the gap is a segment of a row), change the color of the gap pixels to the color of the *vertical* line.
    *   If the gap axis is `vertical` (the gap is a segment of a column), change the color of the gap pixels to the color of the *horizontal* line.
7.  Output the modified grid.
