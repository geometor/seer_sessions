            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous iteration correctly identified the core components: background separators, blocks, majority/minority colors, and the manipulation of minority color patterns based on the parity of the block count (N). The logic for the ODD number of blocks was correct and successfully transformed `train_2`.\n\nHowever, the logic derived for the EVEN number of blocks (`train_1`) was flawed. Specifically, the rule assigning the pattern from the last block (N-1) with a column shift to the first output block (B0) was incorrect. Analysis of the expected output for `train_1` reveals a different pattern movement for the EVEN case:\n\n1.  The last block (N-1) remains unchanged.\n2.  The first block (B0) receives the pattern from the second-to-last block (N-2).\n3.  The intermediate blocks (B1 to B(N-2)) receive the pattern from the preceding block (B(i) gets pattern from B(i-1)).\n4.  Crucially, **no column shift** is applied in either the EVEN or ODD case.\n\nThe strategy is to implement these refined, simpler parity-dependent rules without the column shift.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the refined rules against the examples:\n\n**Train 1 (N=4, EVEN):**\n*   Blocks: B0, B1, B2, B3\n*   Input Patterns: P0, P1, P2, P3\n*   Refined EVEN Rule:\n    *   Out B0 <- In P[N-2] = P2\n    *   Out B1 <- In P[1-1] = P0\n    *   Out B2 <- In P[2-1] = P1\n    *   Out B3 <- In P[N-1] = P3\n*   Expected Output Patterns:\n    *   Out B0: `{(2, 1)}` (Matches P2)\n    *   Out B1: `{(1, 1), (4, 0)}` (Matches P0)\n    *   Out B2: `{(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)}` (Matches P1)\n    *   Out B3: `{(0, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1)}` (Matches P3)\n*   **Confirmation:** The refined EVEN rule matches the expected output structure for `train_1`.\n\n**Train 2 (N=3, ODD):**\n*   Blocks: B0, B1, B2\n*   Input Patterns: P0, P1, P2\n*   ODD Rule (unchanged):\n    *   Out B0 <- In P[N-1] = P2\n    *   Out B1 <- In P[1] = P1\n    *   Out B2 <- In P[0]\n*   Expected Output Patterns:\n    *   Out B0: `{(4, 1)}` (Matches P2)\n    *   Out B1: `{(3, 0), (3, 1)}` (Matches P1)\n    *   Out B2: `{(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}` (Matches P0)\n*   **Confirmation:** The ODD rule correctly matches the expected output structure for `train_2`.\n\nThe refined rules without the column shift correctly predict the transformations for both training examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find all vertical column indices composed entirely of this background color.\n3.  **Define Blocks:** Identify the contiguous vertical segments (blocks) between the separator columns (or grid edges). Determine the number of blocks, `N`, and store their column boundaries (0-indexed, `B0` to `B(N-1)`).\n4.  **Handle Simple Case:** If `N` is less than 2, return the output grid copy without changes.\n5.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the majority color (M) and minority color (m) present in the non-background areas across all blocks. If M or m cannot be determined, return the output grid copy.\n6.  **Extract Input Patterns:** For each block `i` (from 0 to `N-1`), extract the set of relative coordinates `P[i] = {(row, col_relative)}` corresponding to the locations of the minority color `m` within that input block.\n7.  **Determine Target Patterns:** Create a list `Output_Patterns` of size `N` to store the target pattern set for each output block. Populate `Output_Patterns` based on the parity of `N`:\n    *   **If `N` is ODD (and N >= 3):**\n        *   Set `Output_Patterns[0]` = `P[N-1]`.\n        *   For `i` from 1 to `N-2`: Set `Output_Patterns[i]` = `P[i]`.\n        *   Set `Output_Patterns[N-1]` = `P[0]`.\n    *   **If `N` is EVEN (and N >= 2):**\n        *   Set `Output_Patterns[0]` = `P[N-2]`.\n        *   For `i` from 1 to `N-2`: Set `Output_Patterns[i]` = `P[i-1]`.\n        *   Set `Output_Patterns[N-1]` = `P[N-1]`.\n8.  **Apply Transformations:** Iterate through each block `j` from 0 to `N-1`:\n    *   Get the column boundaries `(start_col, end_col)` for block `j`.\n    *   Get the target pattern `Target_P = Output_Patterns[j]`.\n    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` within the block's column boundaries (`start_col <= c < end_col`).\n    *   If the cell at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid was *not* the background color:\n        *   Calculate the relative column `c_rel = c - start_col`.\n        *   Check if the relative coordinate `(r, c_rel)` is present in the `Target_P`.\n        *   If `(r, c_rel)` is in `Target_P`, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the minority color `m`.\n        *   Otherwise (if not in `Target_P`), set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the majority color `M`.\n9.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid."
