task_type: object_transformation # Modifying pixels based on block structure and color patterns

grid_properties:
  size: constant across input/output for each example
  background_color: white (0) acts as a separator
  separators: vertical columns of background_color divide the grid into blocks

block_properties:
  definition: contiguous columns between separator columns
  colors: contain two non-background colors per block
    - majority_color (M): the more frequent non-background color (e.g., green/3, orange/7)
    - minority_color (m): the less frequent non-background color (e.g., yellow/4, magenta/6)
  minority_pattern: the set of relative coordinates of minority_color pixels within a block

transformation_rule (derived primarily from train_2):
  scope: affects only non-background pixels within blocks
  action: swaps the minority_pattern between the first and the last block
  target: first and last vertical blocks
  unchanged: middle blocks remain identical to input
  color_changes:
    - in_first_block:
        - original minority pixels change m -> M
        - pixels corresponding to last_block's pattern change M -> m
    - in_last_block:
        - original minority pixels change m -> M
        - pixels corresponding to first_block's pattern change M -> m
  conservation:
    - number of minority pixels is conserved globally (observed in train_2)
    - relative shape/arrangement of minority pixels is conserved during the swap (observed in train_2)

discrepancy:
  train_1_output: does not match the output predicted by the first/last block swap rule derived from train_2. The transformation in train_1 appears different or more complex.
