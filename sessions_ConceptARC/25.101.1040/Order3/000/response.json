In train_1, these are columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, defining 4 blocks of width 2. In train_2, these are columns 0, 4, 8, 12, defining 3 blocks of width 3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors within the blocks, keeping the background and separators unchanged. The core change involves the locations of the minority color pixels.\n5.  **Train_2 Logic:** In train_2, the pattern of minority pixels (magenta/6) found in the first block (cols 1-3) is moved to the last block (cols 9-11) in the output. Conversely, the pattern of minority pixels from the last block in the input is moved to the first block in the output. The middle block (cols 5-7) remains unchanged. Pixels change color accordingly: where a minority pixel moves from, it becomes the majority color; where it moves to, the existing majority color becomes the minority color. The number and shape of minority pixel groups are conserved between the swapped blocks.\n6.  **Train_1 Discrepancy:** Applying the same \"swap first and last block patterns\" logic to train_1 does *not* produce the provided output for train_1. The changes in train_1 are more complex and don't fit this simple swapping pattern. However, the block structure and presence of majority/minority colors are consistent features. Given the clarity of the pattern in train_2, the \"swap first/last block patterns\" rule seems the most likely intended logic, potentially with conditions or variations not captured by train_1 alone, or train_1 might represent a different task variation.\n7.  **Core Idea:** The task likely involves identifying structural blocks separated by background color and manipulating the patterns of a specific ('minority') color within these blocks, particularly focusing on the first and last blocks.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Locate all columns composed entirely of this background color; these are the vertical separators.\n2.  **Define Blocks:** Identify the contiguous vertical segments of the grid located between the separator columns. These are the blocks. Record the column indices defining each block.\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If the number of identified blocks is less than 2, return the input grid unchanged.\n4.  **Identify Colors and Patterns:**\n    a.  Within each block, determine the two non-background colors present: the majority color (M) and the minority color (m). (Assume consistency across blocks for M and m within a single task example).\n    b.  Determine the relative coordinates (row, column_within_block) of all pixels with the minority color (m) within the first block (B1). Store this as `Pattern_First`.\n    c.  Determine the relative coordinates of all pixels with the minority color (m) within the last block (Bn). Store this as `Pattern_Last`.\n5.  **Perform Swap:**\n    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    b.  Update the first block (B1) in the output grid:\n        i.  For each original minority pixel location in B1 (defined by `Pattern_First`), change its color to the majority color (M).\n        ii. For each relative coordinate in `Pattern_Last`, find the corresponding absolute coordinate within B1 and change the pixel at that location to the minority color (m).\n    c.  Update the last block (Bn) in the output grid:\n        i.  For each original minority pixel location in Bn (defined by `Pattern_Last`), change its color to the majority color (M).\n        ii. For each relative coordinate in `Pattern_First`, find the corresponding absolute coordinate within Bn and change the pixel at that location to the minority color (m).\n6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid."
