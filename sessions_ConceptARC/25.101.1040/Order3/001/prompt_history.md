## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are the same size (6x13 for train_1, 6x13 for train_2).
2.  **Colors:** Each grid uses three colors: a background color (white/0), a 'majority' color (green/3 in train_1, orange/7 in train_2), and a 'minority' color (yellow/4 in train_1, magenta/6 in train_2).
3.  **Separators:** Vertical columns of the background color (white/0) divide the grid into distinct blocks or segments. In train_1, these are columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, defining 4 blocks of width 2. In train_2, these are columns 0, 4, 8, 12, defining 3 blocks of width 3.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors within the blocks, keeping the background and separators unchanged. The core change involves the locations of the minority color pixels.
5.  **Train_2 Logic:** In train_2, the pattern of minority pixels (magenta/6) found in the first block (cols 1-3) is moved to the last block (cols 9-11) in the output. Conversely, the pattern of minority pixels from the last block in the input is moved to the first block in the output. The middle block (cols 5-7) remains unchanged. Pixels change color accordingly: where a minority pixel moves from, it becomes the majority color; where it moves to, the existing majority color becomes the minority color. The number and shape of minority pixel groups are conserved between the swapped blocks.
6.  **Train_1 Discrepancy:** Applying the same "swap first and last block patterns" logic to train_1 does *not* produce the provided output for train_1. The changes in train_1 are more complex and don't fit this simple swapping pattern. However, the block structure and presence of majority/minority colors are consistent features. Given the clarity of the pattern in train_2, the "swap first/last block patterns" rule seems the most likely intended logic, potentially with conditions or variations not captured by train_1 alone, or train_1 might represent a different task variation.
7.  **Core Idea:** The task likely involves identifying structural blocks separated by background color and manipulating the patterns of a specific ('minority') color within these blocks, particularly focusing on the first and last blocks.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation # Modifying pixels based on block structure and color patterns

grid_properties:
  size: constant across input/output for each example
  background_color: white (0) acts as a separator
  separators: vertical columns of background_color divide the grid into blocks

block_properties:
  definition: contiguous columns between separator columns
  colors: contain two non-background colors per block
    - majority_color (M): the more frequent non-background color (e.g., green/3, orange/7)
    - minority_color (m): the less frequent non-background color (e.g., yellow/4, magenta/6)
  minority_pattern: the set of relative coordinates of minority_color pixels within a block

transformation_rule (derived primarily from train_2):
  scope: affects only non-background pixels within blocks
  action: swaps the minority_pattern between the first and the last block
  target: first and last vertical blocks
  unchanged: middle blocks remain identical to input
  color_changes:
    - in_first_block:
        - original minority pixels change m -> M
        - pixels corresponding to last_block's pattern change M -> m
    - in_last_block:
        - original minority pixels change m -> M
        - pixels corresponding to first_block's pattern change M -> m
  conservation:
    - number of minority pixels is conserved globally (observed in train_2)
    - relative shape/arrangement of minority pixels is conserved during the swap (observed in train_2)

discrepancy:
  train_1_output: does not match the output predicted by the first/last block swap rule derived from train_2. The transformation in train_1 appears different or more complex.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background and Separators:** Determine the background color (typically white/0). Locate all columns composed entirely of this background color; these are the vertical separators.
2.  **Define Blocks:** Identify the contiguous vertical segments of the grid located between the separator columns. These are the blocks. Record the column indices defining each block.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If the number of identified blocks is less than 2, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  **Identify Colors and Patterns:**
    a.  Within each block, determine the two non-background colors present: the majority color (M) and the minority color (m). (Assume consistency across blocks for M and m within a single task example).
    b.  Determine the relative coordinates (row, column_within_block) of all pixels with the minority color (m) within the first block (B1). Store this as `Pattern_First`.
    c.  Determine the relative coordinates of all pixels with the minority color (m) within the last block (Bn). Store this as `Pattern_Last`.
5.  **Perform Swap:**
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    b.  Update the first block (B1) in the output grid:
        i.  For each original minority pixel location in B1 (defined by `Pattern_First`), change its color to the majority color (M).
        ii. For each relative coordinate in `Pattern_Last`, find the corresponding absolute coordinate within B1 and change the pixel at that location to the minority color (m).
    c.  Update the last block (Bn) in the output grid:
        i.  For each original minority pixel location in Bn (defined by `Pattern_Last`), change its color to the majority color (M).
        ii. For each relative coordinate in `Pattern_First`, find the corresponding absolute coordinate within Bn and change the pixel at that location to the minority color (m).
6.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.
