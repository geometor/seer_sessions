task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  size: variable (input and output sizes are identical for each example)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: frame
    properties:
      shape: hollow_rectangle
      thickness: 1 pixel
      color: non-white (green=3, yellow=4 in examples)
      size: variable (3x3, 5x5 in examples)
    relationship: surrounds an area of background color

actions:
  - name: fill_center
    target: frame
    condition: frame size > 3x3
    effect: changes the color of the centermost pixel of the hollow interior area to the frame's color
  - name: fill_all
    target: frame
    condition: frame size == 3x3
    effect: changes the color of all pixels within the frame's bounding box (frame and interior) to the frame's color

transformation_logic:
  - Identify all hollow rectangular frames (1 pixel thick, single non-white color).
  - For each identified frame:
    - If the frame's outer dimension is 3x3, apply the 'fill_all' action.
    - If the frame's outer dimension is greater than 3x3, apply the 'fill_center' action.
  - Pixels not part of identified frames or their modified interiors remain unchanged.
