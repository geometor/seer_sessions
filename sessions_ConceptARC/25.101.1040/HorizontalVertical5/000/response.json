The output grids introduce green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary transformation involves adding a solid line of green pixels along one edge of the grid. The original yellow shape from the input remains unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Location of Green Line:** The green line appears either along the top edge (row 0) or the rightmost edge (column 9).\n5.  **Determining Factor:** The choice between placing the green line at the top or the right edge seems dependent on a property derived from the yellow shape in the input. Comparing the examples, the bounding box of the yellow shape appears crucial. Specifically, the area of this bounding box seems to dictate the outcome.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
