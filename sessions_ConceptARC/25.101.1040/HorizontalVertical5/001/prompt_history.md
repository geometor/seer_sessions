Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task uses 10x10 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain white (0) background pixels and yellow (4) pixels forming distinct shapes. The output grids introduce green (3) pixels.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary transformation involves adding a solid line of green pixels along one edge of the grid. The original yellow shape from the input remains unchanged in the output.
4.  **Location of Green Line:** The green line appears either along the top edge (row 0) or the rightmost edge (column 9).
5.  **Determining Factor:** The choice between placing the green line at the top or the right edge seems dependent on a property derived from the yellow shape in the input. Comparing the examples, the bounding box of the yellow shape appears crucial. Specifically, the area of this bounding box seems to dictate the outcome.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: 10x10 (for all examples)
  - background_color: white (0)

Input Objects:
  - type: shape
  - color: yellow (4)
  - properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous or non-contiguous yellow pixels
      - determines_bounding_box: True

Output Objects:
  - type: shape (from input)
  - color: yellow (4)
  - properties:
      - identical_to_input_shape: True
  - type: line
  - color: green (3)
  - properties:
      - location: either top row (row 0) or rightmost column (column 9)
      - solid: fills the entire row or column

Transformation Rule Extraction:
  - step_1: Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - step_2: Calculate the bounding box enclosing these non-white pixels.
      - example_1_bbox: (row=2, col=2) to (row=6, col=6) -> H=5, W=5
      - example_2_bbox: (row=2, col=1) to (row=4, col=7) -> H=3, W=7
      - example_3_bbox: (row=2, col=0) to (row=8, col=8) -> H=7, W=9
  - step_3: Calculate the area of the bounding box (Area = Height * Width).
      - example_1_area: 5 * 5 = 25
      - example_2_area: 3 * 7 = 21
      - example_3_area: 7 * 9 = 63
  - step_4: Determine the location of the green line based on the area.
      - condition: Area >= 25
          - result: paint top row green (3)
          - applies_to: example_1, example_3
      - condition: Area < 25
          - result: paint rightmost column green (3)
          - applies_to: example_2
  - step_5: Construct the output grid by copying the input grid and applying the green line modification.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Find all pixels that are not white (color 0). If no such pixels exist, paint the rightmost column green (3) and return the grid.
3.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by these non-white pixels to define their bounding box.
4.  Calculate the height (H) of the bounding box as (max_row - min_row + 1).
5.  Calculate the width (W) of the bounding box as (max_col - min_col + 1).
6.  Calculate the area of the bounding box by multiplying its height and width (Area = H * W).
7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
8.  Check if the calculated Area is greater than or equal to 25.
9.  If the Area is greater than or equal to 25, change the color of all pixels in the top row (row 0) of the output grid to green (3).
10. If the Area is less than 25, change the color of all pixels in the rightmost column (the column with index Width-1, where Width is the total width of the grid) of the output grid to green (3).
11. Return the modified output grid.
