These lines remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   The yellow pixels are the target of the transformation. In the output, most yellow pixels are removed (changed to white), except for those located *between* the red lines.\n    *   The transformation acts as a filter, keeping only yellow pixels that are spatially contained within the bounds defined by the red lines. If the lines are vertical, containment is defined by column index; if horizontal, by row index.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
