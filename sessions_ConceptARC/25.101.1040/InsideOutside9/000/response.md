*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids share the same dimensions.
    *   The grids contain three primary colors: white (0) as background, red (2) forming structures, and yellow (4) as individual pixels.
    *   The red structures appear as two parallel lines, either vertical (train\_1) or horizontal (train\_2). These lines remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   The yellow pixels are the target of the transformation. In the output, most yellow pixels are removed (changed to white), except for those located *between* the red lines.
    *   The transformation acts as a filter, keeping only yellow pixels that are spatially contained within the bounds defined by the red lines. If the lines are vertical, containment is defined by column index; if horizontal, by row index.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white
        value: 0
      - type: barrier
        color: red
        value: 2
        properties:
          - forms two parallel lines (either vertical or horizontal)
          - defines a spatial region between the lines
          - remains unchanged in the output
      - type: target
        color: yellow
        value: 4
        properties:
          - appear as single pixels
          - location relative to the barrier determines fate
    transformation:
      - action: filter
        target: yellow pixels
        condition: keep only if located strictly between the barrier lines
        outcome_kept: pixel remains yellow
        outcome_removed: pixel becomes white (background)
      - action: preserve
        target: red pixels
        outcome: pixel remains red
      - action: preserve
        target: white pixels (original background)
        outcome: pixel remains white
    relationships:
      - spatial_containment: yellow pixels vs. region defined by red lines
    orientation_determination:
      - method: analyze coordinates of red pixels
      - rule: if the number of unique rows is significantly less than unique columns, barriers are horizontal; otherwise, they are vertical.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the coordinates of all red (2) pixels (barriers).
    3.  Determine the orientation of the barriers:
        a.  Count the number of unique row indices (`num_rows`) and unique column indices (`num_cols`) occupied by red pixels.
        b.  If `num_rows < num_cols`, the barriers are horizontal. Find the minimum (`min_row`) and maximum (`max_row`) row indices of the red pixels.
        c.  Otherwise (assume `num_cols <= num_rows`), the barriers are vertical. Find the minimum (`min_col`) and maximum (`max_col`) column indices of the red pixels.
    4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    5.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is yellow (4):
        a.  If barriers are horizontal: Check if the pixel's row `r` is strictly between `min_row` and `max_row` (i.e., `min_row < r < max_row`). If this condition is *not* met, change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
        b.  If barriers are vertical: Check if the pixel's column `c` is strictly between `min_col` and `max_col` (i.e., `min_col < c < max_col`). If this condition is *not* met, change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    6.  Leave all non-yellow pixels unchanged from the initial copy.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
