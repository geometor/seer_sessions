## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified the conditional nature of the transformation based on the number of yellow pixels in Section 3. However, the implementation failed on both examples, indicating flaws in either the condition's consequence (the specific swap/cycle rule) or the pattern placement logic, or both.

Example 1 failed significantly under the assumption of a 1<=>4 swap, while Example 2 failed narrowly under the assumption of a 1->3->4->1 cycle.

Re-examining the expected outputs suggests two distinct placement mechanisms might be used depending on the rule triggered:

1.  **Rule A (Condition: Yellows in Sec 3 == 3):** Seems to involve a direct swap between Section 1 and Section 4 via a simple *column translation*. All yellow pixels from Section 1 move +15 columns to land in Section 4, and all yellow pixels from Section 4 move -15 columns to land in Section 1. Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
2.  **Rule B (Condition: Yellows in Sec 3 != 3):** Seems to involve a cyclic shift (1->3, 3->4, 4->1) using an *anchor-based relative placement*. The pattern from the source section is identified relative to its top-leftmost pixel (anchor). This pattern is then placed in the target section such that the anchor lands at the same row but in the starting column of the target section. Section 2 remains unchanged.

The strategy is to implement these two distinct rules and placement mechanisms, triggered by the count of yellow pixels in Section 3.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the proposed placement logic for each rule against the examples.

**Rule A Verification (Example 1: Sec 3 count = 3): Swap 1<=>4 via Translation (+/- 15 cols)**

*   Input 1, Section 1 Pixels: `(0, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2)`
*   Input 1, Section 4 Pixel: `(2, 18)`
*   Translate Sec 1 (+15): `(0, 17), (1, 18), (3, 16), (3, 18), (4, 17)` -> **Matches** Expected Output 1, Section 4.
*   Translate Sec 4 (-15): `(2, 3)` -> **Matches** Expected Output 1, Section 1.
*   Sections 2 & 3 remain unchanged -> **Matches** Expected Output 1.
*   *Conclusion: Rule A logic (1<=>4 translation swap) appears correct for Example 1.*

**Rule B Verification (Example 2: Sec 3 count = 4): Cycle 1->3, 3->4, 4->1 via Anchor Placement**

*   Input 2, Section 1: TL=(1,1), Rel=[(0,0),(0,2),(3,1)]
*   Input 2, Section 3: TL=(1,11), Rel=[(0,0),(0,3),(2,3),(3,1)]
*   Input 2, Section 4: TL=(2,16), Rel=[(0,0)]
*   Place Input Sec 1 -> Output Sec 3 (Target Start Col 11, Anchor Row 1): `(1, 11+0), (1, 11+2), (1+3, 11+1)` => `(1,11), (1,13), (4,12)` -> **Matches** Expected Output 2, Section 3.
*   Place Input Sec 3 -> Output Sec 4 (Target Start Col 16, Anchor Row 1): `(1, 16+0), (1, 16+3), (1+2, 16+3), (1+3, 16+1)` => `(1,16), (1,19), (3,19), (4,17)` -> **Matches** Expected Output 2, Section 4.
*   Place Input Sec 4 -> Output Sec 1 (Target Start Col 1, Anchor Row 2): `(2, 1+0)` => `(2,1)` -> **Matches** Expected Output 2, Section 1.
*   Section 2 remains unchanged -> **Matches** Expected Output 2.
*   *Conclusion: Rule B logic (1->3->4->1 anchor cycle) appears correct for Example 2.*

It seems the previous code's failure on Example 2 was likely due to an error in reporting the transformed output in the test harness, not a flaw in the logic itself *for that specific rule*. However, the code failed Example 1 because it used anchor placement instead of translation for the 1<=>4 swap.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries and start columns for Sections 1 (1-4), 2 (6-9), 3 (11-14), and 4 (16-19).
3.  Count the number of yellow pixels (color 4) within Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the *input* grid (`section3_yellow_count`).
4.  **If** `section3_yellow_count` is equal to 3 (Rule A):
    a.  Identify all yellow pixel coordinates `(r, c)` in Section 1 of the input grid.
    b.  Identify all yellow pixel coordinates `(r, c)` in Section 4 of the input grid.
    c.  Clear all non-green pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4) and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    d.  For each identified yellow pixel `(r, c)` from input Section 1, place a yellow pixel at `(r, c + 15)` in the output grid (within bounds).
    e.  For each identified yellow pixel `(r, c)` from input Section 4, place a yellow pixel at `(r, c - 15)` in the output grid (within bounds).
    f.  (Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged).
5.  **Else** (if `section3_yellow_count` is not equal to 3, Rule B):
    a.  Identify the yellow pattern for Section 1 (input grid): find anchor row `anchor_row1` and relative coordinates `relative_coords1`.
    b.  Identify the yellow pattern for Section 3 (input grid): find anchor row `anchor_row3` and relative coordinates `relative_coords3`.
    c.  Identify the yellow pattern for Section 4 (input grid): find anchor row `anchor_row4` and relative coordinates `relative_coords4`.
    d.  Clear all non-green pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 3 (cols 11-14), and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    e.  Place the pattern from input Section 1 into output Section 3: For each `(rel_r, rel_c)` in `relative_coords1`, place yellow at (`anchor_row1 + rel_r`, `11 + rel_c`) in the output grid (within bounds).
    f.  Place the pattern from input Section 3 into output Section 4: For each `(rel_r, rel_c)` in `relative_coords3`, place yellow at (`anchor_row3 + rel_r`, `16 + rel_c`) in the output grid (within bounds).
    g.  Place the pattern from input Section 4 into output Section 1: For each `(rel_r, rel_c)` in `relative_coords4`, place yellow at (`anchor_row4 + rel_r`, `1 + rel_c`) in the output grid (within bounds).
    h.  (Section 2 remains unchanged).
6.  The modified output grid is the final result.
