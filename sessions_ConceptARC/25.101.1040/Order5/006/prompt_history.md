Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids maintain the same dimensions (6x21 in the examples).
2.  **Static Elements:** There are vertical lines of green pixels (color 3) at columns 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. These lines act as separators and remain unchanged between the input and output. The background white pixels (color 0) also largely remain unchanged, except where yellow pixels are moved.
3.  **Dynamic Elements:** The yellow pixels (color 4) are the primary dynamic elements. They exist within the sections created by the green lines.
4.  **Sections:** The green lines divide the grid into four main operational sections:
    *   Section 1: Columns 1-4
    *   Section 2: Columns 6-9
    *   Section 3: Columns 11-14
    *   Section 4: Columns 16-19
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the yellow pixels in Section 1 and Section 4. The *entire pattern* of yellow pixels (maintaining relative positions) found in Section 1 is moved to Section 4, and the pattern of yellow pixels from Section 4 is moved to Section 1.
6.  **Pattern Anchoring:** When a pattern moves, its placement seems anchored by its top-leftmost pixel. The top-leftmost pixel of the pattern originally in Section 1 moves to the *same row* but starts at column 16 (the beginning of Section 4). Similarly, the top-leftmost pixel of the pattern originally in Section 4 moves to the *same row* but starts at column 1 (the beginning of Section 1).
7.  **Invariant Sections:** The patterns of yellow pixels within Section 2 and Section 3 remain unchanged in their positions between the input and output grids.

    Properties:
      - Color: Yellow (4)
      - Shape: Collection of pixels within a section, maintaining relative positions.
      - Role: Represents the content to be moved.
Actions:
  - Name: IdentifyPatterns
    Target: Yellow pixels within Section 1 and Section 4.
    Details: Determine the set of yellow pixel coordinates and their relative arrangement for each section. Identify the top-leftmost pixel coordinate for each pattern.
  - Name: ClearTargetSections
    Target: Output grid Sections 1 and 4.
    Details: Set all pixels within columns 1-4 and 16-19 to white (0), preserving the green separators.
  - Name: SwapAndPlacePatterns
    Details:
      - Move the identified pattern from input Section 1 to output Section 4. The top-leftmost pixel of the pattern is placed at its original row, column 16. Other pixels are placed relative to this anchor.
      - Move the identified pattern from input Section 4 to output Section 1. The top-leftmost pixel of the pattern is placed at its original row, column 1. Other pixels are placed relative to this anchor.
Relationships:
  - Sections 1 and 4 are linked by a swap operation.
  - Sections 2 and 3 are independent of the swap operation.
  - Yellow pixel patterns maintain their internal relative structure during the swap.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries of the four operational sections based on the fixed green vertical lines: Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 2 (cols 6-9), Section 3 (cols 11-14), Section 4 (cols 16-19).
3.  Identify all yellow pixels (color 4) located within Section 1 of the input grid. Record their coordinates. If any yellow pixels are found, find the minimum row (`min_row1`) and minimum column (`min_col1`) among them. Calculate the relative coordinates of all these yellow pixels with respect to (`min_row1`, `min_col1`).
4.  Identify all yellow pixels (color 4) located within Section 4 of the input grid. Record their coordinates. If any yellow pixels are found, find the minimum row (`min_row4`) and minimum column (`min_col4`) among them. Calculate the relative coordinates of all these yellow pixels with respect to (`min_row4`, `min_col4`).
5.  Clear all yellow pixels within Section 1 (columns 1-4) and Section 4 (columns 16-19) of the *output* grid by setting their color to white (0).
6.  Using the relative coordinates calculated in step 3 (from input Section 1), place the yellow pattern into Section 4 of the *output* grid. The anchor pixel (originally at `min_row1`, `min_col1`) should be placed at coordinate (`min_row1`, 16). Place all other pixels relative to this new anchor position.
7.  Using the relative coordinates calculated in step 4 (from input Section 4), place the yellow pattern into Section 1 of the *output* grid. The anchor pixel (originally at `min_row4`, `min_col4`) should be placed at coordinate (`min_row4`, 1). Place all other pixels relative to this new anchor position.
8.  The output grid, now containing the swapped patterns in Sections 1 and 4 and the unchanged content in Sections 2 and 3, is the final result.
```python
import copy

"""
The transformation identifies yellow pixel patterns within specific sections of the grid, 
defined by static vertical green lines. The grid is divided into four main 
operational sections: Section 1 (columns 1-4), Section 2 (columns 6-9), 
Section 3 (columns 11-14), and Section 4 (columns 16-19). 

The transformation rule is to swap the entire yellow pixel pattern found in 
Section 1 with the entire yellow pixel pattern found in Section 4. The patterns 
maintain their internal relative structure. The placement in the swapped section 
is anchored by the top-leftmost pixel of the original pattern. The top-leftmost 
pixel of the pattern from Section 1 moves to the same row but starts at the 
first column of Section 4 (column 16). Similarly, the top-leftmost pixel of the 
pattern from Section 4 moves to the same row but starts at the first column of 
Section 1 (column 1). The content (including yellow pixels) within Section 2 
and Section 3 remains unchanged.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the static green separators and the four operational sections. It also correctly identified the yellow pixels as the dynamic elements. The core transformation was hypothesized as a simple swap of the yellow patterns between Section 1 and Section 4, with Sections 2 and 3 remaining static.

However, testing this hypothesis against the provided examples revealed inconsistencies:
1.  **Example 1 Failure:** The generated output did not match the expected output. The simple swap between sections 1 and 4 did not produce the correct result. Furthermore, sections 2 and 3, assumed static, were actually modified in the expected output.
2.  **Example 2 Failure:** Although the generated output correctly performed the 1<=>4 swap *relative to the input*, the expected output showed that sections 2 and 3 were *also* swapped (2<=>3), which the initial code did not account for.

The strategy must be revised to account for the transformations occurring in *all four* sections. The failure analysis suggests a pairwise swap: Section 1 swaps with Section 4, and Section 2 swaps with Section 3.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the yellow pixel distribution in each section for both examples across input, expected output, and the previously transformed output.

Section Definitions:
*   Sec 1: cols 1-4
*   Sec 2: cols 6-9
*   Sec 3: cols 11-14
*   Sec 4: cols 16-19

```
**Metrics Interpretation:**

*   **Example 1:** The code's output (`Transformed`) matches the `Input` for Sec 2 and Sec 3, as designed by the previous logic. However, the `Expected` output for Sec 1 and Sec 4 is vastly different from both the `Input` and the `Transformed` simple swap. Sec 1 Expected has only 1 yellow pixel, while Input had 5. Sec 4 Expected has 5 yellow pixels, while Input had 1. The code failed to correctly generate the patterns for Sec 1 and Sec 4, and incorrectly left Sec 2 and Sec 3 unchanged.
*   **Example 2:** The code's output (`Transformed`) matches the `Expected` output for Sec 1. It correctly placed the pattern from Input Sec 4 into Output Sec 1. However, Sec 4 `Transformed` does *not* match `Expected`. Furthermore, Sec 2 and Sec 3 `Transformed` match their respective `Inputs` (as per the old code's logic), but the `Expected` outputs for Sec 2 and Sec 3 are different from their inputs.

**Revised Conclusion:** The initial simple swap (1<=>4) was insufficient. The pattern observed in Example 2's *expected* output (1<=>4 and 2<=>3) seems more promising. Let's re-evaluate Example 1 based on this 1<=>4, 2<=>3 swap:

*   **Example 1 (Swap 1<=>4, 2<=>3 Hypothesis):**
    *   Input Sec 1 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 4? (Input 1: 5 pixels). (Expected 4: 5 pixels). Let's check shape. Input 1 TL=(0,2), Rel=(0,0),(1,1),(3,-1),(3,1),(4,0). Expected 4: (0,17), (1,18), (3,16), (3,18), (4,17). Place Rel at (0,16): (0,16), (1,17), (3,15 invalid), (3,17), (4,16). *Doesn't match.*
    *   Input Sec 4 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 1? (Input 4: 1 pixel). (Expected 1: 1 pixel). Input 4 TL=(2,18), Rel=(0,0). Expected 1: (2,3). Place Rel at (2,1): (2,1). *Doesn't match.*
    *   Input Sec 2 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 3? (Input 2: 2 pixels). (Expected 3: 3 pixels). *Doesn't match count.*
    *   Input Sec 3 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 2? (Input 3: 3 pixels). (Expected 2: 2 pixels). *Doesn't match count.*

**Final Revised Conclusion:** Neither the simple 1<=>4 swap nor the full 1<=>4, 2<=>3 swap consistently explains both examples. There must be a condition or variation. Let's look at the number of yellow pixels per section:

*   **Example 1 Input:** Sec1=5, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=1
*   **Example 1 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=5
*   **Example 2 Input:** Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1
*   **Example 2 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=4

Notice in Example 1, the *counts* seem to swap: Sec1 count (5) goes to Sec4, Sec4 count (1) goes to Sec1. Sec2 and Sec3 counts remain the same.
In Example 2, the counts *also* swap: Sec1 count (3) goes to Sec4, Sec4 count (1) goes to Sec1. Sec2 count (2) goes to Sec2, Sec3 count (4) goes to Sec3.

Wait, the tool output shows my manual check for Example 2 counts was wrong. Let's re-verify using the tool output:
*   **Example 2 Input:** Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1
*   **Example 2 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=4

Here, the counts swap: Sec1(3)<->Sec4(1) becomes ExpSec1(1), ExpSec4(3?? No, 4). Sec2(2)<->Sec3(4) becomes ExpSec2(2), ExpSec3(3?? No, 3). This is inconsistent again.

Let's re-examine the code output for Example 1 where Sec 2 and 3 matched Input and Expected:
*   Sec 2 Input: [(2, 7), (4, 8)] -> Expected: [(2, 7), (4, 8)]
*   Sec 3 Input: [(1, 13), (3, 12), (4, 14)] -> Expected: [(1, 13), (3, 12), (4, 14)]
It seems in Example 1, **only** sections 1 and 4 swap their patterns.

Let's re-examine the code output for Example 2 where Sec 2 and 3 did *not* match Expected:
*   Sec 2 Input: [(1, 6), (4, 7)] -> Expected: [(2, 6), (4, 7)]
*   Sec 3 Input: [(1, 11), (1, 14), (3, 14), (4, 12)] -> Expected: [(1, 11), (1, 13), (4, 12)]
It seems in Example 2, **all four** sections swap their patterns in pairs (1<=>4, 2<=>3).

**Hypothesis Refined:** There is a condition determining *which* pairs swap.
*   Condition Met (Example 2): Swap 1<=>4 AND Swap 2<=>3.
*   Condition Not Met (Example 1): Swap 1<=>4 ONLY.

What could the condition be? Let's compare inputs:
*   Input 1: Sec1=5, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=1 yellows. Total Yellows = 11
*   Input 2: Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1 yellows. Total Yellows = 10

Maybe the condition is based on the total number of yellow pixels? If total is even (10), swap all. If total is odd (11), swap only 1<=>4. This fits both examples.

  - Sections 2 and 3 are linked by a swap operation *only if* the total number of yellow pixels in the input is even.
  - Yellow pixel patterns maintain their internal relative structure during swaps, anchored by their original top-leftmost pixel's row and the target section's starting column.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries of the four operational sections: Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 2 (cols 6-9), Section 3 (cols 11-14), Section 4 (cols 16-19).
3.  Count the total number of yellow pixels (color 4) across the entire input grid. Determine if the count is even or odd.
4.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 1 of the input grid.
5.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 4 of the input grid.
6.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (columns 1-4) and Section 4 (columns 16-19) of the *output* grid.
7.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 1 into output Section 4. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 16.
8.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 4 into output Section 1. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 1.
9.  **If** the total yellow pixel count is **even**:
    a.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 2 of the input grid.
    b.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 3 of the input grid.
    c.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 2 (columns 6-9) and Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the *output* grid.
    d.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 2 into output Section 3. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 11.
    e.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 3 into output Section 2. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 6.
10. **Else** (if the total yellow pixel count is **odd**):
    a.  Sections 2 and 3 of the output grid remain unchanged from the initial copy of the input grid.
11. The output grid, now containing the conditionally swapped patterns, is the final result.

"""
The transformation operates on a grid divided into four sections by vertical green lines.
Sections are defined by column ranges: Sec 1 (1-4), Sec 2 (6-9), Sec 3 (11-14), Sec 4 (16-19).
The transformation involves swapping the yellow pixel (color 4) patterns between sections.

The scope of the swap depends on the total count of yellow pixels in the input grid:
1. If the total yellow count is EVEN:
   - The pattern in Section 1 is swapped with the pattern in Section 4.
   - The pattern in Section 2 is swapped with the pattern in Section 3.
2. If the total yellow count is ODD:
   - ONLY the pattern in Section 1 is swapped with the pattern in Section 4.
   - Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.

Patterns are defined by the relative positions of yellow pixels within a section, anchored by the top-leftmost yellow pixel. When swapped, the pattern retains its shape, and its top-left anchor is placed at the same row as the original anchor but in the starting column of the destination section.

## General Assessment

The previous attempts failed because the transformation rule is conditional and more complex than a simple pairwise swap. The initial analysis correctly identified the static grid structure (green separators) and the four operational sections. The key dynamic elements are the yellow pixel patterns within these sections.

The failure analysis revealed two distinct transformation behaviors across the examples:
1.  **Example 1:** Sections 1 and 4 swap their yellow patterns, while Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
2.  **Example 2:** A cyclic shift occurs: Pattern from Section 1 moves to Section 3, Pattern from Section 3 moves to Section 4, Pattern from Section 4 moves to Section 1. Section 2's pattern remains in Section 2.

The determining factor for which rule applies appears to be the number of yellow pixels in **Section 3** of the input grid.
*   If `count(yellows in Section 3) == 3`, Rule A (1<=>4 swap) applies.
*   Otherwise (e.g., `count(yellows in Section 3) == 4` in Example 2), Rule B (1->3->4->1 cycle, 2->2) applies.

The placement mechanism seems consistent: a pattern moved to a new section retains its shape (relative pixel coordinates), and its placement is anchored by its original top-leftmost pixel's **row** and the **starting column** of the target section.

Let's verify the pattern counts and anchor points for the input grids to confirm the condition and the placement logic.

*   Section Definitions: Sec 1 (cols 1-4), Sec 2 (cols 6-9), Sec 3 (cols 11-14), Sec 4 (cols 16-19).

```
**Metrics Interpretation:**

The metrics confirm the hypothesis:
*   **Input 1:** Section 3 has 3 yellow pixels. This corresponds to the observed 1<=>4 swap behavior (Rule A).
*   **Input 2:** Section 3 has 4 yellow pixels. This corresponds to the observed 1->3->4->1 cycle behavior (Rule B).

The anchor points identified will be crucial for the correct placement logic in the natural language program and subsequent code.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries of the four operational sections: Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 2 (cols 6-9), Section 3 (cols 11-14), Section 4 (cols 16-19).
3.  Identify the yellow pattern for each section (1, 2, 3, 4) in the *input* grid. For each pattern, record:
    *   Its top-leftmost anchor row (`anchor_row`).
    *   The list of relative coordinates (`relative_coords`) of its yellow pixels with respect to the anchor.
4.  Count the number of yellow pixels within Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the *input* grid (`section3_yellow_count`).
5.  **If** `section3_yellow_count` is equal to 3 (Rule A):
    a.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4) and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    b.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 1 into output Section 4. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row1`, and the target start column 16.
    c.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 4 into output Section 1. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row4`, and the target start column 1.
    d.  (Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged as per the initial grid copy).
6.  **Else** (if `section3_yellow_count` is not equal to 3, Rule B):
    a.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 3 (cols 11-14), and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    b.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 1 into output Section 3. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row1`, and the target start column 11.
    c.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 3 into output Section 4. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row3`, and the target start column 16.
    d.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 4 into output Section 1. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row4`, and the target start column 1.
    e.  (Section 2 remains unchanged as per the initial grid copy).
7.  The modified output grid is the final result.
```python

# No other standard libraries like numpy are needed based on the logic.

"""
The transformation operates on a grid divided into four sections by vertical green lines (color 3).
Sections are defined by column ranges: Sec 1 (cols 1-4), Sec 2 (cols 6-9), Sec 3 (cols 11-14), Sec 4 (cols 16-19).
The transformation involves moving the yellow pixel (color 4) patterns between sections based on a condition.

Condition: Count the number of yellow pixels in Section 3 (cols 11-14) of the input grid.
Rule A (If count == 3): Swap patterns between Section 1 and Section 4. Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
Rule B (If count != 3): Cycle patterns: Pattern from Section 1 moves to Section 3, pattern from Section 3 moves to Section 4, pattern from Section 4 moves to Section 1. Section 2 remains unchanged.

Patterns are defined by the relative positions of yellow pixels within a section, anchored by the top-leftmost yellow pixel. When moved, the pattern retains its shape, and its top-left anchor is placed at the same row as the original anchor but in the starting column of the destination section.
