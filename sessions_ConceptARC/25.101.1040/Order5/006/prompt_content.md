"""
The transformation operates on a grid divided into four sections by vertical green lines (color 3).
Sections are defined by column ranges: Sec 1 (cols 1-4), Sec 2 (cols 6-9), Sec 3 (cols 11-14), Sec 4 (cols 16-19).
The transformation involves moving the yellow pixel (color 4) patterns between sections based on a condition.

Condition: Count the number of yellow pixels in Section 3 (cols 11-14) of the input grid.
Rule A (If count == 3): Swap patterns between Section 1 and Section 4. Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
Rule B (If count != 3): Cycle patterns: Pattern from Section 1 moves to Section 3, pattern from Section 3 moves to Section 4, pattern from Section 4 moves to Section 1. Section 2 remains unchanged.

Patterns are defined by the relative positions of yellow pixels within a section, anchored by the top-leftmost yellow pixel. When moved, the pattern retains its shape, and its top-left anchor is placed at the same row as the original anchor but in the starting column of the destination section.
