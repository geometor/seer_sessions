            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the static green separators and the four operational sections. It also correctly identified the yellow pixels as the dynamic elements. The core transformation was hypothesized as a simple swap of the yellow patterns between Section 1 and Section 4, with Sections 2 and 3 remaining static.\n\nHowever, testing this hypothesis against the provided examples revealed inconsistencies:\n1.  **Example 1 Failure:** The generated output did not match the expected output. The simple swap between sections 1 and 4 did not produce the correct result. Furthermore, sections 2 and 3, assumed static, were actually modified in the expected output.\n2.  **Example 2 Failure:** Although the generated output correctly performed the 1<=>4 swap *relative to the input*, the expected output showed that sections 2 and 3 were *also* swapped (2<=>3), which the initial code did not account for.\n\nThe strategy must be revised to account for the transformations occurring in *all four* sections. The failure analysis suggests a pairwise swap: Section 1 swaps with Section 4, and Section 2 swaps with Section 3.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the yellow pixel distribution in each section for both examples across input, expected output, and the previously transformed output.\n\nSection Definitions:\n*   Sec 1: cols 1-4\n*   Sec 2: cols 6-9\n*   Sec 3: cols 11-14\n*   Sec 4: cols 16-19\n\n"

            "text": "**Metrics Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code's output (`Transformed`) matches the `Input` for Sec 2 and Sec 3, as designed by the previous logic. However, the `Expected` output for Sec 1 and Sec 4 is vastly different from both the `Input` and the `Transformed` simple swap. Sec 1 Expected has only 1 yellow pixel, while Input had 5. Sec 4 Expected has 5 yellow pixels, while Input had 1. The code failed to correctly generate the patterns for Sec 1 and Sec 4, and incorrectly left Sec 2 and Sec 3 unchanged.\n*   **Example 2:** The code's output (`Transformed`) matches the `Expected` output for Sec 1. It correctly placed the pattern from Input Sec 4 into Output Sec 1. However, Sec 4 `Transformed` does *not* match `Expected`. Furthermore, Sec 2 and Sec 3 `Transformed` match their respective `Inputs` (as per the old code's logic), but the `Expected` outputs for Sec 2 and Sec 3 are different from their inputs.\n\n**Revised Conclusion:** The initial simple swap (1<=>4) was insufficient. The pattern observed in Example 2's *expected* output (1<=>4 and 2<=>3) seems more promising. Let's re-evaluate Example 1 based on this 1<=>4, 2<=>3 swap:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Swap 1<=>4, 2<=>3 Hypothesis):**\n    *   Input Sec 1 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 4? (Input 1: 5 pixels). (Expected 4: 5 pixels). Let's check shape. Input 1 TL=(0,2), Rel=(0,0),(1,1),(3,-1),(3,1),(4,0). Expected 4: (0,17), (1,18), (3,16), (3,18), (4,17). Place Rel at (0,16): (0,16), (1,17), (3,15 invalid), (3,17), (4,16). *Doesn't match.*\n    *   Input Sec 4 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 1? (Input 4: 1 pixel). (Expected 1: 1 pixel). Input 4 TL=(2,18), Rel=(0,0). Expected 1: (2,3). Place Rel at (2,1): (2,1). *Doesn't match.*\n    *   Input Sec 2 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 3? (Input 2: 2 pixels). (Expected 3: 3 pixels). *Doesn't match count.*\n    *   Input Sec 3 pattern -> Expected Output Sec 2? (Input 3: 3 pixels). (Expected 2: 2 pixels). *Doesn't match count.*\n\n**Final Revised Conclusion:** Neither the simple 1<=>4 swap nor the full 1<=>4, 2<=>3 swap consistently explains both examples. There must be a condition or variation. Let's look at the number of yellow pixels per section:\n\n*   **Example 1 Input:** Sec1=5, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=1\n*   **Example 1 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=5\n*   **Example 2 Input:** Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1\n*   **Example 2 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=4\n\nNotice in Example 1, the *counts* seem to swap: Sec1 count (5) goes to Sec4, Sec4 count (1) goes to Sec1. Sec2 and Sec3 counts remain the same.\nIn Example 2, the counts *also* swap: Sec1 count (3) goes to Sec4, Sec4 count (1) goes to Sec1. Sec2 count (2) goes to Sec2, Sec3 count (4) goes to Sec3.\n\nWait, the tool output shows my manual check for Example 2 counts was wrong. Let's re-verify using the tool output:\n*   **Example 2 Input:** Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1\n*   **Example 2 Expected:** Sec1=1, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=4\n\nHere, the counts swap: Sec1(3)<->Sec4(1) becomes ExpSec1(1), ExpSec4(3?? No, 4). Sec2(2)<->Sec3(4) becomes ExpSec2(2), ExpSec3(3?? No, 3). This is inconsistent again.\n\nLet's re-examine the code output for Example 1 where Sec 2 and 3 matched Input and Expected:\n*   Sec 2 Input: [(2, 7), (4, 8)] -> Expected: [(2, 7), (4, 8)]\n*   Sec 3 Input: [(1, 13), (3, 12), (4, 14)] -> Expected: [(1, 13), (3, 12), (4, 14)]\nIt seems in Example 1, **only** sections 1 and 4 swap their patterns.\n\nLet's re-examine the code output for Example 2 where Sec 2 and 3 did *not* match Expected:\n*   Sec 2 Input: [(1, 6), (4, 7)] -> Expected: [(2, 6), (4, 7)]\n*   Sec 3 Input: [(1, 11), (1, 14), (3, 14), (4, 12)] -> Expected: [(1, 11), (1, 13), (4, 12)]\nIt seems in Example 2, **all four** sections swap their patterns in pairs (1<=>4, 2<=>3).\n\n**Hypothesis Refined:** There is a condition determining *which* pairs swap.\n*   Condition Met (Example 2): Swap 1<=>4 AND Swap 2<=>3.\n*   Condition Not Met (Example 1): Swap 1<=>4 ONLY.\n\nWhat could the condition be? Let's compare inputs:\n*   Input 1: Sec1=5, Sec2=2, Sec3=3, Sec4=1 yellows. Total Yellows = 11\n*   Input 2: Sec1=3, Sec2=2, Sec3=4, Sec4=1 yellows. Total Yellows = 10\n\nMaybe the condition is based on the total number of yellow pixels? If total is even (10), swap all. If total is odd (11), swap only 1<=>4. This fits both examples.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"

Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 1 of the input grid.\n5.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 4 of the input grid.\n6.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (columns 1-4) and Section 4 (columns 16-19) of the *output* grid.\n7.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 1 into output Section 4. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 16.\n8.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 4 into output Section 1. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 1.\n9.  **If** the total yellow pixel count is **even**:\n    a.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 2 of the input grid.\n    b.  Identify the yellow pattern (top-left anchor row and relative coordinates) within Section 3 of the input grid.\n    c.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 2 (columns 6-9) and Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the *output* grid.\n    d.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 2 into output Section 3. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 11.\n    e.  Place the identified pattern from input Section 3 into output Section 2. The pattern's original top-left anchor row determines the placement row, and the column starts at 6.\n10. **Else** (if the total yellow pixel count is **odd**):\n    a.  Sections 2 and 3 of the output grid remain unchanged from the initial copy of the input grid.\n11. The output grid, now containing the conditionally swapped patterns, is the final result."
