Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Constant between input and output.
    - Background: Primarily white (0).
StaticObjects:
  - Type: SeparatorLines
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Shape: Vertical lines
      - Location: Columns 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
      - Role: Divide grid into sections; Remain unchanged.
Sections:
  - ID: 1
    Location: Columns 1-4
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns. Swaps content with Section 4 under certain conditions.
  - ID: 2
    Location: Columns 6-9
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns. Swaps content with Section 3 if the condition is met.
  - ID: 3
    Location: Columns 11-14
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns. Swaps content with Section 2 if the condition is met.
  - ID: 4
    Location: Columns 16-19
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns. Swaps content with Section 1 under certain conditions.
DynamicObjects:
  - Type: PixelPattern
    Properties:
      - Color: Yellow (4)
      - Shape: Collection of pixels within a section, maintaining relative positions based on top-left anchor.
      - Role: Represents the content to be moved.
Condition:
  - Name: DetermineSwapScope
    BasedOn: Total count of yellow (4) pixels in the entire input grid.
    Rule:
      - If total yellow count is EVEN: Swap patterns between Sections 1 and 4, AND between Sections 2 and 3.
      - If total yellow count is ODD: Swap patterns ONLY between Sections 1 and 4. Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
Actions:
  - Name: CalculateTotalYellows
    Target: Entire input grid.
    Details: Count all pixels with value 4.
  - Name: IdentifyPatterns
    Target: Yellow pixels within Sections 1, 2, 3, 4.
    Details: For each section, determine the set of yellow pixel coordinates, find the top-leftmost pixel (min_row, min_col), and calculate relative coordinates.
  - Name: ClearTargetSections
    Target: Output grid sections involved in the swap based on the condition (1&4 always, 2&3 if total yellows is even).
    Details: Set all pixels within the target columns to white (0), preserving the green separators.
  - Name: PlaceSwappedPatterns
    Details:
      - Get pattern (anchor row, relative coords) from Input Section 1. Place in Output Section 4, anchored at (anchor_row1, 16).
      - Get pattern from Input Section 4. Place in Output Section 1, anchored at (anchor_row4, 1).
      - IF total yellows is EVEN:
        - Get pattern from Input Section 2. Place in Output Section 3, anchored at (anchor_row2, 11).
        - Get pattern from Input Section 3. Place in Output Section 2, anchored at (anchor_row3, 6).
Relationships:
  - Sections 1 and 4 are linked by a swap operation.
  - Sections 2 and 3 are linked by a swap operation *only if* the total number of yellow pixels in the input is even.
  - Yellow pixel patterns maintain their internal relative structure during swaps, anchored by their original top-leftmost pixel's row and the target section's starting column.
