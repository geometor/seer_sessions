Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Constant between input and output.
    - Background: Primarily white (0).
StaticObjects:
  - Type: SeparatorLines
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Shape: Vertical lines
      - Location: Columns 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
      - Role: Divide grid into sections; Remain unchanged.
Sections:
  - ID: 1
    Location: Columns 1-4
    Role: Contains dynamic patterns; Swaps content with Section 4.
  - ID: 2
    Location: Columns 6-9
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns; Content remains unchanged.
  - ID: 3
    Location: Columns 11-14
    Role: Contains potentially dynamic patterns; Content remains unchanged.
  - ID: 4
    Location: Columns 16-19
    Role: Contains dynamic patterns; Swaps content with Section 1.
DynamicObjects:
  - Type: PixelPattern
    Properties:
      - Color: Yellow (4)
      - Shape: Collection of pixels within a section, maintaining relative positions.
      - Role: Represents the content to be moved.
Actions:
  - Name: IdentifyPatterns
    Target: Yellow pixels within Section 1 and Section 4.
    Details: Determine the set of yellow pixel coordinates and their relative arrangement for each section. Identify the top-leftmost pixel coordinate for each pattern.
  - Name: ClearTargetSections
    Target: Output grid Sections 1 and 4.
    Details: Set all pixels within columns 1-4 and 16-19 to white (0), preserving the green separators.
  - Name: SwapAndPlacePatterns
    Details:
      - Move the identified pattern from input Section 1 to output Section 4. The top-leftmost pixel of the pattern is placed at its original row, column 16. Other pixels are placed relative to this anchor.
      - Move the identified pattern from input Section 4 to output Section 1. The top-leftmost pixel of the pattern is placed at its original row, column 1. Other pixels are placed relative to this anchor.
Relationships:
  - Sections 1 and 4 are linked by a swap operation.
  - Sections 2 and 3 are independent of the swap operation.
  - Yellow pixel patterns maintain their internal relative structure during the swap.
