## General Assessment

The previous attempts failed because the transformation rule is conditional and more complex than a simple pairwise swap. The initial analysis correctly identified the static grid structure (green separators) and the four operational sections. The key dynamic elements are the yellow pixel patterns within these sections.

The failure analysis revealed two distinct transformation behaviors across the examples:
1.  **Example 1:** Sections 1 and 4 swap their yellow patterns, while Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.
2.  **Example 2:** A cyclic shift occurs: Pattern from Section 1 moves to Section 3, Pattern from Section 3 moves to Section 4, Pattern from Section 4 moves to Section 1. Section 2's pattern remains in Section 2.

The determining factor for which rule applies appears to be the number of yellow pixels in **Section 3** of the input grid.
*   If `count(yellows in Section 3) == 3`, Rule A (1<=>4 swap) applies.
*   Otherwise (e.g., `count(yellows in Section 3) == 4` in Example 2), Rule B (1->3->4->1 cycle, 2->2) applies.

The placement mechanism seems consistent: a pattern moved to a new section retains its shape (relative pixel coordinates), and its placement is anchored by its original top-leftmost pixel's **row** and the **starting column** of the target section.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the pattern counts and anchor points for the input grids to confirm the condition and the placement logic.

*   Section Definitions: Sec 1 (cols 1-4), Sec 2 (cols 6-9), Sec 3 (cols 11-14), Sec 4 (cols 16-19).
*   Color 4 = Yellow.

**Metrics Interpretation:**

The metrics confirm the hypothesis:
*   **Input 1:** Section 3 has 3 yellow pixels. This corresponds to the observed 1<=>4 swap behavior (Rule A).
*   **Input 2:** Section 3 has 4 yellow pixels. This corresponds to the observed 1->3->4->1 cycle behavior (Rule B).

The anchor points identified will be crucial for the correct placement logic in the natural language program and subsequent code.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the boundaries of the four operational sections: Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 2 (cols 6-9), Section 3 (cols 11-14), Section 4 (cols 16-19).
3.  Identify the yellow pattern for each section (1, 2, 3, 4) in the *input* grid. For each pattern, record:
    *   Its top-leftmost anchor row (`anchor_row`).
    *   The list of relative coordinates (`relative_coords`) of its yellow pixels with respect to the anchor.
4.  Count the number of yellow pixels within Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the *input* grid (`section3_yellow_count`).
5.  **If** `section3_yellow_count` is equal to 3 (Rule A):
    a.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4) and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    b.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 1 into output Section 4. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row1`, and the target start column 16.
    c.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 4 into output Section 1. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row4`, and the target start column 1.
    d.  (Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged as per the initial grid copy).
6.  **Else** (if `section3_yellow_count` is not equal to 3, Rule B):
    a.  Clear all pixels (set to white 0) within Section 1 (cols 1-4), Section 3 (cols 11-14), and Section 4 (cols 16-19) of the *output* grid.
    b.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 1 into output Section 3. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row1`, and the target start column 11.
    c.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 3 into output Section 4. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row3`, and the target start column 16.
    d.  Place the pattern identified from input Section 4 into output Section 1. Use the pattern's `relative_coords`, its original `anchor_row4`, and the target start column 1.
    e.  (Section 2 remains unchanged as per the initial grid copy).
7.  The modified output grid is the final result.
