"""
The transformation operates on a grid divided into four sections by vertical green lines.
Sections are defined by column ranges: Sec 1 (1-4), Sec 2 (6-9), Sec 3 (11-14), Sec 4 (16-19).
The transformation involves swapping the yellow pixel (color 4) patterns between sections.

The scope of the swap depends on the total count of yellow pixels in the input grid:
1. If the total yellow count is EVEN:
   - The pattern in Section 1 is swapped with the pattern in Section 4.
   - The pattern in Section 2 is swapped with the pattern in Section 3.
2. If the total yellow count is ODD:
   - ONLY the pattern in Section 1 is swapped with the pattern in Section 4.
   - Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.

Patterns are defined by the relative positions of yellow pixels within a section, anchored by the top-leftmost yellow pixel. When swapped, the pattern retains its shape, and its top-left anchor is placed at the same row as the original anchor but in the starting column of the destination section.
