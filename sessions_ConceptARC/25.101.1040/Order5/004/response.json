            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempts failed because the transformation rule is conditional and more complex than a simple pairwise swap. The initial analysis correctly identified the static grid structure (green separators) and the four operational sections. The key dynamic elements are the yellow pixel patterns within these sections.\n\nThe failure analysis revealed two distinct transformation behaviors across the examples:\n1.  **Example 1:** Sections 1 and 4 swap their yellow patterns, while Sections 2 and 3 remain unchanged.\n2.  **Example 2:** A cyclic shift occurs: Pattern from Section 1 moves to Section 3, Pattern from Section 3 moves to Section 4, Pattern from Section 4 moves to Section 1. Section 2's pattern remains in Section 2.\n\nThe determining factor for which rule applies appears to be the number of yellow pixels in **Section 3** of the input grid.\n*   If `count(yellows in Section 3) == 3`, Rule A (1<=>4 swap) applies.\n*   Otherwise (e.g., `count(yellows in Section 3) == 4` in Example 2), Rule B (1->3->4->1 cycle, 2->2) applies.\n\nThe placement mechanism seems consistent: a pattern moved to a new section retains its shape (relative pixel coordinates), and its placement is anchored by its original top-leftmost pixel's **row** and the **starting column** of the target section.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the pattern counts and anchor points for the input grids to confirm the condition and the placement logic.\n\n*   Section Definitions: Sec 1 (cols 1-4), Sec 2 (cols 6-9), Sec 3 (cols 11-14), Sec 4 (cols 16-19).\n*   Color 4 = Yellow.\n\n"
