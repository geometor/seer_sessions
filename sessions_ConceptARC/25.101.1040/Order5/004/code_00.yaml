Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Constant between input and output.
    - Background: Primarily white (0).
StaticObjects:
  - Type: SeparatorLines
    Properties:
      - Color: Green (3)
      - Shape: Vertical lines
      - Location: Columns 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
      - Role: Divide grid into sections; Remain unchanged.
Sections:
  - ID: 1
    Location: Columns 1-4
  - ID: 2
    Location: Columns 6-9
  - ID: 3
    Location: Columns 11-14
  - ID: 4
    Location: Columns 16-19
DynamicObjects:
  - Type: PixelPattern
    Properties:
      - Color: Yellow (4)
      - Shape: Collection of pixels within a section, maintaining relative positions.
      - Anchor: Defined by the top-leftmost yellow pixel coordinate (min_row, min_col) within the section in the input grid.
      - Role: Represents the content to be moved.
Condition:
  - Name: DetermineTransformationRule
    BasedOn: Count of yellow (4) pixels within Section 3 (columns 11-14) of the input grid.
    Rules:
      - Rule A: If count == 3.
      - Rule B: If count != 3.
Actions:
  - Name: IdentifyPatternsAndAnchors
    Target: Yellow pixels within each Section (1, 2, 3, 4) of the input grid.
    Details: For each section, find all yellow pixel coordinates, determine the top-leftmost anchor (min_row, min_col), and calculate the relative coordinates of all yellow pixels with respect to this anchor.
  - Name: CountYellowsInSection3
    Target: Input grid, Section 3 (columns 11-14).
    Details: Count pixels with value 4.
  - Name: ApplyTransformation
    Details: Based on the condition (Section 3 yellow count):
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Clear the yellow pixels (set to white 0) in the sections that will receive new patterns.
      - Place the patterns according to the selected rule (A or B), using the identified relative coordinates and the placement logic.
  - Name: PatternPlacementLogic
    SourcePattern: The pattern (relative coordinates) identified from a source section in the input grid.
    SourceAnchorRow: The row coordinate of the top-leftmost pixel of the source pattern in the input grid.
    TargetSectionStartCol: The first column index of the section where the pattern is being placed.
    Details: Place the source pattern's anchor pixel (relative coord (0,0)) at (SourceAnchorRow, TargetSectionStartCol) in the output grid. Place all other pixels relative to this new anchor position.
TransformationRules:
  - Rule A (Section 3 count == 3):
    - Clear Output Sections: 1 and 4.
    - Pattern Movement:
      - Input Pattern 1 -> Output Section 4
      - Input Pattern 4 -> Output Section 1
      - Input Pattern 2 -> Output Section 2 (no change from input)
      - Input Pattern 3 -> Output Section 3 (no change from input)
    - Placement: Uses PatternPlacementLogic.
  - Rule B (Section 3 count != 3):
    - Clear Output Sections: 1, 3, and 4. (Section 2 remains unchanged).
    - Pattern Movement:
      - Input Pattern 1 -> Output Section 3
      - Input Pattern 3 -> Output Section 4
      - Input Pattern 4 -> Output Section 1
      - Input Pattern 2 -> Output Section 2 (no change from input)
    - Placement: Uses PatternPlacementLogic.
