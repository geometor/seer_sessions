## Perception

The input consists of grids containing various colored objects (shapes made of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color) on a white background. The output is always a single row grid filled entirely with the white background color. The width of the output row grid varies across examples.

Observing the relationship between input and output across the examples, it appears the width of the output grid corresponds to the total number of distinct, contiguous, non-background colored objects present in the input grid.

-   **Example 1:** The input has one gray object, one red object, one yellow object, and one green object. Total = 4 objects. The output is a 1x4 white grid.
-   **Example 2:** The input has one magenta object and two distinct yellow objects. Total = 3 objects. The output is a 1x3 white grid.
-   **Example 3:** The input has one yellow object, one green object, one orange object, and one azure object. Total = 4 objects. The output is a 1x4 white grid.

The task seems to be counting the number of non-background objects in the input and representing this count as the width of a single-row, all-white output grid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Create a single-row output grid filled with the background color (white, 0), where the width of the row is determined by the total count of distinct, contiguous, non-background colored objects in the input grid.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: object
    description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color, where the color is not the background color. Contiguity includes orthogonal and diagonal adjacency.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - contains multiple objects of various colors and shapes.
    - has a background color (white, 0).

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 1 pixel.
    - width: Equal to the total number of distinct non-background objects found in the input grid.
    - content: All pixels are the background color (white, 0).

transformation:
  - step: Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid whose color is not the background color (white, 0).
  - step: Count the total number of identified objects.
  - step: Create a new grid with height 1 and width equal to the count obtained in the previous step.
  - step: Fill the new grid entirely with the background color (white, 0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all groups of connected pixels that are not the background color. Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each such connected group constitutes a single "object".
3.  Count the total number of distinct objects identified in step 2.
4.  Determine the required width `N` for the output grid, where `N` is the total object count from step 3.
5.  Construct the output grid as a single row (height 1) with width `N`.
6.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the background color (white, 0).
```python
"""
This module transforms an input grid based on the following rule:

1. Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more connected pixels of the same color, where the color is not the background color (white, 0). Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).
2. Count the total number of these distinct non-background objects.
3. Create a new output grid that has a height of 1 and a width equal to the total count of objects found.
4. Fill the entire output grid with the background color (white, 0).
