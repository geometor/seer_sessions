            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the output format (a single row of white pixels) but misinterpreted the rule for determining the output width. The provided code implemented the counting of contiguous objects (using 8-way connectivity), but the test results show this count does not consistently match the expected output width.\n\n-   **Example 1:** Code counted 6 objects, expected width 4.\n-   **Example 2:** Code counted 2 objects (based on report), expected width 3. (This count needs verification).\n-   **Example 3:** Code counted 5 objects, expected width 4.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the object counts generated by the `_find_objects` function using code execution.\n2.  Calculate the number of distinct non-background colors for each example.\n3.  Compare these two metrics (`O` = object count, `C` = color count) with the expected output width (`W`).\n4.  Formulate a revised hypothesis that explains the relationship between `O`, `C`, and `W` for all examples.\n5.  Update the facts and natural language program based on the revised hypothesis.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's use code execution to get the precise object count (`O`) using the provided `_find_objects` logic and calculate the distinct color count (`C`) for each example.\n\n"

Cell (6,4) (bottom of L) is diagonally adjacent to (7,3) (top-left of the block). Therefore, there is only ONE yellow object.\n    So, for Example 2: Magenta Object (1), Yellow Object (1). Total Objects (O) = 2. Distinct Colors (C) = 2. Expected Width (W) = 3.\n    The previous hypothesis `(If O == C + 1 AND C == 2, Width = O, Else Width = C)` predicted Width = C = 2, which is incorrect.\n\n-   **Example 3:** O=5, C=4, W=4. Hypothesis `Width=C` holds.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis Search:**\n\nWe need a rule that produces:\n-   Ex 1: O=6, C=4 -> W=4\n-   Ex 2: O=2, C=2 -> W=3\n-   Ex 3: O=5, C=4 -> W=4\n\nThe rule seems to be `W=C` for Examples 1 and 3. Why is Example 2 different (W=3 when C=2)?\nWhat if the width is the maximum of the object count and the color count?\n-   Ex 1: max(O=6, C=4) = 6. Incorrect (W=4).\n-   Ex 2: max(O=2, C=2) = 2. Incorrect (W=3).\n-   Ex 3: max(O=5, C=4) = 5. Incorrect (W=4).\n\nWhat if it's the minimum?\n-   Ex 1: min(O=6, C=4) = 4. Correct!\n-   Ex 2: min(O=2, C=2) = 2. Incorrect (W=3).\n-   Ex 3: min(O=5, C=4) = 4. Correct!\n\nThis \"minimum\" rule works for Examples 1 and 3. Again, Example 2 is the outlier.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 2: O=2, C=2, W=3. How to get 3 from 2 and 2? Maybe `W = O + C - 1`? (2+2-1=3).\nTest this on others:\n-   Ex 1: O=6, C=4. W = 6 + 4 - 1 = 9. Incorrect (W=4).\n-   Ex 3: O=5, C=4. W = 5 + 4 - 1 = 8. Incorrect (W=4).\n\nHow about `W = (O + C) / 2` rounded?\n-   Ex 1: (6+4)/2 = 5. Incorrect.\n-   Ex 2: (2+2)/2 = 2. Incorrect.\n-   Ex 3: (5+4)/2 = 4.5 -> 4 or 5? If 4, Correct.\n\nThis isn't yielding a simple arithmetic rule. Let's look at the objects themselves again.\nMaybe the definition of \"object\" is different. What if objects are defined by color *first*, and we only count separate components if they are *really* far apart? No, ARC usually relies on simple adjacency.\n\nCould the number of *pixels* matter?\n- Ex 1: O=6, C=4, W=4. Total non-bg pixels: Gray(5), Red(22), Yellow(11), Green(17). Sum=55.\n- Ex 2: O=2, C=2, W=3. Total non-bg pixels: Magenta(4), Yellow(28). Sum=32.\n- Ex 3: O=5, C=4, W=4. Total non-bg pixels: Yellow(3), Azure(5), Green(3), Orange(5). Sum=16.\nNo obvious link between pixel counts and W.\n\nLet's revisit the \"minimum\" hypothesis: `W = min(O, C)` works for Ex 1 and 3. Why does Ex 2 give `W=3` instead of `min(2, 2) = 2`?\nPerhaps there's a specific condition for Ex 2 that adds 1?\nEx 2 has O=C=2. Is the condition `if O == C then W = O + 1 else W = min(O, C)`?\n-   Ex 1: O=6, C=4. O != C. W = min(6, 4) = 4. Correct.\n-   Ex 2: O=2, C=2. O == C. W = O + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Correct.\n-   Ex 3: O=5, C=4. O != C. W = min(5, 4) = 4. Correct.\n\nThis hypothesis works for all three examples!\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n1.  Count `O`: the number of distinct contiguous non-background objects (using 8-way connectivity).\n2.  Count `C`: the number of distinct non-background colors present.\n3.  If `O` equals `C`, the output width `W` is `O + 1`.\n4.  Otherwise (if `O` does not equal `C`), the output width `W` is the minimum of `O` and `C`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
