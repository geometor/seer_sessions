task_description: Create a single-row output grid filled with the background color (white, 0), where the width of the row is determined by comparing the count of distinct colors and the count of contiguous objects in the input grid.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: object
    description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color, where the color is not the background color. Contiguity includes orthogonal and diagonal adjacency (8-way).
  - name: object_count (O)
    description: The total number of distinct objects found in the input grid.
  - name: color_count (C)
    description: The total number of distinct non-background colors present in the input grid.
  - name: output_width (W)
    description: The width of the single-row output grid.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - contains objects of various colors and shapes.
    - has a background color (white, 0).

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 1 pixel.
    - width: Determined by the rule comparing object_count (O) and color_count (C).
    - content: All pixels are the background color (white, 0).

transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify all distinct non-background colors present in the input grid and count them to get `C`.
  - step: Identify all distinct contiguous non-background objects (using 8-way connectivity) in the input grid and count them to get `O`.
  - step: Compare `O` and `C`.
  - step: If `O` is equal to `C`, set the output width `W = O + 1`.
  - step: If `O` is not equal to `C`, set the output width `W = min(O, C)`.
  - step: Create a new grid with height 1 and width `W`.
  - step: Fill the new grid entirely with the background color (white, 0).
