The output is always a single row grid filled entirely with the white background color. The width of the output row grid varies across examples.\n\nObserving the relationship between input and output across the examples, it appears the width of the output grid corresponds to the total number of distinct, contiguous, non-background colored objects present in the input grid.\n\n-   **Example 1:** The input has one gray object, one red object, one yellow object, and one green object. Total = 4 objects. The output is a 1x4 white grid.\n-   **Example 2:** The input has one magenta object and two distinct yellow objects. Total = 3 objects. The output is a 1x3 white grid.\n-   **Example 3:** The input has one yellow object, one green object, one orange object, and one azure object. Total = 4 objects. The output is a 1x4 white grid.\n\nThe task seems to be counting the number of non-background objects in the input and representing this count as the width of a single-row, all-white output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
