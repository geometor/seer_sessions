task_description: Create a single-row output grid filled with the background color (white, 0), where the width of the row is determined by the total count of distinct, contiguous, non-background colored objects in the input grid.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: object
    description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color, where the color is not the background color. Contiguity includes orthogonal and diagonal adjacency.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - contains multiple objects of various colors and shapes.
    - has a background color (white, 0).

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 1 pixel.
    - width: Equal to the total number of distinct non-background objects found in the input grid.
    - content: All pixels are the background color (white, 0).

transformation:
  - step: Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid whose color is not the background color (white, 0).
  - step: Count the total number of identified objects.
  - step: Create a new grid with height 1 and width equal to the count obtained in the previous step.
  - step: Fill the new grid entirely with the background color (white, 0).
