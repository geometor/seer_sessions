An object is defined as a group of one or more connected pixels of the same color, where the color is not the background color (white, 0). Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).\n2. Count the total number of these distinct non-background objects.\n3. Create a new output grid that has a height of 1 and a width equal to the total count of objects found.\n4. Fill the entire output grid with the background color (white, 0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\n\ndef _find_objects(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all distinct contiguous non-background objects in the grid.\n    Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 8-way connectivity.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid (list of lists of integers).\n\n    Returns:\n        The total count of distinct non-background objects.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()  # Keep track of visited cells (r, c)\n    object_count = 0\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # Define 8 directions for neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),           (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the cell is a non-background color and hasn't been visited yet\n            if grid[r][c] != background_color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                # Found the start of a new object\n                object_count += 1\n                object_color = grid[r][c] # Get the color of the current object\n                \n                # Start BFS to find all connected cells of the same color\n                queue = collections.deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c)) # Mark the starting cell as visited\n\n                while queue:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = queue.popleft()\n\n                    # Explore all 8 neighbors\n                    for dr, dc in directions:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n\n                        # Check if the neighbor is within the grid bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            # Check if the neighbor has the same color as the object \n                            # and has not been visited yet\n                            if grid[nr][nc] == object_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nr, nc)) # Mark neighbor as visited\n                                queue.append((nr, nc)) # Add neighbor to the queue to explore from\n    \n    return object_count\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by counting non-background objects and creating \n    a corresponding white output row.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid with integer color values.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the output grid (a single row of background color).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find and count all distinct non-background objects in the input grid\n    num_objects = _find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Define the background color\n    background_color = 0\n    \n    # Create the output grid: a single row with width equal to the number of objects,\n    # filled with the background color.\n    # If num_objects is 0, this correctly creates an empty inner list `[[]]`, \n    # which might need adjustment depending on expected output for zero objects.\n    # Based on examples, a 1xN grid is expected.
