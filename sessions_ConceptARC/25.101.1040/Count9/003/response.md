"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rule:
1. Count the number of distinct non-background colors present in the grid (C).
2. Count the number of distinct contiguous non-background objects in the grid using 8-way connectivity (O).
3. Compare O and C.
4. If O equals C, the output grid width W is O + 1.
5. If O does not equal C, the output grid width W is the minimum of O and C.
6. The output grid is a single row of height 1 and width W, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
