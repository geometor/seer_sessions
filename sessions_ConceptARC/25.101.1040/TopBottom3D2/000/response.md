*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves modifying input grids based on patterns within their columns.
    *   The input and output grids always have the same dimensions.
    *   The modification involves changing certain non-white pixels to white (0).
    *   The rule for modification depends on the colors present within each column and their vertical arrangement.
    *   Two main cases seem to exist: columns with only one non-white color and columns with multiple non-white colors.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width
      - background_color: 0 # White is the primary background/default color
    transformation_scope: column_based # The transformation logic operates independently on each column
    column_analysis:
      - counts_non_white_colors: True # The number of distinct non-white colors matters
      - frequency_of_colors: True # The relative frequency (majority) of colors matters in some cases
      - vertical_contiguity: True # Whether pixels of the same color form unbroken vertical segments matters
      - vertical_adjacency: True # Whether pixels of a specific color are vertically next to others of the same color matters
    actions:
      - color_change: # Specific non-white pixels are changed
          target_color: 0 # The target color is always white
          conditions: # The conditions depend on the column analysis results
            - condition_1: # Applies to columns with exactly one non-white color (C)
                trigger: if pixels of color C are NOT vertically contiguous (interrupted by white)
                effect: change all pixels of color C to white (0)
            - condition_2: # Applies to columns with more than one non-white color
                trigger: if a unique majority non-white color (C) exists AND no pixel of color C is vertically adjacent to another pixel of color C
                effect: change all pixels of color C to white (0)
            - condition_default: # Otherwise
                effect: keep the column unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid independently, from left to right.
    3.  For the current column:
        a.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the column and count their occurrences.
        b.  **If** exactly one unique non-white color (let's call it `C`) is present in the column:
            i.  Check if all pixels of color `C` form a single, uninterrupted vertical block within the column.
            ii. If they do **not** form a single contiguous block (i.e., they are separated by white pixels), change all pixels of color `C` in this column of the output grid to white (0).
        c.  **Else if** more than one unique non-white color is present in the column:
            i.  Determine if there is a single color (let's call it `MajC`) that occurs more frequently than any other non-white color in the column.
            ii. If such a unique majority color `MajC` exists:
                1.  Check if any pixel of color `MajC` in the column is immediately above or below another pixel of color `MajC`.
                2.  If **no** pixel of color `MajC` is vertically adjacent to another pixel of color `MajC`, change all pixels of color `MajC` in this column of the output grid to white (0).
        d.  **Else** (column contains only white pixels, or multiple non-white colors with a tie for the most frequent, or other conditions not met): Leave the column in the output grid unchanged from the input.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
