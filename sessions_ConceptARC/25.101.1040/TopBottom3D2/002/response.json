            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic applied to columns containing only a single non-white color was incorrect. The assumption was that non-contiguous single colors should be changed to white, but the examples show that single non-white colors are *always* preserved, regardless of contiguity or adjacency.\n\nThe logic for columns with multiple non-white colors appears correct: identify the unique majority color (if one exists) and change only those pixels to white. If there's no unique majority, the column remains unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the natural language program and the subsequent code implementation to reflect that single non-white colors in a column are always kept, and the modification (changing the unique majority color to white) only applies when multiple non-white colors are present in a column.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's re-verify the column analysis based on the revised understanding:\n\n**Rule:** Process each column. If there are multiple distinct non-white colors AND one color is strictly more frequent than any other, change all pixels of that most frequent color to white (0). Otherwise, keep the column as is.\n\n"
