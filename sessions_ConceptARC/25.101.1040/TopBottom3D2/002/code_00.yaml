task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width
  - background_color: 0 # White is the primary background/default color
transformation_scope: column_based # The transformation logic operates independently on each column
column_analysis:
  - counts_non_white_colors: True # The number of distinct non-white colors matters
  - frequency_of_colors: True # The relative frequency (majority) of colors matters
actions:
  - color_change: # Specific non-white pixels are changed
      target_color: 0 # The target color is always white
      conditions: # The conditions depend on the column analysis results
        - condition_1: # Applies to columns with more than one non-white color
            trigger: If a unique majority non-white color (MajC) exists (i.e., one color appears strictly more often than any other non-white color)
            effect: Change all pixels of color MajC in this column to white (0)
        - condition_default: # Otherwise (column contains 0 or 1 non-white color, or multiple non-white colors with no unique majority)
            effect: Keep the column unchanged
