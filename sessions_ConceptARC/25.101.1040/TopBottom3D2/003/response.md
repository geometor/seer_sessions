"""
Processes each column of the input grid independently. 
If a column contains multiple distinct non-white colors and one of these colors 
appears strictly more frequently than any other non-white color in that column 
(i.e., it has a unique majority), then all pixels of that majority color 
within that column are changed to white (0). 
Otherwise (if the column has 0 or 1 non-white color, or multiple non-white 
colors without a unique majority), the column remains unchanged.
