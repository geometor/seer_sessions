"""
This function transforms an input grid based on the number and values of distinct non-white colors present.

Transformation Logic:

1.  **Analyze Input Colors**: Identify all distinct non-white (non-zero) colors in the input grid.
2.  **Count Distinct Colors**: Let the number of distinct non-white colors be `N`.
3.  **Apply Conditional Rules**:
    *   **If `N > 1` (Multiple distinct non-white colors):**
        *   Find the non-white color with the highest numerical value.
        *   Remove all pixels of this highest color by changing them to white (0).
    *   **If `N == 1` (Single distinct non-white color):**
        *   Let the single non-white color be `C`.
        *   Find all connected components (using 8-way adjacency) formed by pixels of color `C`.
        *   Identify pixels to remove based on component properties:
            *   Remove all pixels belonging to components of size 1 (isolated pixels).
            *   For components consisting of exactly two pixels arranged horizontally, remove the leftmost pixel.
        *   Keep all other pixels of color `C`.
    *   **If `N == 0` (No non-white colors):**
        *   The grid remains unchanged (all white).
