input_features:
  - name: pixel_colors
    description: The grid contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
    values:
      - example_1: [0, 2, 3] # white, red, green
      - example_2: [0, 4] # white, yellow
  - name: color_count
    description: Number of distinct non-white colors in the input grid.
    values:
      - example_1: 2
      - example_2: 1
  - name: max_color_value
    description: The maximum numerical value among non-white colors present.
    values:
      - example_1: 3 # green
      - example_2: 4 # yellow
  - name: connected_components
    description: Non-white pixels of the same color form connected components (using 8-way adjacency).
    properties: [size, shape, pixels]
    relevant_when: color_count == 1
    observations:
      - example_2:
          components:
            - size: 1 # e.g., (0,0), (0,23), (1,6)
            - size: 2
              shape: horizontal_line # e.g., {(0,18), (0,19)}, {(1,13), (1,14)}
            - size: 24
              shape: complex

actions:
  - name: remove_pixel
    description: Change a pixel's color to the background color (0).
    conditions:
      - if: color_count > 1
        target: pixels where color == max_color_value
      - if: color_count == 1
        target: pixels belonging to components satisfying specific criteria (size 1, or start of small simple line)

transformation_logic:
  - condition: color_count > 1
    action: Remove all pixels whose color matches the maximum non-white color value in the input.
  - condition: color_count == 1
    action:
      - Find all connected components (8-way adjacency) of the single non-white color.
      - Remove pixels in components of size 1.
      - For components forming horizontal line segments of size > 1, remove the leftmost pixel.
      - (Hypothesized) For components forming vertical line segments of size > 1, remove the topmost pixel.
      - Keep all other pixels.

output_features:
  - name: pixel_colors
    description: The output grid contains a subset of the input's non-white pixels, or potentially none if all were removed.
    values:
      - example_1: [0, 2]
      - example_2: [0, 4]
