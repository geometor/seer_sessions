            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by selectively removing certain colored pixels (changing them to white/0). The rule for removal depends on the number of distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.\n\n1.  **Case 1: Multiple non-white colors present (Example: train_1)**\n    *   Input `train_1` contains red (2) and green (3) pixels.\n    *   Output `train_1` contains only red (2) pixels.\n    *   Observation: All pixels of the color with the highest numerical value (green=3) are removed (changed to white). The other non-white color (red=2) remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Case 2: Single non-white color present (Example: train_2)**\n    *   Input `train_2` contains only yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Output `train_2` contains fewer yellow (4) pixels. Some specific yellow pixels have been removed.\n    *   Observation: The removal seems related to the structure of the connected components formed by the single non-white color.\n        *   Pixels forming components of size 1 (isolated single pixels) are removed.\n        *   Pixels that are the starting points (leftmost for horizontal, presumably topmost for vertical) of small, simple line-shaped components (like size 2 horizontal segments) are also removed.\n        *   Pixels within larger, more complex components are kept.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

For each pixel coordinate in the set, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n3.  **Return Output**: The modified grid is the result."
