## General Assessment

The initial code failed because it applied the filling rules too broadly. It correctly identified the concept of filling white rectangles based on adjacent or aligned colored shapes but misidentified *which* white rectangles were the targets. The errors in both examples involved filling large background white areas instead of specific, smaller white rectangles that act as bridges or completions.

The strategy for resolving the errors involves:

1.  **Refining Target Identification:** Instead of considering all maximal white rectangles, focus on identifying *specific* white rectangles that fit the "bridging" or "completion" pattern observed.
2.  **Improving Rule Specificity:** Make the conditions for applying the vertical and horizontal fill rules more precise, ensuring they only trigger for the intended target rectangles. This includes verifying the nature of the gap (must be all white) and the alignment/adjacency properties.
3.  **Prioritizing Rules:** Confirm the priority observed (Vertical Below seems to take precedence over Horizontal Left in the examples, though only one rule applies per example).

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   In both examples, exactly 16 pixels were incorrectly changed from white (0) to a non-white color when they should have remained white.
*   **Example 1:** The errors occurred in the large central white rectangle (`[4:8, 3:7]`). The code incorrectly applied fills based on adjacent red (2) and blue (1) shapes. The correct transformation only targeted the smaller white rectangle `[2:4, 4:6]`.
*   **Example 2:** The errors occurred in the large central white rectangle (`[1:5, 2:6]`). The code incorrectly filled this area with magenta (6), likely based on the surrounding magenta frame elements. The correct transformation only targeted the small 1x2 white rectangle `[5, 4:6]`.

**Conclusion:** The core problem is that the previous logic identifies large white areas as "maximal rectangles" and then incorrectly applies filling rules based on adjacent colors, rather than identifying the specific, intended small white "gap" rectangles. The logic needs to isolate only those white rectangles that serve as bridges between *aligned* shapes of the *same color* or direct continuations.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct rectangular areas `W` within the input grid that consist entirely of white pixels (color 0).
3.  For each white rectangle `W` (defined by its top-left corner `r1, c1` and bottom-right corner `r2, c2`):
    a.  **Vertical Bridging Check:**
        i.  Search downwards starting from row `r2 + 1` within the columns `c1` to `c2`. Find the first row `r_below` (if any) that contains at least one non-white pixel within these columns.
        ii. If such a row `r_below` is found, check if the segment `input_grid[r_below, c1 : c2+1]` is monochromatic (all pixels have the same color `C`) and non-white (`C != 0`).
        iii. Also, verify that the entire rectangular region between `W` and this segment (i.e., `input_grid[r2 + 1 : r_below, c1 : c2 + 1]`) consists *only* of white pixels.
        iv. If all these conditions (found aligned monochromatic segment below, gap is purely white) are met, fill the area corresponding to `W` in the `output_grid` with color `C`. Mark `W` as processed and continue to the next white rectangle.
    b.  **Horizontal Bridging Check:** (Only perform if the Vertical Bridging Check did not result in filling `W`)
        i.  Check the column `c_left = c1 - 1`. If `c_left` is within bounds, check if the segment `input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c_left]` is monochromatic (all color `C_L`) and non-white (`C_L != 0`).
        ii. Check the column `c_right = c2 + 1`. If `c_right` is within bounds, check if the segment `input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c_right]` is monochromatic (all color `C_R`) and non-white (`C_R != 0`).
        iii. If both adjacent left and right segments exist, are monochromatic non-white, and have the *same* color (`C_L == C_R`), then fill the area corresponding to `W` in the `output_grid` with color `C_L`. Mark `W` as processed and continue to the next white rectangle.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.
