            The target white rectangle is located above a vertically aligned
            monochromatic blue shape ([[8,4],[8,5],[9,4],[9,5]]).
            The target rectangle has the same width (2) and occupies the same columns (4, 5)
            as the blue shape below.
            The entire rectangular region between the bottom of the target rectangle (row 3)
            and the top of the blue shape (row 8) consists only of white pixels
            ([[4,4]..[7,5]]). The target is filled with the color of the aligned shape below.

            The target white rectangle is located between a horizontally aligned
            monochromatic magenta shape to its left ([[5,2],[5,3]]) and another
            magenta shape to its right ([[5,6]]).
            The target rectangle has the same height (1) and occupies the same row (5)
            as the magenta shapes beside it.
            The target rectangle directly bridges the gap between the left and right shapes.
            It is filled with the color of the adjacent/aligned shapes.
