## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed because its rules for filling white rectangles were too general. Specifically:
1.  The **Vertical Bridging** rule was correctly implemented and worked for Example 1's target, but the subsequent **Horizontal Bridging** rule incorrectly filled a large background area in both Example 1 and Example 2.
2.  The **Horizontal Bridging** rule, requiring matching colors on both left and right, failed to identify the target fill in Example 2, where the fill seems based on extending the color from only the left side. It also incorrectly triggered on large white areas bordered by the same color.

The strategy for resolution involves:
1.  **Refining Target Identification:** Introduce a size constraint to prevent filling large background areas. Only relatively "thin" white rectangles (height <= 2 or width <= 2) should be considered candidates for filling.
2.  **Adjusting Horizontal Rule:** Change the horizontal rule from "bridging" (requiring matching colors on both sides) to "extension" (filling based on the color of an adjacent monochromatic segment to the left, or if none, to the right).
3.  **Maintaining Vertical Rule:** Keep the vertical bridging rule mostly as is (checking for a monochromatic segment below separated by a purely white gap), as it worked for Example 1.
4.  **Establishing Priority:** Maintain the priority: Vertical Bridge Below > Horizontal Extension Left > Horizontal Extension Right.

**Summary of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The target rectangle `[2:4, 4:6]` was correctly filled with blue (1). However, 16 pixels belonging to the large central white rectangle `[4:8, 3:7]` were incorrectly filled (with colors 1 and 2 based on the flawed logic), whereas they should have remained white (0).
*   **Example 2:** 16 pixels belonging to the large central white rectangle `[1:5, 2:6]` were incorrectly filled with magenta (6) when they should have remained white (0). Additionally, the 2 pixels of the target rectangle `[5, 4:6]` were *not* filled, but they *should* have been filled with magenta (6).

These metrics confirm the assessment: the previous code incorrectly filled large areas and failed to apply the correct logic (extension from left) for the target gap in Example 2.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Find all maximal contiguous rectangular areas `W` composed entirely of white pixels (color 0) in the `input_grid`. Define each `W` by its top-left (`r1`, `c1`) and bottom-right (`r2`, `c2`) coordinates, its height (`H = r2 - r1 + 1`), and width (`W = c2 - c1 + 1`).
3.  Iterate through each found white rectangle `W`. Maintain a flag `filled` for each `W`, initially false.
4.  **Size Constraint Check:** If `H > 2` AND `W > 2`, skip this rectangle and continue to the next `W`.
5.  **Vertical Bridge Below Check:**
    a.  Search downwards from row `r2 + 1` within columns `c1` to `c2`. Find the first row index `r_below` that contains at least one non-white pixel in these columns.
    b.  If such a row `r_below` exists within the grid bounds:
        i.  Extract the segment `S_below = input_grid[r_below, c1 : c2 + 1]`.
        ii. Check if `S_below` is monochromatic (all pixels same color `C`) and non-white (`C != 0`).
        iii. If monochromatic, extract the gap region `G = input_grid[r2 + 1 : r_below, c1 : c2 + 1]`.
        iv. Check if the gap region `G` consists entirely of white pixels (color 0).
        v.  If `S_below` is monochromatic non-white and the gap `G` is all white, then fill the area `output_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c1 : c2 + 1]` with color `C`. Set `filled = True`.
6.  **Horizontal Extension Left Check:** (Only if `filled` is false)
    a.  Check if `c1 > 0` (i.e., a column exists to the left).
    b.  If yes, extract the segment `S_left = input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c1 - 1]`.
    c.  Check if `S_left` is monochromatic non-white (color `C`).
    d.  If yes, fill `output_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c1 : c2 + 1]` with color `C`. Set `filled = True`.
7.  **Horizontal Extension Right Check:** (Only if `filled` is false)
    a.  Check if `c2 < grid_width - 1` (i.e., a column exists to the right).
    b.  If yes, extract the segment `S_right = input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c2 + 1]`.
    c.  Check if `S_right` is monochromatic non-white (color `C`).
    d.  If yes, fill `output_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c1 : c2 + 1]` with color `C`. Set `filled = True`.
8.  After iterating through all white rectangles, return the `output_grid`.
