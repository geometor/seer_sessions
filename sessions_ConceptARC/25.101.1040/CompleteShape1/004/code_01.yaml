            The target is a 2x2 white rectangle. There is a monochromatic blue shape
            below it (sharing columns 4, 5), separated by an all-white rectangular gap.
            The target rectangle's height (2) and width (2) satisfy the condition (H<=2 or W<=2).
            The vertical bridge rule applies.

            The target is a 1x2 white rectangle. There is no vertical bridge below.
            There is a monochromatic magenta shape immediately to its left (sharing row 5).
            The target rectangle's height (1) and width (2) satisfy the condition (H<=2 or W<=2).
            The horizontal extension (left) rule applies.
