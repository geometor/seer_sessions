            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves modifying input grids by filling in specific rectangular areas composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). The color used to fill these white rectangles appears to be determined by the color of adjacent or aligned non-white shapes. The goal seems to be completing or bridging gaps in existing monochromatic (single-color) lines or shapes.\n\n1.  **Example 1:** A 2x2 white rectangle near the top-center is filled with blue (1). This white rectangle is located directly above a vertical column of white space, which in turn is above a 2x2 blue rectangle near the bottom-center. The filling action appears to extend the lower blue rectangle upwards across the white gap.\n2.  **Example 2:** A 1x2 white rectangle near the bottom-center is filled with magenta (6). This white rectangle is located immediately to the right of a 1x2 horizontal segment of magenta pixels. The filling action extends this magenta segment to the right.\n\nThe core operation is identifying these \"fillable\" white rectangles and determining the correct color based on context, specifically looking for monochromatic shapes that are aligned (horizontally or vertically) with the white rectangle and separated only by other white pixels, or directly adjacent.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If such an `S` exists and the separating region is white, fill the region corresponding to `W` in the output grid with the color of `S`.
