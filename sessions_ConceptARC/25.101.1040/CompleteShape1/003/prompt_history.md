## Perception

The task involves modifying input grids by filling in specific rectangular areas composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). The color used to fill these white rectangles appears to be determined by the color of adjacent or aligned non-white shapes. The goal seems to be completing or bridging gaps in existing monochromatic (single-color) lines or shapes.

1.  **Example 1:** A 2x2 white rectangle near the top-center is filled with blue (1). This white rectangle is located directly above a vertical column of white space, which in turn is above a 2x2 blue rectangle near the bottom-center. The filling action appears to extend the lower blue rectangle upwards across the white gap.
2.  **Example 2:** A 1x2 white rectangle near the bottom-center is filled with magenta (6). This white rectangle is located immediately to the right of a 1x2 horizontal segment of magenta pixels. The filling action extends this magenta segment to the right.

The core operation is identifying these "fillable" white rectangles and determining the correct color based on context, specifically looking for monochromatic shapes that are aligned (horizontally or vertically) with the white rectangle and separated only by other white pixels, or directly adjacent.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible rectangular subgrids within the input grid.
3.  Identify maximal contiguous rectangular subgrids composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). Let the current white rectangle be `W`.
4.  For each white rectangle `W`:
    a.  **Check for Vertical Completion Below:** Find the highest non-white, monochromatic rectangle `S` located entirely below `W`, such that `S` has the same width and occupies the same columns as `W`. Check if the rectangular region between the bottom edge of `W` and the top edge of `S` consists entirely of white pixels. If such an `S` exists and the separating region is white, fill the region corresponding to `W` in the output grid with the color of `S`. Stop checking for this `W` and proceed to the next white rectangle.
    b.  **Check for Horizontal Completion Left:** Find the rightmost non-white, monochromatic rectangle `S` located entirely to the left of `W`, such that `S` has the same height and occupies the same rows as `W`. Check if `S` is immediately adjacent to `W` (no gap between them). If such an `S` exists, fill the region corresponding to `W` in the output grid with the color of `S`. Stop checking for this `W` and proceed to the next white rectangle.
    c.  **(Implicit)** Similar checks can be defined for vertical completion above and horizontal completion right, if necessary based on other examples, potentially with a defined priority order (e.g., Below > Left > Above > Right).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies maximal contiguous rectangular areas of white pixels (color 0) within the input grid.
For each such white rectangle, it attempts to determine a fill color based on adjacent or aligned non-white monochromatic shapes, following specific priority rules:

1.  **Vertical Completion Below:** It checks if there is a non-white monochromatic shape S located directly below the white rectangle W, perfectly aligned horizontally (sharing the same columns), and separated from W only by other white pixels. If such a shape S exists, the white rectangle W is filled with the color of S.
2.  **Horizontal Completion Left:** If the vertical check does not result in a fill, it checks if there is a non-white monochromatic shape S located immediately to the left of the white rectangle W, perfectly aligned vertically (sharing the same rows). If such a shape S exists, the white rectangle W is filled with the color of S.

If a fill occurs based on rule 1, rule 2 is not checked for that white rectangle. The process is repeated for all identified maximal white rectangles. The output grid reflects these fill operations.

## General Assessment

The initial code failed because it applied the filling rules too broadly. It correctly identified the concept of filling white rectangles based on adjacent or aligned colored shapes but misidentified *which* white rectangles were the targets. The errors in both examples involved filling large background white areas instead of specific, smaller white rectangles that act as bridges or completions.

The strategy for resolving the errors involves:

1.  **Refining Target Identification:** Instead of considering all maximal white rectangles, focus on identifying *specific* white rectangles that fit the "bridging" or "completion" pattern observed.
2.  **Improving Rule Specificity:** Make the conditions for applying the vertical and horizontal fill rules more precise, ensuring they only trigger for the intended target rectangles. This includes verifying the nature of the gap (must be all white) and the alignment/adjacency properties.
3.  **Prioritizing Rules:** Confirm the priority observed (Vertical Below seems to take precedence over Horizontal Left in the examples, though only one rule applies per example).

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   In both examples, exactly 16 pixels were incorrectly changed from white (0) to a non-white color when they should have remained white.
*   **Example 1:** The errors occurred in the large central white rectangle (`[4:8, 3:7]`). The code incorrectly applied fills based on adjacent red (2) and blue (1) shapes. The correct transformation only targeted the smaller white rectangle `[2:4, 4:6]`.
*   **Example 2:** The errors occurred in the large central white rectangle (`[1:5, 2:6]`). The code incorrectly filled this area with magenta (6), likely based on the surrounding magenta frame elements. The correct transformation only targeted the small 1x2 white rectangle `[5, 4:6]`.

**Conclusion:** The core problem is that the previous logic identifies large white areas as "maximal rectangles" and then incorrectly applies filling rules based on adjacent colors, rather than identifying the specific, intended small white "gap" rectangles. The logic needs to isolate only those white rectangles that serve as bridges between *aligned* shapes of the *same color* or direct continuations.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct rectangular areas `W` within the input grid that consist entirely of white pixels (color 0).
3.  For each white rectangle `W` (defined by its top-left corner `r1, c1` and bottom-right corner `r2, c2`):
    a.  **Vertical Bridging Check:**
        i.  Search downwards starting from row `r2 + 1` within the columns `c1` to `c2`. Find the first row `r_below` (if any) that contains at least one non-white pixel within these columns.
        ii. If such a row `r_below` is found, check if the segment `input_grid[r_below, c1 : c2+1]` is monochromatic (all pixels have the same color `C`) and non-white (`C != 0`).
        iii. Also, verify that the entire rectangular region between `W` and this segment (i.e., `input_grid[r2 + 1 : r_below, c1 : c2 + 1]`) consists *only* of white pixels.
        iv. If all these conditions (found aligned monochromatic segment below, gap is purely white) are met, fill the area corresponding to `W` in the `output_grid` with color `C`. Mark `W` as processed and continue to the next white rectangle.
    b.  **Horizontal Bridging Check:** (Only perform if the Vertical Bridging Check did not result in filling `W`)
        i.  Check the column `c_left = c1 - 1`. If `c_left` is within bounds, check if the segment `input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c_left]` is monochromatic (all color `C_L`) and non-white (`C_L != 0`).
        ii. Check the column `c_right = c2 + 1`. If `c_right` is within bounds, check if the segment `input_grid[r1 : r2 + 1, c_right]` is monochromatic (all color `C_R`) and non-white (`C_R != 0`).
        iii. If both adjacent left and right segments exist, are monochromatic non-white, and have the *same* color (`C_L == C_R`), then fill the area corresponding to `W` in the `output_grid` with color `C_L`. Mark `W` as processed and continue to the next white rectangle.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.
