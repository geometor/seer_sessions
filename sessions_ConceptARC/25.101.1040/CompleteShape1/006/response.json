            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code and natural language program implement a transformation rule based on filling specific white rectangles. The core logic involves:\n1.  Identifying maximal white rectangles.\n2.  Applying a size constraint (height <= 2 or width <= 2) to filter candidate rectangles.\n3.  Checking for a \"Vertical Bridge Below\" pattern (aligned monochromatic shape below, separated by only white pixels).\n4.  If the vertical check fails, checking for a \"Horizontal Extension Left\" pattern (adjacent monochromatic shape to the left).\n5.  If both above fail, checking for a \"Horizontal Extension Right\" pattern (adjacent monochromatic shape to the right).\n\nThe execution results show that this logic correctly solved Example 2 but failed Example 1. The failure in Example 1 involved incorrectly filling a large central white area that should have been skipped by the size constraint. Example 2 was solved correctly because the target rectangle met the size constraint and was filled by the \"Horizontal Extension Left\" rule, while the large central white area was correctly skipped by the size constraint.\n\nThe discrepancy in Example 1 suggests a potential issue in the previous execution or analysis, perhaps related to the implementation of `find_maximal_white_rectangles` or the application of the size constraint in that specific run. However, the refined logic as described *should* handle both cases correctly.\n\n**Strategy:** Maintain the current logic (size constraint, prioritized fill rules) as it successfully explains Example 2 and, theoretically, should work for Example 1. Refine the natural language program for maximum clarity based on this logic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the *intended* logic of the provided Python code (including the size constraint), the expected outcomes are:\n\n*code_execution:*\n"

Find all maximal contiguous rectangular areas `W` composed entirely of white pixels (color 0) in the `input_grid`. For each `W`, determine its top-left (`r1`, `c1`) and bottom-right (`r2`, `c2`) coordinates, height (`H = r2 - r1 + 1`), and width (`W = c2 - c1 + 1`).\n3.

If it does not satisfy this condition, skip this rectangle and proceed to the next one.\n5.  **Vertical Bridge Below Check:**\n    a.  Search downwards from the row immediately below `W` (`r2 + 1`) to the bottom of the grid, looking only within the columns of `W` (`c1` to `c2`).
