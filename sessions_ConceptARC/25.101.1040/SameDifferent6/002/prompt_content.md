Transformation rule:
Identify distinct objects composed of non-background pixels (color > 0).
For each object, determine all colors involved: the colors of the object's pixels and any background (0) pixels that are fully enclosed within the object's structure (i.e., cannot reach the grid border via other background pixels).
If an object, including its enclosed background pixels, consists of exactly two distinct colors, identify the 'frame' color (the one touching the external background) and the 'internal' color (the one not touching the external background, or the background color 0 if it's enclosed).
Check if the (internal_color, frame_color) pair matches specific removal criteria: (Blue(1), Red(2)), (Orange(7), Green(3)), or (White(0), Yellow(4)).
If a match is found, remove the object by replacing all of its original non-background pixels with the background color (0). Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
