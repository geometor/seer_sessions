            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grid uses white (0) as the background color.\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of non-white pixels. These objects are separated by the white background.\n3.  **Object Structure:** The objects in the examples often exhibit a structure with an outer \"frame\" color and one or more \"internal\" colors.\n    *   In `train_1`, objects are 3x3 squares with a frame color (Red, Yellow, or Azure) and a single internal center pixel (Blue).\n    *   In `train_2`, some objects are 3x3 squares with a frame (Magenta or Gray) and a center pixel (Orange). Others are rectangles (Green frame) with a more complex internal shape (Orange).\n    *   In `train_3`, objects have a frame color (Yellow, Blue, or Orange) and internal pixels of the background color (White).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively removing *entire* objects from the input grid. Removed objects are replaced with the background color (white).\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The key is to determine *which* objects are removed. Observing the examples, the removal seems dependent on the specific combination of the object's frame color and its internal color(s).\n    *   `train_1`: Objects with a Red frame and Blue center are removed. Objects with Yellow/Azure frames and Blue centers are kept.\n    *   `train_2`: Objects with a Green frame and Orange internal pixels are removed. Objects with Magenta/Gray frames and Orange centers are kept.\n    *   `train_3`: Objects with a Yellow frame and White internal pixels are removed. Objects with Blue/Orange frames and White internal pixels are kept.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
