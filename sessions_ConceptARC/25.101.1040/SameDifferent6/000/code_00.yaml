task_description: Identify specific types of two-colored objects and remove them, keeping all other objects.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 # white
  object: A contiguous group of non-background pixels.

rules:
  - description: Iterate through each distinct object in the input grid.
  - conditions:
      - object_must_have_two_colors: True
      - define_frame_color: The color forming the outer boundary of the object.
      - define_internal_color: The color(s) enclosed by the frame color.
  - removal_criteria:
      - description: Remove the object if its (Internal Color, Frame Color) pair matches a specific set.
      - pairs_to_remove:
          - internal: 1 # blue
            frame: 2 # red
          - internal: 7 # orange
            frame: 3 # green
          - internal: 0 # white
            frame: 4 # yellow
  - action:
      - if: removal_criteria met
        then: Replace all pixels of the object with the background_color.
      - else: Keep the object unchanged.

output_grid: The modified input grid after applying the removal action based on the criteria.

examples:
  train_1:
    objects:
      - { frame: 2, internal: 1, action: remove }
      - { frame: 2, internal: 1, action: remove }
      - { frame: 4, internal: 1, action: keep }
      - { frame: 8, internal: 1, action: keep }
  train_2:
    objects:
      - { frame: 6, internal: 7, action: keep }
      - { frame: 3, internal: 7, action: remove }
      - { frame: 5, internal: 7, action: keep }
      - { frame: 3, internal: 7, action: remove }
  train_3:
    objects:
      - { frame: 4, internal: 0, action: remove }
      - { frame: 1, internal: 0, action: keep }
      - { frame: 7, internal: 0, action: keep }
