            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: remove specific two-color objects based on their frame and internal colors, including handling enclosed background pixels. The rule works for `train_1` and `train_3`.\n\nThe failure on `train_2` stemmed from an implementation issue rather than a flawed understanding of the pattern. The code correctly identified the top-right Green(3)/Orange(7) object and determined it met the removal criteria (Internal=7, Frame=3). However, it failed to execute the removal step for this object, while correctly ignoring the other objects (Magenta/Orange kept, merged Gray/Green/Orange kept due to having 3 colors).\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the existing natural language program and YAML facts, as they accurately describe the transformation observed across all examples. The focus for the coder phase will be to debug the implementation, specifically the part where identified objects are removed from the `output_grid`, ensuring it correctly modifies the grid when `should_remove` is true.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the `code_execution` analysis performed previously:\n\n**`train_1`:**\n- Objects found: 4 (Red/Blue, Red/Blue, Yellow/Blue, Azure/Blue)\n- Object Analysis:\n    - Red/Blue (x2): 2 colors {1, 2}. Frame=2, Internal=1. Pair (1, 2) matches removal criteria. -> Removed (Correct).\n    - Yellow/Blue: 2 colors {1, 4}. Frame=4, Internal=1. Pair (1, 4) does not match. -> Kept (Correct).\n    - Azure/Blue: 2 colors {1, 8}. Frame=8, Internal=1. Pair (1, 8) does not match. -> Kept (Correct).\n- Result: Match (Correct)\n\n**`train_2`:**\n- Objects found: 3\n    - Object 0 (Top-Right): Colors {3, 7}. Frame=3, Internal=7. Pair (7, 3) matches removal criteria. -> Should be Removed.\n    - Object 1 (Top-Left): Colors {6, 7}. Frame=6, Internal=7. Pair (7, 6) does not match. -> Should be Kept.\n    - Object 2 (Bottom Merged): Colors {3, 5, 7}. 3 colors. -> Should be Kept.\n- Code Output Analysis: Object 0 was *not* removed. Objects 1 and 2 were kept.\n- Result: Mismatch (Incorrect - Object 0 removal failed)\n\n**`train_3`:**\n- Objects found: 3 (Yellow/White, Blue/White, Orange/White)\n- Object Analysis:\n    - Yellow/White: 2 colors {0, 4}. Has enclosed background (0). Frame=4, Internal=0. Pair (0, 4) matches removal criteria. -> Removed (Correct).\n    - Blue/White: 2 colors {0, 1}. Has enclosed background (0). Frame=1, Internal=0. Pair (0, 1) does not match. -> Kept (Correct).\n    - Orange/White: 2 colors {0, 7}. Has enclosed background (0). Frame=7, Internal=0. Pair (0, 7) does not match. -> Kept (Correct).\n- Result: Match (Correct)\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation logic holds. The implementation failed specifically during the removal action for the relevant object in `train_2`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the set of all background pixel coordinates (`background_color` = 0) that are connected to the grid border using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood-fill algorithm starting from all border background pixels. Store these coordinates in a set called `border_background_coords`.\n3.  Find all distinct objects in the `input_grid`. An object is a connected component of non-background pixels (colors 1-9), using 4-way adjacency. For each object found, store the set of its pixel coordinates.\n4.  Iterate through the list of found objects (each represented by its set of coordinates `obj_coords`):\n    a.  Determine the set of unique non-background colors present in the object's pixels (`obj_colors_non_zero`).\n    b.  Check if the object is adjacent to any background pixels that are *not* in `border_background_coords`. Set a flag `has_enclosed_background` to true if such pixels exist.\n    c.  Create the full set of relevant colors for the object, `all_obj_colors`, by starting with `obj_colors_non_zero` and adding `background_color` (0) if `has_enclosed_background` is true.\n    d.  If the number of colors in `all_obj_colors` is exactly two:\n        i.  Let the two colors be `c1` and `c2`.\n        ii. Determine if any pixel of color `c1` within the object is adjacent to any coordinate in `border_background_coords` (set `c1_touches_external` flag).\n        iii. Determine if any pixel of color `c2` within the object is adjacent to any coordinate in `border_background_coords` (set `c2_touches_external` flag).\n        iv. Assign `internal_color` and `frame_color` based on the flags:\n            - If `c1_touches_external` is true and `c2_touches_external` is false: `frame_color = c1`, `internal_color = c2`.\n            - If `c2_touches_external` is true and `c1_touches_external` is false: `frame_color = c2`, `internal_color = c1`.\n            - If neither is true (object is \"floating\" or only touches enclosed background) AND one of the colors is background (0): `internal_color = 0`, `frame_color` = the other color.\n            - Otherwise (e.g., both touch external, or neither touches and neither is 0), set `internal_color` and `frame_color` to invalid values (e.g., -1) as the structure doesn't match.\n        v. Check if a valid `internal_color` and `frame_color` were assigned (i.e., not -1).\n        vi. If valid, check if the pair (`internal_color`, `frame_color`) exists in the predefined set of pairs to remove: `{(1, 2), (7, 3), (0, 4)}`.\n        vii. If the pair matches a removal criterion, set a flag `should_remove` to true for this object.\n    e.  If the `should_remove` flag is true for the current object:\n        i.  Iterate through all coordinates `(r_obj, c_obj)` in the object's stored `obj_coords`.\n        ii. For each coordinate, set `output_grid[r_obj][c_obj]` to `background_color` (0).\n5.  Return the final `output_grid`."
