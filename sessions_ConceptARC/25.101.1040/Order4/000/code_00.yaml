task_description: Apply a color transformation to vertical blocks based on their internal color composition.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Separator and grid base. Also acts as an 'impurity' color within blocks in some examples.
  - type: block
    description: Vertical rectangular regions containing non-background pixels, separated by background columns.
    properties:
      - composition: Contains primarily one 'MainColor' (not 0 or 5) and one 'ImpurityColor' (either 0 or 5).
      - location: Defined by a range of columns and rows containing non-background colors.
    input_state: Composed of MainColor and ImpurityColor pixels.
    output_state: Uniformly filled with a single 'OutputColor'. The region filled matches the row/column extent of the input block's non-background content.
  - type: color_transformation
    description: Rule to determine the OutputColor based on the input block's MainColor and ImpurityColor.
    rules:
      - condition: ImpurityColor is 5 (gray)
        mapping: {1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 3} # {Blue: Yellow, Red: Red, Green: Blue, Yellow: Green}
      - condition: ImpurityColor is 0 (white)
        mapping: {2: 7, 4: 6, 6: 2, 7: 4} # {Red: Orange, Yellow: Magenta, Magenta: Red, Orange: Yellow}
relationships:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each block.
  - The output color of a block depends uniquely on the pair of (MainColor, ImpurityColor) found within the input block.
  - The spatial extent (columns and rows) of the output block matches the spatial extent of the non-background pixels in the input block.
