Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids consist of a background (white, 0) and several distinct colored regions or "blocks".
2.  **Blocks:** The colored regions appear as vertical blocks separated by columns of the background color. The width and height of these blocks can vary.
3.  **Input Block Composition:** Each block in the input grid seems to be composed primarily of one main color, but also contains pixels of an "impurity" color. In `train_1`, the impurity color is gray (5). In `train_2`, the impurity color is the background white (0), appearing *within* the block area.
4.  **Output Block Composition:** Each corresponding block in the output grid is filled *uniformly* with a single color. The shape and position (columns occupied, row range) of the output block match the extent of the non-background content of the input block.
5.  **Color Transformation:** The uniform color used to fill the output block is determined by the combination of the main color and the impurity color present in the corresponding input block. There seem to be two distinct sets of color transformation rules: one applied when the impurity is gray (5), and another when the impurity is white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a color transformation to vertical blocks based on their internal color composition.
elements:
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: Separator and grid base. Also acts as an 'impurity' color within blocks in some examples.
  - type: block
    description: Vertical rectangular regions containing non-background pixels, separated by background columns.
    properties:
      - composition: Contains primarily one 'MainColor' (not 0 or 5) and one 'ImpurityColor' (either 0 or 5).
      - location: Defined by a range of columns and rows containing non-background colors.
    input_state: Composed of MainColor and ImpurityColor pixels.
    output_state: Uniformly filled with a single 'OutputColor'. The region filled matches the row/column extent of the input block's non-background content.
  - type: color_transformation
    description: Rule to determine the OutputColor based on the input block's MainColor and ImpurityColor.
    rules:
      - condition: ImpurityColor is 5 (gray)
        mapping: {1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 3} # {Blue: Yellow, Red: Red, Green: Blue, Yellow: Green}
      - condition: ImpurityColor is 0 (white)
        mapping: {2: 7, 4: 6, 6: 2, 7: 4} # {Red: Orange, Yellow: Magenta, Magenta: Red, Orange: Yellow}
relationships:
  - The transformation is applied independently to each block.
  - The output color of a block depends uniquely on the pair of (MainColor, ImpurityColor) found within the input block.
  - The spatial extent (columns and rows) of the output block matches the spatial extent of the non-background pixels in the input block.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid's background (or simply an all-white grid of the same dimensions).
2.  Identify all columns in the input grid that contain at least one non-background (non-0) pixel.
3.  Group consecutive columns identified in step 2 to define the column ranges of the vertical blocks. Blocks are separated by columns containing only background pixels.
4.  For each identified block (defined by a column range):
    a.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_row`, `max_row`) that contain non-background pixels within the block's columns.
    b.  Extract all pixel values from the input grid within this block's column range and row range (`min_row` to `max_row`).
    c.  Find the set of unique non-background colors present in the extracted pixels.
    d.  Identify the `MainColor`: the color in the set that is neither 0 nor 5.
    e.  Identify the `ImpurityColor`: check if 5 (gray) is present in the set; if not, check if 0 (white) is present within the extracted block pixels. Assign 5 or 0 accordingly.
    f.  Select the appropriate color transformation map based on the `ImpurityColor`.
    g.  Look up the `MainColor` in the selected map to find the `OutputColor`.
    h.  Fill the rectangular region in the output grid defined by the block's columns and rows `min_row` to `max_row` (inclusive) with the determined `OutputColor`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
