The width and height of these blocks can vary.\n3.  **Input Block Composition:** Each block in the input grid seems to be composed primarily of one main color, but also contains pixels of an \"impurity\" color. In `train_1`, the impurity color is gray (5). In `train_2`, the impurity color is the background white (0), appearing *within* the block area.\n4.  **Output Block Composition:** Each corresponding block in the output grid is filled *uniformly* with a single color. The shape and position (columns occupied, row range) of the output block match the extent of the non-background content of the input block.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The uniform color used to fill the output block is determined by the combination of the main color and the impurity color present in the corresponding input block. There seem to be two distinct sets of color transformation rules: one applied when the impurity is gray (5), and another when the impurity is white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
