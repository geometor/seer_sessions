objects:
  - id: grid
    description: The 2D array of pixels (cells) with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - id: background_pixel
    description: A pixel with the background color (white, 0).
  - id: shape_pixel
    description: A pixel with a non-background color.
  - id: largest_shape
    description: >
      The largest connected component (using 4-way adjacency)
      of contiguous non-background pixels. Assumed to be unique
      in terms of pixel count.
    properties:
      color: C (The single color value of the pixels in this shape; 1, 6, 3 in examples)
      mask: A boolean grid indicating the location of this shape's pixels.
  - id: potential_hole_region
    description: >
      A contiguous region of background pixels identified by applying a
      standard 'fill holes' operation (like `scipy.ndimage.binary_fill_holes`
      with 4-way structure) to the mask of the `largest_shape`.
    properties:
      size: The number of pixels in the region.
      pixels: The set of coordinates belonging to this region.
      connectivity: Defined by 4-way adjacency between background pixels within the region.
  - id: small_hole_region
    description: A `potential_hole_region` whose size is less than or equal to 2 pixels.
actions:
  - id: find_largest_shape
    description: Identify the largest 4-connected component of non-background pixels and determine its color C and mask M.
  - id: find_potential_holes
    description: Apply `binary_fill_holes` to mask M to get Filled_M. Identify pixels P where Filled_M is true and M is false.
  - id: segment_potential_holes
    description: Find the 4-connected components within the set of pixels P.
  - id: filter_small_holes
    description: Select only those hole components whose size (pixel count) is 1 or 2.
  - id: fill_small_holes
    description: Create an output grid by copying the input. Change the color of pixels belonging to the selected `small_hole_region`s to the color C of the `largest_shape`.
relationships:

    subject: potential_hole_region
    object: largest_shape
    description: Potential hole regions are spatially enclosed by the largest shape according to the `binary_fill_holes` definition.
  - type: size_threshold
    subject: small_hole_region
    value: 2
    description: A small hole region has a pixel count less than or equal to 2.
