objects:
  - id: background_pixel
    description: A pixel/cell with the background color (white, 0).
    properties:
      color: 0
      connectivity: Can be connected to other background pixels via 4-way adjacency (sharing an edge).
  - id: shape_pixel
    description: A pixel/cell with the dominant non-background color C.
    properties:
      color: C (varies: 1, 6, 3)
  - id: shape
    description: The largest contiguous object (using 4-way adjacency) of shape_pixels. Assumed unique largest.
  - id: grid_border
    description: The set of pixels forming the outer edge of the grid (row 0, last row, col 0, last col).
  - id: external_background
    description: The set of background_pixels that have a 4-connected path consisting only of background_pixels leading to a background_pixel on the grid_border.
  - id: internal_hole_pixel
    description: A background_pixel that is NOT part of the external_background. Hypothesis: These are the pixels to be filled.
actions:
  - id: identify_shape_color
    description: Find the color C of the largest 4-connected component of non-background pixels.
  - id: identify_external_background
    description: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all background_pixels on the grid_border, exploring via 4-way adjacent background_pixels, to find all reachable background_pixels. Mark these pixels.
  - id: identify_holes
    description: Identify all background_pixels that were not marked during the BFS.
  - id: fill_holes
    description: Create an output grid by copying the input grid. Change the color of all identified internal_hole_pixels in the output grid to the shape_color C.

  - type: connectivity
    subject: background_pixel
    object: background_pixel
    description: Two background pixels are connected if adjacent orthogonally (4-way). Used for BFS.
  - type: connectivity
    subject: shape_pixel
    object: shape_pixel
    description: Two shape pixels are connected if adjacent orthogonally (4-way). Used for finding the largest shape.
  - type: reachability
    subject: internal_hole_pixel
    object: grid_border
    description: An internal_hole_pixel (by definition) cannot reach the grid_border via a 4-connected path of only background_pixels.
