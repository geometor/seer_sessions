objects:
  - id: background_pixel
    description: A pixel/cell with the background color (white, 0).
    properties:
      color: 0
  - id: shape_pixel
    description: A pixel/cell with the shape color (the single non-background color C in the input).
    properties:
      color: C (varies per task: 1, 6, 3)
  - id: grid
    description: The 2D array of pixels.
actions:
  - id: identify_shape_color
    description: Determine the unique non-background color C present in the input grid.
  - id: check_neighbours
    description: For a given background pixel, count its orthogonal neighbours (up, down, left, right) that are shape pixels (color C).
  - id: update_pixel_color
    description: Change the color of a background pixel to the shape color C if its neighbour check meets a condition.
relationships:
  - type: orthogonal_adjacency
    subject: background_pixel
    object: shape_pixel
    description: A background pixel can be adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to one or more shape pixels.
condition:
  - id: color_change_rule
    description: A background_pixel's color is changed to the shape_color if the count of its orthogonally adjacent shape_pixels is 1 or greater.
