The main shape is defined as the largest contiguous block of a single non-white color. The \"holes\" are areas of the background color (white) that are completely enclosed by the main shape's color. The overall structure and the color of the main shape are preserved, except for the filling of these internal voids.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
