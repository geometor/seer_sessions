task_type: object_extraction_by_color_and_position
input_grid_properties:
  - contains_multiple_objects: true
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_colors_present: vary per example (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange, maroon observed)
output_grid_properties:
  - size: 3x3
  - content: derived_from_single_input_object
transformation_logic:
  - step: identify_candidate_objects
    criteria:
      - property: color
      - rule: color is one of [red (2), orange (7), gray (5)]
  - step: select_target_object
    target: candidate_objects
    selection_rule: choose the candidate object with the maximum minimum row index (the object starting lowest down in the grid).
    assumption: there will be a unique lowest candidate object.
  - step: determine_bounding_box
    target: selected_target_object
  - step: extract_subgrid
    source: bounding_box_of_target_object
    subgrid_definition: top_left_3x3_area
  - step: handle_incomplete_fill
    rule: if a cell within the 3x3 subgrid relative to the target object's bounding box top-left does not correspond to a pixel of the target object (e.g., outside the object's actual pixels but inside its bounding box, or outside input grid bounds), the output cell value is white (0).
