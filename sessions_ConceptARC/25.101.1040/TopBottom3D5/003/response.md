"""
Identifies all distinct connected objects in the input grid that have one of the 
candidate colors: red (2), orange (7), or gray (5). Among these candidates, 
selects the one whose bounding box starts at the lowest row index (maximum minimum row). 
Determines the top-left 3x3 area relative to the selected target object's bounding box. 
Creates a 3x3 output grid. For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding 
cell in the input grid (relative to the target bounding box's top-left) exists 
and belongs to the target object (has the target color), copy the target color. 
Otherwise, the output cell is white (0).
