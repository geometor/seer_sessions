In the first example, these are solid rectangles (red and blue). In the second example, they are patterns of individual pixels (green and yellow). The background is uniformly white (0).\n\nThe transformation involves moving these colored objects horizontally across the grid. The direction of movement appears to depend on the color of the object. Objects move until they reach the corresponding edge (left or right) of the grid. Their vertical position and internal structure (shape or relative pixel arrangement) are preserved.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Red (2) objects move left.\n- Blue (1) objects move right.\n- Green (3) objects move left.\n- Yellow (4) objects move right.\n\nThe background remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same color) in the input grid, excluding the background color. For each object, record its color and the coordinates of all its pixels.\n3.  For each identified object:\n    a.  Determine its horizontal movement direction based on its color:\n        *   If the color is Red (2) or Green (3), the direction is 'left'.\n        *   If the color is Blue (1) or Yellow (4), the direction is 'right'.\n    b.  Calculate the target horizontal position:\n        *   If the direction is 'left', determine the minimum column index occupied by the object's pixels. Calculate the horizontal shift required to move this minimum column index to 0.\n        *   If the direction is 'right', determine the maximum column index occupied by the object's pixels. Calculate the horizontal shift required to move this maximum column index to the last column index of the grid.\n    c.  Calculate the new coordinates for each pixel of the object by applying the calculated horizontal shift. The vertical coordinates remain unchanged.\n    d.  Place the object (using its original color) onto the output grid at its new coordinates.\n4.  Return the final output grid."
