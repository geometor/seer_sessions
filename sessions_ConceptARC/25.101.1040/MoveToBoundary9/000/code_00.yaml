task_context:
  grid_size: Variable dimensions for both input and output.
  background_color: White (0).
  num_examples: 2 provided for analysis.

objects:
  - type: contiguous_group
    color: Non-white (1-9)
    properties:
      - shape: Variable (rectangle in ex1, dispersed pixels in ex2)
      - color: Determines movement direction (Red/Green left, Blue/Yellow right)
      - position: Initial coordinates in the input grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects (with color, pixels, bounding_box)
    description: Find all contiguous groups of non-white pixels.
  - name: determine_movement_direction
    inputs: object_color
    outputs: direction (left or right)
    rules:
      - if color is Red (2) or Green (3), direction is left.
      - if color is Blue (1) or Yellow (4), direction is right.
  - name: translate_object_horizontally
    inputs: object, direction, grid_width
    outputs: new_object_position
    description: |
      Move the object horizontally in the specified direction until any part
      of the object reaches the corresponding grid boundary (column 0 for left,
      last column for right). The vertical position remains unchanged.
  - name: reconstruct_output_grid
    inputs: list_of_translated_objects, grid_dimensions, background_color
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the original dimensions, filled with the background color, and place the translated objects at their new positions.

relationships:
  - type: movement_constraint
    elements: [object, grid_boundary]
    description: Objects stop moving when they reach the edge of the grid corresponding to their movement direction.
  - type: color_direction_mapping
    elements: [object_color, movement_direction]
    description: The color of an object dictates whether it moves left or right.
