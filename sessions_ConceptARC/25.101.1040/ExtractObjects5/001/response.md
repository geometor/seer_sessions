"""
The transformation identifies "key" objects in the input grid based on their bounding box dimensions. 
Specifically, it looks for a size 'N' such that objects with bounding boxes NxN and (N+1)x(N+1) both exist in the input.
It then selects all objects whose bounding box dimensions (height H, width W) satisfy H in {N, N+1} and W in {N, N+1}.
Next, it determines the smallest dimension 'S' (minimum of height or width) among all selected key objects.
Each selected key object is then transformed into a solid square of size SxS using the object's original color.
Finally, these SxS squares are arranged horizontally in the output grid, ordered from left to right based on the 
minimum column index (leftmost position) of their corresponding original key objects in the input grid.
