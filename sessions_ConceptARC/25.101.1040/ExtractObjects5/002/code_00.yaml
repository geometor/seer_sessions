task_type: object_filtering_resizing_assembly

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - color: (1-9)
          - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
          - bounding_box: {min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col, height, width}

output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0) potentially, though none shown in examples
  - objects:
      - type: solid squares
      - properties:
          - color: derived from selected input objects
          - size: uniform within each example (S x S), determined from selected input objects
          - arrangement: horizontal sequence, no spacing

transformation_steps:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups in the input.
  - calculate_properties: Determine bounding box (height H, width W) and color for each object.
  - find_max_square_dim: Determine the maximum dimension `M` such that at least one object has an `MxM` bounding box. Handle the case where no square bounding boxes exist (though not seen in examples).
  - filter_key_objects: Select objects where `H >= M-1` and `W >= M-1`. If M=1 (only 1x1 squares), the filter is H>=0 and W>=0, selecting all objects; this edge case might need refinement if encountered. If no MxM BB exists, this rule needs a fallback (perhaps select all objects?). Based on examples, M >= 3.
  - determine_output_size_S: Find the minimum dimension value among all selected key objects (i.e., `min(min(obj['height'], obj['width']) for obj in key_objects)`). Let this be `S`.
  - create_output_squares: For each selected key object, generate a solid `S x S` square using the object's color.
  - sort_squares: Order the generated `S x S` squares based on the minimum column index (`min_col`) of the corresponding key objects in the input grid (left-to-right).
  - assemble_output: Arrange the sorted `S x S` squares horizontally adjacent to each other in a new grid of height `S`.

relationships:
  - input_object_color -> output_square_color
  - min(min(H,W) for key_obj) -> output_square_size (S)
  - max(H for obj if H==W) -> determines filtering threshold (M)
  - min_col(key_object_bbox) -> horizontal_order(output_squares)

uncertainties:
  - Behavior if no objects have square bounding boxes (M cannot be determined).
  - Behavior if M=1 (filter threshold becomes 0).
  - Behavior if no objects meet the filtering criteria `H >= M-1` and `W >= M-1`.
