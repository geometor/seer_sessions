Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Analysis**: The input grids contain various colored objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) scattered on a white background. These objects include solid squares, hollow squares, L-shapes, cross shapes, and other irregular shapes of different colors and sizes.
2.  **Output Analysis**: The output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs. They consist of solid-colored squares arranged horizontally side-by-side. The size of these squares is consistent within each output grid (4x4 in the first example, 3x3 in the second), but differs between examples. The colors of the output squares correspond to the colors of specific objects selected from the input grid.
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying specific "key" objects in the input, determining a standard square size based on these objects, converting each key object into a solid square of that standard size using its original color, and arranging these squares horizontally based on their original left-to-right position in the input.
4.  **Object Selection**: The criteria for selecting the "key" objects seem to be the most complex part.
    *   In Example 1, the selected objects (Red hollow square, Yellow cross, Gray L-shape) have bounding boxes of size 5x5 or 4x4.
    *   In Example 2, the selected objects are mostly solid squares (Azure 3x3, Green 4x4, Green 3x3, Orange 3x3) plus one specific non-square Blue shape (3x4 bounding box).
5.  **Output Size Determination**: The size of the output squares (S x S) appears to be determined by the minimum dimension (height or width) found among the bounding boxes of the selected key objects in the input.
    *   Example 1: Key objects have bounding boxes 5x5, 4x4, 4x4. Minimum dimension is 4. Output squares are 4x4.
    *   Example 2: Key objects have bounding boxes 3x3, 4x4, 3x3, 3x4, 3x3. Minimum dimension is 3. Output squares are 3x3.
6.  **Ordering**: The output squares are arranged horizontally based on the minimum column index (leftmost position) of their corresponding key objects in the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_and_assembly

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - color: (1-9)
          - shape: variable (square, hollow square, L-shape, cross, irregular)
          - size: variable
          - bounding_box: {min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col, height, width}
          - position: defined by bounding_box

output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: solid squares
      - properties:
          - color: derived from selected input objects
          - size: uniform within each example (S x S), determined from input objects
          - arrangement: horizontal sequence

transformation_steps:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups in the input.
  - calculate_properties: Determine bounding box, color, dimensions for each object.
  - filter_objects: Select a subset of "key" objects based on specific criteria (e.g., bounding box dimensions like NxN or (N+1)x(N+1), shape properties like solid square, or specific shape patterns). This criteria seems task-dependent based on the examples.
  - determine_output_size: Find the minimum dimension (min(height, width)) across the bounding boxes of all selected key objects. Let this be S.
  - create_output_squares: For each selected key object, generate a solid S x S square using the object's color.
  - sort_squares: Order the generated S x S squares based on the minimum column index of the corresponding key objects in the input grid.
  - assemble_output: Arrange the sorted S x S squares horizontally in a new grid.

relationships:
  - input_object_color -> output_square_color
  - min_dimension(input_key_object_bounding_boxes) -> output_square_size
  - min_col(input_key_object_bounding_box) -> horizontal_order(output_squares)

uncertainties:
  - The precise criteria for filtering/selecting the "key" objects in the `filter_objects` step needs to be generalized or parameterized based on the input characteristics. The current examples suggest different criteria (BB size 4x4/5x5 in Ex1; Solid Squares >=3x3 + specific 3x4 shape in Ex2).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels.
2.  For each object found, determine its color and calculate its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column).
3.  Filter these objects to select the "key" objects relevant to the transformation. (The specific filtering rule needs to be determined, possibly based on bounding box dimensions relative to each other, e.g., NxN and (N+1)x(N+1), or based on shape properties like being a solid square above a certain size, potentially including specific exceptional shapes).
4.  Examine the bounding box dimensions (height and width) of all selected key objects. Find the smallest dimension (minimum of all heights and widths) among them. Let this minimum dimension be `S`.
5.  Create a list of new objects, where each new object is a solid square of size `S`x`S`, having the same color as one of the selected key objects. There will be one `S`x`S` square for each key object.
6.  Sort this list of `S`x`S` squares based on the horizontal position (minimum column index of the bounding box) of their corresponding original key objects in the input grid, from left to right.
7.  Construct the final output grid by arranging the sorted `S`x`S` squares horizontally next
 to each other, separated by no space. The height of the output grid will be `S`, and the width will be `S` times the number of key objects found.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
The transformation identifies "key" objects in the input grid based on their bounding box dimensions. 
Specifically, it looks for a size 'N' such that objects with bounding boxes NxN and (N+1)x(N+1) both exist in the input.
It then selects all objects whose bounding box dimensions (height H, width W) satisfy H in {N, N+1} and W in {N, N+1}.
Next, it determines the smallest dimension 'S' (minimum of height or width) among all selected key objects.
Each selected key object is then transformed into a solid square of size SxS using the object's original color.
Finally, these SxS squares are arranged horizontally in the output grid, ordered from left to right based on the 
minimum column index (leftmost position) of their corresponding original key objects in the input grid.
