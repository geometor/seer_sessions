Find all contiguous non-white objects and their bounding boxes (height H, width W).\n2. Determine the maximum dimension 'M' such that at least one object has an MxM bounding box. If no square bounding boxes exist, M is treated as 0.\n3. Filter the objects, selecting only those \"key\" objects where both H >= M-1 and W >= M-1.\n4. If no key objects are selected, return an empty grid.\n5. Determine the output square size 'S' by finding the minimum dimension (minimum of H or W) across all selected key objects.\n6. For each selected key object, create a solid square of size SxS using the object's color.\n7. Sort these SxS squares based on the horizontal position (minimum column index) of their corresponding original key objects in the input grid, from left to right.\n8. Assemble the final output grid by arranging the sorted SxS squares horizontally next to each other.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray) -> list[dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background color (0) in the grid.\n    \n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n        \n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n        and contains its color, pixels (list of (r, c) tuples), and\n        bounding box information (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col, height, width).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                height = max_r - min_r + 1\n                width = max_c - min_c + 1\n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'min_row': min_r, 'max_row': max_r,\n                    'min_col': min_c, 'max_col': max_c,\n                    'height': height, 'width': width\n                })\n    return objects\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified object filtering,\n    resizing, and assembly rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
