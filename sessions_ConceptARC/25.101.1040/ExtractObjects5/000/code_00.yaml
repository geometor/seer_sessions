task_type: object_transformation_and_assembly

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - color: (1-9)
          - shape: variable (square, hollow square, L-shape, cross, irregular)
          - size: variable
          - bounding_box: {min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col, height, width}
          - position: defined by bounding_box

output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: solid squares
      - properties:
          - color: derived from selected input objects
          - size: uniform within each example (S x S), determined from input objects
          - arrangement: horizontal sequence

transformation_steps:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups in the input.
  - calculate_properties: Determine bounding box, color, dimensions for each object.
  - filter_objects: Select a subset of "key" objects based on specific criteria (e.g., bounding box dimensions like NxN or (N+1)x(N+1), shape properties like solid square, or specific shape patterns). This criteria seems task-dependent based on the examples.
  - determine_output_size: Find the minimum dimension (min(height, width)) across the bounding boxes of all selected key objects. Let this be S.
  - create_output_squares: For each selected key object, generate a solid S x S square using the object's color.
  - sort_squares: Order the generated S x S squares based on the minimum column index of the corresponding key objects in the input grid.
  - assemble_output: Arrange the sorted S x S squares horizontally in a new grid.

relationships:
  - input_object_color -> output_square_color
  - min_dimension(input_key_object_bounding_boxes) -> output_square_size
  - min_col(input_key_object_bounding_box) -> horizontal_order(output_squares)

uncertainties:
  - The precise criteria for filtering/selecting the "key" objects in the `filter_objects` step needs to be generalized or parameterized based on the input characteristics. The current examples suggest different criteria (BB size 4x4/5x5 in Ex1; Solid Squares >=3x3 + specific 3x4 shape in Ex2).
