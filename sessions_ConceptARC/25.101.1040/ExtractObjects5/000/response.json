            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Analysis**: The input grids contain various colored objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) scattered on a white background. These objects include solid squares, hollow squares, L-shapes, cross shapes, and other irregular shapes of different colors and sizes.\n2.  **Output Analysis**: The output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs. They consist of solid-colored squares arranged horizontally side-by-side. The size of these squares is consistent within each output grid (4x4 in the first example, 3x3 in the second), but differs between examples. The colors of the output squares correspond to the colors of specific objects selected from the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying specific \"key\" objects in the input, determining a standard square size based on these objects, converting each key object into a solid square of that standard size using its original color, and arranging these squares horizontally based on their original left-to-right position in the input.\n4.  **Object Selection**: The criteria for selecting the \"key\" objects seem to be the most complex part.\n    *   In Example 1, the selected objects (Red hollow square, Yellow cross, Gray L-shape) have bounding boxes of size 5x5 or 4x4.\n    *   In Example 2, the selected objects are mostly solid squares (Azure 3x3, Green 4x4, Green 3x3, Orange 3x3) plus one specific non-square Blue shape (3x4 bounding box).\n5.  **Output Size Determination**: The size of the output squares (S x S) appears to be determined by the minimum dimension (height or width) found among the bounding boxes of the selected key objects in the input.\n    *   Example 1: Key objects have bounding boxes 5x5, 4x4, 4x4. Minimum dimension is 4. Output squares are 4x4.\n    *   Example 2: Key objects have bounding boxes 3x3, 4x4, 3x3, 3x4, 3x3. Minimum dimension is 3. Output squares are 3x3.\n6.  **Ordering**: The output squares are arranged horizontally based on the minimum column index (leftmost position) of their corresponding key objects in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

(The specific filtering rule needs to be determined, possibly based on bounding box dimensions relative to each other, e.g., NxN and (N+1)x(N+1), or based on shape properties like being a solid square above a certain size, potentially including specific exceptional shapes).\n4.  Examine the bounding box dimensions (height and width) of all selected key objects. Find the smallest dimension (minimum of all heights and widths) among them. Let this minimum dimension be `S`.\n5.
