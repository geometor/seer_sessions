            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code successfully processed `train_2` but failed `train_1`. The failure analysis revealed that the transformation rule was incorrectly assumed to *always* produce solid squares. `train_1` clearly requires preserving the internal structure of the source objects, while `train_2` requires generating solid squares, even when the source object's bounding box is larger than the target size `S x S`.\n\nThe key insight is that the transformation method depends on whether the original object's bounding box dimensions (`H`, `W`) exactly match the calculated target size `S`.\n- If `H == S` and `W == S`, the `S x S` pattern is extracted directly from the input.\n- If `H > S` or `W > S`, a solid `S x S` square of the object's color is generated instead.\n\nThis refined logic consistently explains both training examples. The strategy is to update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this conditional transformation and implement it in the next coding phase.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the refined logic:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Objects (Partial List): Red (H=4, W=4, min_col=1), Yellow (H=4, W=4, min_col=5), Gray (H=4, W=4, min_col=13). Many other smaller objects exist.\n    *   Max Square BB Dimension (`M`): 4 (from Red, Yellow, Gray).\n    *   Filter Threshold (`M-1`): 3.\n    *   Key Objects (H>=3, W>=3): Red(4,4), Yellow(4,4), Gray(4,4).\n    *   Output Size (`S`): `min(min(4,4))` = 4.\n    *   Transformation Mode: All key objects have H=4, W=4, which equals S. Therefore, use 'extract pattern' mode for all.\n    *   Sorting Order: Red (col 1), Yellow (col 5), Gray (col 13).\n    *   Result: Assembling the extracted 4x4 patterns matches the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Objects (Partial List): Azure (H=3, W=3, min_col=1), Green (H=3, W=4, min_col=5), Green (H=3, W=3, min_col=9), Blue (H=3, W=4, min_col=12), Orange (H=3, W=3, min_col=18). Many other smaller objects exist.\n    *   Max Square BB Dimension (`M`): 3 (from Azure, Green, Orange).\n    *   Filter Threshold (`M-1`): 2.\n    *   Key Objects (H>=2, W>=2): Azure(3,3), Green(3,4), Green(3,3), Blue(3,4), Orange(3,3).\n    *   Output Size (`S`): `min(min(3,3), min(3,4))` = 3.\n    *   Transformation Mode:\n        *   Azure(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.\n        *   Green(3,4): H=3, W=4. `W > S`. Use 'solid square'.\n        *   Green(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.\n        *   Blue(3,4): H=3, W=4. `W > S`. Use 'solid square'.\n        *   Orange(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.\n    *   Sorting Order: Azure (col 1), Green(3x4) (col 5), Green(3x3) (col 9), Blue(3x4) (col 12), Orange (col 18).\n    *   Result: Assembling the resulting 3x3 grids (mix of patterns and solid squares) matches the expected output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If key objects exist, determine the target size `S` by finding the minimum dimension value among all key objects (calculate `min(H, W)` for each key object and find the minimum of these values).\n6.  Sort the selected key objects based on their `min_col` value, from left to right.\n7.  Create a list of `S x S` output segments, one for each sorted key object:\n    *   If the key object's dimensions `H` and `W` are both exactly equal to `S` (`H == S` and `W == S`), then extract the `S x S` pixel pattern directly from the input grid at the object's bounding box location.
