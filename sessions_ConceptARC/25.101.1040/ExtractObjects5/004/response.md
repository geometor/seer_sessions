**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully processed `train_2` but failed `train_1`. The failure analysis revealed that the transformation rule was incorrectly assumed to *always* produce solid squares. `train_1` clearly requires preserving the internal structure of the source objects, while `train_2` requires generating solid squares, even when the source object's bounding box is larger than the target size `S x S`.

The key insight is that the transformation method depends on whether the original object's bounding box dimensions (`H`, `W`) exactly match the calculated target size `S`.
- If `H == S` and `W == S`, the `S x S` pattern is extracted directly from the input.
- If `H > S` or `W > S`, a solid `S x S` square of the object's color is generated instead.

This refined logic consistently explains both training examples. The strategy is to update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this conditional transformation and implement it in the next coding phase.

**Metrics**

Based on the refined logic:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Objects (Partial List): Red (H=4, W=4, min_col=1), Yellow (H=4, W=4, min_col=5), Gray (H=4, W=4, min_col=13). Many other smaller objects exist.
    *   Max Square BB Dimension (`M`): 4 (from Red, Yellow, Gray).
    *   Filter Threshold (`M-1`): 3.
    *   Key Objects (H>=3, W>=3): Red(4,4), Yellow(4,4), Gray(4,4).
    *   Output Size (`S`): `min(min(4,4))` = 4.
    *   Transformation Mode: All key objects have H=4, W=4, which equals S. Therefore, use 'extract pattern' mode for all.
    *   Sorting Order: Red (col 1), Yellow (col 5), Gray (col 13).
    *   Result: Assembling the extracted 4x4 patterns matches the expected output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Objects (Partial List): Azure (H=3, W=3, min_col=1), Green (H=3, W=4, min_col=5), Green (H=3, W=3, min_col=9), Blue (H=3, W=4, min_col=12), Orange (H=3, W=3, min_col=18). Many other smaller objects exist.
    *   Max Square BB Dimension (`M`): 3 (from Azure, Green, Orange).
    *   Filter Threshold (`M-1`): 2.
    *   Key Objects (H>=2, W>=2): Azure(3,3), Green(3,4), Green(3,3), Blue(3,4), Orange(3,3).
    *   Output Size (`S`): `min(min(3,3), min(3,4))` = 3.
    *   Transformation Mode:
        *   Azure(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.
        *   Green(3,4): H=3, W=4. `W > S`. Use 'solid square'.
        *   Green(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.
        *   Blue(3,4): H=3, W=4. `W > S`. Use 'solid square'.
        *   Orange(3,3): H=3, W=3. `H==S`, `W==S`. Use 'extract pattern'.
    *   Sorting Order: Azure (col 1), Green(3x4) (col 5), Green(3x3) (col 9), Blue(3x4) (col 12), Orange (col 18).
    *   Result: Assembling the resulting 3x3 grids (mix of patterns and solid squares) matches the expected output.

```yaml
task_type: object_filtering_conditional_resizing_assembly

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: contiguous blocks of non-white pixels
      - properties:
          - color: (1-9)
          - pixels: list of (row, col) tuples
          - bounding_box: {min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col, height, width}

derived_input_properties:
  - max_square_dim_M: The largest dimension M such that an object with an MxM bounding box exists. Defaults to 0 if none exist.
  - filter_threshold: M - 1

output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - objects:
      - type: square grids of size S x S
      - properties:
          - S: The minimum dimension (min(height, width)) across all selected key input objects.
          - content: Either the exact pixel pattern from the input object (if its BB was S x S) or a solid color fill (if its BB was larger than S x S in either dimension).
          - color: derived from selected input objects
          - arrangement: horizontal sequence, no spacing

transformation_steps:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups in the input grid.
  - calculate_properties: Determine bounding box (height H, width W, min_col) and color for each object.
  - find_max_square_dim_M: Determine M as defined above.
  - filter_key_objects: Select objects where H >= (M - 1) and W >= (M - 1).
  - check_key_objects_exist: If no key objects are selected, output an empty grid.
  - determine_output_size_S: Find S = min(min(obj['height'], obj['width']) for obj in key_objects). Handle potential errors if S<=0.
  - sort_key_objects: Order the key objects based on their minimum column index (`min_col`) ascending.
  - generate_output_segments: For each sorted key object:
      - Define segment_grid: an S x S numpy array, initialized to background color (0).
      - Get object properties: color, H, W, min_row, min_col.
      - Conditional transformation:
          - If H == S and W == S:
              - Extract the S x S subgrid from the input_grid corresponding to the object's bounding box.
              - Copy this subgrid into segment_grid.
          - Else (H > S or W > S):
              - Fill the segment_grid completely with the object's color.
      - Store the resulting segment_grid.
  - assemble_output: Horizontally stack (concatenate) the generated segment_grids in order.
  - convert_to_list: Convert the final numpy grid to a list of lists.

relationships:
  - max(H for obj if H==W) -> M (filtering parameter)
  - filter(objects where H>=M-1 and W>=M-1) -> key_objects
  - min(min(H,W) for key_obj) -> S (output segment size)
  - key_object H, W compared to S -> determines segment content (pattern vs solid)
  - key_object color -> segment color
  - key_object min_col -> horizontal_order(output_segments)

uncertainties_addressed:
  - The previous uncertainty about why Ex1 preserved structure and Ex2 used solid squares is resolved by the conditional transformation rule based on comparing object BB dimensions (H, W) to the target size S.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects of non-white color in the input grid. For each object, record its color, its bounding box (height `H`, width `W`), and its leftmost column index (`min_col`).
2.  Find the dimension `M` of the largest square bounding box present among all identified objects (i.e., find the maximum `H` for objects where `H == W`). If no objects have square bounding boxes, treat `M` as 0.
3.  Select a subset of "key" objects by keeping only those whose bounding box dimensions satisfy both `H >= M-1` and `W >= M-1`.
4.  If no key objects are selected, the output is an empty grid.
5.  If key objects exist, determine the target size `S` by finding the minimum dimension value among all key objects (calculate `min(H, W)` for each key object and find the minimum of these values).
6.  Sort the selected key objects based on their `min_col` value, from left to right.
7.  Create a list of `S x S` output segments, one for each sorted key object:
    *   If the key object's dimensions `H` and `W` are both exactly equal to `S` (`H == S` and `W == S`), then extract the `S x S` pixel pattern directly from the input grid at the object's bounding box location. This pattern forms the output segment.
    *   Otherwise (if `H > S` or `W > S`), create a solid `S x S` square filled entirely with the key object's color. This solid square forms the output segment.
8.  Construct the final output grid by arranging the generated `S x S` segments horizontally next to each other in the sorted order.
