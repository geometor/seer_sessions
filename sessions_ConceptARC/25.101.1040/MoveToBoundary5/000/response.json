The transformation involves moving (translating) the entire object within the grid.\n5.  **Translation Details**:\n    *   In train_1, the gray 'plus' shape moves 3 cells to the right.\n    *   In train_2, the orange 'L' shape moves 3 cells down.\n6.  **Rule Determination**: The direction of the translation appears to depend on the object's initial position relative to the grid boundaries. Specifically, it relates to the position of the object's top-leftmost pixel. If this pixel is closer to the top edge than the left edge, the object moves down. If it's closer to or equidistant from the left edge compared to the top edge, the object moves right. The magnitude of the shift is consistently 3 cells in both examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
