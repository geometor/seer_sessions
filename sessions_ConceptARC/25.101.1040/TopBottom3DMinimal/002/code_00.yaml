task_type: color_transformation_by_neighbor_count
grid_properties:
  size: constant (8x8 in examples)
  background_color: 0 (White)
objects:
  - type: colored_regions
    count: 2 (per example, excluding background)
    colors_present_example1: [2, 3] # Red, Green
    colors_present_example2: [6, 7] # Magenta, Orange
    relationships:
      - adjacency (8-way, including diagonal) between the two non-background colors
transformation_rule:
  type: conditional_color_change_based_on_neighbor_count
  affected_pixels: only pixels of a designated 'Loser' color (L)
  condition_trigger: A pixel of color L changes to the 'Winner' color (W) if the number of its 8 neighbors (in the input grid) that have color W meets or exceeds a specific threshold.
  parameters_determined_by_color_pair:
    - pair {Red(2), Green(3)}:
        Loser_color (L): 2
        Winner_color (W): 3
        Threshold: 3
    - pair {Magenta(6), Orange(7)}:
        Loser_color (L): 7
        Winner_color (W): 6
        Threshold: 4
  unaffected_pixels:
    - background pixels (color 0)
    - 'Winner' color pixels
    - 'Loser' color pixels where the count of 'Winner' neighbors is less than the threshold for that color pair.
  pixel_changes_summary:
    - example1: 6 pixels change from color 2 to color 3.
    - example2: 7 pixels change from color 7 to color 6.
