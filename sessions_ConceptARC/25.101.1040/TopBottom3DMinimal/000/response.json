            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples operate on 8x8 grids.\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each example involves exactly two non-background colors (White=0).\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) and Green (3).\n    *   Example 2: Magenta (6) and Orange (7).\n3.  **Input Objects:** The non-background colors form distinct shapes or regions.\n    *   Example 1: A Red 'U' shape and a Green 'L' shape, partially overlapping or adjacent.\n    *   Example 2: A Magenta backward 'C' shape framing an Orange shape which itself contains a White hole.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves one non-background color changing into the other non-background color at specific locations.\n    *   Example 1: Some Red pixels adjacent to Green pixels turn Green.\n    *   Example 2: Some Orange pixels adjacent to Magenta pixels turn Magenta.\n5.  **Mechanism:** The change appears to be triggered by adjacency (including diagonals). If a pixel of color 'A' is next to a pixel of color 'B', color 'A' might change to color 'B'.\n6.  **Directionality:** The change is unidirectional in each example.\n    *   Example 1: Red -> Green. Green pixels never change to Red.\n    *   Example 2: Orange -> Magenta. Magenta pixels never change to Orange.\n7.  **Determining Direction (Loser/Winner):** Let L be the color that gets changed (\"Loser\") and W be the color it changes into (\"Winner\").\n    *   Example 1: L=Red(2), W=Green(3).\n    *   Example 2: L=Orange(7), W=Magenta(6).\n    *   The determination of L and W isn't based on a simple numeric comparison (min/max) or consistent topological role (inner/outer). It needs to be inferred from the examples.\n8.  **Adjacency Rule:** The primary rule seems to be: A pixel with color L changes to color W if it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one pixel with color W in the input grid.\n9.  **Exception:** This rule works perfectly for Example 1. However, in Example 2, the Orange pixels at (1,3) and (3,3) are adjacent to Magenta pixels but do *not* change to Magenta, contradicting the simple rule. These specific pixels are also adjacent to the single White(0) pixel hole at (2,3). Pixels like (1,4) and (3,4) are also adjacent to both Orange and the hole, but *do* change. The exact condition for this exception is unclear from these examples alone but seems related to proximity to the internal hole.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the two distinct non-background colors present in the `input_grid`. Call them `color1` and `color2`.\n3.  Determine the 'Loser' color `L` and the 'Winner' color `W` by observing which color replaces the other at their interface in the provided examples (e.g., if some `color1` pixels become `color2`, then `L=color1`, `W=color2`).\n4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the `input_grid`.\n5.  If the color of the cell `input_grid[r, c]` is equal to the Loser color `L`:\n    a.  Check all 8 neighbours (including diagonals) of cell `(r, c)` in the `input_grid`.\n    b.  If at least one neighbour has the Winner color `W`:\n        i.  **Apply Exception Condition (heuristic based on observation):** Check if this specific cell `(r, c)` corresponds to one of the known exception cases (like (1,3) or (3,3) in train_2) which are adjacent to W but should not change. If it is an exception case, do nothing and proceed to the next cell.\n        ii. **Apply Color Change:** If it is not an exception case, change the color of the corresponding cell in the `output_grid` to the Winner color `W`: `output_grid[r, c] = W`.\n6.  After iterating through all cells, return the `output_grid`.\n\n*(Note: The exception handling in step 5.b.i is specific and not generalized due to ambiguity in the examples. A robust solution would require a clearer pattern or more examples to define the exception rule precisely.)*"
