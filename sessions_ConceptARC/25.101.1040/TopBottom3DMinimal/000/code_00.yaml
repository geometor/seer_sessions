task_type: color_transformation
grid_properties:
  size: constant (8x8 in examples)
  background_color: 0 (White)
objects:
  - type: colored_regions
    count: 2 (per example, excluding background)
    colors_present_example1: [2, 3] # Red, Green
    colors_present_example2: [6, 7] # Magenta, Orange
    relationships:
      - adjacency (including diagonal)
      - potential containment or framing (e.g., Ex2 M frames O)
      - presence of internal holes (Ex2 O contains 0)
transformation_rule:
  type: conditional_color_change
  condition_trigger: adjacency (8-way) between the two non-background colors
  directionality:
    - unidirectional per example
    - example1: color 2 (Red) changes to color 3 (Green)
    - example2: color 7 (Orange) changes to color 6 (Magenta)
    - general_rule_for_direction: unclear (not simple min/max)
  affected_pixels: only pixels of the 'loser' color (L) adjacent to the 'winner' color (W)
  unaffected_pixels:
    - background pixels
    - 'winner' color pixels
    - 'loser' color pixels not adjacent to 'winner' color
  exception:
    - observed in example 2
    - pixels L=7 at (1,3) and (3,3) are adjacent to W=6 but do not change
    - these pixels are also adjacent to an internal background hole at (2,3)
    - the precise condition for the exception is not fully determined but involves adjacency to both W and the hole.
