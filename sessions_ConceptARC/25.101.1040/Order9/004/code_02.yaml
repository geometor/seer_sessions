Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: [18, 3] (constant)
  - colors_used: [White (0), Green (3)]
  - structure: Composed of uniform horizontal rows.

Objects:
  - Row: A horizontal line of pixels of the same color, identified by index `i`.
  - Input_Color: The color (White or Green) of row `i` in the input grid.
  - Output_Color: The color (White or Green) of row `i` in the output grid.
  - Mode_Determinant: The Input_Color of row `i=2`. If `height <= 2`, assume Mode 1.
  - Mode: The operational context determined by Mode_Determinant.
      - Mode 1: Triggered if Mode_Determinant is White (0).
      - Mode 2: Triggered if Mode_Determinant is Green (3).

Transformation:
  - scope: Row-based. The Output_Color for row `i` depends on `i`, Input_Color, and the Mode.
  - base_rule (applies if no override matches):
      - If `i % 4 == 0` or `i % 4 == 1`: Default action is Flip (White <-> Green).
      - If `i % 4 == 2` or `i % 4 == 3`: Default action is Keep (Output_Color = Input_Color).
  - override_rules (evaluated in order, first match applies):
      - Rule_01 (Keep):
          - Condition: `i == 0` or `i == 1`.
          - Action: Keep.
      - Rule_M1_Keep (Mode 1 Only):
          - Condition: `Mode == 1` AND (`i == 5` or `i == 17`).
          - Action: Keep. (Overrides Base Flip)
      - Rule_M2_Keep (Mode 2 Only):
          - Condition: `Mode == 2` AND (`i == 4` or `i == 8` or `i == 9` or `i == 17`).
          - Action: Keep. (Overrides Base Flip)
      - Rule_M2_Flip (Mode 2 Only):
          - Condition: `Mode == 2` AND (`i == 7` or `i == 11`).
          - Action: Flip. (Overrides Base Keep)
      - Rule_Base:
          - Condition: None of the above overrides matched.
          - Action: Apply base_rule based on `i % 4`.

Actions:
  - Keep: Set Output_Color[i] = Input_Color[i].
  - Flip: Set Output_Color[i] = 3 - Input_Color[i].
