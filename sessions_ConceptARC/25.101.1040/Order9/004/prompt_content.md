```python
"""
Transforms the input grid based on row index `i` and potentially the color of row 2.

The core logic involves applying a transformation based on `i % 4`.
- Rows where `i % 4` is 0 or 1 are typically flipped (White 0 <-> Green 3).
- Rows where `i % 4` is 2 or 3 are typically kept the same.

However, there are overrides determined by analyzing the examples:
1. Rows 0 and 1 are always kept the same as the input, overriding the base rule.
2. Further specific overrides depend on a 'mode' determined by the color of input row 2 (if the grid is tall enough):
   - If input row 2 is White (0) ('Ex1' mode): Rows 5 and 17 are also kept (overriding the base flip rule for i%4=1 at these specific indices).
   - If input row 2 is Green (3) ('Ex2' mode): Rows 7 and 11 are flipped (overriding the base keep rule for i%4=3 at these specific indices).
   - If the grid is too short or row 2 has another color, only the row 0/1 override applies.
