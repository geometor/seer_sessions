Rows 0 and 1 are always kept the same as the input, overriding the base rule.\n2. Further specific overrides depend on a 'mode' determined by the color of input row 2 (if the grid is tall enough):\n   - If input row 2 is White (0) ('Ex1' mode): Rows 5 and 17 are also kept (overriding the base flip rule for i%4=1 at these specific indices).\n   - If input row 2 is Green (3) ('Ex2' mode): Rows 7 and 11 are flipped (overriding the base keep rule for i%4=3 at these specific indices).\n   - If the grid is too short or row 2 has another color, only the row 0/1 override applies.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\nimport numpy as np # Import numpy for potential future use, though not strictly needed here\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule based on row index modulo 4,\n    with overrides for specific rows determined by the color of input row 2.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid (list of lists of integers).\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed output grid (list of lists of integers).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid\n    # Using numpy array temporarily for easier manipulation might be an option,\n    # but sticking to lists of lists as per ARC standard.\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n    height = len(input_grid)\n\n    # Basic sanity check for empty grid\n    if height == 0:\n        return output_grid\n        \n    # Assume non-ragged array based on ARC examples, get width from first row\n    # Add check for empty row\n    if not input_grid[0]:\n         return output_grid # Or handle as error\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Handle case of empty grid (width=0)\n    if width == 0:\n         return output_grid\n\n    # Determine the operational mode based on the color of row 2, if it exists\n    mode = 'base' # Default mode if grid height < 3 or row 2 is empty/invalid\n    if height > 2:\n        # Ensure row 2 is not empty before accessing its first element\n        if input_grid[2]:\n            row_2_color = input_grid[2][0]\n            if row_2_color == 0: # White\n                mode = 'Ex1'\n            elif row_2_color == 3: # Green\n                mode = 'Ex2'\n        # If row 2 is empty, mode remains 'base'\n\n    # Iterate through each row index i\n    for i in range(height):\n        # Ensure the current row is valid before processing\n        if not input_grid[i] or len(input_grid[i]) != width:\n             # Skip potentially invalid rows or handle error\n             # For now, assume valid structure and skip if empty\n             if not input_grid[i]: continue \n\n        input_color = input_grid[i][0] # Color is consistent across the row\n\n        # --- Determine Transformation Rule ---\n        \n        # 1.
