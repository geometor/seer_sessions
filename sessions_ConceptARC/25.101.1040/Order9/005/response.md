"""
Transforms the input grid based on the row index `i` and an operating 'Mode' determined by the color of input row 2.

1. Determine the Mode:
   - If grid height < 3 or input row 2 is White(0), Mode = 1.
   - If input row 2 is Green(3), Mode = 2.

2. For each row `i`:
   - Apply rules sequentially. The first matching rule determines the action (Keep/Flip).
   - Rule 01 (Keep): If `i == 0` or `i == 1`.
   - Rule M1_Keep (Mode 1): If `Mode == 1` AND (`i == 5` or `i == 17`).
   - Rule M2_Keep (Mode 2): If `Mode == 2` AND `i` is in {4, 8, 9, 17}.
   - Rule M2_Flip (Mode 2): If `Mode == 2` AND `i` is in {7, 11}.
   - Rule Base (Default): 
     - If `i % 4 == 0` or `i % 4 == 1`, action is Flip.
     - If `i % 4 == 2` or `i % 4 == 3`, action is Keep.

3. Apply the action:
   - Keep: Output row color is the same as input row color.
   - Flip: Output row color is the opposite of input row color (0 <-> 3).
