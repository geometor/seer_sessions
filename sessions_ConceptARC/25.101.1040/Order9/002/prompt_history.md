**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid (18x3) consisting of horizontal rows of either White (0) or Green (3) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to operate row by row. The color of a row in the output seems dependent on its original color in the input grid and its row index `i`. A distinct pattern related to the row index modulo 4 emerges: rows where `i % 4` is 0 or 1 often have their color flipped (White becomes Green, Green becomes White), while rows where `i % 4` is 2 or 3 often retain their original color. However, analyzing the examples reveals discrepancies with this simple modulo-4 rule, suggesting potential edge cases or influences from adjacent rows, although these exceptions are not consistently explained by simple neighborhood rules (like being adjacent to white or grid boundaries). The most prominent and consistent pattern observed across both examples is the conditional flipping based on `i % 4`.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: [18, 3] (constant)
  - colors_used: [White (0), Green (3)]
  - structure: Composed of horizontal rows, where all pixels in a row share the same color.

Objects:
  - Row: A horizontal line of pixels of the same color.
  - Block: A contiguous sequence of one or more rows of the same color.
    - White_Block: Block of white rows.
    - Green_Block: Block of green rows.

Transformation:
  - scope: Row-based; operates independently on each row based on its index and original color.
  - rule_core_pattern: The transformation strongly correlates with the row index `i` modulo 4.
  - observed_behavior:
      - If `i % 4 == 0` or `i % 4 == 1`: The color of the row tends to be flipped (0 -> 3, 3 -> 0).
      - If `i % 4 == 2` or `i % 4 == 3`: The color of the row tends to remain the same as the input.
  - exceptions: The simple modulo-4 rule does not perfectly predict the output for all rows in the examples (e.g., rows 0, 1, 5, 17 in train_1; rows 0, 1, 7, 17 in train_2 show deviations from the predicted flip/keep behavior). The exact conditions for these exceptions are not immediately clear but might relate to boundary conditions or adjacency to different colored rows.

Input/Output Row Examples (Train 1):
  - Row 4 (W, i=4, i%4=0): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 8 (G, i=8, i%4=0): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 9 (W, i=9, i%4=1): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 12 (W, i=12, i%4=0): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 13 (G, i=13, i%4=1): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 16 (G, i=16, i%4=0): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 5 (G, i=5, i%4=1): Rule predicts Flip (G->W), Actual keeps G. (Exception)
  - Row 17 (G, i=17, i%4=1): Rule predicts Flip (G->W), Actual keeps G. (Exception)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  For each row index `i` from 0 to the height of the grid minus 1:
3.  Check if the row index `i` modulo 4 is equal to 0 or 1.
4.  If it is, flip the color of the entire row `i` in the output grid: change White (0) to Green (3), and Green (3) to White (0).
5.  If `i` modulo 4 is 2 or 3, leave the row `i` in the output grid unchanged from its copied input color.
6.  Return the final output grid.
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by iterating through each row.
If the row index `i` modulo 4 is 0 or 1, the color of the entire row is flipped 
(White becomes Green, Green becomes White).
If the row index `i` modulo 4 is 2 or 3, the row remains unchanged.
