            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid (18x3) consisting of horizontal rows of either White (0) or Green (3) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to operate row by row. The color of a row in the output seems dependent on its original color in the input grid and its row index `i`. A distinct pattern related to the row index modulo 4 emerges: rows where `i % 4` is 0 or 1 often have their color flipped (White becomes Green, Green becomes White), while rows where `i % 4` is 2 or 3 often retain their original color. However, analyzing the examples reveals discrepancies with this simple modulo-4 rule, suggesting potential edge cases or influences from adjacent rows, although these exceptions are not consistently explained by simple neighborhood rules (like being adjacent to white or grid boundaries). The most prominent and consistent pattern observed across both examples is the conditional flipping based on `i % 4`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
