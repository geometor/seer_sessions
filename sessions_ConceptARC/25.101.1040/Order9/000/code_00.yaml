Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: [18, 3] (constant)
  - colors_used: [White (0), Green (3)]
  - structure: Composed of horizontal rows, where all pixels in a row share the same color.

Objects:
  - Row: A horizontal line of pixels of the same color.
  - Block: A contiguous sequence of one or more rows of the same color.
    - White_Block: Block of white rows.
    - Green_Block: Block of green rows.

Transformation:
  - scope: Row-based; operates independently on each row based on its index and original color.
  - rule_core_pattern: The transformation strongly correlates with the row index `i` modulo 4.
  - observed_behavior:
      - If `i % 4 == 0` or `i % 4 == 1`: The color of the row tends to be flipped (0 -> 3, 3 -> 0).
      - If `i % 4 == 2` or `i % 4 == 3`: The color of the row tends to remain the same as the input.
  - exceptions: The simple modulo-4 rule does not perfectly predict the output for all rows in the examples (e.g., rows 0, 1, 5, 17 in train_1; rows 0, 1, 7, 17 in train_2 show deviations from the predicted flip/keep behavior). The exact conditions for these exceptions are not immediately clear but might relate to boundary conditions or adjacency to different colored rows.

Input/Output Row Examples (Train 1):
  - Row 4 (W, i=4, i%4=0): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 8 (G, i=8, i%4=0): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 9 (W, i=9, i%4=1): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 12 (W, i=12, i%4=0): Flips W -> G (Matches rule)
  - Row 13 (G, i=13, i%4=1): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 16 (G, i=16, i%4=0): Flips G -> W (Matches rule)
  - Row 5 (G, i=5, i%4=1): Rule predicts Flip (G->W), Actual keeps G. (Exception)
  - Row 17 (G, i=17, i%4=1): Rule predicts Flip (G->W), Actual keeps G. (Exception)
