**PERCEPTION**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, with values 0-9 representing colors. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** The key elements are contiguous rectangular blocks of non-white pixels. In the provided examples, these blocks are aligned vertically, starting at the leftmost column (column 0).
3.  **Properties:** Each block has a distinct color, height, width, and vertical position (top row).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reordering these blocks vertically. The blocks themselves (their shape and color) remain unchanged.
5.  **Pattern:** The reordering criterion appears to be the width of the blocks. Blocks are sorted in ascending order based on their width.
6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The relative vertical spacing (gaps of white rows) between the blocks in their original order is preserved and applied to the sorted sequence of blocks. The horizontal position (starting column) remains unchanged.

**FACTS**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input and Output grids contain a white background (0) and multiple non-white rectangular blocks.
  - Blocks appear vertically stacked, starting at column 0.
  - Blocks maintain their shape and color from input to output.
  - The vertical order of the blocks changes between input and output.
  - The horizontal position of the blocks remains unchanged.

Identified Objects:
  - Type: Rectangular contiguous blocks of a single non-white color.
  - Properties:
      - color: The pixel value (1-9).
      - height: Vertical dimension in pixels.
      - width: Horizontal dimension in pixels.
      - top_row: The row index of the block's topmost pixels.
      - pixels: The 2D array representing the block's shape and color.
      - original_order: The vertical sequence index (0, 1, 2...) in the input grid.

Derived Properties:
  - vertical_gaps: The number of white rows between consecutive blocks in the input grid.

Action:
  - Reorder the blocks vertically based on a specific property.

Relationship:
  - Sorting criterion: Block width, in ascending order.
  - Positioning rule:
      - The sorted block with the smallest width is placed at the top_row of the first block from the original input.
      - Subsequent sorted blocks are placed sequentially below the previously placed block.
      - The vertical gap (number of white rows) placed below each block corresponds to the vertical gap that originally existed below the block occupying that sequential position in the *input* grid.

**NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white rectangular blocks. Assume blocks are vertically arranged and start in the same column.
2.  For each identified block, record its properties: pixel data (shape and color), height, width, and original top row index. Store the blocks in a list maintaining their original top-to-bottom order.
3.  Calculate the vertical gaps (number of white rows) between consecutive blocks in the original list. The gap `G_i` after block `i` is `top_row(i+1) - (top_row(i) + height(i))`. Store these gaps.
4.  Create a copy of the block list and sort this new list based on the width of the blocks in ascending order.
5.  Create a new empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Initialize the current row position `current_top_row` with the `top_row` of the *first* block from the *original* (unsorted) list.
7.  Iterate through the *sorted* list of blocks (from smallest width to largest). For each block `S_k` (where k is the index in the sorted list, 0 to N-1):
    a.  Place the block `S_k` onto the output grid, starting at `current_top_row` and its original starting column (column 0 in the examples).
    b.  If this is not the last block (k < N-1), update `current_top_row` for the *next* block by adding the height of the current block `S_k` and the corresponding original gap `G_k` (the gap that followed the k-th block in the original input order): `current_top_row = current_top_row + height(S_k) + G_k`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
