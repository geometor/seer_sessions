The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The key elements are contiguous rectangular blocks of non-white pixels. In the provided examples, these blocks are aligned vertically, starting at the leftmost column (column 0).\n3.  **Properties:** Each block has a distinct color, height, width, and vertical position (top row).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reordering these blocks vertically. The blocks themselves (their shape and color) remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern:** The reordering criterion appears to be the width of the blocks. Blocks are sorted in ascending order based on their width.\n6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The relative vertical spacing (gaps of white rows) between the blocks in their original order is preserved and applied to the sorted sequence of blocks. The horizontal position (starting column) remains unchanged.\n\n**FACTS**\n\n"

Assume blocks are vertically arranged and start in the same column.\n2.  For each identified block, record its properties: pixel data (shape and color), height, width, and original top row index. Store the blocks in a list maintaining their original top-to-bottom order.\n3.  Calculate the vertical gaps (number of white rows) between consecutive blocks in the original list. The gap `G_i` after block `i` is `top_row(i+1) - (top_row(i) + height(i))`. Store these gaps.\n4.  Create a copy of the block list and sort this new list based on the width of the blocks in ascending order.\n5.  Create a new empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Initialize the current row position `current_top_row` with the `top_row` of the *first* block from the *original* (unsorted) list.\n7.  Iterate through the *sorted* list of blocks (from smallest width to largest). For each block `S_k` (where k is the index in the sorted list, 0 to N-1):\n    a.  Place the block `S_k` onto the output grid, starting at `current_top_row` and its original starting column (column 0 in the examples).\n    b.  If this is not the last block (k < N-1), update `current_top_row` for the *next* block by adding the height of the current block `S_k` and the corresponding original gap `G_k` (the gap that followed the k-th block in the original input order): `current_top_row = current_top_row + height(S_k) + G_k`.\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
