Observations:
  - Input and Output grids contain a white background (0) and multiple non-white rectangular blocks.
  - Blocks appear vertically stacked, starting at column 0.
  - Blocks maintain their shape and color from input to output.
  - The vertical order of the blocks changes between input and output.
  - The horizontal position of the blocks remains unchanged.

Identified Objects:
  - Type: Rectangular contiguous blocks of a single non-white color.
  - Properties:
      - color: The pixel value (1-9).
      - height: Vertical dimension in pixels.
      - width: Horizontal dimension in pixels.
      - top_row: The row index of the block's topmost pixels.
      - pixels: The 2D array representing the block's shape and color.
      - original_order: The vertical sequence index (0, 1, 2...) in the input grid.

Derived Properties:
  - vertical_gaps: The number of white rows between consecutive blocks in the input grid.

Action:
  - Reorder the blocks vertically based on a specific property.

Relationship:
  - Sorting criterion: Block width, in ascending order.
  - Positioning rule:
      - The sorted block with the smallest width is placed at the top_row of the first block from the original input.
      - Subsequent sorted blocks are placed sequentially below the previously placed block.
      - The vertical gap (number of white rows) placed below each block corresponds to the vertical gap that originally existed below the block occupying that sequential position in the *input* grid.
