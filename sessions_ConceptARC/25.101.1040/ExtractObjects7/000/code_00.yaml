task_context: The task involves isolating specific shapes from an input grid by removing a separator element and the background, then combining the isolated shapes.
elements:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: non-white (1-9)
      contiguity: pixels of the same color are connected
      role: primary_object or separator
  - type: primary_object
    description: The shapes intended to be extracted and combined in the output.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The minimal rectangle containing all pixels of the object.
      - position: Location within the input grid (e.g., top-left coordinates).
  - type: separator
    description: A specific object that divides the grid and separates the primary objects.
    properties:
      - shape: Typically a line or bar (vertical or horizontal rectangle).
      - orientation: vertical or horizontal.
      - function: Partitions the grid, separating other objects.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    description: The separator object divides the grid, placing primary objects into distinct regions (e.g., left/right, top/bottom).
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal or vertical
      - separator: the object performing the separation
      - separated_objects: list of primary objects
  - type: adjacency
    description: In the output, the extracted primary objects are placed directly next to each other.
    properties:
      - direction: horizontal or vertical (determined by separator orientation)
      - order: Based on original relative positions (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
  - action: identify_separator
    description: Distinguish the separator object from primary objects based on its shape (line/bar) and its function of partitioning the grid.
  - action: determine_separator_orientation
    description: Check if the separator is taller than wide (vertical) or wider than tall (horizontal).
  - action: filter_objects
    description: Select only the primary (non-separator) objects for further processing.
  - action: extract_bounding_box
    description: For each selected primary object, find its minimal bounding box and extract the corresponding subgrid from the input.
  - action: sort_objects
    description: Order the extracted subgrids based on the original spatial position of their corresponding objects relative to the separator axis.
  - action: concatenate_subgrids
    description: Combine the sorted, extracted subgrids along the axis orthogonal to the separator's orientation (horizontally for a vertical separator, vertically for a horizontal separator).
