The other non-white objects reside entirely within these separate regions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the non-separator objects, extracting them based on their minimal bounding boxes, and then concatenating these extracted shapes. The separator object and the original background are discarded.\n5.  **Concatenation Logic:** If the separator is vertical, the objects are concatenated horizontally (left object then right object). If the separator is horizontal, the objects are concatenated vertically (top object then bottom object).\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains only the extracted primary shapes placed adjacent to each other, with no separator or original background. The dimensions of the output grid depend on the dimensions of the extracted shapes and the concatenation direction.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
