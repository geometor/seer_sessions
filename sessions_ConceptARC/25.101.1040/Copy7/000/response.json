One object contains an internal pattern, specifically a diagonal line of a distinct color. The other object is typically a solid color block. The transformation consists of copying the internal diagonal pattern from the first object (\"source\") into the second object (\"target\"), preserving the pattern's color and its relative position within the bounds of the target object. The original objects and the background remain otherwise unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
