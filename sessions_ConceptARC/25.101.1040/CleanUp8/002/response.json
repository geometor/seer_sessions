            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis identified a plausible rule: find contiguous objects, check if their bounding box is 2x2, and if so, draw a filled 2x2 square of the object's color at the bounding box location in the output. The provided code implemented this logic.\n\nTesting revealed this logic failed for Example 1, specifically missing a green 2x2 square present in the expected output. Further investigation using code execution confirmed that the green object in question, when identified using standard 4-connectivity, includes an adjacent pixel that extends its bounding box to 3x2, causing the code to correctly (based on its logic) discard it. However, the expected output *requires* this square.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates the initial rule was incomplete. Analysis of the failing case (Example 1 green square) and the passing case (Example 2) suggests a refined, dual-condition rule:\n\n1.  Identify objects based on 2x2 bounding boxes (regardless of internal shape).\n2.  *Additionally*, identify any 2x2 squares in the input that are solidly filled with a single non-white color.\n\nBoth types of identified 2x2 areas are then drawn onto the output grid. This combined rule successfully explains both provided examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution to test the `find_objects` and `calculate_bounding_box` functions against both examples using 4-connectivity.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.\n    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:\n        *   Color 2 (Red), Top-Left (0,0)\n        *   Color 1 (Blue), Top-Left (2,2)\n        *   Color 4 (Yellow), Top-Left (6,6)\n        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (8,8)\n    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:\n        *   A solid Green (3) square exists at Top-Left (4,4).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.\n    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:\n        *   Color 3 (Green), Top-Left (0,8)\n        *   Color 7 (Orange), Top-Left (2,6)\n        *   Color 6 (Magenta), Top-Left (4,4)\n        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (6,2)\n        *   Color 9 (Maroon), Top-Left (8,0)\n    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:\n        *   No solid 2x2 squares of a single non-white color exist.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates `(r, c)` for a 2x2 square within the input grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to height-2, `c` from 0 to width-2).\n    b.

Check if all four pixels are identical *and* are not the background color (white, 0).\n    d.  If they are identical and non-white, let the color be `C`.
