**General Assessment**

The initial analysis identified a plausible rule: find contiguous objects, check if their bounding box is 2x2, and if so, draw a filled 2x2 square of the object's color at the bounding box location in the output. The provided code implemented this logic.

Testing revealed this logic failed for Example 1, specifically missing a green 2x2 square present in the expected output. Further investigation using code execution confirmed that the green object in question, when identified using standard 4-connectivity, includes an adjacent pixel that extends its bounding box to 3x2, causing the code to correctly (based on its logic) discard it. However, the expected output *requires* this square.

This discrepancy indicates the initial rule was incomplete. Analysis of the failing case (Example 1 green square) and the passing case (Example 2) suggests a refined, dual-condition rule:

1.  Identify objects based on 2x2 bounding boxes (regardless of internal shape).
2.  *Additionally*, identify any 2x2 squares in the input that are solidly filled with a single non-white color.

Both types of identified 2x2 areas are then drawn onto the output grid. This combined rule successfully explains both provided examples.

**Metrics**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution to test the `find_objects` and `calculate_bounding_box` functions against both examples using 4-connectivity.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.
    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:
        *   Color 2 (Red), Top-Left (0,0)
        *   Color 1 (Blue), Top-Left (2,2)
        *   Color 4 (Yellow), Top-Left (6,6)
        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (8,8)
    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:
        *   A solid Green (3) square exists at Top-Left (4,4).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.
    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:
        *   Color 3 (Green), Top-Left (0,8)
        *   Color 7 (Orange), Top-Left (2,6)
        *   Color 6 (Magenta), Top-Left (4,4)
        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (6,2)
        *   Color 9 (Maroon), Top-Left (8,0)
    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:
        *   No solid 2x2 squares of a single non-white color exist.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty set, `squares_to_draw`, to store the color and top-left coordinates `(color, (row, col))` of the 2x2 squares that will be drawn in the output.
2.  **Identify squares based on object bounding boxes:**
    a.  Find all distinct contiguous objects of non-white pixels in the input grid (using 4-way adjacency).
    b.  For each identified object:
        i.  Determine its color.
        ii. Calculate its bounding box (minimum enclosing rectangle).
        iii. If the bounding box height is exactly 2 and the width is exactly 2, add the object's `(color, (bounding_box_top_row, bounding_box_top_col))` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
3.  **Identify squares based on solid 2x2 patterns:**
    a.  Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates `(r, c)` for a 2x2 square within the input grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to height-2, `c` from 0 to width-2).
    b.  For each `(r, c)`, examine the four pixels: `input[r][c]`, `input[r+1][c]`, `input[r][c+1]`, `input[r+1][c+1]`.
    c.  Check if all four pixels are identical *and* are not the background color (white, 0).
    d.  If they are identical and non-white, let the color be `C`. Add `(C, (r, c))` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
4.  **Generate the output grid:**
    a.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    b.  For each `(color, (row, col))` pair in the `squares_to_draw` set:
        i.  Set the pixel at `output[row][col]` to `color`.
        ii. Set the pixel at `output[row+1][col]` to `color`.
        iii. Set the pixel at `output[row][col+1]` to `color`.
        iv. Set the pixel at `output[row+1][col+1]` to `color`.
5.  Return the final output grid.
