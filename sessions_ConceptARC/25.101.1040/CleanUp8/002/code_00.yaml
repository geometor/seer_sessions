task_context: Grid transformation focusing on identifying and standardizing 2x2 patterns.
components:
  - item: Grid
    attributes:
      - 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
      - Contains background (white, 0) and foreground pixels (non-white).
  - item: Object
    description: A contiguous block (4-connectivity) of one or more pixels of the same non-white color.
    attributes:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - pixels: Set of coordinates (row, col).
      - bounding_box: Minimal rectangle (top_left_row, top_left_col, height, width).
  - item: Solid 2x2 Square
    description: A 2x2 area in the input grid where all 4 pixels have the same non-white color.
    attributes:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - top_left_corner: (row, col) coordinates of the top-left pixel of the square.
relationships:
  - type: Selection Criteria 1 (Object-based)
    condition: Object's bounding_box height == 2 AND Object's bounding_box width == 2.
  - type: Selection Criteria 2 (Pattern-based)
    condition: A 2x2 area in the grid consists of 4 pixels of the identical non-white color.
actions:
  - action: Identify Objects and Bounding Boxes
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: List of objects with properties (color, pixels, bounding_box).
  - action: Identify Solid 2x2 Squares
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: List of solid squares identified by (color, top_left_corner).
  - action: Filter and Collect Target Squares
    actor: System
    input: Results from Identify Objects and Identify Solid 2x2 Squares.
    process:
      - Create a set to store target squares as (color, top_left_corner) tuples to avoid duplicates.
      - Add (object.color, object.bounding_box.top_left_corner) for all objects meeting Selection Criteria 1.
      - Add (square.color, square.top_left_corner) for all squares meeting Selection Criteria 2.
    output: Set of unique (color, top_left_corner) tuples representing squares to be drawn.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    actor: System
    input: Set of target squares and input grid dimensions.
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
      - For each (color, (r, c)) in the target set, fill the 2x2 area starting at (r, c) in the new grid with that color.
    output: Output grid.
