task_context: Grid transformation focusing on object properties.
components:
  - item: Grid
    attributes:
      - 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
      - Contains background (white, 0) and foreground pixels (non-white).
  - item: Object
    description: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same non-white color.
    attributes:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels comprising the object.
      - pixels: Set of coordinates (row, col) belonging to the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimal rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object.
        properties:
          - top_left_corner: (min_row, min_col)
          - bottom_right_corner: (max_row, max_col)
          - height: max_row - min_row + 1
          - width: max_col - min_col + 1
relationships:
  - type: Selection criteria
    based_on: Object bounding box dimensions.
    condition: Height must be 2 AND Width must be 2.
actions:
  - action: Identify Objects
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: List of identified objects with their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box).
  - action: Filter Objects
    actor: System
    input: List of identified objects
    condition: Keep only objects where bounding_box height == 2 and bounding_box width == 2.
    output: List of filtered objects.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    actor: System
    input: Filtered objects and input grid dimensions.
    process: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0). For each filtered object, fill the 2x2 area defined by its bounding box with the object's color.
    output: Output grid.
