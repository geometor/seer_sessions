The input grid features multiple small \"objects,\" defined as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. The output grid retains only a subset of these objects, and the retained objects are always 2x2 squares, filled entirely with the color of the original object. Objects in the input that do not have a bounding box of exactly 2x2 are removed (their pixels are turned white) in the output. The core transformation identifies objects based on their spatial extent (specifically, a 2x2 bounding box) and standardizes their shape to a filled 2x2 square while preserving their color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
