**Perception**

The task involves processing a 2D grid containing various colored pixels. The input grid features multiple small "objects," defined as contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. The output grid retains only a subset of these objects, and the retained objects are always 2x2 squares, filled entirely with the color of the original object. Objects in the input that do not have a bounding box of exactly 2x2 are removed (their pixels are turned white) in the output. The core transformation identifies objects based on their spatial extent (specifically, a 2x2 bounding box) and standardizes their shape to a filled 2x2 square while preserving their color.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, entirely filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine the color of the object.
    b.  Calculate the bounding box of the object (the smallest rectangle containing all its pixels).
    c.  Measure the height and width of the bounding box.
    d.  Check if the height is exactly 2 pixels and the width is exactly 2 pixels.
4.  If an object's bounding box dimensions are 2x2:
    a.  Locate the top-left corner coordinates of its bounding box in the input grid.
    b.  Fill the corresponding 2x2 area in the output grid (starting from the identified top-left corner) with the color of that object.
5.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid as the background color (white, 0).
6.  Return the final output grid.

**General Assessment**

The initial analysis identified a plausible rule: find contiguous objects, check if their bounding box is 2x2, and if so, draw a filled 2x2 square of the object's color at the bounding box location in the output. The provided code implemented this logic.

Testing revealed this logic failed for Example 1, specifically missing a green 2x2 square present in the expected output. Further investigation using code execution confirmed that the green object in question, when identified using standard 4-connectivity, includes an adjacent pixel that extends its bounding box to 3x2, causing the code to correctly (based on its logic) discard it. However, the expected output *requires* this square.

This discrepancy indicates the initial rule was incomplete. Analysis of the failing case (Example 1 green square) and the passing case (Example 2) suggests a refined, dual-condition rule:

1.  Identify objects based on 2x2 bounding boxes (regardless of internal shape).
2.  *Additionally*, identify any 2x2 squares in the input that are solidly filled with a single non-white color.

Both types of identified 2x2 areas are then drawn onto the output grid. This combined rule successfully explains both provided examples.

**Metrics**

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution to test the `find_objects` and `calculate_bounding_box` functions against both examples using 4-connectivity.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.
    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:
        *   Color 2 (Red), Top-Left (0,0)
        *   Color 1 (Blue), Top-Left (2,2)
        *   Color 4 (Yellow), Top-Left (6,6)
        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (8,8)
    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:
        *   A solid Green (3) square exists at Top-Left (4,4).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Objects found: 19 distinct contiguous non-white objects.
    *   Objects with 2x2 Bounding Box:
        *   Color 3 (Green), Top-Left (0,8)
        *   Color 7 (Orange), Top-Left (2,6)
        *   Color 6 (Magenta), Top-Left (4,4)
        *   Color 5 (Gray), Top-Left (6,2)
        *   Color 9 (Maroon), Top-Left (8,0)
    *   Solid 2x2 Square Check:
        *   No solid 2x2 squares of a single non-white color exist.

      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - pixels: Set of coordinates (row, col).
      - bounding_box: Minimal rectangle (top_left_row, top_left_col, height, width).

    description: A 2x2 area in the input grid where all 4 pixels have the same non-white color.
    attributes:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - top_left_corner: (row, col) coordinates of the top-left pixel of the square.
relationships:
  - type: Selection Criteria 1 (Object-based)
    condition: Object's bounding_box height == 2 AND Object's bounding_box width == 2.
  - type: Selection Criteria 2 (Pattern-based)
    condition: A 2x2 area in the grid consists of 4 pixels of the identical non-white color.
actions:
  - action: Identify Objects and Bounding Boxes
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: List of objects with properties (color, pixels, bounding_box).
  - action: Identify Solid 2x2 Squares
    actor: System
    input: Input grid
    output: List of solid squares identified by (color, top_left_corner).
  - action: Filter and Collect Target Squares
    actor: System
    input: Results from Identify Objects and Identify Solid 2x2 Squares.
    process:
      - Create a set to store target squares as (color, top_left_corner) tuples to avoid duplicates.
      - Add (object.color, object.bounding_box.top_left_corner) for all objects meeting Selection Criteria 1.
      - Add (square.color, square.top_left_corner) for all squares meeting Selection Criteria 2.
    output: Set of unique (color, top_left_corner) tuples representing squares to be drawn.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    actor: System
    input: Set of target squares and input grid dimensions.
    process:
      - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
      - For each (color, (r, c)) in the target set, fill the 2x2 area starting at (r, c) in the new grid with that color.
    output: Output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty set, `squares_to_draw`, to store the color and top-left coordinates `(color, (row, col))` of the 2x2 squares that will be drawn in the output.
2.  **Identify squares based on object bounding boxes:**
    a.  Find all distinct contiguous objects of non-white pixels in the input grid (using 4-way adjacency).
    b.  For each identified object:
        i.  Determine its color.
        ii. Calculate its bounding box (minimum enclosing rectangle).
        iii. If the bounding box height is exactly 2 and the width is exactly 2, add the object's `(color, (bounding_box_top_row, bounding_box_top_col))` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
3.  **Identify squares based on solid 2x2 patterns:**
    a.  Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates `(r, c)` for a 2x2 square within the input grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to height-2, `c` from 0 to width-2).
    b.  For each `(r, c)`, examine the four pixels: `input[r][c]`, `input[r+1][c]`, `input[r][c+1]`, `input[r+1][c+1]`.
    c.  Check if all four pixels are identical *and* are not the background color (white, 0).
    d.  If they are identical and non-white, let the color be `C`. Add `(C, (r, c))` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
4.  **Generate the output grid:**
    a.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    b.  For each `(color, (row, col))` pair in the `squares_to_draw` set:
        i.  Set the pixel at `output[row][col]` to `color`.
        ii. Set the pixel at `output[row+1][col]` to `color`.
        iii. Set the pixel at `output[row][col+1]` to `color`.
        iv. Set the pixel at `output[row+1][col+1]` to `color`.
5.  Return the final output grid.
