            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on counting \"pure columns,\" successfully solved examples `train_1` and `train_3` but failed on `train_2`. The results show the code generated a 4x4 grid for `train_2` instead of the expected 5x5. This indicates that the definition of which columns contribute to the output size needs refinement.\n\nAnalysis of `train_2` reveals that the input width is 6, and the expected output size is 5. The previous code identified 4 \"pure\" columns (indices 1, 2, 3, 4). The columns that *failed* the purity test were columns 0 and 5, which contained white (0) pixels within the rows relevant to the dominant color (magenta, 6). There are 2 such \"impure\" columns.\n\nComparing this to the successes:\n-   `train_1`: Width 15, Output 5x5. Pure columns = 5. Impure columns = 10 (0, 6-14). `15 - 10 = 5`.\n-   `train_3`: Width 16, Output 3x3. Pure columns = 3 (11, 12, 13). Impure columns = 13 (0-10, 14, 15). `16 - 13 = 3`.\n\nA consistent pattern emerges: The size `N` of the output square grid appears to be the **width of the input grid minus the number of columns that are \"impure\"** relative to the dominant color within the relevant rows.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Update the core logic to identify \"impure\" columns instead of \"pure\" ones.\n2.  Calculate the output size `N` as `input_width - impure_column_count`.\n3.  Generate the `N x N` output grid filled with the dominant color.\n4.  Verify this revised logic against all training examples using metric calculation.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
