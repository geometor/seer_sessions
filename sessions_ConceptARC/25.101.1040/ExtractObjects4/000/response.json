            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of two colors: white (0) and one other dominant non-white color (red=2, magenta=6, yellow=4 in the examples). These colors often appear in alternating horizontal rows.\n2.  **Row Variation:** Some rows containing the dominant non-white color are completely filled with that color, while others contain interspersed white pixels (\"holes\" or \"impurities\").\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are always squares, significantly smaller than the input grids, and are filled uniformly with the dominant non-white color found in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Clue:** The size of the output square seems related to some property of the input grid. Initial thoughts about counting purely colored *rows* didn't consistently match the output size across examples.\n5.  **Columnar Pattern:** Analyzing the columns reveals a pattern: The size of the output square (`N x N`) corresponds to the number of columns in the input grid that are \"pure\" relative to the dominant non-white color. A column is considered \"pure\" if, within all the rows that contain *any* instance of the dominant color, that specific column *only* contains the dominant color.\n6.  **Core Logic:** The task identifies the main color, filters the input grid based on column purity (where purity is defined by the absence of white pixels in specific locations within the column), counts these pure columns, and generates a square output of that count's dimension filled with the main color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each column index `j` of the input grid.\n    c.  For the current column `j`, assume it is pure (`is_column_pure = true`).\n    d.  Iterate through each row index `i` in `relevant_row_indices`.\n    e.  Check the color of the pixel at `input_grid[i][j]`.\n    f.  If `input_grid[i][j]` is *not* equal to `dominant_color`, set `is_column_pure = false` and stop checking rows for this column `j` (break the inner loop).\n    g.  After checking all relevant rows for column `j`, if `is_column_pure` is still `true`, increment `pure_column_count`.\n4.  **Determine Output Size:** The size `N` for the output square grid is equal to `pure_column_count`.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate a new grid of size `N x N`, filling every cell with the `dominant_color`.
