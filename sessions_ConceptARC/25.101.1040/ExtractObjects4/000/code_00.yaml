task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    attributes:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
      - pixels: 2D array of colors (0-9)
      - contains_dominant_color: non-white color C
      - contains_white_pixels: color 0
      - structure: often alternating rows of white and color C
  - name: Output Grid
    attributes:
      - height: N (integer)
      - width: N (integer)
      - pixels: 2D array, uniformly filled with color C
      - shape: square

properties:
  - name: Dominant Color (C)
    description: The single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - name: Relevant Rows
    description: The set of row indices in the input grid that contain at least one pixel of the Dominant Color C.
  - name: Pure Column
    description: A column 'j' in the input grid such that for every row index 'i' in the set of Relevant Rows, the pixel input[i][j] has the Dominant Color C.
  - name: Pure Column Count (N)
    description: The total number of Pure Columns in the input grid.

relationships:
  - Output grid dimension N is determined by the Pure Column Count N.
  - Output grid color is the Dominant Color C from the input grid.

actions:
  - Identify the Dominant Color C.
  - Identify the Relevant Rows.
  - Iterate through input columns to identify Pure Columns.
  - Count the number of Pure Columns (N).
  - Generate an N x N grid filled with Dominant Color C.
