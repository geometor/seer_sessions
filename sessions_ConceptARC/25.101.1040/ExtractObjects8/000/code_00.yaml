Task: Extract content within a frame and potentially transform it based on shape.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background: The most frequent pixel color in the grid.
  - Frame:
      Object_Type: Hollow rectangle.
      Property: Composed of a single color (F) different from the Background color.
      Property: Thickness of 1 pixel.
      Property: Dimensions (FrameHeight, FrameWidth).
      Relationship: Must exist uniquely in the input grid.
  - InnerContent:
      Object_Type: Solid rectangle.
      Relationship: Enclosed by the Frame.
      Property: Composed of a single color (C), same as the Background color.
      Property: Dimensions (ContentHeight = FrameHeight - 2, ContentWidth = FrameWidth - 2).
      Property: Shape (Square if ContentHeight == ContentWidth, Rectangle otherwise).
      Data: The grid of pixels forming the InnerContent (InnerGrid).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels, derived from Frame and InnerContent.
  - Derivation_Rule: Conditional based on InnerContent shape.

Transformation_Logic:
  - Find: Identify the Background color, the Frame color (F), Frame dimensions (FH, FW), InnerContent color (C), and InnerContent grid (InnerGrid) with dimensions (CH, CW).
  - Condition: Check if InnerGrid is square (CH == CW).
  - Case_Square:
      Action: Output is the InnerGrid directly.
  - Case_Rectangle:
      Action: Construct a new output grid.
      Output_Dimensions: CH x FH (ContentHeight x FrameHeight).
      Define_Columns:
        - ContentColumn (ColC): The first column of InnerGrid.
        - ModifiedColumn (ColM): Copy of ContentColumn with the top (row 0) and bottom (row CH-1) pixels replaced by the FrameColor (F).
      Assemble_Output:
        - Create a sequence S of columns by repeating [ColM, ColC] CW times.
        - Append ColC to S until S has length FH.
        - Truncate S to length FH if it exceeds it (shouldn't happen with the previous step).
        - Combine columns in S to form the output grid.
