            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.\nThe input grids contain multiple colors (pixels with values 1-9) on a white background (pixels with value 0).\nThe output grids consist primarily of a white background and a hollow rectangular frame made of a single color. This color appears to be derived from the input grid.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  **Identify Key Color:** The color used for the frame in the output corresponds to the most frequent non-white color in the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Initial Frame:** The initial location and size of the frame seem related to the bounding box of all pixels of the key color in the input grid.\n3.  **Frame Adjustment:** In the second example, the bounding box of the key color extends further down than the final frame in the output. This suggests an adjustment rule. The bottom edge of the initial bounding box contains only one pixel of the key color. It appears that if any edge (top, bottom, left, right) of the bounding box contains exactly one pixel of the key color, that edge is 'shrunk' inwards. This process might need iteration if shrinking one edge causes another edge to now have only one key color pixel.\n4.  **Construct Output:** The final output grid is created by drawing the adjusted hollow rectangular frame using the key color on a white background. All pixels inside and outside the frame are white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Count the occurrences of each non-white color (1 through 9) in the input grid.\n3.  Identify the `key_color` which is the non-white color with the highest frequency. If there is a tie in frequency, select the color with the smallest numerical value as the `key_color`.\n4.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid where the pixel value equals the `key_color`. Store these as `key_pixel_locations`.\n5.  If no pixels of the `key_color` exist, the output is an all-white grid of size HxW; stop.\n6.  Calculate the initial bounding box of the `key_pixel_locations`: find the minimum row (`min_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), maximum row (`max_r`), and maximum column (`max_c`).\n7.  Initialize the final bounding box coordinates (`final_min_r`, `final_min_c`, `final_max_r`, `final_max_c`) with the initial bounding box values.\n8.  Start an adjustment loop:\n    a.  Set a flag `shrunk_this_iteration` to false.\n    b.  Count how many `key_pixel_locations` lie on the current top border (row = `final_min_r`, column from `final_min_c` to `final_max_c`). If the count is exactly 1 and `final_min_r < final_max_r`, increment `final_min_r` by 1 and set `shrunk_this_iteration` to true.\n    c.  Count how many `key_pixel_locations` lie on the current bottom border (row = `final_max_r`, column from `final_min_c` to `final_max_c`). If the count is exactly 1 and `final_max_r > final_min_r`, decrement `final_max_r` by 1 and set `shrunk_this_iteration` to true.\n    d.  Count how many `key_pixel_locations` lie on the current left border (column = `final_min_c`, row from `final_min_r` to `final_max_r`). If the count is exactly 1 and `final_min_c < final_max_c`, increment `final_min_c` by 1 and set `shrunk_this_iteration` to true.\n    e.  Count how many `key_pixel_locations` lie on the current right border (column = `final_max_c`, row from `final_min_r` to `final_max_r`). If the count is exactly 1 and `final_max_c > final_min_c`, decrement `final_max_c` by 1 and set `shrunk_this_iteration` to true.\n    f.  If `shrunk_this_iteration` is true, repeat the adjustment loop (step 8). Otherwise, exit the loop.\n9.  Create a new output grid of size HxW, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).\n10. Iterate through all rows `r` from `final_min_r` to `final_max_r`.\n11. Iterate through all columns `c` from `final_min_c` to `final_max_c`.\n12. If the current coordinate `(r, c)` is on the border of the final bounding box (i.e., if `r == final_min_r` or `r == final_max_r` or `c == final_min_c` or `c == final_max_c`), set the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` to the `key_color`.\n13.
