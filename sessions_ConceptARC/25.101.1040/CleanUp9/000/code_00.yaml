task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  background_color: 0 # white

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Contains pixels of various colors (1-9) on a white background (0).
  - type: object_set
    description: Implicit objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
  - type: color_frequency
    description: Each non-white color appears a certain number of times.

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Contains a hollow rectangular frame of a single color on a white background.
  - type: object
    name: frame
    description: A hollow rectangle defined by a top-left and bottom-right corner.
    properties:
      color: The single color used for the frame.
      border_pixels: Pixels forming the perimeter of the rectangle.
      interior_pixels: Pixels inside the frame (all white).
      exterior_pixels: Pixels outside the frame (all white).

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_key_color
    input: input_grid
    output: key_color
    rule: Find the non-white color (1-9) with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, select the color with the lowest numerical value.
  - step: 2
    action: find_key_pixels
    input: input_grid, key_color
    output: key_pixel_locations
    rule: Identify the coordinates of all pixels in the input grid that have the key_color.
  - step: 3
    action: calculate_initial_bounding_box
    input: key_pixel_locations
    output: initial_bbox (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
    rule: Determine the smallest rectangle enclosing all key_pixel_locations.
  - step: 4
    action: adjust_bounding_box
    input: initial_bbox, key_pixel_locations
    output: final_bbox (final_min_row, final_min_col, final_max_row, final_max_col)
    rule: Iteratively check the count of key_color pixels on each of the four borders (top, bottom, left, right) of the current bounding box. If a border contains exactly one key_color pixel, shrink the box by moving that border inwards by one step. Repeat this check until no border shrinks in a full iteration.
  - step: 5
    action: create_output_grid
    input: final_bbox, key_color, input_grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid
    rule: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0). Draw the hollow rectangular frame defined by final_bbox using the key_color.

relationships:
  - The output frame's color is determined by the most frequent non-white color in the input.
  - The output frame's position and size are derived from the bounding box of the key color pixels in the input, potentially adjusted by removing edges with only one key color pixel.
