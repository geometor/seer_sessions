"""
Identifies two parallel boundary lines (horizontal or vertical) and a single 'moving' pixel between them. 
The moving pixel is moved parallel to the boundaries, away from the closer boundary. 
The distance moved is half the distance (floor division) between the pixel and the farther boundary.
The original position of the moving pixel is set to the background color (assumed to be 0).
