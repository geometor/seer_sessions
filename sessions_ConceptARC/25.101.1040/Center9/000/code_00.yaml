Grid:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  contains:
    - Boundary Lines
    - Moving Pixel
Boundary Lines:
  count: 2
  property: parallel (either horizontal or vertical)
  color: uniform, non-background color (e.g., magenta, green, azure, yellow)
  function: define a channel for movement
Moving Pixel:
  count: 1
  color: distinct from background and boundary lines (e.g., azure, orange, yellow, magenta)
  location: initially located between the boundary lines
Action:
  type: Move
  target: Moving Pixel
  constraints:
    - Movement is parallel to boundary lines.
    - Movement occurs within the channel defined by boundary lines.
  rule:
    - Determine the boundary line closer to the Moving Pixel (b_close).
    - Determine the boundary line farther from the Moving Pixel (b_far).
    - Calculate distance_to_far = distance between Moving Pixel and b_far along the axis perpendicular to the boundaries.
    - Calculate movement_steps = floor(distance_to_far / 2).
    - Move the Moving Pixel movement_steps away from b_close (towards b_far).
Result:
  - The input grid is modified.
  - The Moving Pixel's original position becomes the background color.
  - The Moving Pixel appears at its new calculated position.
  - Boundary Lines and other background pixels remain unchanged.
