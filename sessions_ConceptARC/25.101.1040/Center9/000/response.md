**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels, typically with a white background (color 0).
2.  **Boundary Objects:** Each grid contains two parallel lines (either horizontal or vertical) of a single, non-background color. These lines act as boundaries defining a channel or corridor.
3.  **Moving Object:** Within the channel defined by the boundary lines, there is a single pixel of a third distinct color. This pixel represents an object that changes its position between the input and output.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement of the single colored pixel within the boundaries. The background and boundary lines remain unchanged.
5.  **Movement Rule:**
    *   The movement is constrained to be parallel to the boundary lines (vertical movement for horizontal lines, horizontal movement for vertical lines).
    *   The direction of movement is *away* from the boundary line that the pixel is initially closest to.
    *   The distance of the movement is calculated based on the pixel's position relative to the *farther* boundary. Specifically, it is the floor of half the distance between the pixel and the farther boundary line.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  contains:
    - Boundary Lines
    - Moving Pixel
Boundary Lines:
  count: 2
  property: parallel (either horizontal or vertical)
  color: uniform, non-background color (e.g., magenta, green, azure, yellow)
  function: define a channel for movement
Moving Pixel:
  count: 1
  color: distinct from background and boundary lines (e.g., azure, orange, yellow, magenta)
  location: initially located between the boundary lines
Action:
  type: Move
  target: Moving Pixel
  constraints:
    - Movement is parallel to boundary lines.
    - Movement occurs within the channel defined by boundary lines.
  rule:
    - Determine the boundary line closer to the Moving Pixel (b_close).
    - Determine the boundary line farther from the Moving Pixel (b_far).
    - Calculate distance_to_far = distance between Moving Pixel and b_far along the axis perpendicular to the boundaries.
    - Calculate movement_steps = floor(distance_to_far / 2).
    - Move the Moving Pixel movement_steps away from b_close (towards b_far).
Result:
  - The input grid is modified.
  - The Moving Pixel's original position becomes the background color.
  - The Moving Pixel appears at its new calculated position.
  - Boundary Lines and other background pixels remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color (typically white/0).
3.  Scan the grid to find two parallel lines of the same non-background color. These are the boundary lines. Determine if they are horizontal or vertical and record their row/column indices.
4.  Scan the grid to find the single pixel whose color is different from both the background and the boundary lines. This is the 'moving pixel'. Record its color and its initial coordinates (row `r`, column `c`).
5.  If the boundary lines are horizontal (at rows `bound1` and `bound2`):
    a.  Determine which boundary row is closer to the pixel's row `r`. Let this be `b_close` and the other be `b_far`.
    b.  Calculate the vertical distance to the farther boundary: `dist_far = abs(b_far - r)`.
    c.  Calculate the number of steps to move: `steps = floor(dist_far / 2)`.
    d.  Determine the direction: If `r` is closer to the upper boundary (`b_close < r`), move `steps` down. If `r` is closer to the lower boundary (`b_close > r`), move `steps` up.
    e.  Calculate the new row: `r_new`. If moving down, `r_new = r + steps`. If moving up, `r_new = r - steps`. The column `c` remains unchanged (`c_new = c`).
6.  If the boundary lines are vertical (at columns `bound1` and `bound2`):
    a.  Determine which boundary column is closer to the pixel's column `c`. Let this be `b_close` and the other be `b_far`.
    b.  Calculate the horizontal distance to the farther boundary: `dist_far = abs(b_far - c)`.
    c.  Calculate the number of steps to move: `steps = floor(dist_far / 2)`.
    d.  Determine the direction: If `c` is closer to the left boundary (`b_close < c`), move `steps` right. If `c` is closer to the right boundary (`b_close > c`), move `steps` left.
    e.  Calculate the new column: `c_new`. If moving right, `c_new = c + steps`. If moving left, `c_new = c - steps`. The row `r` remains unchanged (`r_new = r`).
7.  Update the output grid: Set the pixel at the original coordinates (`r`, `c`) to the background color. Set the pixel at the new coordinates (`r_new`, `c_new`) to the color of the moving pixel.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
