            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid containing white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The transformation operates independently on each row. For rows containing magenta pixels, the pixels are moved horizontally to the left. The number of magenta pixels in each row remains the same in the output. The final horizontal positions depend on the initial column indices of the magenta pixels in that row.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Color Preservation**: Only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels are present. The output grid contains the same colors.\n2.  **Row Independence**: The transformation seems to be applied to each row separately. The content of one row does not affect the output of another row, except potentially for establishing a global context or mapping (which was explored but seemed less likely).\n3.  **Pixel Count Preservation**: The number of magenta pixels in any given row of the input is the same as the number of magenta pixels in the corresponding row of the output.\n4.  **Horizontal Shift**: Magenta pixels are shifted towards the left (column index decreases).\n5.  **Compaction/Mapping**: The core logic involves mapping the set of input column indices for magenta pixels in a row to a new set of output column indices for that row.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation Rule:**\n\nSeveral hypotheses were tested:\n*   Simple left shift until column 0: Failed (relative positions not preserved).\n*   Gravity simulation (pixels stop at edge or other pixels): Failed (didn't match example train_1 row 9).\n*   Mapping based on global column rank: Failed.\n*   Mapping based on rank of `min_col` for the row: Failed.\n*   Mapping based on local rank (index in sorted list of columns for the row): This seemed promising and worked for many cases (Rows 5, 8 in train_1; all rows in train_2). The hypothesis is: for a row with input columns `C_in`, find the unique sorted columns `U_in`, create a map `M` where `U_in[i]` maps to `i`, and the output columns are `{M[c] for c in C_in}`.\n*   Special Case Handling: The simple local rank mapping failed for input `{7}` (output `{1}` instead of `{0}`) and input `{6, 8}` (output `{0, 3}` instead of `{0, 1}`). Adjusting the rule for these specific cases seems necessary but finding a general principle covering them was difficult.\n\nThe most consistent rule found, despite not perfectly matching all examples, is based on mapping the rank within the row, with a specific adjustment for the single-pixel case of `{7}`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
