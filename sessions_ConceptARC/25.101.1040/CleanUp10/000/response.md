**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid containing red (2) and white (0) pixels. The transformation identifies specific structures within the input grid â€“ rows and columns that are completely filled with red pixels. The output grid is constructed by highlighting these identified rows and columns in red against a white background. All other pixels from the input that are not part of a completely red row or a completely red column are turned white in the output. The size of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - colors_used: [red (2), white (0)]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: (red or white)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: row
    attributes:
      - index: (integer)
      - pixels: (list of pixels)
      - state: (can be 'fully red' or 'mixed')
  - type: column
    attributes:
      - index: (integer)
      - pixels: (list of pixels)
      - state: (can be 'fully red' or 'mixed')
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: rows
    condition: all pixels in the row are red (2)
    result: mark row as 'fully red'
  - action: identify
    target: columns
    condition: all pixels in the column are red (2)
    result: mark column as 'fully red'
  - action: construct_output
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_state: all white (0) pixels
    steps:
      - For each row marked 'fully red' in the input, set the corresponding row in the output to all red (2) pixels.
      - For each column marked 'fully red' in the input, set the corresponding column in the output to all red (2) pixels.
      - Pixels not belonging to a 'fully red' row or 'fully red' column remain white (0).
output_relation:
  - The output grid is a representation of the union of all fully red rows and fully red columns found in the input grid, drawn on a white background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height and width as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Examine each row of the input grid. If a row consists solely of red (2) pixels, then fill the entire corresponding row in the output grid with red (2) pixels.
3.  Examine each column of the input grid. If a column consists solely of red (2) pixels, then fill the entire corresponding column in the output grid with red (2) pixels.
4.  The final state of the output grid is the result of the transformation.
