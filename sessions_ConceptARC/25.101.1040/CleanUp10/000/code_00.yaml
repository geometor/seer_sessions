task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - colors_used: [red (2), white (0)]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: (red or white)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: row
    attributes:
      - index: (integer)
      - pixels: (list of pixels)
      - state: (can be 'fully red' or 'mixed')
  - type: column
    attributes:
      - index: (integer)
      - pixels: (list of pixels)
      - state: (can be 'fully red' or 'mixed')
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: rows
    condition: all pixels in the row are red (2)
    result: mark row as 'fully red'
  - action: identify
    target: columns
    condition: all pixels in the column are red (2)
    result: mark column as 'fully red'
  - action: construct_output
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_state: all white (0) pixels
    steps:
      - For each row marked 'fully red' in the input, set the corresponding row in the output to all red (2) pixels.
      - For each column marked 'fully red' in the input, set the corresponding column in the output to all red (2) pixels.
      - Pixels not belonging to a 'fully red' row or 'fully red' column remain white (0).
output_relation:
  - The output grid is a representation of the union of all fully red rows and fully red columns found in the input grid, drawn on a white background.
