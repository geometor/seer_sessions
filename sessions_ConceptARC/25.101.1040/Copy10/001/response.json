Find all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same non-background color) using 4-way connectivity.\n2. Identify the unique 'container' object that fully encloses one or more 'contained' objects of different colors.\n   An object is considered fully enclosed if all its adjacent pixels (including diagonals, 8-way check) belong either to itself or to the container object, and it does not touch the grid boundary.\n3. Determine the set of all pixels belonging to the container and all objects it encloses. This constitutes the 'composite object'. Calculate its combined bounding box.\n4. Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).\n5. Draw the composite object onto the output grid at its original location using the colors from the input grid.\n6. Determine the placement for a copy:\n   - Calculate the bounding box dimensions (height, width) of the composite object.\n   - Define a gap of 1 pixel.\n   - Check if a copy fits entirely within the grid boundaries when placed to the right of the original with the gap (i.e., copy_start_col + copy_width <= grid_width).\n   - Check if a copy fits entirely within the grid boundaries when placed below the original with the gap (i.e., copy_start_row + copy_height <= grid_height).\n   - If it fits to the right, set the translation vector (dx, dy) for rightward placement (dx = original_width + gap, dy = 0).\n   - Otherwise, if it fits downwards, set the translation vector for downward placement (dx = 0, dy = original_height + gap).\n   - If it fits neither way, no copy is placed (dx=0, dy=0).\n7. If a valid placement (dx > 0 or dy > 0) was determined, draw a copy of the composite object at the translated position (original_pixel_pos + (dy, dx)) on the output grid, using the original colors.\n8. Return the resulting output grid as a list of lists.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray) -> list[dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of non-background pixels using 4-connectivity.\n    Each object stores its color, pixel coordinates (set), and bounding box.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if pixel is non-background and not yet visited\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_pixels = set()\n                # Use BFS (deque) for finding connected components\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                # Initialize bounding box coordinates\n                min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = r, c, r, c\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.add((row, col))\n                    # Update bounding box\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Explore 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check if neighbor is within bounds, has the same color, and not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Store the found object's properties\n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) # min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col\n                })\n    return objects\n\ndef is_fully_enclosed(container_obj: dict, contained_obj: dict, grid: np.ndarray) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if contained_obj is fully enclosed by container_obj using 8-way adjacency.\n    Returns False if contained_obj touches the grid boundary, has the same color as container,\n    or touches any pixel not belonging to the container or itself.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Basic checks: cannot contain itself or object of same color\n    if container_obj is contained_obj or container_obj['color'] == contained_obj['color']:\n        return False\n\n    container_pixels = container_obj['pixels']\n    contained_pixels = contained_obj['pixels']\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Check if contained object is non-empty\n    if not contained_pixels:\n        return False\n\n    for r, c in contained_pixels:\n        # Check if any pixel of the contained object is on the grid boundary\n        if r == 0 or r == height - 1 or c == 0 or c == width - 1:\n             return False # Cannot be fully enclosed if touching boundary\n\n        # Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue # Skip self\n\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                neighbor_pos = (nr, nc)\n\n                # Neighbor must be within bounds (implicitly true due to boundary check above)\n                # Check if neighbor belongs EITHER to the contained object OR the container object\n                if neighbor_pos not in contained_pixels and neighbor_pos not in container_pixels:\n                    # Found a neighbor that is not part of the container or contained object\n                    # This means it touches background or another object.\n                    return False\n\n    # If all checks passed for all pixels, the object is fully enclosed.\n    return True\n\n\ndef get_composite_object_pixels(objects: list[dict], grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[set | None, tuple | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the unique container object and collects all pixels from it\n    and all objects it fully encloses.
