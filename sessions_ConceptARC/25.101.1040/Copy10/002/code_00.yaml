Task: Duplicate_Enclosed_Object

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Contiguous regions of non-white pixels, identified using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).
    - Properties: color, pixel coordinates (set), bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
  - Relationships:
    - Enclosure: A 'Container' object fully encloses one or more 'Contained' objects.
      - Definition: A Contained object is fully enclosed if:
          - It has a different color than the Container.
          - It does not touch the grid boundary.
          - Every pixel adjacent (8-way) to any Contained object pixel is either part of the Contained object itself or part of the Container object.

Identified_Structures:
  - Container_Object: The unique object identified as enclosing others based on the Enclosure definition.
  - Contained_Object(s): The object(s) identified as being fully enclosed by the Container_Object.
  - Composite_Object: The union of the Container_Object's pixels and all its Contained_Object(s)' pixels.
    - Properties: Combined pixel set, combined bounding box.
  - Isolated_Objects: All other objects in the input grid that are not part of the identified Composite_Object.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Find all distinct objects using 8-way connectivity.
  - Action: Identify the unique Composite_Object (Container + Contained).
  - Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to the background color (white, 0).
  - Action: Draw the identified Composite_Object onto the output grid at its original position.
  - Action: Calculate the composite object's bounding box dimensions (comp_h, comp_w).
  - Action: Determine placement for a copy:
    - Calculate potential top-left position if placed right: `(min_r, min_c + comp_w + 2)`
    - Calculate potential top-left position if placed down: `(min_r + comp_h + 1, min_c)`
    - Check if a copy fits entirely within grid boundaries if placed right (using translation `dx = comp_w + 2`, `dy = 0`).
    - Check if a copy fits entirely within grid boundaries if placed down (using translation `dx = 0`, `dy = comp_h + 1`).
    - Priority: If fits right, choose right placement. Else if fits down, choose down placement. Otherwise, place no copy.
  - Action: If a placement is chosen, draw a translated copy of the Composite_Object onto the output grid.
  - Implicit_Action: Discard all Isolated_Objects.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Contains the original Composite_Object and potentially one translated copy, with all other areas set to the background color.
