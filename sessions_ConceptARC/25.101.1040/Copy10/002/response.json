            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of finding a composite object (container + contained) and duplicating it. However, the implementation failed, resulting in blank outputs. This strongly suggests a failure in the `get_composite_object_pixels` function, likely stemming from the `is_fully_enclosed` check not correctly identifying the container-contained relationship as expected, or possibly an issue in `find_objects`. The duplication logic also needs refinement, specifically the translation distance (gap), which appears inconsistent between examples in the initial analysis (gap=1 vs gap=2) but might follow a pattern related to object dimensions (+2 horizontally, +1 vertically).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Object Identification:** Use `tool_code` to execute the `find_objects` function on both training inputs to confirm it correctly identifies the distinct objects (container, contained, isolated).\n2.  **Verify Enclosure Logic:** Use `tool_code` to test the `is_fully_enclosed` function with the objects identified in step 1 for both examples. Pinpoint why it might be failing to recognize the enclosure.\n3.  **Refine Duplication Logic:** Based on the examples, revise the translation rule. Instead of a fixed gap, the translation distance seems to be `dimension + 2` for horizontal copies and `dimension + 1` for vertical copies. The directional choice (right vs. down) seems based on available space, prioritizing right.\n4.  **Update YAML and NLP:** Refine the documentation and natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding of object identification, enclosure rules, and duplication/translation logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"

This is because it uses 4-way connectivity, and the yellow \"diamond\" shape has pixels connected only diagonally at the corners. This breaks it into many single-pixel objects. The 4-way connectivity is insufficient for diagonally connected shapes common in ARC.\n2.  **`is_fully_enclosed` Failure:** Because `find_objects` failed to identify the correct container object shape in Example 2, the `is_fully_enclosed` function cannot possibly work as intended. Even in Example 1, where `find_objects` *seems* correct with 4-way connectivity (identifying the green frame, inner red, outer red), the `is_fully_enclosed` check still fails to identify the relationship, resulting in \"Composite Object: Not found\". This suggests a potential subtle bug in the `is_fully_enclosed` logic itself, perhaps in how it accesses neighbor coordinates or compares pixel sets.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix `find_objects`:** Modify `find_objects` to use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) to correctly identify contiguous objects, especially those connected diagonally.\n2.  **Re-evaluate `is_fully_enclosed`:** After fixing `find_objects`, re-run the analysis. If `is_fully_enclosed` still fails, debug its logic step-by-step, focusing on neighbor checks and set comparisons.\n3.  **Confirm Translation Rule:** Once the composite object is correctly identified, verify the translation rule: `dx = width + 2` (horizontal) and `dy = height + 1` (vertical).\n4.  **Update YAML and NLP:** Document the need for 8-way connectivity and the refined translation rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
