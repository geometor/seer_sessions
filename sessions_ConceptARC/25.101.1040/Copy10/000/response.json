The key elements appear to be:\n1.  **Objects:** Distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.\n2.  **Relationships:** A spatial relationship where one object (container) fully encloses another object (contained) of a different color.\n3.  **Composite Objects:** The combination of a container object and the object(s) it contains.\n4.  **Other Objects:** Objects that are neither containers nor contained within the identified primary composite structure.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be selecting the primary composite object, removing all other objects, and then duplicating the composite object within the grid boundaries.\n6.  **Placement:** The duplicated object is placed adjacent to the original, either horizontally or vertically, with a small gap. The specific direction and gap size appear context-dependent based on the examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the unique \"composite object\" which consists of a \"container\" object (whose pixels fully enclose pixels of another object) and the \"contained\" object(s) (the object(s) fully enclosed by the container, having a different color).\n3.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  Copy the pixels belonging to the identified composite object (both container and contained parts) from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original coordinates.\n5.  Determine the optimal direction (e.g., right or down) and distance (including a small gap, observed as 1 or 2 pixels) to place a duplicate of the composite object, likely based on the available space within the grid boundaries relative to the original composite object's position and size.\n6.  Create a translated copy of the composite object's pixels and draw them onto the output grid at the location determined in the previous step. Ensure the copy remains within the grid boundaries. Any objects present in the input grid that are not part of the selected composite object are not included in the output."
