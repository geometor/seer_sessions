Task: Duplicate Composite Object

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Objects:
    - Contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
    - Properties: color, pixel coordinates, bounding box.
  - Relationships:
    - Containment: One object's pixels fully surround the pixels of another object of a different color.

Identified_Structures:
  - Container_Object: An object that fully encloses at least one other object of a different color.
  - Contained_Object(s): Object(s) fully enclosed by the Container_Object.
  - Composite_Object: The union of the Container_Object and its Contained_Object(s).
  - Isolated_Objects: Objects that are not part of the identified Composite_Object.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Identify the primary Composite_Object.
  - Action: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to the background color (0).
  - Action: Draw the identified Composite_Object onto the new grid at its original position.
  - Action: Determine placement (direction and gap) for a copy based on context (e.g., available space in the grid).
    - Example 1 shows horizontal placement (right) with a gap of 2 pixels.
    - Example 2 shows vertical placement (down) with a gap of 1 pixel.
  - Action: Draw a copy of the Composite_Object onto the new grid at the determined translated position.
  - Implicit_Action: Discard all Isolated_Objects from the input.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Contains the original Composite_Object and one translated copy, with all other areas set to the background color.
