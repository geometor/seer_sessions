            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The output grid size differs from the input grid size in all examples. The output grid is always monochromatic (filled with a single color).\n2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain multiple colors (including white/background), while the outputs contain only one non-background color, filling the entire grid.\n3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct contiguous shapes (objects) made of single colors, set against a white background or adjacent to other colored objects.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to involve selecting a specific color from the input based on certain criteria related to the objects formed by that color, and then creating an output grid whose size is determined by the spatial extent of that selected color's pixels, filled entirely with that color.\n\n**Observations across examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input has green, red, and blue objects. There are two distinct green objects, one red object, and one blue object. Green has the most distinct objects (2). The output is entirely green. The bounding box containing all green pixels in the input is 6 rows high and 2 columns wide (from row 0, col 2 to row 5, col 3). The output is a 6x2 green grid.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has magenta, yellow, and orange objects. There are two distinct magenta objects, one yellow object, and one orange object. Magenta has the most distinct objects (2). The output is entirely magenta. The bounding box containing all magenta pixels is 3 rows high and 5 columns wide (from row 1, col 1 to row 3, col 5). The output is a 3x5 magenta grid.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has orange, azure, and red objects. There is one object of each color (orange=1, azure=1, red=1). This is a tie for the maximum number of objects (1). We need a tie-breaker. Let's look at the bounding box enclosing all pixels of each tied color:\n    *   Orange: Bounding box from (1,1) to (3,5) -> Height 3, Width 5, Area 15.\n    *   Azure: Bounding box from (2,2) to (4,4) -> Height 3, Width 3, Area 9.\n    *   Red: Bounding box from (3,0) to (5,2) -> Height 3, Width 3, Area 9.\n    Orange has the largest bounding box area (15). The output is entirely orange. The dimensions of the orange bounding box (3x5) match the output grid size.\n\n**Derived Rule:** The transformation selects a color based first on which color forms the maximum number of distinct contiguous objects. If there's a tie in the number of objects, the tie is broken by choosing the color whose pixels, taken together, span the bounding box with the largest area (height * width). The output grid's dimensions are determined by the height and width of the bounding box enclosing all pixels of the finally selected color, and the grid is filled with that color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
