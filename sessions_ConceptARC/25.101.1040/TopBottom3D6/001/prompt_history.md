Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** All inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The output grid size differs from the input grid size in all examples. The output grid is always monochromatic (filled with a single color).
2.  **Colors:** The inputs contain multiple colors (including white/background), while the outputs contain only one non-background color, filling the entire grid.
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct contiguous shapes (objects) made of single colors, set against a white background or adjacent to other colored objects.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to involve selecting a specific color from the input based on certain criteria related to the objects formed by that color, and then creating an output grid whose size is determined by the spatial extent of that selected color's pixels, filled entirely with that color.

**Observations across examples:**

*   **Example 1:** Input has green, red, and blue objects. There are two distinct green objects, one red object, and one blue object. Green has the most distinct objects (2). The output is entirely green. The bounding box containing all green pixels in the input is 6 rows high and 2 columns wide (from row 0, col 2 to row 5, col 3). The output is a 6x2 green grid.
*   **Example 2:** Input has magenta, yellow, and orange objects. There are two distinct magenta objects, one yellow object, and one orange object. Magenta has the most distinct objects (2). The output is entirely magenta. The bounding box containing all magenta pixels is 3 rows high and 5 columns wide (from row 1, col 1 to row 3, col 5). The output is a 3x5 magenta grid.
*   **Example 3:** Input has orange, azure, and red objects. There is one object of each color (orange=1, azure=1, red=1). This is a tie for the maximum number of objects (1). We need a tie-breaker. Let's look at the bounding box enclosing all pixels of each tied color:
    *   Orange: Bounding box from (1,1) to (3,5) -> Height 3, Width 5, Area 15.
    *   Azure: Bounding box from (2,2) to (4,4) -> Height 3, Width 3, Area 9.
    *   Red: Bounding box from (3,0) to (5,2) -> Height 3, Width 3, Area 9.
    Orange has the largest bounding box area (15). The output is entirely orange. The dimensions of the orange bounding box (3x5) match the output grid size.

**Derived Rule:** The transformation selects a color based first on which color forms the maximum number of distinct contiguous objects. If there's a tie in the number of objects, the tie is broken by choosing the color whose pixels, taken together, span the bounding box with the largest area (height * width). The output grid's dimensions are determined by the height and width of the bounding box enclosing all pixels of the finally selected color, and the grid is filled with that color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Select a color based on object count and bounding box properties, then create a monochromatic grid based on the selected color's spatial extent.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background (non-white) color. Adjacency includes diagonals.
  - bounding_box(color): The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a specific color.
  - area(bounding_box): Height * Width of the bounding_box.

selection_criteria:
  - primary: The color forming the maximum number of distinct objects.
  - tie_breaker: If multiple colors tie for the maximum number of objects, select the color whose bounding_box has the largest area.

output_generation:
  - color: The color selected based on the criteria.
  - dimensions: The height and width of the bounding_box of the selected color.
  - content: A grid of the determined dimensions, filled entirely with the selected color.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each unique non-background color:
    a.  Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of that color (using 8-way adjacency).
    b.  Count the number of these distinct objects.
3.  Determine the maximum object count found across all colors.
4.  Create a list of candidate colors that have this maximum object count.
5.  If the list of candidate colors contains only one color, this is the selected color.
6.  If the list contains multiple candidate colors (due to a tie in object count):
    a.  For each candidate color, find the minimum bounding box that encloses *all* pixels of that color in the input grid.
    b.  Calculate the area (height * width) of each candidate color's bounding box.
    c.  The selected color is the candidate color whose bounding box has the largest area. (Assume ties in area do not occur or handle based on a secondary rule like lowest color index if necessary, though not observed here).
7.  Once the single final color is selected (either from step 5 or step 6), determine the minimum bounding box enclosing all pixels of this selected color in the input grid.
8.  Create a new output grid with dimensions equal to the height and width of this final bounding box.
9.  Fill the entire output grid with the selected color.
