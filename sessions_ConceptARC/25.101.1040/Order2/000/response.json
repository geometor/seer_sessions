            "text": "## Perception\nThe user has provided two training examples for an ARC task.\nEach example consists of an input grid and an output grid.\nThe grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, where 0 (white) is the background color.\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  **Color Conservation:** In both examples, the output grid contains only one non-background color. This color is the same as the single non-background color present in the input grid. The total count of these non-background pixels remains the same between the input and the output.\n2.  **Shape Transformation:** The scattered non-background pixels from the input are rearranged into a single connected shape in the output grid.\n3.  **Output Location:** The generated shape is always located in the bottom-left corner of the grid.\n4.  **Two Different Shapes:** The shape generated in the output differs between the two examples.\n    *   Example 1 (Input N=10 yellow pixels): The output is a right-angled triangle, 4 pixels high and 4 pixels wide, containing exactly 10 pixels. The right angle is at the top-left of the shape's bounding box, (row 6, col 3) if we use the grid coords, but visually it's oriented with the hypotenuse from bottom-left to top-right. Specifically, pixels (r, c) are filled if `r >= 6`, `c <= 3`, and `r + c >= 9`.\n    *   Example 2 (Input N=13 magenta pixels): The output shape is different. It appears to be constructed by filling pixels column by column from left to right, and within each column, filling from bottom to top, until N pixels are placed.\n5.  **Condition for Shape:** The number of pixels N in Example 1 is 10, which is a triangular number (1+2+3+4 = 10). The number of pixels N in Example 2 is 13, which is not a triangular number. This suggests the transformation rule depends on whether the count N of the non-background pixels is a triangular number.\n\n**Hypothesized Rule:**\n1.  Find the single non-background color (C) and count its occurrences (N).\n2.  Check if N is a triangular number (i.e., if 8*N + 1 is a perfect square).\n3.  If N is triangular, construct a specific right-angled triangle shape (like in Example 1) using N pixels of color C in the bottom-left of the output grid. The height H of this triangle is determined by N = H*(H+1)/2. The pixels (r, c) satisfy `r >= max_r - H + 1`, `c <= H - 1`, and `r + c >= max_r`.\n4.  If N is not triangular, construct the shape by filling pixels with color C column by column (left to right), bottom to top within each column, starting from the bottom-left of the grid, until exactly N pixels have been placed.\n\n## Facts\n"

Find the single non-background color present in the input grid. Call this color `C`.\n    c.  Count the total number of pixels `N` that have color `C`.\n    d.  Get the dimensions of the input grid (height `H_grid`, width `W_grid`). Let `max_r = H_grid - 1` and `max_c = W_grid - 1`.\n\n2.  **Prepare Output:** Create a new grid of size `H_grid` x `W_grid`, filled entirely with the background color (0).\n\n3.  **Check Triangular Condition:** Determine if `N` is a triangular number. This can be done by checking if `8 * N + 1` is a perfect square.\n\n4.  **Generate Output Shape:**\n    a.  **If `N` is a triangular number:**\n        i.  Calculate the triangle height `H_tri = (sqrt(8 * N + 1) - 1) / 2`.\n        ii. Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` in the output grid.\n        iii. If a pixel's coordinates `(r, c)` satisfy all three conditions:\n            1.  `r >= max_r - H_tri + 1`\n            2.  `c <= H_tri - 1`\n            3.  `r + c >= max_r`\n            Then set the color of pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `C`.\n    b.  **If `N` is not a triangular number:**\n        i.  Initialize a counter `placed_pixels = 0`.\n        ii. Iterate through columns `c` from 0 to `max_c`.\n        iii. For each column `c`, iterate through rows `r` from `max_r` down to 0.\n        iv. If `placed_pixels < N`:\n            1. Set the color of pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `C`.\n            2. Increment `placed_pixels`.\n            3. If `placed_pixels` is now equal to `N`, stop placing pixels (exit both row and column loops).\n        v. If `placed_pixels` was already equal to `N` when checking, stop iterating through rows for the current column and proceed to the next column (or finish if this was the last necessary column).\n\n5.  **Finalize:** Return the generated output grid."
