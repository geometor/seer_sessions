task_type: pixel_rearrangement_conditional_shape
background_color: 0 # white
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - color_preservation: The single non-background color from the input is used in the output.
  - count_preservation: The total count 'N' of non-background pixels is preserved.
object_description:
  - type: single_color_pixels
    input_state: scattered
    output_state: consolidated_shape
    output_location: bottom_left_corner
transformation_rule:
  - condition: Check if the count 'N' of non-background pixels is a triangular number T(H) = H*(H+1)/2.
  - case_triangular (N == T(H)):
      action: form_specific_right_triangle
      details: Construct a right-angled triangle T(H) with height H. The filled pixels (r, c) relative to the grid (height H_grid, width W_grid) satisfy r >= H_grid - H, c <= H - 1, and r + c >= H_grid - 1.
      example: train_1 (N=10, H=4)
  - case_non_triangular (T(H-1) < N < T(H)):
      action: form_partial_right_triangle
      details:
        1. Find the smallest integer H such that T(H) >= N.
        2. Generate the set P of pixels for the full triangle T(H) using the conditions: r >= H_grid - H, c <= H - 1, r + c >= H_grid - 1.
        3. Calculate the number of pixels to remove: R = T(H) - N.
        4. Identify the R pixels in P that should be removed. [Precise removal criteria determined from Example 2 to be removing (5,3) and (6,2) from T(5) when N=13]. These pixels are the ones with the smallest column index `c` among all pixels in T(H) *not* located on the bottom row (r=H_grid-1) or the rightmost column (c=H-1). (Hypothesis needs verification if more examples were available).
        5. The final shape consists of pixels in P excluding the R removed pixels.
      example: train_2 (N=13, H=5, R=2, Removed={(5,3), (6,2)})
