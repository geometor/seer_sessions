task_type: pixel_rearrangement_conditional_shape
background_color: 0 # white
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - color_preservation: The single non-background color from the input is used in the output.
  - count_preservation: The total count of non-background pixels is preserved.
object_description:
  - type: single_color_pixels
    input_state: scattered
    output_state: consolidated_shape
    output_location: bottom_left_corner
transformation_rule:
  - condition: Check if the count 'N' of non-background pixels is a triangular number.
  - case_triangular:
      action: form_specific_right_triangle
      details: Construct a right-angled triangle with height H such that N = H*(H+1)/2. The filled pixels (r, c) relative to the grid (height H_grid, width W_grid) satisfy r >= H_grid - H, c <= H - 1, and r + c >= H_grid - 1.
      example: train_1 (N=10, H=4)
  - case_non_triangular:
      action: form_bottom_up_row_filled_shape
      details: Fill pixels starting from the bottom row (r=H_grid-1), moving left-to-right (c=0 to W_grid-1). Proceed to the next row up (r=H_grid-2) and fill left-to-right, continuing until exactly N pixels have been filled.
      example: train_2 (N=13)
