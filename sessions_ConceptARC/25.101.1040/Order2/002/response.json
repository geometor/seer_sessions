            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: rearranging scattered pixels of a single non-background color into a consolidated shape in the bottom-left corner. The distinction based on whether the pixel count `N` is a triangular number was also correct.\n\nThe code successfully implemented the logic for the triangular case (Example 1). However, the implementation for the non-triangular case (Example 2) did not match the expected output. The code filled columns completely from bottom to top, starting from the left, resulting in a shape concentrated in the top-left columns. The expected output shows a different shape, also in the bottom-left, which appears to be constructed by filling rows from bottom to top, left to right, until `N` pixels are placed.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the description and subsequent implementation for the non-triangular case to match the observed pattern in Example 2.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe can confirm the counts and shapes using code.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 10x11\n*   Non-background Color: 4 (yellow)\n*   Pixel Count (N): 10\n*   Is N triangular? Yes (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)\n*   Expected Output Shape: Right-angled triangle (H=4) in bottom-left.\n*   Code Output Shape: Matched expected.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 9x10\n*   Non-background Color: 6 (magenta)\n*   Pixel Count (N): 13\n*   Is N triangular? No (8*13 + 1 = 105, not a perfect square)\n*   Expected Output Shape: A shape built by filling rows from bottom-to-top, left-to-right in the bottom-left corner until 13 pixels are placed.\n    *   Row 8 (bottom): Pixels (8,0) to (8,4) - 5 pixels\n    *   Row 7: Pixels (7,1) to (7,4) - 4 pixels (Total: 9)\n    *   Row 6: Pixels (6,2) to (6,3) - 2 pixels (Total: 11)\n    *   Row 5: Pixel (5,4) - 1 pixel (Total: 12)\n    *   Row 4: Pixel (4,4) - 1 pixel (Total: 13)\n*   Code Output Shape: A shape built by filling columns from bottom-to-top, left-to-right until 13 pixels are placed.\n    *   Column 0: Pixels (8,0) to (0,0) - 9 pixels\n    *   Column 1: Pixels (8,1) to (5,1) - 4 pixels (Total: 13)\n*   Result: The code's implementation for the non-triangular case was incorrect based on the expected output pattern.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
