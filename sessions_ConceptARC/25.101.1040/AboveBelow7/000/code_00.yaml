task_context:
  description: Swaps the vertical positions of two distinct non-background objects where one is directly above the other.
  grid_properties:
    background_color: 0 # white
    max_colors: 3 # background + 2 objects

input_elements:
  - element_type: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: non-zero
      - contiguity: contiguous pixels of the same color
      - relative_position: One object is strictly above the other (no row overlap).
      - name: upper_object
      - name: lower_object

output_elements:
  - element_type: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: same as corresponding input objects
      - shape: same as corresponding input objects
      - contiguity: same as corresponding input objects
      - relative_position: The original lower_object is now above the original upper_object.
      - name: new_upper_object (originally lower_object)
      - name: new_lower_object (originally upper_object)

transformation:
  action: vertical_swap
  details:
    - Identify the two distinct non-white objects.
    - Determine which object is 'upper' and which is 'lower' based on row indices.
    - Calculate the vertical gap between the bottom row of the upper object and the top row of the lower object.
    - In the output grid:
        - Place the original 'lower' object at its original coordinates.
        - Place the original 'upper' object below the (now positioned) original 'lower' object, preserving the original vertical gap between them.
  preserves:
    - Object shape and color.
    - Object internal structure.
    - Relative horizontal positioning.
    - Vertical gap between objects.
