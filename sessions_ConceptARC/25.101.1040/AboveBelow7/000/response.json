The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** In each example pair, the input grid contains exactly two distinct, contiguous, non-white colored objects.\n    *   `train_1`: A solid yellow (4) rectangle and a hollow green (3) rectangle (frame).\n    *   `train_2`: An irregular azure (8) shape and a hollow red (2) rectangle (frame).\n3.  **Spatial Relationship (Input):** In both examples, one object is located entirely above the other object. There is no horizontal overlap, and in these specific examples, there is no vertical gap between their bounding boxes.\n    *   `train_1`: Yellow object is above the Green object.\n    *   `train_2`: Azure object is above the Red object.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a vertical swap of the two objects. The object that was originally lower remains in its original vertical position, while the object that was originally upper is moved below it.\n5.  **Properties Preservation:** The shape, color, and internal structure of each object remain unchanged during the transformation. The relative horizontal positions also seem preserved. The vertical gap (if any) between the objects is also preserved after the swap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
