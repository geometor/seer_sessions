Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency.\n2.  For each identified object, determine its color, height, and width.\n3.  Count the total number of identified objects (N).\n4.  Determine the set of unique colors present across all objects and count them (C).\n5.  Find the maximum height (MaxH) among all identified objects.\n6.  If N is equal to C:\n    a.  Search for an object where its height value is numerically equal to its color value.\n    b.  If such an object is found, set the output grid's height and width to be the height and width of this specific object.\n    c.  If no such object is found, calculate the output dimensions as MaxH by max(0, C - 1).\n7.  If N is not equal to C:\n    a.  Set the output grid's height to MaxH.\n    b.  Set the output grid's width to max(0, C - 1).\n8.  Create the output grid using the determined height and width, filling all its cells with the white color (0).\n\nNote: This logic was derived from examples 1 and 2, but it fails to produce the correct output for example 3, suggesting the rules are incomplete or incorrect.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_objects(grid: np.ndarray) -> list[dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-white colors in the grid using Breadth-First Search (4-way adjacency).\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n        and contains its color, pixels (list of tuples), bounding box coordinates\n        (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), height, and width.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if the cell is non-white and not yet visited\n            if color != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n\n                # Perform BFS to find all connected pixels of the same color\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    obj_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    # Update bounding box coordinates\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Check neighbors (4-directional adjacency)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds, color match, and visited status\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Calculate height and width from bounding box\n                height = max_r - min_r + 1\n                width = max_c - min_c + 1\n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'min_r': min_r, 'max_r': max_r,\n                    'min_c': min_c, 'max_c': max_c,\n                    'height': height,\n                    'width': width\n                })\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid into an all-white grid whose dimensions\n    are determined by the rules based on object counts (N), unique color counts (C),\n    maximum object height (MaxH), and a special condition where N==C and an\n    object's height equals its color.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # 1.
