"""
Determines the dimensions of an all-white output grid based on properties of objects in the input grid.
The core logic compares the number of distinct objects (N) to the number of unique non-white colors (C).

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency.
2.  For each identified object, determine its color, height, and width.
3.  Count the total number of identified objects (N).
4.  Determine the set of unique colors present across all objects and count them (C).
5.  Find the maximum height (MaxH) among all identified objects.
6.  If N is equal to C:
    a.  Search for an object where its height value is numerically equal to its color value.
    b.  If such an object is found, set the output grid's height and width to be the height and width of this specific object.
    c.  If no such object is found, calculate the output dimensions as MaxH by max(0, C - 1).
7.  If N is not equal to C:
    a.  Set the output grid's height to MaxH.
    b.  Set the output grid's width to max(0, C - 1).
8.  Create the output grid using the determined height and width, filling all its cells with the white color (0).

Note: This logic was derived from examples 1 and 2, but it fails to produce the correct output for example 3, suggesting the rules are incomplete or incorrect.
