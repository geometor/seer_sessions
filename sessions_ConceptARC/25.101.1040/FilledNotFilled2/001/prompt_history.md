*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) composed of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
    *   The objects have different colors, shapes, sizes (heights and widths), and positions.
    *   The output grid is always composed entirely of white pixels.
    *   The size (dimensions) of the output grid varies between examples and appears to depend on properties derived from the objects in the input grid.

*   **YAML block documenting facts:**

*   **Natural language program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-white color in the input grid.
    2.  For each object, determine its height, width, and color value.
    3.  Count the total number of distinct objects found (N).
    4.  Count the number of unique non-white colors present across all objects (C).
    5.  Check if the number of objects (N) is equal to the number of unique colors (C).
    6.  **If N equals C:**
        a.  Search for an object where its color value is numerically equal to its height. (Assume there will be at most one such object relevant).
        b.  If such an object is found, the output grid's dimensions are the height and width of this specific object.
        c.  (Implicit fallback, though not needed for examples: If no such object is found, calculate MaxH (maximum height among all objects) and the output dimensions are MaxH by (C-1)).
    7.  **If N is not equal to C:**
        a.  Calculate MaxH, the maximum height among all identified objects.
        b.  The output grid's dimensions are MaxH by (C - 1).
    8.  Create the output grid with the determined height and width, filling all its pixels with the white color (0).
