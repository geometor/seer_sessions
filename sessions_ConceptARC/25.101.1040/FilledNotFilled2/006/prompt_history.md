*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) composed of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
    *   The objects have different colors, shapes, sizes (heights and widths), and positions.
    *   The output grid is always composed entirely of white pixels.
    *   The size (dimensions) of the output grid varies between examples and appears to depend on properties derived from the objects in the input grid.

*   **YAML block documenting facts:**

    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-white color in the input grid.
    2.  For each object, determine its height, width, and color value.
    3.  Count the total number of distinct objects found (N).
    4.  Count the number of unique non-white colors present across all objects (C).
    5.  Check if the number of objects (N) is equal to the number of unique colors (C).
    6.  **If N equals C:**
        a.  Search for an object where its color value is numerically equal to its height. (Assume there will be at most one such object relevant).
        b.  If such an object is found, the output grid's dimensions are the height and width of this specific object.
        c.  (Implicit fallback, though not needed for examples: If no such object is found, calculate MaxH (maximum height among all objects) and the output dimensions are MaxH by (C-1)).
    7.  **If N is not equal to C:**
        a.  Calculate MaxH, the maximum height among all identified objects.
        b.  The output grid's dimensions are MaxH by (C - 1).
    8.  Create the output grid with the determined height and width, filling all its pixels with the white color (0).

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis identified two potential rules for determining the output grid dimensions, contingent on whether the number of distinct objects (N) equals the number of unique non-white colors (C). The first rule (N == C) relies on finding an object whose height matches its color value. The second rule (N != C) uses the maximum object height and the number of unique colors minus one. The provided code implemented this logic.

    The execution results show that the code successfully passed `train_1` and `train_2`. However, the report indicates a failure for `train_3`, stating mismatches in size and color count, despite the transformed output visually matching the expected output (both are 5x3 white grids).

    **Strategy:**
    1.  Re-verify the analysis for `train_3`.
        *   Input `train_3` has 5 objects (Magenta C, Azure G, Yellow T, Red Bar1, Red Bar2). N = 5.
        *   Unique colors are Magenta (6), Azure (8), Yellow (4), Red (2). C = 4.
        *   Since N (5) != C (4), the rule is MaxH x (C-1).
        *   Heights are 3, 3, 4, 5, 5. MaxH = 5.
        *   Output dimensions = 5 x (4 - 1) = 5 x 3.
        *   Expected output is a 5x3 white grid.
        *   The code generated a 5x3 white grid.
    2.  Conclusion: The code appears to correctly implement the derived logic, and the logic correctly handles all three training examples. The failure report for `train_3` seems inconsistent with the visual outputs provided. Assuming the code's output is indeed correct for `train_3` as calculated, the existing natural language program and underlying logic are likely correct. No changes to the core logic are needed based *solely* on the provided examples and outputs. The focus remains on accurately documenting the established rules.

*   **Metrics:**
    *(Using manual calculation and inspection based on the previous analysis, assuming the code execution for train_3 produced the correct 5x3 grid despite the report)*

    *   **Train 1:**
        *   Input Objects: 3 (Red G, Green L, Blue T)
        *   Unique Colors: 3 (Red 2, Green 3, Blue 1)
        *   N=3, C=3. Condition N == C is TRUE.
        *   Object with Height == Color: Green L (Height=3, Color=3). Dimensions: 3x2.
        *   Max Height: 3
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 1): 3x2
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 2, fallback): 3 x (3-1) = 3x2
        *   Expected Output: 3x2 white grid.
        *   Code Output: 3x2 white grid.
        *   Result: Pass.

    *   **Train 2:**
        *   Input Objects: 3 (Yellow Square, Orange H, Azure G)
        *   Unique Colors: 3 (Yellow 4, Orange 7, Azure 8)
        *   N=3, C=3. Condition N == C is TRUE.
        *   Object with Height == Color: Yellow Square (Height=4, Color=4). Dimensions: 4x4.
        *   Max Height: 5 (Orange H)
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 1): 4x4
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 2, fallback): 5 x (3-1) = 5x2
        *   Expected Output: 4x4 white grid.
        *   Code Output: 4x4 white grid.
        *   Result: Pass.

    *   **Train 3:**
        *   Input Objects: 5 (Magenta C, Azure G, Yellow T, Red Bar1, Red Bar2)
        *   Unique Colors: 4 (Magenta 6, Azure 8, Yellow 4, Red 2)
        *   N=5, C=4. Condition N == C is FALSE.
        *   Object with Height == Color: Yellow T (Height=4, Color=4). *This exists but the N==C condition is false, so it's not used by Rule 1.*
        *   Max Height: 5 (Red Bars)
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 1 not applicable)
        *   Output Dimensions (Rule 2): MaxH x (C-1) = 5 x (4-1) = 5x3.
        *   Expected Output: 5x3 white grid.
        *   Code Output: 5x3 white grid.
        *   Result: Pass (assuming report error).

```yaml
task_description: Determines the dimensions of an all-white output grid based on properties of objects in the input grid, specifically comparing the number of objects (N) to the number of unique colors (C) and utilizing object heights and colors.

definitions:
  object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
  N: The total count of distinct objects in the input grid.
  C: The count of unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
  MaxH: The maximum height of any object in the input grid.
  height: The number of rows spanned by an object's bounding box.
  width: The number of columns spanned by an object's bounding box.
  color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels comprising an object.

rules:
  - condition: N == C
    action:
      - find_object: Locate an object where its height property is numerically equal to its color property.
      - output_dimensions: Use the height and width of the found object.
      - fallback (if no such object found): Use the rule for N != C. # Note: Not required by examples but good practice.
  - condition: N != C
    action:
      - calculate: MaxH (maximum height among all objects).
      - calculate: Width = C - 1 (Ensure non-negative).
      - output_dimensions: MaxH by Width.

output_grid:
  content: All pixels are white (0).
  dimensions: Determined by the applicable rule (N==C or N!=C).

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each object, determine its color, height (rows in bounding box), and width (columns in bounding box).
3.  Count the total number of identified objects (N).
4.  Determine the set of unique colors present across all objects and count them (C).
5.  Find the maximum height (MaxH) among all identified objects.
6.  **Compare N and C:**
    *   **If N is equal to C:**
        a.  Search for an object where its `height` value is numerically equal to its `color` value.
        b.  If such an object is found, set the output grid's height and width to be the `height` and `width` of *this specific object*.
        c.  If no such object is found (this case did not occur in the examples), calculate the output dimensions as `MaxH` by `max(0, C - 1)`.
    *   **If N is not equal to C:**
        a.  Set the output grid's height to `MaxH`.
        b.  Set the output grid's width to `max(0, C - 1)`.
7.  Create the output grid using the determined height and width, filling all its cells with the white color (0).

*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided execution results indicate that the Python code successfully transformed the inputs for `train_1` and `train_2` to match their respective expected outputs. However, for `train_3`, the report flags a mismatch (`Match: False`, `Size Correct: False`, `Color Count Correct: False`), despite the `Transformed Output` visually appearing identical to the `Expected Output` (both are 5x3 grids of white pixels).

    A re-analysis using the code's logic confirms that for `train_3`, the conditions (N=5, C=4 -> N != C) correctly trigger the rule `MaxH x (C-1)`, resulting in dimensions 5 x (4-1) = 5x3. This matches the expected output size.

    Therefore, the discrepancy in the `train_3` report is likely due to an external factor in the evaluation process or reporting, rather than an error in the implemented transformation logic itself. The strategy is to proceed with the current understanding of the transformation rules, as they correctly explain all three training examples, while acknowledging the reported evaluation inconsistency for `train_3`.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency. Note: Objects of the same color might merge if adjacent.
2.  For each identified object, determine its color, height (rows in bounding box), and width (columns in bounding box).
3.  Count the total number of identified objects (N).
4.  Determine the set of unique colors present across all objects and count them (C).
5.  Find the maximum height (MaxH) among all identified objects.
6.  **Compare N and C:**
    *   **If N is equal to C:**
        a.  Search for an object where its `height` value is numerically equal to its `color` value.
        b.  If such an object is found, set the output grid's height and width to be the `height` and `width` of *this specific object*.
        c.  If no such object is found, calculate the output dimensions as `MaxH` by `max(0, C - 1)`.
    *   **If N is not equal to C:**
        a.  Set the output grid's height to `MaxH`.
        b.  Set the output grid's width to `max(0, C - 1)`.
7.  Create the output grid using the determined height and width, filling all its cells with the white color (0).

*(Self-Correction during analysis)*: The detailed tool code execution revealed a crucial detail missed in the initial manual inspection: In `train_3`, the two red vertical bars are actually contiguous and form a single object with height 5 and width 3. This changes N from 5 to 4. Now, N=4 and C=4, so the `N == C` rule applies. This rule dictates using the dimensions of the object where height equals color (the Yellow T, H=4, W=3). This leads to a 4x3 output, which *fails* to match the expected 5x3 output.

**Revised Conclusion:** The initial assumption that the N!=C rule applied to train_3 was incorrect due to misidentifying the red bars as separate objects. The correct application of the N==C rule (now that N=4, C=4) leads to the wrong output dimensions (4x3 instead of 5x3). Therefore, the derived natural language program, although consistent with train_1 and train_2, is incomplete or incorrect as it fails train_3. The logic needs revision. The failure is *not* an evaluation error but a flaw in the rule derivation.

import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Determines the dimensions of an all-white output grid based on properties of objects in the input grid.
The core logic compares the number of distinct objects (N) to the number of unique non-white colors (C).

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency.
2.  For each identified object, determine its color, height, and width.
3.  Count the total number of identified objects (N).
4.  Determine the set of unique colors present across all objects and count them (C).
5.  Find the maximum height (MaxH) among all identified objects.
6.  If N is equal to C:
    a.  Search for an object where its height value is numerically equal to its color value.
    b.  If such an object is found, set the output grid's height and width to be the height and width of this specific object.
    c.  If no such object is found, calculate the output dimensions as MaxH by max(0, C - 1).
7.  If N is not equal to C:
    a.  Set the output grid's height to MaxH.
    b.  Set the output grid's width to max(0, C - 1).
8.  Create the output grid using the determined height and width, filling all its cells with the white color (0).

Note: This logic was derived from examples 1 and 2, but it fails to produce the correct output for example 3, suggesting the rules are incomplete or incorrect.
