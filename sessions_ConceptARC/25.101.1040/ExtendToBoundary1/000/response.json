            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the task examples provided.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single, contiguous, non-white rectangular object.\n    *   Example 1: A 3x3 green (3) square.\n    *   Example 2: A 6x5 red (2) rectangle.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding a line segment (either horizontal or vertical) that starts from the boundary of the original object and extends towards one edge of the grid. The original object remains unchanged.\n4.  **Color Consistency:** The added line segment always has the same color as the original object.\n5.  **Directionality:**\n    *   Example 1 (Grid 5x14 - wider than tall): The line extends horizontally to the right from the middle row of the object.\n    *   Example 2 (Grid 14x7 - taller than wide): The line extends vertically downwards from the middle column of the object.\n6.  **Rule Determination:** The direction of the extension (horizontal vs. vertical) appears to be determined by the aspect ratio of the *grid*, not the object. If the grid is wider than tall, the extension is horizontal. If the grid is taller or square, the extension is vertical.\n7.  **Line Origin:** The line starts adjacent to the object's boundary.\n    *   Horizontal line: Starts in the column immediately to the right of the object (`max_col + 1`) along the object's middle row.\n    *   Vertical line: Starts in the row immediately below the object (`max_row + 1`) along the object's middle column.\n8.  **Line Termination:** The line extends fully to the corresponding edge of the grid (right edge for horizontal, bottom edge for vertical).\n9.  **Midpoint Calculation:** The \"middle\" row/column seems to be calculated using integer division of the sum of the min and max row/column indices of the object's bounding box.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
