task_description: Horizontally translate the leftmost color group to the left edge and the rightmost color group to the right edge of the grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - height: integer (constant within a pair)
      - width: integer (constant within a pair)
      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)
  - element: color_group
    description: All pixels of a specific non-background color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)
      - pixels: list of (row, column) coordinates
      - bounding_box:
          min_row: integer
          max_row: integer
          min_col: integer
          max_col: integer

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Determine the overall leftmost and rightmost extent of non-background pixels.
    properties:
      - min_overall_col: minimum column index containing any non-background pixel
      - max_overall_col: maximum column index containing any non-background pixel
  - type: identity
    description: Identify the color(s) present at the overall minimum and maximum columns.
    properties:
      - leftmost_colors: set of colors present in the min_overall_col
      - rightmost_colors: set of colors present in the max_overall_col

actions:
  - action: create_output_grid
    origin: input grid dimensions
    target: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input grid
      - initial_fill: background color (white, 0)
  - action: translate_horizontally
    origin: input grid pixels for specific colors
    target: output grid
    conditions:
      - Applies to colors identified as leftmost_colors.
      - Applies to colors identified as rightmost_colors.
    properties:
      - direction: left (for leftmost_colors), right (for rightmost_colors)
      - destination_edge: column 0 (for leftmost_colors), column width-1 (for rightmost_colors)
      - preservation: maintains vertical position (row index) and relative horizontal positions within the color group.
    details:
      - For each leftmost_color:
          shift = 0 - min_col for that color
          Each pixel (r, c) moves to (r, c + shift)
      - For each rightmost_color:
          shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col for that color
          Each pixel (r, c) moves to (r, c + shift)
