            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, representing colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Content:** The grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one or more groups of pixels of other colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow). These colored pixels often form distinct shapes or patterns.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving specific groups of colored pixels horizontally.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:**\n    *   The group of pixels belonging to the color that appears furthest to the left in the input grid is moved to the absolute left edge (column 0) of the output grid.\n    *   The group of pixels belonging to the color that appears furthest to the right in the input grid is moved to the absolute right edge (last column) of the output grid.\n5.  **Preservation:**\n    *   The vertical position of each moved pixel group is preserved.\n    *   The internal shape and relative arrangement of pixels within each moved color group are preserved.\n    *   Pixels not belonging to the identified leftmost or rightmost color groups are not present in the output; the corresponding areas become background (white).\n    *   The background color (white) fills any space not occupied by the moved color groups.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct non-background colors present in the input grid.\n3.  For each distinct non-background color, find all coordinates `(row, column)` where it appears. Group these coordinates by color.\n4.  Determine the overall minimum column index (`min_overall_col`) occupied by any non-background pixel across the entire input grid.\n5.  Identify the set of colors (`leftmost_colors`) that have at least one pixel located at `min_overall_col`.\n6.  Determine the overall maximum column index (`max_overall_col`) occupied by any non-background pixel across the entire input grid.\n7.  Identify the set of colors (`rightmost_colors`) that have at least one pixel located at `max_overall_col`.\n8.  For each color in the `leftmost_colors` set:\n    a.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col_for_this_color`) among all pixels *of this specific color*.\n    b.  Calculate the horizontal shift required to move this color group to the left edge: `shift = 0 - min_col_for_this_color`.\n    c.  Iterate through all input coordinates `(r, c)` corresponding to this color. Place this color at the coordinate `(r, c + shift)` in the output grid.\n9.  For each color in the `rightmost_colors` set:\n    a.  Find the maximum column index (`max_col_for_this_color`) among all pixels *of this specific color*.\n    b.  Get the width of the grid (`grid_width`).\n    c.  Calculate the horizontal shift required to move this color group to the right edge: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col_for_this_color`.\n    d.  Iterate through all input coordinates `(r, c)` corresponding to this color. Place this color at the coordinate `(r, c + shift)` in the output grid. (Note: If a color is in both `leftmost_colors` and `rightmost_colors`, its pixels might be written twice, potentially overwriting based on the order of steps 8 and 9, but the final position will depend on the applied shift).\n10. Return the completed output grid."
