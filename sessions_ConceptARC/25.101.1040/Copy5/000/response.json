If they are in the first column, the operation is vertical.\n    *   The region of the grid *before* the blue marker(s) (either columns to the left or rows above) constitutes a \"pattern block\".\n    *   The number of blue pixels determines how many times the pattern block is repeated in the output.\n    *   The region occupied by the blue marker(s) in the input is replaced by a separator line (a column or row of white pixels) in the output.\n    *   The output consists of the pattern block repeated multiple times, interleaved with the separator line. Specifically, if there are N blue pixels, the pattern block appears N+1 times, separated by N separator lines.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
