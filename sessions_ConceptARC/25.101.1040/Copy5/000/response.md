*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids contain distinct blocks of colors.
    *   A specific color, blue (1), acts as a marker or instruction pixel.
    *   The location of the blue pixel(s) determines the orientation of the operation (horizontal or vertical).
    *   If blue pixels are in the top row, the operation is horizontal. If they are in the first column, the operation is vertical.
    *   The region of the grid *before* the blue marker(s) (either columns to the left or rows above) constitutes a "pattern block".
    *   The number of blue pixels determines how many times the pattern block is repeated in the output.
    *   The region occupied by the blue marker(s) in the input is replaced by a separator line (a column or row of white pixels) in the output.
    *   The output consists of the pattern block repeated multiple times, interleaved with the separator line. Specifically, if there are N blue pixels, the pattern block appears N+1 times, separated by N separator lines.

```yaml
    task_type: pattern_repetition_with_separator
    elements:
      - role: pattern_block
        description: A contiguous block of rows or columns in the input grid.
        location: Determined relative to the marker pixels. If markers are in the top row, it's the columns to the left. If markers are in the first column, it's the rows above.
      - role: marker
        color: blue (1)
        location: Either confined to the top row or the first column.
        property: count (N) - the number of blue pixels.
        function: Determines orientation (horizontal/vertical) and repetition count (N+1).
      - role: separator
        color: white (0)
        shape: A single row or column with dimensions matching the pattern block's corresponding dimension (width or height).
        location: Replaces the marker region in the output and separates repetitions of the pattern block.
        derivation: Its orientation (row/column) matches the marker's orientation (vertical/horizontal).
    relationships:
      - type: control
        source: marker
        target: pattern_block
        detail: The location and count of markers dictate the extraction, repetition, and orientation of the pattern block.
      - type: control
        source: marker
        target: separator
        detail: The location and orientation of markers determine the separator's existence, orientation, and placement.
    transformation:
      - action: identify_orientation
        based_on: location of blue (1) markers (top row -> horizontal, first column -> vertical).
      - action: identify_pattern_block
        based_on: region before the markers according to orientation.
      - action: count_markers
        input: blue (1) pixels (N).
      - action: define_separator
        based_on: orientation (white column or white row).
      - action: construct_output
        steps:
          - Place the pattern_block.
          - Repeat N times:
              - Place the separator.
              - Place the pattern_block.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Scan the input grid to locate all blue pixels (color 1).
    2.  Determine the operation's orientation:
        *   If all blue pixels are in the top row, the orientation is horizontal.
        *   If all blue pixels are in the first column, the orientation is vertical.
        *   (Assume no other configurations of blue pixels occur based on examples).
    3.  Count the number of blue pixels found (let this be N).
    4.  Identify the pattern block:
        *   If orientation is horizontal, the pattern block consists of all columns to the left of the first column containing a blue pixel.
        *   If orientation is vertical, the pattern block consists of all rows above the first row containing a blue pixel.
    5.  Define the separator:
        *   If orientation is horizontal, the separator is a single column of white pixels (0) with the same height as the input grid.
        *   If orientation is vertical, the separator is a single row of white pixels (0) with the same width as the input grid.
    6.  Construct the output grid:
        *   Start with the pattern block.
        *   Repeat N times: Append the separator, then append the pattern block (concatenating horizontally if orientation is horizontal, vertically if orientation is vertical).
        *   The final output consists of N+1 copies of the pattern block interleaved with N separators.
