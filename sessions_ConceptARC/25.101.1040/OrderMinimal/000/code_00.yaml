task_description: Apply a gravitational-like effect pulling yellow pixels leftwards until stable.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: true
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    behavior: mobile
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency (left neighbour is key)
  - type: blocking
    condition: A yellow pixel's leftward movement is blocked by the grid boundary or another yellow pixel.
actions:
  - name: shift_left
    actor: yellow pixel
    target: adjacent white cell to the left
    condition: The cell to the left is white and within grid bounds.
    effect: The yellow pixel moves to the left cell; the original cell becomes white.
  - name: stabilize
    actor: all yellow pixels
    mechanism: Iteratively apply shift_left action to all eligible yellow pixels until no pixel can move in a full pass.
    granularity: Simultaneous update per pass (evaluate all moves based on the state at the start of the pass, then apply all moves).
notes:
  - The stabilization process implies iterations until a fixed point is reached.
  - Example 1's provided output does not match the result of applying the derived rule. The rule derived from Examples 2 and 3 is assumed to be correct.
