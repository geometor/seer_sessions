            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming grids containing white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The input grids feature scattered yellow pixels or clusters of yellow pixels. The output grids also contain only white and yellow pixels, with the yellow pixels rearranged. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. Observing the examples, the yellow pixels appear to move towards the left side of the grid, compacting together until they are blocked by the left boundary or another yellow pixel.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The input has several yellow pixels, some forming diagonal or L-shapes. The output shows the yellow pixels shifted significantly leftward and consolidated.\n*   **Example 2**: The input has a larger, more complex shape of yellow pixels. The output shows this entire shape shifted uniformly one step to the left.\n*   **Example 3**: The input has sparse yellow pixels. The output shows these pixels shifted as far left as possible in their respective rows, stopping against the boundary or each other.\n\nThe common pattern across examples 2 and 3 is a leftward shift or compaction of yellow pixels. Each yellow pixel attempts to move into the white cell immediately to its left. This process seems to repeat iteratively until no yellow pixel can move further left (either because the cell to the left is already yellow or it's the grid boundary).\n\nThere appears to be a discrepancy in Example 1. Applying the \"shift left until stable\" rule derived from Examples 2 and 3 produces a different output grid than the one provided for Example 1. However, since the rule works consistently for the other two examples, it is the most likely intended transformation. The rule can be described as a simulation where yellow pixels behave like particles under a force pulling them leftwards, stopping only when blocked.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
