"""
Apply a gravitational-like effect pulling yellow (4) pixels leftwards until stable. 
The process is iterative: in each step, all yellow pixels that can move one cell to the left (into a white (0) cell) do so simultaneously. This continues until no yellow pixel can move left in a full pass, either because the cell to the left is occupied by another yellow pixel or it's the grid boundary.
"""

def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Shifts all yellow pixels (4) leftward until they hit the grid boundary 
    or another yellow pixel.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A list of lists representing the transformed grid with yellow pixels shifted left.
