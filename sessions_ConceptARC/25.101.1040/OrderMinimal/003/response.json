Find the number (N) and indices (C) of all yellow pixels (color 4).\n2. If N=0 (no yellow pixels), the row remains all white (color 0).\n3. If N > 0, calculate the centroid (mean column index) of the yellow pixels: mean_c = sum(C) / N.\n4. Determine the target start index 'k' for a contiguous block of N yellow pixels. The goal is to center this block [k, k+N-1] around the calculated centroid mean_c.\n5. The center of the target block is k + (N - 1) / 2.0. Set this equal to mean_c and solve for k: k = mean_c - (N - 1) / 2.0.\n6. Since k must be an integer index, round the calculated float value: k = round(k_float). (Uses standard Python 3 round-half-to-even).\n7. Clamp the calculated start index k to ensure the block fits within the row boundaries: 0 <= k <= width - N.\n8. Create the output row: Place N yellow pixels contiguously starting at the clamped index k. All other cells in the row are white.\n9. Combine the transformed rows to form the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the grid by rearranging yellow pixels in each row into a \n    single contiguous block.
