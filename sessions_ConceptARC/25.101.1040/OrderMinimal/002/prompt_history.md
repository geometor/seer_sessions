**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming grids containing white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The input grids feature scattered yellow pixels or clusters of yellow pixels. The output grids also contain only white and yellow pixels, with the yellow pixels rearranged. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. Observing the examples, the yellow pixels appear to move towards the left side of the grid, compacting together until they are blocked by the left boundary or another yellow pixel.

*   **Example 1**: The input has several yellow pixels, some forming diagonal or L-shapes. The output shows the yellow pixels shifted significantly leftward and consolidated.
*   **Example 2**: The input has a larger, more complex shape of yellow pixels. The output shows this entire shape shifted uniformly one step to the left.
*   **Example 3**: The input has sparse yellow pixels. The output shows these pixels shifted as far left as possible in their respective rows, stopping against the boundary or each other.

The common pattern across examples 2 and 3 is a leftward shift or compaction of yellow pixels. Each yellow pixel attempts to move into the white cell immediately to its left. This process seems to repeat iteratively until no yellow pixel can move further left (either because the cell to the left is already yellow or it's the grid boundary).

There appears to be a discrepancy in Example 1. Applying the "shift left until stable" rule derived from Examples 2 and 3 produces a different output grid than the one provided for Example 1. However, since the rule works consistently for the other two examples, it is the most likely intended transformation. The rule can be described as a simulation where yellow pixels behave like particles under a force pulling them leftwards, stopping only when blocked.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a gravitational-like effect pulling yellow pixels leftwards until stable.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: true
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    behavior: mobile
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency (left neighbour is key)
  - type: blocking
    condition: A yellow pixel's leftward movement is blocked by the grid boundary or another yellow pixel.
actions:
  - name: shift_left
    actor: yellow pixel
    target: adjacent white cell to the left
    condition: The cell to the left is white and within grid bounds.
    effect: The yellow pixel moves to the left cell; the original cell becomes white.
  - name: stabilize
    actor: all yellow pixels
    mechanism: Iteratively apply shift_left action to all eligible yellow pixels until no pixel can move in a full pass.
    granularity: Simultaneous update per pass (evaluate all moves based on the state at the start of the pass, then apply all moves).
notes:
  - The stabilization process implies iterations until a fixed point is reached.
  - Example 1's provided output does not match the result of applying the derived rule. The rule derived from Examples 2 and 3 is assumed to be correct.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Start an iterative process that continues as long as any yellow pixel moves in a pass.
3.  In each pass, assume initially that no pixel will move. Create a temporary grid for the next state, copying the current state.
4.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the current grid state.
5.  If the cell (r, c) contains a yellow pixel (4):
    a.  Check the cell immediately to the left, at (r, c-1).
    b.  If the left cell is within the grid boundaries (c > 0) and contains a white pixel (0):
        i.  Mark that a move occurred in this pass.
        ii. In the temporary grid for the next state, set cell (r, c) to white (0) and cell (r, c-1) to yellow (4).
6.  After checking all cells, update the current grid state to be the temporary grid computed in this pass.
7.  If any move occurred in the pass, repeat from step 2.
8.  If a pass completes with no moves, the current grid state is the final stable output. Return this grid.
```python

"""
Apply a gravitational-like effect pulling yellow (4) pixels leftwards until stable. 
The process is iterative: in each step, all yellow pixels that can move one cell to the left (into a white (0) cell) do so simultaneously. This continues until no yellow pixel can move left in a full pass, either because the cell to the left is occupied by another yellow pixel or it's the grid boundary.
