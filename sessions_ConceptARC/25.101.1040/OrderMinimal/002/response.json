            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implemented an iterative, simultaneous leftward shift of all yellow pixels until blocked by the boundary or another yellow pixel. Testing revealed this logic does not match the expected output for *any* of the three training examples. The expected outputs show a mix of leftward shifts, rightward shifts, and no shifts for yellow pixels, occurring within a single transformation step (no iteration seems required).\n\nThe core difficulty lies in identifying a single, consistent rule that determines *which* yellow pixels move and in *which* direction (left or right) based on the input configuration. Simple rules based on adjacent cells being white, proximity to boundaries, neighbour counts, or maximizing local neighbours failed to explain the observed behavior across all examples. Example 1's output seems particularly different from the apparent logic in Examples 2 and 3.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to re-analyze the specific pixel movements in each example, focusing on identifying potential trigger conditions for moving left vs. right vs. staying stationary. We will formulate a description based on the observed input-output pairs, acknowledging the difficulty in finding a universal rule that fits all three perfectly. We will assume the transformation happens in a single, simultaneous pass.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics like grid size and color palette remain consistent. The key difference is the final position of yellow pixels.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 10\n    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 10\n    *   Moved Left: 0\n    *   Moved Right: 3 (`(3,1)->(3,2)`, `(4,0)->(4,1)`, `(4,1)->(4,2)`)\n    *   No Move: 7 (`(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)`)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 15\n    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 15\n    *   Moved Left: 7 (`(3,5)->(3,4)`, `(4,5)->(4,4)`, `(5,1)->(5,0)`, `(5,2)->(5,1)`, `(5,3)->(5,2)`, `(5,4)->(5,3)`, `(5,5)->(5,4)`)\n    *   Moved Right: 3 (`(1,3)->(1,4)`, `(2,2)->(2,3)`, `(2,3)->(2,4)`)\n    *   No Move: 5 (`(3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)`)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 6\n    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 6\n    *   Moved Left: 4 (`(3,3)->(3,2)`, `(4,3)->(4,2)`, `(5,2)->(5,1)`, `(5,3)->(5,2)`)\n    *   Moved Right: 1 (`(4,0)->(4,1)`)\n    *   No Move: 1 (`(5,0)`)\n\nThe pattern of L/R/N moves is complex and varies significantly between examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If `L` is White and `R` is Yellow or Boundary, potentially move Left.\n        ii. If `R` is White and `L` is Yellow or Boundary, potentially move Right.\n        iii. If both `L` and `R` are Yellow or Boundary, stay put.\n        iv. If both `L` and `R` are White, the decision is complex and context-dependent (examples show moves L, R, or N).\n    d.  If a move is decided:\n        i.  If moving Left: In the next state grid, set `(r, c-1)` to yellow and `(r, c)` to white.\n        ii.

The true conditions remain unidentified but the overall process is a single, simultaneous update based on those conditions).*"
