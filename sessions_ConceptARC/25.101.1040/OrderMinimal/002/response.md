**General Assessment:**

The initial code implemented an iterative, simultaneous leftward shift of all yellow pixels until blocked by the boundary or another yellow pixel. Testing revealed this logic does not match the expected output for *any* of the three training examples. The expected outputs show a mix of leftward shifts, rightward shifts, and no shifts for yellow pixels, occurring within a single transformation step (no iteration seems required).

The core difficulty lies in identifying a single, consistent rule that determines *which* yellow pixels move and in *which* direction (left or right) based on the input configuration. Simple rules based on adjacent cells being white, proximity to boundaries, neighbour counts, or maximizing local neighbours failed to explain the observed behavior across all examples. Example 1's output seems particularly different from the apparent logic in Examples 2 and 3.

The strategy moving forward is to re-analyze the specific pixel movements in each example, focusing on identifying potential trigger conditions for moving left vs. right vs. staying stationary. We will formulate a description based on the observed input-output pairs, acknowledging the difficulty in finding a universal rule that fits all three perfectly. We will assume the transformation happens in a single, simultaneous pass.

**Metrics:**

Metrics like grid size and color palette remain consistent. The key difference is the final position of yellow pixels.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 10
    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 10
    *   Moved Left: 0
    *   Moved Right: 3 (`(3,1)->(3,2)`, `(4,0)->(4,1)`, `(4,1)->(4,2)`)
    *   No Move: 7 (`(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)`)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 15
    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 15
    *   Moved Left: 7 (`(3,5)->(3,4)`, `(4,5)->(4,4)`, `(5,1)->(5,0)`, `(5,2)->(5,1)`, `(5,3)->(5,2)`, `(5,4)->(5,3)`, `(5,5)->(5,4)`)
    *   Moved Right: 3 (`(1,3)->(1,4)`, `(2,2)->(2,3)`, `(2,3)->(2,4)`)
    *   No Move: 5 (`(3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)`)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Pixels (Yellow): 6
    *   Output Pixels (Yellow): 6
    *   Moved Left: 4 (`(3,3)->(3,2)`, `(4,3)->(4,2)`, `(5,2)->(5,1)`, `(5,3)->(5,2)`)
    *   Moved Right: 1 (`(4,0)->(4,1)`)
    *   No Move: 1 (`(5,0)`)

The pattern of L/R/N moves is complex and varies significantly between examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform the grid by selectively moving some yellow pixels horizontally by one step into adjacent white cells.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: true
  - background_color: white (0)
  - fixed_colors: [white (0), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    behavior: mobile (conditionally)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency (left and right neighbours are key)
  - type: state
    property: color (white or yellow) of adjacent cells
actions:
  - name: move_left
    actor: yellow pixel at (r, c)
    condition: Unknown, but requires cell (r, c-1) to be white and within bounds. Observed in Ex2, Ex3.
    effect: Pixel moves to (r, c-1); original cell (r, c) becomes white.
  - name: move_right
    actor: yellow pixel at (r, c)
    condition: Unknown, but requires cell (r, c+1) to be white and within bounds. Observed in Ex1, Ex2, Ex3.
    effect: Pixel moves to (r, c+1); original cell (r, c) becomes white.
  - name: stay_put
    actor: yellow pixel at (r, c)
    condition: Unknown, occurs even when adjacent white cells exist. Observed in all examples.
    effect: Pixel remains at (r, c).
process:
  - type: update
    granularity: simultaneous (all moves are decided based on the initial input state)
    passes: single (the transformation happens once, not iteratively)
notes:
  - The precise conditions triggering move_left, move_right, or stay_put are unclear and likely depend on the configuration of yellow neighbours beyond the immediate left/right cells.
  - No consistent simple rule (e.g., always move left, move towards boundary, move based on L/R neighbour state alone) explains all examples.
  - The transformation results in the same number of yellow pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid (next state).
2.  Identify all yellow pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each yellow pixel at position `(r, c)` in the input grid:
    a.  Examine the state of the cell to its left, `L = (r, c-1)`, and the cell to its right, `R = (r, c+1)` (considering grid boundaries).
    b.  Determine if the pixel should move left, move right, or stay put based on a set of currently unknown conditions. These conditions likely involve the state (white/yellow/boundary) of `L` and `R`, and potentially other neighbouring yellow pixels.
    c.  **Hypothesized Conditions (Incomplete - based on partial observations):**
        i.  If `L` is White and `R` is Yellow or Boundary, potentially move Left.
        ii. If `R` is White and `L` is Yellow or Boundary, potentially move Right.
        iii. If both `L` and `R` are Yellow or Boundary, stay put.
        iv. If both `L` and `R` are White, the decision is complex and context-dependent (examples show moves L, R, or N).
    d.  If a move is decided:
        i.  If moving Left: In the next state grid, set `(r, c-1)` to yellow and `(r, c)` to white.
        ii. If moving Right: In the next state grid, set `(r, c+1)` to yellow and `(r, c)` to white.
        *Note: All move decisions are based on the *original* input grid state.*
4.  After evaluating all yellow pixels from the input grid, the computed next state grid is the final output grid. Return this grid.
*(Self-Correction: The hypothesized conditions in 3.c are insufficient based on analysis. The core issue is that these simple conditions have counter-examples in the training data. The true conditions remain unidentified but the overall process is a single, simultaneous update based on those conditions).*
