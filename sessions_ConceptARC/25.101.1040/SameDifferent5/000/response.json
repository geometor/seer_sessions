The size of the objects and their inner regions can vary (e.g., 3x3 with a 1x1 center, 4x4 with a 2x2 center).\n3.  **Color Usage:** Multiple colors are used within each input grid, forming the borders and centers of the objects.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is consistently a single digit, representing a color index.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to involve analyzing the properties of the objects in the input grid, specifically their center colors, and determining which center color appears most frequently.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
