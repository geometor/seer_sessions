1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the two non-background colors present (colors other than 0).
2.  Count the occurrences of each non-background color. Designate the color with the higher count as the 'primary color' (P) and the color with the lower count as the 'secondary color' (S).
3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
5.  If the color of the input cell `(r, c)` is the primary color (P):
    a.  Examine its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) in the original input grid.
    b.  Check if at least one of these neighbors also contains the primary color (P).
    c.  If at least one neighbor is also color P (meaning the pixel at `(r, c)` is not isolated), then set the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the primary color (P).
6.  All other input cells (background, secondary color, or isolated primary color) result in the corresponding output cell remaining the background color (0).
7.  Return the final output grid.
