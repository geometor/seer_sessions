Analyze the input grid to identify all non-background colors (pixels with value > 0) and count their occurrences.\n2. If there are two or more non-background colors:\n    a. Designate the color with the highest count as the 'primary color' (P). If there's a tie in counts, the color with the lower numerical value is P.\n    b. Designate the color with the lowest count as the 'secondary color' (S). If there's a tie in counts, the color with the higher numerical value is S. (This assumes exactly two non-background colors based on examples).\n3. If there is only one non-background color, designate it as the primary color (P), and there is no secondary color (S).\n4. If there are no non-background colors, the output is identical to the input (all background).\n5. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n    a. If the input cell color is the primary color (P):\n        i. Check its eight neighbors (including diagonals) in the input grid.\n        ii. Count how many neighbors are also the primary color (P).\n        iii. If this count is 1 or more (i.e., the pixel is not isolated), set the output cell `(r, c)` to P.\n    b. If the input cell color is the secondary color (S) (only applicable if S was defined):\n        i. Check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.\n        ii. Count how many of these cardinal neighbors are the primary color (P).\n        iii. If this count is 2 or more, set the output cell `(r, c)` to the primary color (P).\n    c. (Implicitly) If the input cell is background (0), an isolated P pixel (neighbor count = 0), or an S pixel not meeting the conversion condition (neighbor count < 2), the output cell `(r, c)` remains background (0).\n7. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbor_coords(r, c, height, width, connectivity=8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Yields valid coordinates of neighbors for a cell (r, c) within grid bounds.\n    \n    Args:\n        r: Row index of the cell.\n        c: Column index of the cell.\n        height: Grid height.\n        width: Grid width.\n        connectivity: 8 for diagonal neighbors, 4 for cardinal neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            # Skip diagonals if connectivity is 4 (cardinal)\n            if connectivity == 4 and abs(dr) + abs(dc) != 1:\n                continue\n                \n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                yield nr, nc\n\ndef count_neighbor_color(grid, r, c, target_color, connectivity=8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of neighbors of a specific color around cell (r, c).\n    \n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid (list of lists).\n        r: Row index of the cell.\n        c: Column index of the cell.\n        target_color: The color value to count in the neighborhood.\n        connectivity: 8 for diagonal neighbors, 4 for cardinal neighbors.\n        \n    Returns:\n        The count of neighbors with the target_color.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0])\n    for nr, nc in get_neighbor_coords(r, c, height, width, connectivity):\n        if grid[nr][nc] == target_color:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify non-background colors and their counts.\n    color_counts = collections.Counter()\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = input_grid[r][c]\n            if color != 0: # Ignore background\n                color_counts[color] += 1\n\n    # Step 2, 3 & 4: Determine primary (P) and secondary (S) colors.\n    primary_color = -1  # Use -1 to indicate no color assigned yet\n    secondary_color = -1 \n    \n    if len(color_counts) == 0:\n         # Step 4: No non-background colors, return grid of zeros\n         return [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n    elif len(color_counts) == 1:\n         # Step 3: Only one non-background color, it's primary\n         primary_color = list(color_counts.keys())[0]\n         # secondary_color remains -1\n    else: \n        # Step 2: Two or more colors (examples suggest exactly two)\n        # Sort by count (descending), then by color value (ascending) for tie-breaking\n        sorted_colors = sorted(color_counts.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))\n        primary_color = sorted_colors[0][0]\n        # Find the least frequent for secondary.
