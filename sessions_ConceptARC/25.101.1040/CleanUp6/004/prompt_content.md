"""
Transform the input grid based on the following rules:

1. Identify the two non-background colors. The one appearing more frequently is the 'primary color' (P), the other is the 'secondary color' (S). If counts are equal, the lower color value is primary.
2. Create an output grid initialized with the background color (0).
3. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
   a. If the pixel is primary (P): Keep it in the output grid *only if* it has at least one primary (P) neighbor among its 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals) in the input grid. Otherwise, set the output pixel to background (0).
   b. If the pixel is secondary (S): Change it to the primary color (P) in the output grid *only if* it has 3 or more primary (P) neighbors among its 4 cardinal adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in the input grid. Otherwise, set the output pixel to background (0).
   c. If the pixel is background (0), keep it as background (0) in the output grid.
