Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves filtering objects within a grid based on their shape properties. Each input grid contains multiple distinct objects, each composed of a single color (other than white). The output grid retains some of these objects while removing others, replacing the removed objects' pixels with white.

The key distinguishing feature appears to be whether an object forms a "solid rectangle". A solid rectangle is defined as an object whose pixels completely fill its minimum bounding box.

A meta-rule seems to govern *which* type of object (solid rectangle or non-solid rectangle) is kept:

1.  Identify all objects and classify them as either "Solid Rectangle" or "Non-Solid-Rectangle".
2.  Count the number of objects in each category.
3.  If the counts are equal, only the "Solid Rectangle" objects are kept in the output.
4.  If the counts are unequal, only the "Non-Solid-Rectangle" objects are kept in the output.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_context: Grid transformation involving object filtering based on shape properties.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color (using orthogonal adjacency).
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - solid_rectangle_object: An object where the number of its pixels is equal to the area (width * height) of its bounding box.
  - non_solid_rectangle_object: An object that is not a solid_rectangle_object.

observations:
  - input_grids contain multiple objects of different colors and shapes.
  - output_grids contain a subset of the input objects.
  - objects are either kept entirely or removed entirely (replaced with white).
  - the decision to keep/remove an object depends on its classification (solid_rectangle vs non_solid_rectangle) and the relative counts of these types in the input grid.

filtering_rule:
  - condition: Count of solid_rectangle_objects equals count of non_solid_rectangle_objects.
    action: Keep only solid_rectangle_objects in the output.
  - condition: Count of solid_rectangle_objects does not equal count of non_solid_rectangle_objects.
    action: Keep only non_solid_rectangle_objects in the output.

examples_analysis:
  - train_1:
      objects: Red (solid), Azure (non-solid), Blue (solid), Gray (non-solid).
      counts: solid=2, non-solid=2.
      rule_applied: Counts are equal, keep solid.
      output: Red and Blue objects remain.
  - train_2:
      objects: Magenta (solid), Yellow_Rect (solid), Yellow_+ (non-solid), Red_T (non-solid), Orange (solid).
      counts: solid=3, non-solid=2.
      rule_applied: Counts are unequal, keep non-solid.
      output: Yellow_+ and Red_T objects remain.
  - train_3:
      objects: Orange_Hole (non-solid), Green_Hole1 (non-solid), Orange_Rect (solid), Green_Hole2 (non-solid).
      counts: solid=1, non-solid=3.
      rule_applied: Counts are unequal, keep non-solid.
      output: Orange_Hole, Green_Hole1, and Green_Hole2 objects remain.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled with white pixels.
2.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a connected group of pixels of the same non-white color, using orthogonal adjacency.
3.  Create two lists: `solid_objects` and `non_solid_objects`.
4.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).
    b.  Calculate the area of the bounding box: `area = (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`.
    c.  Count the number of pixels in the object (`pixel_count`).
    d.  If `pixel_count` equals `area`, add the object to the `solid_objects` list.
    e.  Otherwise, add the object to the `non_solid_objects` list.
5.  Compare the number of objects in `solid_objects` (`count_solid`) with the number of objects in `non_solid_objects` (`count_non_solid`).
6.  If `count_solid` equals `count_non_solid`:
    a.  Iterate through the objects in the `solid_objects` list.
    b.  For each pixel belonging to these objects, copy its color and position to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
7.  Else (if `count_solid` does not equal `count_non_solid`):
    a.  Iterate through the objects in the `non_solid_objects` list.
    b.  For each pixel belonging to these objects, copy its color and position to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
8.  Return the final output grid.
