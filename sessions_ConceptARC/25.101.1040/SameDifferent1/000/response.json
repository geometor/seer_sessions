Each input grid contains multiple distinct objects, each composed of a single color (other than white). The output grid retains some of these objects while removing others, replacing the removed objects' pixels with white.\n\nThe key distinguishing feature appears to be whether an object forms a \"solid rectangle\". A solid rectangle is defined as an object whose pixels completely fill its minimum bounding box.\n\nA meta-rule seems to govern *which* type of object (solid rectangle or non-solid rectangle) is kept:\n\n1.  Identify all objects and classify them as either \"Solid Rectangle\" or \"Non-Solid-Rectangle\".\n2.  Count the number of objects in each category.\n3.  If the counts are equal, only the \"Solid Rectangle\" objects are kept in the output.\n4.  If the counts are unequal, only the \"Non-Solid-Rectangle\" objects are kept in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
