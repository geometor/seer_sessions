task_context: Grid transformation involving object filtering based on shape properties.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color (using orthogonal adjacency).
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - solid_rectangle_object: An object where the number of its pixels is equal to the area (width * height) of its bounding box.
  - non_solid_rectangle_object: An object that is not a solid_rectangle_object.

observations:
  - input_grids contain multiple objects of different colors and shapes.
  - output_grids contain a subset of the input objects.
  - objects are either kept entirely or removed entirely (replaced with white).
  - the decision to keep/remove an object depends on its classification (solid_rectangle vs non_solid_rectangle) and the relative counts of these types in the input grid.

filtering_rule:
  - condition: Count of solid_rectangle_objects equals count of non_solid_rectangle_objects.
    action: Keep only solid_rectangle_objects in the output.
  - condition: Count of solid_rectangle_objects does not equal count of non_solid_rectangle_objects.
    action: Keep only non_solid_rectangle_objects in the output.

examples_analysis:
  - train_1:
      objects: Red (solid), Azure (non-solid), Blue (solid), Gray (non-solid).
      counts: solid=2, non-solid=2.
      rule_applied: Counts are equal, keep solid.
      output: Red and Blue objects remain.
  - train_2:
      objects: Magenta (solid), Yellow_Rect (solid), Yellow_+ (non-solid), Red_T (non-solid), Orange (solid).
      counts: solid=3, non-solid=2.
      rule_applied: Counts are unequal, keep non-solid.
      output: Yellow_+ and Red_T objects remain.
  - train_3:
      objects: Orange_Hole (non-solid), Green_Hole1 (non-solid), Orange_Rect (solid), Green_Hole2 (non-solid).
      counts: solid=1, non-solid=3.
      rule_applied: Counts are unequal, keep non-solid.
      output: Orange_Hole, Green_Hole1, and Green_Hole2 objects remain.
