Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The input and output grids are the same size (10x10) and predominantly filled with the white background color (0).
Each input grid contains a single, contiguous object made of red pixels (2). The shape of the red object varies between the examples.
In the output grid, the red object retains its exact shape and orientation but is located in a different position compared to the input.
The transformation appears to be a horizontal translation (movement) of the red object to the right.
By comparing the rightmost extent of the object in the input and the rightmost column of the grid (index 9 for a 10-wide grid), the object seems to move so that its rightmost edge aligns with column index 9, the last column before the edge. The amount of horizontal shift is precisely the number of white columns between the object's rightmost edge and the grid's right edge in the input.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (white, value 0).
2.  Locate the single contiguous block of non-background colored pixels (the red object). Record its shape, color, and the coordinates of all its pixels.
3.  Determine the width of the input grid.
4.  Find the maximum column index occupied by any pixel of the red object in the input grid (`rightmost_column_index`).
5.  Calculate the horizontal shift distance required: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - rightmost_column_index`.
6.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
7.  For each pixel of the original red object located at `(row, col)`, place a pixel of the same red color at the new coordinates `(row, col + shift)` in the output grid.
8.  Return the newly created grid.
