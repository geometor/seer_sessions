The shape of the red object varies between the examples.\nIn the output grid, the red object retains its exact shape and orientation but is located in a different position compared to the input.\nThe transformation appears to be a horizontal translation (movement) of the red object to the right.\nBy comparing the rightmost extent of the object in the input and the rightmost column of the grid (index 9 for a 10-wide grid), the object seems to move so that its rightmost edge aligns with column index 9, the last column before the edge. The amount of horizontal shift is precisely the number of white columns between the object's rightmost edge and the grid's right edge in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).\n7.  For each pixel of the original red object located at `(row, col)`, place a pixel of the same red color at the new coordinates `(row, col + shift)` in the output grid.\n8.
