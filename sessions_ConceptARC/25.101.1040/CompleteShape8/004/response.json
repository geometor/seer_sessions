            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous transformation attempt correctly identified the rule for removing gray pixels (color 5) and the rule for filling the 3x3 bounding box when all pixels of a non-gray color fit within such a box. This worked perfectly for `train_1` and for the magenta color (6) in `train_2`.\n\nHowever, the code failed on the orange color (7) in `train_2`. The initial assumption for objects whose bounding box was *not* 3x3 was to simply copy the original pixels. The expected output for the orange object showed a more complex transformation, adding pixels beyond the original ones.\n\nAnalysis of the `train_2` orange object revealed:\n1.  Input pixels were at `(2, 1)` and `(3, 2)`.\n2.  The bounding box for these pixels is `(2, 1)` to `(3, 2)`, which is 2x2.\n3.  The two input pixels occupy the top-left and bottom-right corners of this 2x2 bounding box.\n4.  The output pixels are `(2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)`.\n5.  This specific output pattern corresponds to taking the top-left input pixel `(r, c)` and the bottom-right input pixel `(r+1, c+1)` and generating a specific 6-pixel shape defined relative to `(r, c)`.\n\nThis suggests a special case for 2x2 bounding boxes containing only the diagonal pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\nRefine the transformation logic to include this specific 2x2 diagonal pattern case alongside the 3x3 fill case. Add a fallback rule (copy original pixels) for any other non-gray, non-3x3, non-special-2x2 cases, although none were observed in the training data.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered to verify the properties of the non-gray objects in the training inputs:\n*code_execution:*\n"
