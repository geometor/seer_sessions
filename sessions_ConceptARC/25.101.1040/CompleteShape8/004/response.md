**General Assessment**

The previous transformation attempt correctly identified the rule for removing gray pixels (color 5) and the rule for filling the 3x3 bounding box when all pixels of a non-gray color fit within such a box. This worked perfectly for `train_1` and for the magenta color (6) in `train_2`.

However, the code failed on the orange color (7) in `train_2`. The initial assumption for objects whose bounding box was *not* 3x3 was to simply copy the original pixels. The expected output for the orange object showed a more complex transformation, adding pixels beyond the original ones.

Analysis of the `train_2` orange object revealed:
1.  Input pixels were at `(2, 1)` and `(3, 2)`.
2.  The bounding box for these pixels is `(2, 1)` to `(3, 2)`, which is 2x2.
3.  The two input pixels occupy the top-left and bottom-right corners of this 2x2 bounding box.
4.  The output pixels are `(2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)`.
5.  This specific output pattern corresponds to taking the top-left input pixel `(r, c)` and the bottom-right input pixel `(r+1, c+1)` and generating a specific 6-pixel shape defined relative to `(r, c)`.

This suggests a special case for 2x2 bounding boxes containing only the diagonal pixels.

**Strategy:**
Refine the transformation logic to include this specific 2x2 diagonal pattern case alongside the 3x3 fill case. Add a fallback rule (copy original pixels) for any other non-gray, non-3x3, non-special-2x2 cases, although none were observed in the training data.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were gathered to verify the properties of the non-gray objects in the training inputs:

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white background color (0).
2.  Identify all unique non-white (0) and non-gray (5) colors present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique non-gray color identified:
    a.  Find the coordinates `C` of *all* pixels in the input grid that have this color. Let `(min_r, min_c)` be the top-left coordinate and `(max_r, max_c)` be the bottom-right coordinate defining the minimum bounding box `B` enclosing these pixels.
    b.  Calculate the height `H = max_r - min_r + 1` and width `W = max_c - min_c + 1` of the bounding box `B`.
    c.  **Case 1 (3x3 Bounding Box):** If `H` is 3 and `W` is 3:
        i. Fill the entire rectangular area defined by the bounding box `B` (from `min_r` to `max_r` and `min_c` to `max_c`) in the output grid with the current color.
    d.  **Case 2 (Specific 2x2 Diagonal Pattern):** If `H` is 2 and `W` is 2, AND the set of coordinates `C` contains exactly two pixels: the top-left `(min_r, min_c)` and the bottom-right `(max_r, max_c)` of the bounding box:
        i. Add pixels to the output grid at the following six coordinates, using the current color: `(min_r, min_c)`, `(max_r, max_c)`, `(min_r, max_c + 1)`, `(max_r + 1, min_c)`, `(max_r + 1, min_c + 1)`, `(max_r + 1, max_c + 1)`. (Ensure these coordinates are within the grid boundaries).
    e.  **Case 3 (Other):** Otherwise (if neither Case 1 nor Case 2 applies):
        i. For each original pixel coordinate in `C`, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the current color.
4.  Return the completed output grid. (Gray pixels from the input are implicitly ignored as they are not processed in step 3).
