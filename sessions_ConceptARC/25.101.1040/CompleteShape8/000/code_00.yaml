task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - type: grid
    attributes:
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - type: contiguous_pixels
          properties:
            color: [yellow, gray, magenta, orange] # Observed colors other than background
            bounding_box:
              type: rectangle
              properties: [height, width]
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: non-white contiguous pixel groups
  - action: filter_objects
    condition: color is gray (5)
    effect: remove_object (replace with white)
  - action: process_non_gray_objects
    target: objects not filtered out
    rules:
      - condition: bounding_box height is 3 AND width is 3
        effect: fill_bounding_box
        arguments:
          color: object's color
          area: object's bounding box
      - condition: bounding_box height is NOT 3 OR width is NOT 3 # Rule derived from contrast with 3x3 rule
        effect: preserve_object_pixels # Simplest interpretation, acknowledging discrepancy in train_2 orange example
        # alternative_effect (Observed for train_2 orange): apply_specific_transformation (details unclear from single example)
        arguments:
          color: object's color
          pixels: original pixel locations
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    elements: [object, bounding_box]
    relation: object contained within bounding_box
  - type: conditional_transformation
    condition: object properties (color, bounding_box size)
    effect: determines transformation rule (remove, fill_bbox, preserve/modify)
