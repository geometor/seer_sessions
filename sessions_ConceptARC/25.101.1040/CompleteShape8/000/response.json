            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task uses grids of pixels with different colors. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. Colors observed include yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and orange (7).\n3.  **Transformations:**\n    *   **Color Removal:** Gray objects present in the input seem to be consistently removed (replaced by white) in the output.\n    *   **Shape Modification:** Non-gray objects undergo a transformation based on their properties.\n    *   **Bounding Box Rule:** In `train_1`, both the yellow and magenta objects have pixels that fit within a 3x3 bounding box. In the output, these 3x3 bounding boxes are completely filled with the respective object's color. In `train_2`, the magenta object's pixels also fit within a 3x3 bounding box, which is filled in the output.\n    *   **Exception/Alternate Rule:** In `train_2`, the orange object's pixels fit within a 2x2 bounding box. This object is *not* transformed into a filled 3x3 square. Instead, the original orange pixels remain, and several *new* orange pixels are added in seemingly specific locations relative to the original pixels ((2,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) added to original (2,1), (3,2)). This specific transformation for non-3x3-bounded objects is only demonstrated once.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The primary transformation appears to be: remove gray objects, and for other objects, if their bounding box is exactly 3x3, fill that box with the object's color. The rule for objects whose bounding box is *not* 3x3 is less clear from the examples, with the single instance showing a complex change rather than simple preservation or removal. The most consistent rule observed across multiple objects and both examples is the 3x3 bounding box fill and gray removal.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
