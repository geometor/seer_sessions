It modifies only the Subject (S) pixels according to the following rules applied based on the initial state of the input grid:\n\n1.  **S -> R Change:** An S pixel changes to color R if it is cardinally adjacent to an R pixel. This rule has the highest priority.\n2.  **S -> B Change (Hypothesized Rule):** An S pixel that does *not* change to R changes to color B if it is cardinally adjacent to a B pixel AND it is *not* considered \"protected\".\n3.  **Protection (Hypothesized Rule):** An S pixel P (not changing to R) is \"protected\" if it's cardinally adjacent to an S pixel P' changing to R, or if P is adjacent to another S pixel P'' which is itself protected. Protection propagates through contiguous S pixels starting from those adjacent to the S->R boundary.\n4.  **S Remains S:** An S pixel remains S if it doesn't meet the conditions for changing to R or B (i.e., it's not adjacent to R, and if it is adjacent to B, it's \"protected\").\n\n*Validation Note:* Implementations based on this hypothesized \"protection\" rule (Rule 2 & 3) failed to perfectly replicate the transformations in the provided training examples. The exact conditions governing the S->B change remain uncertain.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef identify_colors(grid: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[int | None, int | None, int | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Background (B), Subject (S), and Reactant (R) colors based on frequency.\n    - B = most frequent.\n    - S = less frequent of top 2 non-B.\n    - R = more frequent of top 2 non-B.\n    Handles grids with < 3 colors.\n    Returns (background_color, subject_color, reactant_color)\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = collections.Counter(cell for row in grid for cell in row)\n    \n    if not counts:\n        return 0, None, None #
