task_context:
  grid_properties:
    size: Variable
    background_color_value: 0 # Consistently most frequent
    background_color_name: White
  objects:
    - type: Subject_Pixel (S)
      color_value_fn: Less frequent of the two most common non-background colors. (Ex1: 3 Green, Ex2: 1 Blue)
      properties: Potentially changes color based on cardinal neighbors. Target of transformation.
    - type: Reactant_Pixel (R)
      color_value_fn: More frequent of the two most common non-background colors. (Ex1: 2 Red, Ex2: 4 Yellow)
      properties: Does not change color. Influences adjacent Subject_Pixels, causing S->R change.
    - type: Background_Pixel (B)
      color_value: 0
      properties: Does not change color. Influences adjacent Subject_Pixels, potentially causing S->B change.
  relationships:
    - type: Cardinal_Adjacency
      description: Interactions (color change) are determined by neighbors sharing an edge (N, S, E, W) in the input grid.
    - type: Protection (Hypothesized, Flawed)
      description: A hypothesized mechanism where S pixels are 'protected' from changing to B if connected via a chain of S pixels to an S->R changing pixel. This mechanism, as tested, failed validation. The true rule for S->B is uncertain.
  actions:
    - name: Subject_Color_Transformation
      target: Subject_Pixel (S)
      rules:
        - rule_id: S_to_R
          condition: The S pixel is cardinally adjacent to a Reactant_Pixel (R) in the input grid.
          result: The S pixel's color changes to R in the output grid. (Priority 1 - This rule appears consistent).
        - rule_id: S_to_B (Uncertain / Flawed Hypothesis)
          condition: The S pixel does NOT meet condition S_to_R, IS cardinally adjacent to a Background_Pixel (B) in the input grid, AND is NOT "protected" by connection to the S->R reaction (see Protection relationship).
          result: The S pixel's color changes to B in the output grid. (Priority 2 - The protection condition is not fully understood and previous implementations failed).
        - rule_id: S_remains_S
          condition: The S pixel does not meet the conditions for S_to_R or S_to_B.
          result: The S pixel's color remains S in the output grid.
      validation_note: The specific conditions defining "protection" against the S_to_B change could not be accurately determined from the examples, and implementations based on the 'protection chain' hypothesis failed validation.
