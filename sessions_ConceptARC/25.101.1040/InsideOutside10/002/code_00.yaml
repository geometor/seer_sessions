task_context:
  grid_properties:
    size: Variable (e.g., 12x12)
    background_color: White (0) - Identified as the most frequent color.
  objects:
    - type: Subject_Pixel
      color_name: Green (ex1), Blue (ex2)
      color_value_fn: Determined as the less frequent of the two most common non-background colors.
      properties: Potentially changes color based on cardinal neighbors.
    - type: Reactant_Pixel
      color_name: Red (ex1), Yellow (ex2)
      color_value_fn: Determined as the more frequent of the two most common non-background colors.
      properties: Does not change color. Influences adjacent Subject_Pixels.
    - type: Background_Pixel
      color_name: White
      color_value: 0
      properties: Does not change color. Influences adjacent Subject_Pixels.
  relationships:
    - type: Cardinal_Adjacency
      description: Interaction occurs between pixels sharing an edge (N, S, E, W).
    - type: Protection_Chain
      description: Subject_Pixels can be protected from changing to Background if they are part of a contiguous chain (cardinal adjacency) of other Subject_Pixels that ultimately connects to a Subject_Pixel changing to the Reactant color.
  actions:
    - name: Subject_Color_Transformation
      target: Subject_Pixel (S)
      rules:
        - condition: The S pixel is cardinally adjacent to a Reactant_Pixel (R) in the input grid.
          result: The S pixel's color changes to R in the output grid. (Priority 1)
        - condition: The S pixel is NOT adjacent to R, IS adjacent to Background_Pixel (B), AND is NOT "protected".
          result: The S pixel's color changes to B in the output grid. (Priority 2)
        - condition: The S pixel does not meet the conditions for changing to R or B.
          result: The S pixel's color remains S in the output grid.
      protection_definition: An S pixel P (not changing to R) is "protected" if it is cardinally adjacent to another S pixel P' which IS changing to R, OR if P is cardinally adjacent to another S pixel P'' which is itself "protected". Protection status is determined iteratively based on the input grid configuration.
