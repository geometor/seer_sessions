This rule has the highest priority.\n2.  **Protection:** An S pixel P (that is not changing to R) is considered \"protected\" if it is cardinally adjacent to another S pixel P' which IS changing to R (Rule 1), OR if P is cardinally adjacent to another S pixel P'' which is itself \"protected\". Protection propagates through contiguous S pixels originating from those adjacent to S->R pixels.\n3.  **Change to Background (B):** An S pixel changes to B if it is NOT changing to R (Rule 1), IS cardinally adjacent to a B pixel, AND is NOT \"protected\" (Rule 2).\n4.  **Remain Subject (S):** If an S pixel does not meet the conditions to change to R or B, it remains S.\n\n*Note: This implementation reflects the described logic, but validation against provided examples indicated this logic does not perfectly match the target transformation.*\n\"\"\"\n\ndef identify_colors(grid: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[int | None, int | None, int | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Background (B), Subject (S), and Reactant (R) colors based on frequency.\n    - B = most frequent.\n    - S = less frequent of top 2 non-B.\n    - R = more frequent of top 2 non-B.\n    Handles grids with < 3 colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = collections.Counter(cell for row in grid for cell in row)\n    \n    if not counts:\n        return 0, None, None # Default for empty grid: Background 0, S/R unknown\n\n    # Sort colors by count (descending), then color index (ascending)\n    sorted_counts = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))\n\n    # If fewer than 3 distinct colors are present\n    if len(sorted_counts) < 3:\n        background_color = sorted_counts[0][0]\n        if len(sorted_counts) == 1:\n             # Only background color exists\n             return background_color, None, None\n        else: # Exactly 2 colors\n             # Assume the second color is Subject, Reactant is undefined\n             subject_color = sorted_counts[1][0]\n             return background_color, subject_color, None \n\n    # Standard case: 3 or more colors\n    background_color = sorted_counts[0][0]\n    \n    # Isolate non-background colors and their counts\n    non_background_counts = {k: v for k, v in counts.items() if k != background_color}\n    \n    # Sort non-background colors by count (ascending), then color index (ascending)\n    # This helps determine S (less frequent) and R (more frequent) among the top 2\n    sorted_non_bg = sorted(non_background_counts.items(), key=lambda item: (item[1], item[0]))\n\n    # Assume S is the least frequent, R is the second least frequent (which is the most frequent if only 2 non-bg)\n    subject_color = sorted_non_bg[0][0]\n    reactant_color = sorted_non_bg[1][0]\n\n    # Double-check: Ensure R has a count >= S count based on original counts\n    # (This handles cases where counts might be equal, relying on color index sorting)\n    if counts[subject_color] > counts[reactant_color]:\n         subject_color, reactant_color = reactant_color, subject_color # Swap if S count > R count\n\n    return background_color, subject_color, reactant_color\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return []\n\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Colors (Background, Subject, Reactant)\n    background_color, subject_color, reactant_color = identify_colors(input_grid)\n\n    # If Subject or Reactant colors cannot be determined (e.g., < 3 colors),\n    # the transformation rules involving S and R cannot apply.
