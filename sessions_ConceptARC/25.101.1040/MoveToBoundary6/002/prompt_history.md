**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids are consistently 6x6. They contain a background of white pixels (0), a structure made of yellow pixels (4), and a single blue pixel (1).
2.  **Yellow Structure**: The yellow structure forms either a vertical line in the first column or a horizontal line in the first row.
3.  **Blue Pixel**: There is always exactly one blue pixel in the input grid. Its position varies.
4.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are also 6x6 and are entirely white (0) except for a single blue pixel (1).
5.  **Transformation**: The yellow structure disappears in the output. The single blue pixel from the input moves to a new position in the output grid. The final position of the blue pixel seems related to the orientation of the yellow structure and the initial position of the blue pixel.
6.  **Pattern**:
    *   When the yellow structure is a vertical line in the first column, the blue pixel moves to the top row (row 0), keeping its original column index.
    *   When the yellow structure is a horizontal line in the first row, the blue pixel moves to the last column (column 5), keeping its original row index.

    persistence: moves position in output
relationships:

    detail: The marker's initial position determines its final position based on the barrier's orientation.

    inputs:

    logic:
      - if barrier is vertical (at column 0): output position is (0, input_column)
      - if barrier is horizontal (at row 0): output position is (input_row, grid_width - 1)
  - name: generate_output_grid
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions

    process: create grid of specified dimensions filled with white (0), place blue (1) marker at calculated output position.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the coordinates (input\_row, input\_column) of the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid.
3.  Check if the first column (column 0) of the input grid consists entirely of yellow pixels (4) or contains at least one yellow pixel (indicating a vertical barrier).
4.  If a vertical yellow barrier exists in the first column:
    *   Set the output coordinates for the blue pixel to (0, input\_column).
5.  Else (if no vertical yellow barrier exists in the first column), check if the first row (row 0) of the input grid consists entirely of yellow pixels (4) or contains at least one yellow pixel (indicating a horizontal barrier).
6.  If a horizontal yellow barrier exists in the first row:
    *   Determine the width of the input grid.
    *   Set the output coordinates for the blue pixel to (input\_row, width - 1).
7.  Place the blue pixel (1) at the determined output coordinates in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
```python

"""
Identifies a single blue pixel (1) and a yellow barrier (4) in the input grid.
The yellow barrier is either a vertical line in the first column or a horizontal line in the first row.
If the barrier is vertical (column 0), the blue pixel moves to the top row (row 0) while retaining its original column index.
If the barrier is horizontal (row 0), the blue pixel moves to the last column (grid width - 1) while retaining its original row index.
The output grid is initialized as white (0), and only the final position of the blue pixel is marked.
