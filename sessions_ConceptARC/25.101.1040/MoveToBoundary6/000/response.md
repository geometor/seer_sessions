**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids are consistently 6x6. They contain a background of white pixels (0), a structure made of yellow pixels (4), and a single blue pixel (1).
2.  **Yellow Structure**: The yellow structure forms either a vertical line in the first column or a horizontal line in the first row.
3.  **Blue Pixel**: There is always exactly one blue pixel in the input grid. Its position varies.
4.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are also 6x6 and are entirely white (0) except for a single blue pixel (1).
5.  **Transformation**: The yellow structure disappears in the output. The single blue pixel from the input moves to a new position in the output grid. The final position of the blue pixel seems related to the orientation of the yellow structure and the initial position of the blue pixel.
6.  **Pattern**:
    *   When the yellow structure is a vertical line in the first column, the blue pixel moves to the top row (row 0), keeping its original column index.
    *   When the yellow structure is a horizontal line in the first row, the blue pixel moves to the last column (column 5), keeping its original row index.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size:
    fixed: true

    present: [white, blue, yellow] # 0, 1, 4

  - name: barrier
    color: yellow # 4
    shape: line
    orientation:
      - vertical (column 0)
      - horizontal (row 0)
    role: defines transformation axis
    persistence: disappears in output
  - name: marker
    color: blue # 1
    count: 1
    shape: single pixel
    role: primary object being transformed
    persistence: moves position in output
relationships:
  - type: position_relative_to_barrier
    object1: marker
    object2: barrier
    detail: The marker's initial position determines its final position based on the barrier's orientation.
actions:
  - name: identify_barrier_orientation
    input: input grid
    output: orientation (vertical or horizontal)
  - name: locate_marker
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates (row, column)
  - name: calculate_output_position
    inputs:
      - marker_input_coordinates
      - barrier_orientation
      - grid_dimensions
    logic:
      - if barrier is vertical (at column 0): output position is (0, input_column)
      - if barrier is horizontal (at row 0): output position is (input_row, grid_width - 1)
  - name: generate_output_grid
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions
      - marker_output_coordinates
    process: create grid of specified dimensions filled with white (0), place blue (1) marker at calculated output position.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the coordinates (input\_row, input\_column) of the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid.
3.  Check if the first column (column 0) of the input grid consists entirely of yellow pixels (4) or contains at least one yellow pixel (indicating a vertical barrier).
4.  If a vertical yellow barrier exists in the first column:
    *   Set the output coordinates for the blue pixel to (0, input\_column).
5.  Else (if no vertical yellow barrier exists in the first column), check if the first row (row 0) of the input grid consists entirely of yellow pixels (4) or contains at least one yellow pixel (indicating a horizontal barrier).
6.  If a horizontal yellow barrier exists in the first row:
    *   Determine the width of the input grid.
    *   Set the output coordinates for the blue pixel to (input\_row, width - 1).
7.  Place the blue pixel (1) at the determined output coordinates in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
