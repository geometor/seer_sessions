"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identifies a single blue pixel (marker, color 1) and a solid yellow line (barrier, color 4) in the input grid.
2. The yellow barrier is either a solid vertical line occupying the entire first column (column 0) or a solid horizontal line occupying the entire first row (row 0).
3. The output grid is initialized as all white (color 0) with the same dimensions as the input.
4. If the yellow barrier is vertical (in column 0), the blue marker pixel is moved to the top row (row 0) while retaining its original column index.
5. If the yellow barrier is horizontal (in row 0), the blue marker pixel is moved to the last column (grid width - 1) while retaining its original row index.
6. The yellow barrier itself is not present in the output grid.
