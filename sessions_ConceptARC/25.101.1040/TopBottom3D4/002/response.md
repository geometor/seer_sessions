**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the presence of two objects and a transformation based on the color pair. However, it incorrectly classified the transformations for pairs {3, 4} (Green, Yellow) and {1, 5} (Blue, Gray) as 'color bleed'. The test results show these pairs, like {1, 2} (Blue, Red) and {4, 6} (Yellow, Magenta), actually follow a 'shift left' pattern.

Furthermore, the initial 'shift left' logic was incomplete. While it correctly moved the object with the lower color index (C_low) one step left, it failed to account for the interaction where the other object's color (C_high) fills the specific vacated cell previously occupied by C_low, if C_high was immediately to the right of that vacated cell in the input.

The strategy is to unify the transformation rule:
1.  The object with the lower color index (C_low) always attempts to shift one column to the left.
2.  Implement a refined 'shift' logic that handles the potential 'backfill' of the vacated space by the C_high color. This involves:
    a.  Identifying original C_low and C_high pixel locations.
    b.  Creating the output grid by first shifting C_low (clearing its original locations and painting its new locations).
    c.  Iterating through the original C_high pixels and checking if their *shifted left* position corresponds to an *original C_low* position. If so, paint C_high at that position in the output grid, potentially overwriting the background color left by the C_low shift.

**Metrics**

``` python
import numpy as np

def get_grid_metrics(grid):
    a = np.array(grid, dtype=int)
    dims = a.shape
    colors, counts = np.unique(a[a != 0], return_counts=True)
    color_map = dict(zip(colors, counts))
    non_white_pixels = a[a != 0]
    pixel_coords = {color: [] for color in colors}
    for r in range(dims[0]):
        for c in range(dims[1]):
            color_val = a[r,c]
            if color_val != 0:
                pixel_coords[color_val].append((r, c))

    return {

        "non_white_colors": sorted(colors.tolist()),

```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_interaction
components:
  - role: grid
    elements:
      - role: background
        color: white (0)
      - role: object
        count: 2 # Exactly two distinct non-white objects per grid
        properties:
          - color: non-white (1-9)
          - shape: variable
          - connectivity: contiguous pixels of the same color

relationships:
  - type: color_index_determinism
    description: The transformation depends on which of the two colors has the lower index.
    properties:
      - C_low: color with min(index(color1), index(color2))
      - C_high: color with max(index(color1), index(color2))
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects can be adjacent, separate, or one can enclose another. Adjacency influences the outcome of vacated space.

    description: |
      Performs a conditional shift-left operation on both objects based on C_low and C_high.
    logic: |
      1. Initialize output_grid by copying input_grid.
      2. Store the set of original coordinates for object_low (low_orig_coords).
      3. **Shift C_low:**
         a. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in low_orig_coords.
         b. Clear the original location in output_grid: output_grid[r][c] = 0.
         c. Calculate the new location (nr, nc) = (r, c - 1).
         d. If (nr, nc) is within grid bounds, paint the new location: output_grid[nr][nc] = C_low.
      4. **Conditionally Shift/Fill C_high:**
         a. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of object_high in the *input* grid.
         b. Calculate its potential 'shifted left' location (nr, nc) = (r, c - 1).
         c. If (nr, nc) is within grid bounds AND (nr, nc) exists in low_orig_coords:
            - Set output_grid[nr][nc] = C_high. This effectively fills the vacated spot with C_high.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two unique non-white colors present in the input grid. Determine the color with the lower index (C_low) and the color with the higher index (C_high).
2.  Find the set of all coordinate pairs `(r, c)` for pixels originally belonging to the C_low object (let this set be `low_orig_coords`).
3.  Create the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
4.  **Process C_low object:** Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in `low_orig_coords`:
    a.  Set the original location in the `output_grid` to white (0): `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
    b.  Calculate the potential new location `(nr, nc)` by shifting left: `(nr, nc) = (r, c - 1)`.
    c.  Check if the new column `nc` is valid (i.e., `nc >= 0`).
    d.  If `nc` is valid, set the color of the new location in the `output_grid` to C_low: `output_grid[nr][nc] = C_low`. (This overwrites any color previously at that location).
5.  **Process C_high object interaction:** Iterate through all coordinates `(r, c)` in the *input_grid* where the color is C_high:
    a.  Calculate the potential 'shifted left' location `(nr, nc)`: `(nr, nc) = (r, c - 1)`.
    b.  Check if the potential new column `nc` is valid (i.e., `nc >= 0`).
    c.  Check if this potential new location `(nr, nc)` was part of the original C_low object (i.e., if `(nr, nc)` is in the set `low_orig_coords`).
    d.  If both conditions (valid `nc` and `(nr, nc)` was original C_low position) are true, set the color at this location in the `output_grid` to C_high: `output_grid[nr][nc] = C_high`. (This may overwrite a background pixel left from step 4a, or potentially a C_low pixel painted in step 4d if C_low and C_high objects were adjacent vertically).
6.  Return the `output_grid`.
