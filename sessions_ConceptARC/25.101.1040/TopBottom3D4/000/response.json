            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves grids containing two distinct non-white colored objects. The transformation depends on the specific pair of colors present. There appear to be two main types of transformations:\n1.  **Object Shift:** One of the objects shifts its position horizontally (specifically, one column to the left). The object retains its color, overwriting pixels in its new path. Its original location becomes white.\n2.  **Color Bleed:** One object remains static, while specific pixels of the *other* object, adjacent to the first, change their color to match the first object's color.\n\nThe key seems to be identifying which color pair triggers which transformation, which object is affected, and the precise rule for the change (which object shifts, or exactly which pixels change color).\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   Each input grid contains exactly two non-white colors.\n*   The relative positions vary: one object might be lower-right, or one might be inside the other.\n*   The transformation rule depends on the specific pair of colors involved.\n    *   Pairs {Blue(1), Red(2)} and {Yellow(4), Magenta(6)} result in the object with the *lower* color index (Blue=1, Yellow=4) shifting left by one column.\n    *   Pairs {Green(3), Yellow(4)} and {Blue(1), Gray(5)} result in a \"color bleed\" where the color with the *lower* index (Green=3, Blue=1) changes the color of specific adjacent pixels of the *higher* index object.\n*   For the \"Color Bleed\" cases:\n    *   {Green(3), Yellow(4)}: Yellow pixels adjacent to Green pixels change to Green if the Green neighbor is directly to the right or directly below the Yellow pixel.\n    *   {Blue(1), Gray(5)}: The single Gray pixel adjacent to the Blue pixel(s) that has the minimum column index (with row index as a tie-breaker) changes to Blue.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```"

Calculate the new coordinates for Object_low by subtracting 1 from the column index of each original pixel.\n        v.
