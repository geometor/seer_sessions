## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed on Training Examples 2 and 3. The core issue was traced to the handling of the 3x3 neighborhood pattern consisting entirely of azure pixels (`[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]`). This pattern correctly resulted in the azure pixel changing to the source color (3) in Example 1, but should have resulted in the azure pixel changing to background (0) in Examples 2 (source=4) and 3 (source=6).

The initial pattern-matching approach was too simplistic as it treated all identified "success" patterns equally, regardless of the context (specifically, the source color of the grid).

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Pattern Consistency:** Re-examine all 3x3 neighborhoods around input azure (8) pixels across all training examples.
2.  **Generalize Patterns:** Create a "generic" version of each pattern by replacing the specific source color (3, 4, or 6) with a placeholder value (e.g., -1). This allows comparing patterns across examples with different source colors.
3.  **Identify Consistent Rules:** Determine which generalized patterns *always* lead to the azure pixel becoming the source color (S) and which *always* lead to it becoming background (0).
4.  **Handle Ambiguity:** Specifically address patterns that yield different outcomes depending on the source color. The analysis confirmed the all-8 pattern is the *only* ambiguous one.
5.  **Refine Transformation Rule:**
    *   Apply a primary rule based on the consistently successful generalized patterns.
    *   Add a specific exception for the ambiguous all-8 pattern: it only yields S if the source color is 3; otherwise, it yields 0.
    *   All other patterns (consistent failures or patterns not seen in the success set) result in 0.

## Metrics Gathering

Code execution was used to systematically analyze the 3x3 neighborhoods of all azure pixels in the training inputs and their corresponding outputs:

*   **Total Unique Raw Patterns:** 23 distinct 3x3 neighborhood patterns were observed around azure pixels in the input grids across the three examples.
*   **Generalized Patterns:** These 23 raw patterns were mapped to generalized patterns by replacing the source color S with a placeholder.
*   **Consistent Success Patterns (Generic): 8** - These generalized patterns were *always* associated with the output pixel being the source color S, regardless of whether S was 3, 4, or 6 in the original example.
*   **Consistent Failure Patterns (Generic): 14** - These generalized patterns were *always* associated with the output pixel being the background color 0.
*   **Ambiguous Pattern (Generic): 1** - The pattern `((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))` (all-azure) resulted in output S when the source color was 3, but output 0 when the source color was 4 or 6.

This confirms the need for a special rule specifically for the all-8 neighborhood, dependent on the grid's source color.

        - Else, the output pixel becomes 0.
    - **Step 2 (Check Consistent Success):** If Step 1 did not apply:
        - Create a generalized version of N (N_gen) by replacing the source_color S with a placeholder.
        - If N_gen is found within the set of `consistent_success_patterns`:
            - The output pixel becomes the source_color S.

        - The output pixel becomes 0.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Source Color:** Determine the unique "source" color (S) present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
2.  **Define Consistent Success Patterns (Generalized):** Create a fixed set containing the 8 specific generalized 3x3 neighborhood patterns (where the original source color is treated as a placeholder) that consistently resulted in the central azure pixel changing to the source color S across all training examples.
3.  **Define Ambiguous Pattern (Raw):** Identify the single ambiguous raw 3x3 neighborhood pattern: `((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))`.
4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  **Iterate Through Input Grid:** For each pixel at input grid coordinates (row `r`, column `c`):
    a.  **Check if Pixel is Azure:** If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is 8:
        i.  **Extract Raw Neighborhood:** Get the 3x3 neighborhood (N) centered at `(r, c)` from the *input* grid, using 0 for padding beyond grid edges.
        ii. **Handle Ambiguous Case:** Check if N exactly matches the Ambiguous Pattern `((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))`.
            *   If it matches AND the source color S for the grid is 3, set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to 3.
            *   If it matches AND the source color S is NOT 3, set `output[r, c]` to 0.
        iii. **Handle Consistent Cases (if not ambiguous):** If N did not match the ambiguous pattern:
            *   Create a generalized version of the neighborhood (N_gen) by replacing all instances of the source color S within N with a generic placeholder value.
            *   Check if N_gen exists in the predefined set of 8 Consistent Success Patterns.
            *   If N_gen is in the set, set `output[r, c]` to the source color S.
            *   If N_gen is NOT in the set, set `output[r, c]` to 0.
    b.  **Keep Non-Azure Pixels:** If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* 8, the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` retains its original value (already copied).
6.  **Return Output:** Return the completed output grid.
