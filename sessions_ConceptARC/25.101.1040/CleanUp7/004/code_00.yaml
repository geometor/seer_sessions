    rule: If input neighborhood matches this pattern, output is S if source_color == 3, otherwise output is 0.
  output_determination:
    - For an azure (8) pixel at (r, c):
    - Get its 3x3 input neighborhood (N).
    - **Step 1 (Check Ambiguous):** If N matches the ambiguous_pattern `((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))`:
        - If the grid's source_color is 3, the output pixel becomes 3.
        - Else, the output pixel becomes 0.
    - **Step 2 (Check Consistent Success):** If Step 1 did not apply:
        - Create a generalized version of N (N_gen) by replacing the source_color S with a placeholder.
        - If N_gen is found within the set of `consistent_success_patterns`:
            - The output pixel becomes the source_color S.
    - **Step 3 (Default Failure):** If neither Step 1 nor Step 2 applied:
        - The output pixel becomes 0.
