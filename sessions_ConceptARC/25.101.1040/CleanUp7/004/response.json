            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed on Training Examples 2 and 3. The core issue was traced to the handling of the 3x3 neighborhood pattern consisting entirely of azure pixels (`[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]`). This pattern correctly resulted in the azure pixel changing to the source color (3) in Example 1, but should have resulted in the azure pixel changing to background (0) in Examples 2 (source=4) and 3 (source=6).\n\nThe initial pattern-matching approach was too simplistic as it treated all identified \"success\" patterns equally, regardless of the context (specifically, the source color of the grid).\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pattern Consistency:** Re-examine all 3x3 neighborhoods around input azure (8) pixels across all training examples.\n2.  **Generalize Patterns:** Create a \"generic\" version of each pattern by replacing the specific source color (3, 4, or 6) with a placeholder value (e.g., -1). This allows comparing patterns across examples with different source colors.\n3.  **Identify Consistent Rules:** Determine which generalized patterns *always* lead to the azure pixel becoming the source color (S) and which *always* lead to it becoming background (0).\n4.  **Handle Ambiguity:** Specifically address patterns that yield different outcomes depending on the source color. The analysis confirmed the all-8 pattern is the *only* ambiguous one.\n5.  **Refine Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Apply a primary rule based on the consistently successful generalized patterns.\n    *   Add a specific exception for the ambiguous all-8 pattern: it only yields S if the source color is 3; otherwise, it yields 0.\n    *   All other patterns (consistent failures or patterns not seen in the success set) result in 0.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nCode execution was used to systematically analyze the 3x3 neighborhoods of all azure pixels in the training inputs and their corresponding outputs:\n\n*   **Total Unique Raw Patterns:** 23 distinct 3x3 neighborhood patterns were observed around azure pixels in the input grids across the three examples.\n*   **Generalized Patterns:** These 23 raw patterns were mapped to generalized patterns by replacing the source color S with a placeholder.\n*   **Consistent Success Patterns (Generic): 8** - These generalized patterns were *always* associated with the output pixel being the source color S, regardless of whether S was 3, 4, or 6 in the original example.\n*   **Consistent Failure Patterns (Generic): 14** - These generalized patterns were *always* associated with the output pixel being the background color 0.\n*   **Ambiguous Pattern (Generic): 1** - The pattern `((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))` (all-azure) resulted in output S when the source color was 3, but output 0 when the source color was 4 or 6.\n\nThis confirms the need for a special rule specifically for the all-8 neighborhood, dependent on the grid's source color.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
