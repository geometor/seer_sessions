Define Success Patterns per Source Color: Establish distinct sets of raw 3x3 \n   input neighborhood patterns (tuples, padded with 0) for each source color (S=3, S=4, S=6) \n   observed in training. A pattern is included in the set for S if, in the training data, \n   an azure (8) pixel with that input neighborhood transformed into color S in the output.\n\n2. Identify Source Color: For the given input grid, find the unique color S that is not 0 (white) or 8 (azure).\n\n3. Initialize Output: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.\n\n4. Iterate and Transform: Process each pixel (r, c) in the input grid:\n   a. If the input pixel is azure (8):\n      i. Extract the raw 3x3 input neighborhood N (as a tuple) centered at (r, c), padding with 0.\n      ii. Select the predefined set of success patterns corresponding to the identified source color S.\n      iii. If N exists within the selected pattern set for S:\n          - Set the output pixel at (r, c) to S.\n      iv. Otherwise (if N is not in the set for S):\n          - Set the output pixel at (r, c) to 0 (white).\n   b. If the input pixel is not azure (8), it remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5.
