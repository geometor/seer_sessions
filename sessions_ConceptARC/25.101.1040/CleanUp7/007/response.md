Transformation Rule: Source-Color-Specific Raw Neighborhood Match

1. Define Success Patterns per Source Color: Establish distinct sets of raw 3x3 
   input neighborhood patterns (tuples, padded with 0) for each source color (S=3, S=4, S=6) 
   observed in training. A pattern is included in the set for S if, in the training data, 
   an azure (8) pixel with that input neighborhood transformed into color S in the output.

2. Identify Source Color: For the given input grid, find the unique color S that is not 0 (white) or 8 (azure).

3. Initialize Output: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.

4. Iterate and Transform: Process each pixel (r, c) in the input grid:
   a. If the input pixel is azure (8):
      i. Extract the raw 3x3 input neighborhood N (as a tuple) centered at (r, c), padding with 0.
      ii. Select the predefined set of success patterns corresponding to the identified source color S.
      iii. If N exists within the selected pattern set for S:
          - Set the output pixel at (r, c) to S.
      iv. Otherwise (if N is not in the set for S):
          - Set the output pixel at (r, c) to 0 (white).
   b. If the input pixel is not azure (8), it remains unchanged in the output grid.

5. Return Output: Return the final transformed grid.
