All non-azure pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n5.  **Modification Rule:** Azure pixels in the input are changed to *either* the source color (C) or white (0) in the output.\n6.  **Spatial Dependency:** The decision to change an azure pixel to C or 0 depends on its spatial relationship (adjacency/neighborhood) with the source color pixels (C) in the *input* grid. Azure pixels closer to or adjacent to source color pixels are more likely to be affected.\n7.  **Pattern of Change:** The azure pixels that change to the source color C form specific, often sparse, patterns within the original azure area. These patterns don't simply replicate the shape of the adjacent source objects, nor do they seem to follow a straightforward rule like \"change if adjacent\" or \"change based on neighbor count\". There seems to be a more complex local condition determining the change. The pixel at (4,5) in train\\_1 is particularly informative, as it changes to green despite having no green neighbors, suggesting the rule considers more than immediate adjacency or that some form of propagation or neighborhood pattern matching is involved.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

Apply a specific condition based on the colors present in this input neighborhood.

If the condition is met, set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to the source color C.\n    d.  If the condition is not met, set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to white (0).\n5.  If the color of the input pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* azure (8), keep its color unchanged in the output grid (`output[r, c] = input[r, c]`).\n6.  Return the final output grid."
