Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the unique 'source' color (S) in the input grid, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
2. Define a fixed set of 8 specific 'generalized' 3x3 neighborhood patterns. These patterns represent input neighborhoods where the source color S is replaced by a placeholder (-1), and which consistently resulted in the central azure pixel changing to S across all training examples.
3. Define the specific 'ambiguous' raw 3x3 neighborhood pattern: ((8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8)).
4. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
6. If the input pixel is azure (8):
   a. Extract its raw 3x3 neighborhood (N_raw) from the input grid, using 0 for padding.
   b. Convert N_raw to a tuple (N_raw_tuple).
   c. Check if N_raw_tuple matches the ambiguous pattern:
      i. If it matches AND the grid's source color S is 3, set the output pixel to 3.
      ii. If it matches AND S is NOT 3, set the output pixel to 0.
   d. If N_raw_tuple did not match the ambiguous pattern:
      i. Create a generalized version of the neighborhood tuple (N_gen_tuple) by replacing all occurrences of S with -1.
      ii. Check if N_gen_tuple exists in the predefined set of consistent success patterns.
      iii. If it exists, set the output pixel to S.
      iv. If it does not exist, set the output pixel to 0.
7. Non-azure pixels remain unchanged.
8. Return the final output grid.
