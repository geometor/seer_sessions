            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt used a generalized pattern matching approach with a specific exception for the all-azure neighborhood. This failed on examples 1 and 2, indicating the generalization was incorrect. The fact that the same generalized pattern `((-1, -1, -1), (8, 8, 8), (8, 8, 8))` sometimes leads to output S (Ex 1, pixel (3,5)) and sometimes to output 0 (Ex 2, pixel (3,5)) confirms that the specific source color (S) must be considered as part of the pattern itself, not just as a placeholder for generalization or solely for the ambiguous all-8 case.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to matching exact, *raw* 3x3 neighborhood patterns. We need to determine, for each specific source color (S=3, S=4, S=6) encountered in the training set, precisely which raw input neighborhoods centered on an azure pixel (8) result in that pixel becoming S in the output.\n\n1.  **Systematic Raw Pattern Extraction per Source Color:** Analyze each training example again. For a given source color S, collect all unique raw 3x3 input neighborhoods where the input pixel is 8 and the output pixel is S.\n2.  **Store Patterns by Source Color:** Maintain separate sets of these \"success\" patterns, one set for each source color observed (3, 4, 6).\n3.  **Refine Transformation Rule:** The rule becomes:\n    *   Identify the source color S of the input grid.\n    *   For each azure pixel (8) in the input:\n        *   Extract its raw 3x3 input neighborhood N.\n        *   Check if N is present in the specific set of success patterns associated *with that particular source color S*.\n        *   If yes, the output pixel becomes S.\n        *   If no, the output pixel becomes 0.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this source-color-specific raw pattern matching.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nThe following code execution precisely identifies the raw 3x3 input neighborhood patterns that lead to a successful transformation (8 -> S) for each source color (S) observed in the training data.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
