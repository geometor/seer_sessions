"""
The transformation rule operates on a grid containing a background color (white, 0), 
a target color (azure, 8), and a single unique 'source' color (S). 
The goal is to determine, for each azure pixel in the input grid, whether it 
should become the source color S or the background color 0 in the output grid. 
All non-azure pixels remain unchanged.

The decision is based on the 3x3 neighborhood of each azure pixel in the input grid.
If the exact 3x3 pattern centered on an azure pixel matches one of a specific set 
of predefined 'target patterns' derived from the training examples, the azure pixel 
is replaced by the source color S. Otherwise, the azure pixel is replaced by the 
background color 0.

The target patterns are identified by observing which 3x3 neighborhoods around 
azure pixels in the training inputs lead to those pixels becoming the source 
color in the corresponding outputs.
