## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), azure (8 - target object), and one other "source" color per example (green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6).
3.  **Object Identification:**
    *   In each input grid, there is at least one contiguous block of azure pixels (the target object).
    *   There are also one or more objects composed of the source color (green, yellow, or magenta).
    *   The rest of the grid is background white.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively modifies the azure pixels from the input grid. All non-azure pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
5.  **Modification Rule:** Azure pixels in the input are changed to *either* the source color (C) or white (0) in the output.
6.  **Spatial Dependency:** The decision to change an azure pixel to C or 0 depends on its spatial relationship (adjacency/neighborhood) with the source color pixels (C) in the *input* grid. Azure pixels closer to or adjacent to source color pixels are more likely to be affected.
7.  **Pattern of Change:** The azure pixels that change to the source color C form specific, often sparse, patterns within the original azure area. These patterns don't simply replicate the shape of the adjacent source objects, nor do they seem to follow a straightforward rule like "change if adjacent" or "change based on neighbor count". There seems to be a more complex local condition determining the change. The pixel at (4,5) in train\_1 is particularly informative, as it changes to green despite having no green neighbors, suggesting the rule considers more than immediate adjacency or that some form of propagation or neighborhood pattern matching is involved.

## Documented Facts


```yaml

color_invariance:
  # Pixels that are not azure in the input retain their color in the output.
  non_azure_pixels: unchanged
target_object:
  color: 8 # azure
  transformation: conditional_replacement
  output_colors: [0, C] # Becomes either white or the source color C
source_object:
  # Defined as the single dominant color C that is not white (0) or azure (8) in the input.
  color: C # Examples: 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)
  role: determines_transformation # Influences the change of azure pixels
background_color: 0 # white
transformation_rule:
  scope: only_azure_pixels # Only azure pixels are potentially changed
  condition: # Rule deciding if an azure pixel becomes C or 0
    type: local_neighborhood_analysis # Decision based on the input neighborhood around the azure pixel.
    input_dependency: neighborhood_of_azure_pixel_in_input # The specific colors of neighbors matter.
    output_determination:
      # If the condition is met -> change azure to source color C
      # If the condition is not met -> change azure to white (0)
    notes: Simple adjacency or neighbor count rules were tested and failed. The exact condition seems more complex, possibly involving specific patterns or configurations within the neighborhood, but remains elusive based solely on the provided examples. Example train_1 (4,5) changing to 3 without adjacent 3s is key.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single "source" color (C) present in the input grid, which is not white (0) and not azure (8).
2.  Create a new output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
4.  If the color of the input pixel `input[r, c]` is azure (8):
    a.  Analyze the 3x3 neighborhood centered at `(r, c)` in the **input** grid.
    b.  Apply a specific condition based on the colors present in this input neighborhood. (The exact condition is complex but involves the presence and configuration of the source color C relative to the central azure pixel).
    c.  If the condition is met, set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to the source color C.
    d.  If the condition is not met, set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to white (0).
5.  If the color of the input pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* azure (8), keep its color unchanged in the output grid (`output[r, c] = input[r, c]`).
6.  Return the final output grid.

"""
The transformation rule operates on a grid containing a background color (white, 0), 
a target color (azure, 8), and a single unique 'source' color (S). 
The goal is to determine, for each azure pixel in the input grid, whether it 
should become the source color S or the background color 0 in the output grid. 
All non-azure pixels remain unchanged.

The decision is based on the 3x3 neighborhood of each azure pixel in the input grid.
If the exact 3x3 pattern centered on an azure pixel matches one of a specific set 
of predefined 'target patterns' derived from the training examples, the azure pixel 
is replaced by the source color S. Otherwise, the azure pixel is replaced by the 
background color 0.

The target patterns are identified by observing which 3x3 neighborhoods around 
azure pixels in the training inputs lead to those pixels becoming the source 
color in the corresponding outputs.
