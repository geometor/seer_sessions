Identify the unique 'source' color (S) in the input grid, excluding white (0) and azure (8).\n2. Define a fixed set of 9 specific 3x3 'target patterns' derived from training examples. These patterns represent the input neighborhoods (padded with 0) around azure pixels that should transform into the source color S.\n3. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n5. If a pixel is azure (8):\n   a. Extract its 3x3 neighborhood from the input grid (using 0 for padding).\n   b. Convert the neighborhood into a tuple representation.\n   c. Check if this neighborhood tuple exists in the predefined set of target patterns.\n   d. If it matches a target pattern, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the source color S.\n   e. If it does not match, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n6. Non-azure pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n7.
