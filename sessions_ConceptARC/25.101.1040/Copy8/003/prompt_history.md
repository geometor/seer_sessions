Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input contains a red shape above a blue rectangle on the left, and just a blue rectangle on the right. The blue rectangles appear identical in shape and size. The background is white.
    *   Output retains all elements from the input and adds a copy of the red shape above the right blue rectangle. The position of the copied red shape relative to the right blue rectangle mirrors the position of the original red shape relative to the left blue rectangle.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input contains a yellow '8' shape above a green 'T' shape on the left, and just a yellow '8' shape on the right. The yellow '8' shapes appear identical. The background is white.
    *   Output retains all elements from the input and adds a copy of the green 'T' shape below the right yellow '8'. The position of the copied green shape relative to the right yellow '8' mirrors the position of the original green shape relative to the left yellow '8'.

**Common Pattern:**
The core idea seems to be pattern completion based on symmetry or repetition. The grid contains pairs of identical "anchor" objects (blue rectangles in Ex1, yellow '8's in Ex2). One anchor object has an associated object ("source" object - red shape in Ex1, green shape in Ex2) positioned vertically relative to it. If the other anchor object ("target" anchor) is missing this associated object in the same relative position, the source object is copied and placed there. The relative vertical and horizontal positioning between the source and anchor is preserved during the copy operation relative to the target anchor.

**YAML Fact Document:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct non-background colored objects in the input grid, noting their color, shape, size, and bounding box position.
3.  Search for pairs of objects ("anchor pairs") that are identical in color, shape, and size but are located at different positions within the grid.
4.  For each identified anchor pair:
    a.  Designate one anchor as the "reference anchor" and the other as the "target anchor". (Consistency is needed, e.g., always pick the top-most or left-most as reference).
    b.  Search for a "source object" that is located immediately above or immediately below the reference anchor (potentially separated by background pixels, but vertically aligned).
    c.  If a source object is found:
        i.  Calculate the relative position (row offset, column offset) between the top-left corner of the source object's bounding box and the top-left corner of the reference anchor's bounding box.
        ii. Check if an object identical to the source object already exists in the output grid at the calculated relative position with respect to the *target* anchor's top-left corner.
        iii. If no such object exists at the target location, copy the source object's pixels and paste them onto the output grid at the calculated relative position with respect to the target anchor's top-left corner. Ensure pasting only overwrites background (white) pixels in the target area.
5.  Repeat step 4 for all identified anchor pairs and their associated source objects.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Execution Error: 'ObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'height'

## Example 2:
Error: Execution Error: 'ObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'height'
## Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: finding identical "anchor" objects and copying an associated "source" object from one anchor's vicinity to the other's if it's missing, maintaining the relative spatial relationship.

The provided code failed during execution due to an `AttributeError: 'ObjectInfo' object has no attribute 'height'`. This specific error stems from an implementation detail within the `ObjectInfo` class: the `_extract_shape` method attempts to use `self.height` and `self.width` before these attributes have been assigned in the `__init__` method. The calculation of `bbox`, `height`, and `width` needs to precede the call to `_extract_shape`.

While this error prevented the validation of the core transformation logic against the examples, the underlying concept described in the initial Natural Language Program appears sound and consistent with the visual patterns in the training pairs. The strategy moving forward involves correcting the implementation bug and then re-validating the logic. The core hypothesis about identifying anchor pairs, finding relative source objects, and completing the pattern remains the primary focus.

## Metrics

Due to the execution error occurring during object initialization, metrics about identified objects, pairs, or relative positions could not be gathered from the failed code execution. The code needs to be corrected before such metrics can be accurately collected and analyzed.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Copy a 'source' object found relative to a 'reference anchor' object to the same relative position next to an identical 'target anchor' object, if that position is currently empty or background.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default color filling empty space, which can be overwritten.
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of non-background colored pixels, identified using 8-way connectivity.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates comprising the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) enclosing the object.
      - top_left: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
      - shape: A 2D list representing the object's pattern relative to its top-left corner.
      - size: The height and width derived from the bounding box.

relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Two objects are identical if they have the same color and the same shape (relative pixel pattern).
    usage: Used to find 'anchor pairs'.
  - type: relative_position
    description: The spatial offset between two objects, calculated using their top-left bounding box corners.
    properties:
      - delta_row: Difference in row index (source.top_left[0] - anchor.top_left[0]).
      - delta_col: Difference in column index (source.top_left[1] - anchor.top_left[1]).
    usage: Used to define the position of a 'source' object relative to a 'reference anchor' and to determine the target placement location relative to the 'target anchor'.

actions:
  - type: find_objects
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous objects (non-background color) in the input grid. Calculate their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box, top_left, shape, size).

  - type: check_target_area
    description: Verify if an object identical to the `source_candidate` already exists at the `calculate_target_position`.
  - type: copy_and_paste
    description: If the `check_target_area` reveals the source object is missing, copy the `source_candidate`'s shape and color and paste it onto the output grid at the `calculate_target_position`. Pasting should only overwrite background (color 0) pixels.
  - type: apply_symmetrically
    description: Repeat the process of identifying relative sources, calculating target positions, checking, and pasting, but swap the roles of `anchor1` and `anchor2` (i.e., find sources relative to `anchor2` and potentially copy them relative to `anchor1`).

example_1_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Blue rectangles (color 1). `anchor1` is left, `anchor2` is right.
  - relative_source (for anchor1): Red shape (color 2). `delta_row` is negative (above), `delta_col` is approx zero.
  - target_position (for anchor2): Calculated position above `anchor2`.
  - check_target_area: No red shape exists there initially.
  - action: Copy red shape to the target position above `anchor2`.

example_2_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Yellow '8' shapes (color 4). `anchor1` is left, `anchor2` is right.
  - relative_source (for anchor1): Green 'T' shape (color 3). `delta_row` is positive (below), `delta_col` is approx zero.
  - target_position (for anchor2): Calculated position below `anchor2`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, the set of pixel coordinates it occupies, its bounding box, its top-left coordinate, and its shape (pattern relative to the top-left).
3.  Find all pairs of objects (`anchor1`, `anchor2`) that are identical (same color and shape) but occupy different positions in the grid.
4.  For each identified anchor pair (`anchor1`, `anchor2`):
    a.  Iterate through all other objects (`source_obj`) in the grid (those not identical to `anchor1` or `anchor2`).
    b.  **Check Anchor 1 as Reference:**
        i.  Calculate the relative position (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) of `source_obj`'s top-left corner with respect to `anchor1`'s top-left corner.
        ii. Calculate the target top-left position by applying this same (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) offset to `anchor2`'s top-left corner.
        iii. Check if an object identical in shape and color to `source_obj` already exists at this target top-left position in the *output grid*.
        iv. If no such object exists, paste the `source_obj`'s shape and color onto the output grid starting at the target top-left position, only overwriting background (color 0) pixels.
    c.  **Check Anchor 2 as Reference (Symmetry):**
        i.  Calculate the relative position (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) of `source_obj`'s top-left corner with respect to `anchor2`'s top-left corner.
        ii. Calculate the target top-left position by applying this same (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) offset to `anchor1`'s top-left corner.
        iii. Check if an object identical in shape and color to `source_obj` already exists at this target top-left position in the *output grid*.
        iv. If no such object exists, paste the `source_obj`'s shape and color onto the output grid starting at the target top-left position, only overwriting background (color 0) pixels.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
