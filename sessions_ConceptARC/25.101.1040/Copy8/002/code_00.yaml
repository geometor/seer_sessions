task_description: Copy a 'source' object found relative to a 'reference anchor' object to the same relative position next to an identical 'target anchor' object, if that position is currently empty or background.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default color filling empty space, which can be overwritten.
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of non-background colored pixels, identified using 8-way connectivity.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates comprising the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) enclosing the object.
      - top_left: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
      - shape: A 2D list representing the object's pattern relative to its top-left corner.
      - size: The height and width derived from the bounding box.

relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Two objects are identical if they have the same color and the same shape (relative pixel pattern).
    usage: Used to find 'anchor pairs'.
  - type: relative_position
    description: The spatial offset between two objects, calculated using their top-left bounding box corners.
    properties:
      - delta_row: Difference in row index (source.top_left[0] - anchor.top_left[0]).
      - delta_col: Difference in column index (source.top_left[1] - anchor.top_left[1]).
    usage: Used to define the position of a 'source' object relative to a 'reference anchor' and to determine the target placement location relative to the 'target anchor'.

actions:
  - type: find_objects
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous objects (non-background color) in the input grid. Calculate their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box, top_left, shape, size).
  - type: find_anchor_pairs
    description: Identify all pairs of objects within the grid that are identical (same color, same shape) but located at different positions.
  - type: identify_relative_source
    description: For each object (`source_candidate`) that is not part of a given anchor pair (`anchor1`, `anchor2`), calculate its relative position (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) with respect to `anchor1`.
  - type: calculate_target_position
    description: For a `source_candidate` relative to `anchor1`, calculate the corresponding target position relative to `anchor2` using the same (`delta_row`, `delta_col`) offset from `anchor2.top_left`.
  - type: check_target_area
    description: Verify if an object identical to the `source_candidate` already exists at the `calculate_target_position`.
  - type: copy_and_paste
    description: If the `check_target_area` reveals the source object is missing, copy the `source_candidate`'s shape and color and paste it onto the output grid at the `calculate_target_position`. Pasting should only overwrite background (color 0) pixels.
  - type: apply_symmetrically
    description: Repeat the process of identifying relative sources, calculating target positions, checking, and pasting, but swap the roles of `anchor1` and `anchor2` (i.e., find sources relative to `anchor2` and potentially copy them relative to `anchor1`).

example_1_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Blue rectangles (color 1). `anchor1` is left, `anchor2` is right.
  - relative_source (for anchor1): Red shape (color 2). `delta_row` is negative (above), `delta_col` is approx zero.
  - target_position (for anchor2): Calculated position above `anchor2`.
  - check_target_area: No red shape exists there initially.
  - action: Copy red shape to the target position above `anchor2`.

example_2_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Yellow '8' shapes (color 4). `anchor1` is left, `anchor2` is right.
  - relative_source (for anchor1): Green 'T' shape (color 3). `delta_row` is positive (below), `delta_col` is approx zero.
  - target_position (for anchor2): Calculated position below `anchor2`.
  - check_target_area: No green shape exists there initially.
  - action: Copy green shape to the target position below `anchor2`.
