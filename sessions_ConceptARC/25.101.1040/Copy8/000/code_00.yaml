task_description: Complete vertical patterns based on paired anchor objects.

elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default color filling empty space.
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of non-background colored pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels.
      - shape: The spatial arrangement of the pixels.
      - size: The height and width of the object's bounding box.
      - position: The row and column coordinates of the object (e.g., top-left corner or bounding box).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative positioning between objects.
    properties:
      - above: Object A is vertically higher than Object B.
      - below: Object A is vertically lower than Object B.
      - aligned: Objects share some vertical or horizontal coordinates.
      - vertical_offset: The difference in row indices between two objects.
      - horizontal_offset: The difference in column indices between two objects.
  - type: identity
    description: Two objects being identical.
    properties:
      - same_color: Objects have the same color value.
      - same_shape: Objects have the same pixel arrangement relative to their top-left corners.
      - same_size: Objects have the same bounding box dimensions.

actions:
  - type: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - type: find_pairs
    description: Identify pairs of objects that are identical (same color, shape, size) but in different locations. These are 'anchor' pairs.
  - type: find_associated_object
    description: For one anchor ('reference'), find another object ('source') positioned directly above or below it.
  - type: calculate_relative_position
    description: Determine the row and column offset between the source object and the reference anchor (e.g., top-left to top-left).
  - type: check_completion
    description: Verify if the other anchor ('target') already has an identical object in the same relative position.
  - type: copy_object
    description: Create a duplicate of the source object's pixels.
  - type: place_object
    description: Position the copied object relative to the target anchor using the calculated relative position, overwriting only background pixels.

example_1_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Blue rectangles (color 1).
  - reference_anchor: Left blue rectangle.
  - target_anchor: Right blue rectangle.
  - source_object: Red shape (color 2).
  - relative_position: Source is above reference.
  - completion_check: Target does not have a red shape above it.
  - action: Copy red shape and place it above the target anchor.

example_2_specifics:
  - anchor_pair: Yellow '8' shapes (color 4).
  - reference_anchor: Left yellow '8'.
  - target_anchor: Right yellow '8'.
  - source_object: Green 'T' shape (color 3).
  - relative_position: Source is below reference.
  - completion_check: Target does not have a green shape below it.
  - action: Copy green shape and place it below the target anchor.
