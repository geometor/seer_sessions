            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input contains a red shape above a blue rectangle on the left, and just a blue rectangle on the right. The blue rectangles appear identical in shape and size. The background is white.\n    *   Output retains all elements from the input and adds a copy of the red shape above the right blue rectangle. The position of the copied red shape relative to the right blue rectangle mirrors the position of the original red shape relative to the left blue rectangle.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input contains a yellow '8' shape above a green 'T' shape on the left, and just a yellow '8' shape on the right. The yellow '8' shapes appear identical. The background is white.\n    *   Output retains all elements from the input and adds a copy of the green 'T' shape below the right yellow '8'. The position of the copied green shape relative to the right yellow '8' mirrors the position of the original green shape relative to the left yellow '8'.\n\n**Common Pattern:**\nThe core idea seems to be pattern completion based on symmetry or repetition. The grid contains pairs of identical \"anchor\" objects (blue rectangles in Ex1, yellow '8's in Ex2). One anchor object has an associated object (\"source\" object - red shape in Ex1, green shape in Ex2) positioned vertically relative to it. If the other anchor object (\"target\" anchor) is missing this associated object in the same relative position, the source object is copied and placed there. The relative vertical and horizontal positioning between the source and anchor is preserved during the copy operation relative to the target anchor.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Designate one anchor as the \"reference anchor\" and the other as the \"target anchor\". (Consistency is needed, e.g., always pick the top-most or left-most as reference).\n    b.  Search for a \"source object\" that is located immediately above or immediately below the reference anchor (potentially separated by background pixels, but vertically aligned).\n    c.  If a source object is found:\n        i.  Calculate the relative position (row offset, column offset) between the top-left corner of the source object's bounding box and the top-left corner of the reference anchor's bounding box.\n        ii. Check if an object identical to the source object already exists in the output grid at the calculated relative position with respect to the *target* anchor's top-left corner.\n        iii. If no such object exists at the target location, copy the source object's pixels and paste them onto the output grid at the calculated relative position with respect to the target anchor's top-left corner. Ensure pasting only overwrites background (white) pixels in the target area.\n5.  Repeat step 4 for all identified anchor pairs and their associated source objects.\n6.
