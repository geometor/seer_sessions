"""
The transformation identifies pairs of identical objects (anchors) in the input grid. 
For each anchor pair, it finds any other object (source) that is positioned 
vertically relative to one of the anchors (the reference anchor). 
If the second anchor (the target anchor) does not have an identical source object 
in the same relative position, the source object is copied and placed there. 
The placement only overwrites background pixels (color 0).
