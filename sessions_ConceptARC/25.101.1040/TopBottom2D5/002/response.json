            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis identified a potential pattern involving selecting 'T' shapes, or 'L' shapes as a fallback, based on their vertical position (lowest topmost point). However, the provided code failed with a syntax error before it could be fully tested against the examples. The immediate priority is to correct the syntax error in the shape definition within the `_is_t_shape` function.\n\nOnce the syntax is corrected, the core strategy remains:\n1.  Implement robust functions to identify specific 'T' (inverted T, 5 pixels) and 'L' (4 pixels, 8 orientations) shapes based on the patterns observed in the examples.\n2.  Find all objects in the input grid.\n3.  Classify each object as 'T', 'L', or 'Other'.\n4.  Apply the selection logic: If 'T' shapes exist, select the one with the highest `top_row` index (lowest on the grid). If no 'T' shapes exist but 'L' shapes do, select the 'L' shape with the highest `top_row` index.\n5.  Construct the output grid containing only the selected shape.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

            "text": "**Assessment of Metrics and Refined Strategy**\n\nThe metric gathering and verification reveal critical flaws in the initial hypothesis and shape classification:\n\n1.  **Shape Classification Issues:**\n    *   The 'T' shape classification worked correctly for `train_1`, identifying the specific inverted T shape.\n    *   The 'L' shape classification (both explicit patterns and the structural check) failed to identify the shapes in `train_2` as 'L' shapes. Re-examining `train_2`'s input shapes:\n        *   Green (3): `(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)`. BBox W=3, H=2. Relative: `{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0)}`. This *is* one of the L shapes defined earlier. The structural check `check_l_shape_structure` must be flawed. Let's re-trace `check_l_shape_structure` for this shape:\n            *   (0,0): Neighbors (0,1), (1,0). Count = 2. (Corner)\n            *   (0,1): Neighbors (0,0), (0,2). Count = 2. (Corner?) -> Error here. An L has only one corner.\n            *   (0,2): Neighbors (0,1). Count = 1. (End)\n            *   (1,0): Neighbors (0,0). Count = 1. (End)\n            *   Issue: Multiple pixels have 2 neighbors. The structural check is too simple or incorrect. Let's revert to checking against the 8 explicit relative patterns.\n    *   Similarly, the shapes in `train_3` (Yellow, Azure, Green) were not classified correctly. They appear to be combinations or different structures. Example 3's Azure and Green shapes, previously thought to be 'T' shapes, are actually 8-pixel shapes.\n\n2.  **Rule Failure:** The rule \"select lowest T, else lowest L\" failed for `train_2` and `train_3`.\n    *   In `train_2`, no shapes were identified as T or L (incorrectly), so the rule predicted no output, but the actual output was the lowest shape overall (Red, top_row=8).\n    *   In `train_3`, no shapes were identified as T or L, rule predicted no output, but the actual output was the lowest shape overall (Green, top_row=7).\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule seems much simpler than initially thought. It doesn't appear to depend on specific 'T' or 'L' shapes. Instead, it looks like it selects the object whose highest point is lowest on the grid, regardless of its shape.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Find all distinct, contiguous, non-background objects in the input grid.\n2.  For each object, determine its topmost row index (`min_r`).\n3.  Identify the object(s) with the maximum `min_r` value (i.e., the object(s) starting lowest on the grid).\n4.  If there's a single object that is lowest, select that object.\n5.  (Hypothesis Extension: If there's a tie for the lowest position, there might be a secondary tie-breaking rule, possibly based on color index, left-most position, or size, but the examples don't explicitly show a tie scenario). Assume for now there are no ties or the first one found is sufficient.\n6.  Create an output grid filled with the background color.\n7.  Draw the selected lowest object onto the output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Based on results, it seems the object found last (higher ID if scanning top-down) might be chosen in case of a tie (e.g., Example 2, Red L is chosen over Azure L, Green L, Orange L - Red L likely found last). Let's refine: Select the object with the maximum `top_row`. If there are ties, select the one among the tied objects that was found last (highest object ID from `find_objects`).\n      - If no objects are found, select none.\n  - Construct_Output:\n    - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).\n    - If an object was selected, draw it onto the new grid in its original position and color.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The selection criterion is solely based on the vertical starting position (topmost row) of the objects. The object starting lowest on the grid is chosen.\n  - Shape classification (T, L, etc.) appears irrelevant.\n  - In case of a tie in lowest position, the object identified later in a top-down, left-right scan (likely having a higher internal ID) is selected.\n```"
