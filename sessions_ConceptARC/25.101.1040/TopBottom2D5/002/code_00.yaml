Task: Select Lowest Object

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9) representing colors.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Composed of contiguous pixels of a single non-white color.
    - Can have various shapes and sizes.
    - Position is relevant, specifically the topmost row index.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Contains at most one object from the input.
    - If an object is present, it corresponds to one of the input objects.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify_Objects: Find all distinct colored objects (contiguous non-white pixels) in the input grid.
  - Find_Top_Row: For each object, determine the minimum row index occupied by its pixels (top_row).
  - Select_Lowest: Identify the object(s) having the maximum top_row value among all objects.
  - Handle_Selection:
      - If exactly one object is the lowest, select it.
      - If multiple objects share the same maximum top_row (tie), the current examples suggest selecting one of them (the exact tie-breaker isn't explicitly defined, but selecting the first encountered during a standard top-down, left-right scan might work implicitly or explicitly based on object ID order). Based on results, it seems the object found last (higher ID if scanning top-down) might be chosen in case of a tie (e.g., Example 2, Red L is chosen over Azure L, Green L, Orange L - Red L likely found last). Let's refine: Select the object with the maximum `top_row`. If there are ties, select the one among the tied objects that was found last (highest object ID from `find_objects`).
      - If no objects are found, select none.
  - Construct_Output:
    - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).
    - If an object was selected, draw it onto the new grid in its original position and color.

Relationships:
  - The selection criterion is solely based on the vertical starting position (topmost row) of the objects. The object starting lowest on the grid is chosen.
  - Shape classification (T, L, etc.) appears irrelevant.
  - In case of a tie in lowest position, the object identified later in a top-down, left-right scan (likely having a higher internal ID) is selected.
