            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\nThe input grids contain multiple distinct geometric shapes, each made of a single solid color, placed on a white background. The shapes seem to generally fall into two categories: 'L' shapes and 'T' shapes (or variations thereof). The output grid isolates and retains only one specific shape from the input, while removing all others and leaving the background white. The key transformation involves identifying objects based on their shape ('T' shapes specifically) and then applying a selection criterion based on their vertical position if multiple qualifying shapes exist. The shape that is retained in the output is always the 'T' shape whose highest point is lowest on the grid compared to other 'T' shapes.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Focus on identifying 'T' shapes.\n  - Filter_Objects: Select only the objects classified as 'T' shapes.\n  - Positional_Selection:\n    - If multiple 'T' shapes are found:\n      - Find the highest pixel (minimum row index) for each 'T' shape.\n      - Select the 'T' shape whose highest pixel has the maximum row index (i.e., is located lowest on the grid).\n    - If only one 'T' shape is found, select it.\n    - If no 'T' shapes are found, select none.\n  - Construct_Output:\n    - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).\n    - If a 'T' shape was selected, draw it onto the new grid in its original position and color.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Input objects are filtered based on their shape ('T' shape).\n  - Selection among filtered objects ('T' shapes) is based on vertical position (lowest starting point).\n  - The output grid preserves the dimensions of the input grid and the position/color of the single selected object.\n```"

Scan the input grid to identify all distinct objects, where an object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.\n3.  For each identified object, determine if it matches the specific structure of a 'T' shape (a 5-pixel shape composed of a 3-pixel line and a 2-pixel line attached perpendicularly to the center of the 3-pixel line).\n4.  Create a list of all objects identified as 'T' shapes.\n5.  If the list of 'T' shapes is empty, return the initialized empty output grid.\n6.  If the list contains one or more 'T' shapes, find the 'T' shape whose topmost pixel (the pixel with the minimum row index within that shape) has the maximum row index compared to the topmost pixels of all other 'T' shapes in the list. This identifies the 'T' shape that starts lowest on the grid.\n7.  Take the selected 'T' shape (the lowest one) and draw its pixels (preserving their original color and coordinates) onto the initially empty output grid.\n8.  Return the final output grid."
