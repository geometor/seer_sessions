Task: Shape Selection based on Type and Position

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9) representing colors.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Composed of contiguous pixels of a single non-white color.
    - Can have different shapes and colors.
    - Shapes observed:
      - 'L' shape (or variations)
      - 'T' shape (5 pixels: a 3-pixel line segment with a 2-pixel perpendicular stem attached to the center)

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Contains at most one object from the input.
    - If an object is present, it's a 'T' shape from the input.

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify_Objects: Find all distinct colored objects in the input grid.
  - Classify_Shapes: Determine the shape type for each identified object. Focus on identifying 'T' shapes.
  - Filter_Objects: Select only the objects classified as 'T' shapes.
  - Positional_Selection:
    - If multiple 'T' shapes are found:
      - Find the highest pixel (minimum row index) for each 'T' shape.
      - Select the 'T' shape whose highest pixel has the maximum row index (i.e., is located lowest on the grid).
    - If only one 'T' shape is found, select it.
    - If no 'T' shapes are found, select none.
  - Construct_Output:
    - Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).
    - If a 'T' shape was selected, draw it onto the new grid in its original position and color.

Relationships:
  - Input objects are filtered based on their shape ('T' shape).
  - Selection among filtered objects ('T' shapes) is based on vertical position (lowest starting point).
  - The output grid preserves the dimensions of the input grid and the position/color of the single selected object.
