*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are square (5x5, 5x5, 9x9).
    *   Each input grid contains a single large triangular object composed of a single non-white color (blue, red, yellow) against a white background.
    *   The triangular object always originates from one of the corners.
    *   The output grids are always single rows (1x3, 1x3, 1x5).
    *   The color of the pixels in the output row is the same as the color of the triangular object in the input.
    *   The width of the output row appears related to the dimensions of the input grid. For input sizes 5x5, the output width is 3. For input size 9x9, the output width is 5. This suggests a relationship: `output_width = (input_side_length + 1) / 2`.

```yaml
    task_description: Generate a single row of pixels based on the properties of a triangular object in a square input grid.
    
    elements:
      - element: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
          - shape: Square (N x N)
          - content: Contains a single triangular object and a white background.
      - element: triangular_object
        properties:
          - shape: Triangle
          - color: Single non-white color (e.g., blue, red, yellow)
          - location: Occupies roughly half the grid, originating from one corner.
      - element: background
        properties:
          - color: White (0)
      - element: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
          - shape: Single row (1 x W)
          - color: Same as the triangular_object's color.
    
    relationships:
      - type: Color Identity
        element1: triangular_object
        element2: output_grid
        details: The color of the output grid pixels is identical to the color of the input triangular object.
      - type: Size Transformation
        element1: input_grid
        element2: output_grid
        details: The width (W) of the output grid is derived from the side length (N) of the square input grid using the formula W = (N + 1) / 2.
    
    actions:
      - action: Identify Color
        input: input_grid
        output: dominant non-white color (C)
        details: Find the color that makes up the triangular object.
      - action: Determine Input Size
        input: input_grid
        output: side length (N)
        details: Get the height or width of the square input grid.
      - action: Calculate Output Width
        input: side length (N)
        output: output width (W)
        details: Apply the formula W = (N + 1) / 2.
      - action: Construct Output
        input: color (C), output width (W)
        output: output_grid
        details: Create a 1xW grid filled with color C.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid. Let this color be `C`.
    2.  Determine the side length `N` of the square input grid (e.g., by getting its height or width).
    3.  Calculate the required width `W` for the output grid using the formula `W = (N + 1) / 2`. Ensure integer division or rounding if necessary, although the examples suggest N is always odd, making (N+1) always even.
    4.  Construct the output grid as a single row with height 1 and width `W`.
    5.  Fill all pixels in the output grid with the identified color `C`.
