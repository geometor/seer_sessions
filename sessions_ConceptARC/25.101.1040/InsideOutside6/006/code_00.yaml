task_type: filtering_by_adjacency
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: maintained
    description: The default color filling the grid.
  - role: target_pixels
    color: variable (magenta(6) in T1, blue(1) in T2)
    property:
      - non_background
      - less_frequent (compared to context_pixels, if context_pixels exist)
    action: conditionally_kept
    condition: Kept if not adjacent (8-way) to any context_pixel. Otherwise removed.
  - role: context_pixels
    color: variable (green(3) in T1, yellow(4) in T2)
    property:
      - non_background
      - more_frequent (compared to target_pixels)
    action: removed
    effect: Defines an exclusion zone via adjacency for target_pixels.
relationships:
  - type: frequency_comparison
    between: non_background_colors
    relevance: Determines 'target' vs 'context' roles when exactly two non-background colors are present.
  - type: adjacency
    definition: 8-connectivity (Moore neighborhood)
    between: target_pixels, context_pixels
    relevance: Primary condition for removing target_pixels. If a target pixel is adjacent to a context pixel, it is removed.
grid_properties:
  - size: maintained between input and output
ambiguity:
  - rule_incompleteness: The identified rule (frequency roles + 8-way adjacency filtering) does not explain the removal of all target pixels in the examples. Specifically, target pixels at T1(3,5), T1(4,5), T1(6,6), and T2(10,7) are removed in the expected outputs despite *not* being adjacent to any context pixel according to the 8-way definition. The precise condition causing their removal remains undetermined from the examples and simple geometric priors.
