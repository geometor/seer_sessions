task_type: filtering_by_adjacency
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: maintained
  - role: target_pixels
    color: variable (magenta(6) in train_1, blue(1) in train_2)
    property: identified as the less frequent non-background color
    action: kept only if isolated from context_pixels, otherwise removed
  - role: context_pixels
    color: variable (green(3) in train_1, yellow(4) in train_2)
    property: identified as the more frequent non-background color
    action: defines exclusion zone for target_pixels; always removed in output
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: 8-connectivity (Moore neighborhood - horizontal, vertical, diagonal distance=1)
    between: target_pixels, context_pixels
    relevance: determines if a target_pixel is kept (if no adjacent context_pixel) or removed (if any adjacent context_pixel)
grid_properties:
  - size: maintained between input and output
notes:
  - The frequency heuristic (target < context) correctly identifies roles in provided examples.
  - The primary transformation rule appears to be removing target pixels adjacent (8-way) to context pixels.
  - There is one inconsistency observed: In train_1, target pixel (6,6) has no context neighbors but is removed in the expected output, contrary to the general rule observed otherwise. The proposed program follows the general rule.
