task_type: filtering_by_adjacency
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: maintained
  - role: target_pixels
    color: variable (magenta(6) in train_1, blue(1) in train_2)
    property: identified as the less frequent non-background color
    action: filtered based on relationship to context_pixels
  - role: context_pixels
    color: variable (green(3) in train_1, yellow(4) in train_2)
    property: identified as the more frequent non-background color
    action: defines exclusion zone for target_pixels; always removed in output
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: 8-connectivity (Moore neighborhood)
    between: target_pixels, context_pixels
    relevance: If a target_pixel is adjacent to a context_pixel, the target_pixel is removed.
grid_properties:
  - size: maintained between input and output
ambiguity:
  - rule_incompleteness: The adjacency rule does not fully explain the removal of all target pixels in the examples. Specifically, target pixels at T1(3,5), T1(4,5), T1(6,6), and T2(10,7) are removed in the expected output despite *not* being adjacent to any context pixel. The precise condition causing their removal is not determined from the examples.
notes:
  - The frequency heuristic (target < context) correctly identifies roles in provided examples.
  - The primary transformation rule appears to be removing target pixels adjacent (8-way) to context pixels. The implemented solution follows this rule.
