task_description: Replace minority colors with the dominant color, potentially respecting border structures.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value (0-9).
  - element: color
    description: An integer value 0-9 associated with each pixel.
  - element: region
    description: A contiguous area within the grid. Can be the entire grid or sub-parts like a border or the interior enclosed by a border.
  - element: dominant_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently within a specific region (either the whole grid or the interior).
  - element: minority_color
    description: Colors that are not the dominant color within a region.
  - element: border
    description: The outermost layer of pixels (row 0, last row, col 0, last col). Identified as a structural element if all perimeter pixels share the same color.

relationships:
  - type: frequency
    description: Colors have frequencies (counts) within a region.
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels have positions (row, column) and neighbors. A border encloses an interior region.

actions:
  - action: identify_border
    description: Check if all pixels on the grid perimeter (row 0, last row, col 0, last col) have the same color.
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Count pixel colors within a specified region (either the whole grid or the interior excluding the border) and find the color with the highest count.
  - action: replace_pixels
    description: Change the color of pixels based on the identified structure and dominant color.
    conditions:
      - if: uniform border exists
        effect: Preserve border pixels, replace all interior pixels with the dominant color of the interior.
      - if: no uniform border
        effect: Replace all pixels in the grid with the overall dominant color of the whole grid.
