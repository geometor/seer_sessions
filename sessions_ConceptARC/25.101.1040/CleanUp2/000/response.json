The replacement rule depends on the grid structure.\n5.  **Grid Structure (Border vs. No Border):**\n    *   Example `train_3` shows a distinct, uniform border (color white - 0). The transformation preserves this border and fills the *interior* region with the dominant color found *within* that interior (color red - 2). The minority color (gray - 5) inside the border is replaced by red. The minority color (gray - 5) *on* the border is replaced by the border color (white - 0), effectively becoming part of the border.\n    *   Examples `train_1` and `train_2` do not have a uniform border. In these cases, the entire grid is treated as a single region. All pixels are replaced by the single most frequent color found across the entire input grid (green - 3 in `train_1`, magenta - 6 in `train_2`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
