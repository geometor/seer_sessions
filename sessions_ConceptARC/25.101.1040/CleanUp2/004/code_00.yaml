task_description: Simplify the grid based on corner pixel uniformity and comparison between corner color and overall dominant color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: color
    description: An integer value 0-9 associated with each pixel.
  - element: corner_pixels
    description: The four pixels at the grid's corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
  - element: perimeter_pixels
    description: Pixels located on the first or last row, or the first or last column.
  - element: interior_pixels
    description: Pixels not located on the perimeter. Relevant only for grids larger than 2x2.
  - element: background_color
    description: The color identified if all four corner pixels are the same. Undefined otherwise.
  - element: overall_dominant_color
    description: The color that appears most frequently across the entire grid. Ties broken by lowest color index.
  - element: interior_non_background_pixels
    description: The set of interior pixels whose color does not match the background_color. Relevant only when corners match and background is not overall dominant.
  - element: dominant_interior_non_background_color
    description: The most frequent color among interior_non_background_pixels. Ties broken by lowest color index. Relevant only when corners match and background is not overall dominant.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels have positions (row, column). Corners, perimeter, and interior define regions.
  - type: frequency
    description: Colors have frequencies (counts) within a set of pixels (whole grid, interior non-background).
  - type: identity
    description: Comparing if corner pixels match. Comparing background_color to overall_dominant_color.

actions:
  - action: check_corners
    description: Determine if all four corner pixels have the same color.
  - action: find_overall_dominant
    description: Count colors across the entire grid and identify the most frequent (lowest index for ties).
  - action: find_dominant_interior_non_background
    description: Identify interior pixels, filter out background color, count remaining colors, find most frequent (lowest index for ties). Relevant only under specific conditions.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Generate the output grid based on corner check and color comparisons.
    conditions:
      - if: corners do not match
        effect: Fill output grid entirely with the overall_dominant_color.
      - if: corners match
        variables:
          - B = background_color (corner color)
          - D = overall_dominant_color
        sub_conditions:
          - if: B == D
            effect: Fill output grid entirely with B.
          - if: B != D
            variables:
              - DI = dominant_interior_non_background_color
            effect: Create output grid. Fill perimeter pixels with B. Fill interior pixels: if input pixel was B, output is B; otherwise, output is DI. (Handle grids < 3x3 where there's no interior: fill all with B).
