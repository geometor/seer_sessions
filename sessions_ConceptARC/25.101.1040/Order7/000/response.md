**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6 rows, 21 columns).
2.  **Central Separator:** A consistent feature across all examples is a vertical gray line (color 5) located exactly in the middle column (index 10). This line divides the grid into two halves: a left half (columns 0-9) and a right half (columns 11-20). The gray line itself remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Objects:** The other non-white pixels are yellow (color 4). They appear primarily as 2x2 squares, but the core element seems to be individual yellow pixels.
4.  **Transformation Condition:** The transformation depends on comparing the number of yellow pixels in the left half versus the right half.
5.  **Transformation Action:** If the count of yellow pixels in the left half is strictly greater than the count in the right half, the entire content of the left half (columns 0-9) is swapped with the entire content of the right half (columns 11-20). If the count on the left is less than or equal to the count on the right, the grid remains unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
constants:
  - gray_line_color: 5
  - object_color: 4 # yellow
  - background_color: 0 # white
grid_properties:
  - height: 6
  - width: 21
  - separator_column_index: 10 # gray line
definitions:
  - left_half: columns 0 through 9
  - right_half: columns 11 through 20
transformation_rule:
  - condition:
      - compare: count of yellow pixels in left_half vs right_half
      - trigger: count(left_half, yellow) > count(right_half, yellow)
  - action_if_true:
      - swap_content: left_half with right_half
      - preserve: column at separator_column_index (gray line)
  - action_if_false:
      - no_change: grid remains identical to input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical gray line located at the central column (index 10) which separates the grid into a left section (columns 0-9) and a right section (columns 11-20).
2.  Count the total number of yellow pixels within the left section.
3.  Count the total number of yellow pixels within the right section.
4.  Compare the counts: If the number of yellow pixels in the left section is greater than the number in the right section, proceed to step 5. Otherwise, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    *   Copy the gray separator line from the input to the output at column index 10.
    *   Copy the content (all pixels) from the input's left section (columns 0-9) to the output's right section (columns 11-20), maintaining relative positions.
    *   Copy the content (all pixels) from the input's right section (columns 11-20) to the output's left section (columns 0-9), maintaining relative positions.
