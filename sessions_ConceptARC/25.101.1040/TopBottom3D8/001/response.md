Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. For each cell (r, c) in the grid:
   a. Determine the dominant non-white color (H_color) of row r. If row r contains only white (0), H_color is considered non-existent.
   b. Determine the dominant non-white color (V_color) of column c. If column c contains only white (0), V_color is considered non-existent.
   c. If both H_color and V_color exist, then the cell (r, c) is an intersection point.
   d. For each intersection point (r, c):
      i. Get the original color of this point from the input grid (Original_color).
      ii. If Original_color is the same as H_color, update the color of the cell (r, c) in the output grid to V_color.
      iii. Else if Original_color is the same as V_color, update the color of the cell (r, c) in the output grid to H_color.
      iv. Otherwise (if Original_color is neither H_color nor V_color, including if it's white), update the color of the cell (r, c) in the output grid to V_color.
3. Return the modified output grid.
