*   **Perception:** The input grids contain patterns resembling horizontal and vertical lines or structures against a white background. These structures intersect at specific points. The transformation modifies the color of the pixel at these intersection points. The rule for modification depends on the original color of the intersection pixel relative to the colors of the intersecting horizontal and vertical structures.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: grid
        attributes:
          - background_color: white (0)
      - object: horizontal_structure
        attributes:
          - located_in: row
          - color: dominant non-white color in the row (H_color)
      - object: vertical_structure
        attributes:
          - located_in: column
          - color: dominant non-white color in the column (V_color)
      - object: intersection_point
        attributes:
          - location: coordinates (r, c) where a horizontal structure in row r meets a vertical structure in column c
          - original_color: color of the pixel at (r, c) in the input grid
    relationships:
      - type: intersection
        between: [horizontal_structure, vertical_structure]
        at: intersection_point
    actions:
      - action: determine_structure_color
        on: [horizontal_structure, vertical_structure]
        details: Find the most frequent non-white color within the row/column.
      - action: modify_color
        on: intersection_point
        details: Change the color based on original_color, H_color, and V_color.
    transformation_rule:
      - condition: If original_color equals H_color
        effect: Change intersection_point color to V_color.
      - condition: If original_color equals V_color
        effect: Change intersection_point color to H_color.
      - condition: Otherwise (original_color is neither H_color nor V_color, e.g., background)
        effect: Change intersection_point color to V_color (vertical color takes precedence).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all rows containing horizontal structures (rows with at least one non-white pixel). For each such row `r`, determine its characteristic horizontal color (`H_color`) by finding the most frequent non-white color in that row.
    3.  Identify all columns containing vertical structures (columns with at least one non-white pixel). For each such column `c`, determine its characteristic vertical color (`V_color`) by finding the most frequent non-white color in that column.
    4.  Iterate through every row `r` identified in step 2 and every column `c` identified in step 3. The cell at coordinates `(r, c)` is considered an intersection point.
    5.  For each intersection point `(r, c)`:
        a.  Retrieve the original color of this point from the input grid (`Original_color`).
        b.  Retrieve the horizontal color `H_color` associated with row `r`.
        c.  Retrieve the vertical color `V_color` associated with column `c`.
        d.  Compare `Original_color` with `H_color` and `V_color`.
        e.  If `Original_color` is the same as `H_color`, update the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `V_color`.
        f.  Else if `Original_color` is the same as `V_color`, update the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `H_color`.
        g.  Otherwise (if `Original_color` is neither `H_color` nor `V_color`), update the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `V_color`.
