elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - height: H
      - width: W
  - object: horizontal_bar
    attributes:
      - location: row `r`
      - criteria: The most frequent non-white color in row `r` appears in more than W/2 cells.
      - color: The dominant non-white color (H_color).
  - object: vertical_bar
    attributes:
      - location: column `c`
      - criteria: The most frequent non-white color in column `c` appears in more than H/2 cells.
      - color: The dominant non-white color (V_color).
  - object: intersection_point
    attributes:
      - location: coordinates (r, c) where a horizontal_bar in row `r` meets a vertical_bar in column `c`.
      - original_color: color of the pixel at (r, c) in the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: intersection
    between: [horizontal_bar, vertical_bar]
    at: intersection_point (r, c)
actions:
  - action: identify_bars
    on: grid
    details: Scan each row and column to find horizontal_bars and vertical_bars based on the >50% dominance criterion, recording their location (row/column index) and dominant color (H_color/V_color).
  - action: modify_color_at_intersection
    on: intersection_point (r, c)
    details: Apply transformation based on original_color, H_color (from row r's bar), and V_color (from column c's bar).
transformation_rule:
  - for each intersection_point (r, c) identified:
    - let H_color be the color of the horizontal_bar at row r
    - let V_color be the color of the vertical_bar at column c
    - let Original_color be the input color at (r, c)
    - condition: If Original_color equals H_color
      effect: Change output color at (r, c) to V_color.
    - condition: Else if Original_color equals V_color
      effect: Change output color at (r, c) to H_color.
    - condition: Otherwise
      effect: Change output color at (r, c) to V_color.
  - for all non-intersection points:
    - effect: Output color remains the same as the input color.
