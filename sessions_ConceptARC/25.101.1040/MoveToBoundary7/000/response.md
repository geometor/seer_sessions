Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids containing pixels of different colors (white, green, red, yellow).
*   **Objects:** In both examples, the input grid contains two distinct colored objects set against a white background.
    *   `train_1`: A green hollow rectangle and a red hollow rectangle.
    *   `train_2`: A small solid yellow rectangle and a larger hollow yellow rectangle.
*   **Relationships:** The two objects are spatially separated in the input. One object appears larger than the other.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving one of the objects.
    *   The larger object remains stationary in both examples.
    *   The smaller object is translated (moved without rotation or resizing).
    *   The direction of movement is directly towards the stationary object along the primary axis of separation (horizontal in `train_1`, vertical in `train_2`).
    *   The movement stops when the moving object becomes adjacent to the stationary object along the axis of movement. The smaller object effectively docks against the larger one.
*   **Consistency:** The shapes, colors, and sizes of the objects are preserved during the transformation, only the position of the smaller object changes. The background remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Move the smaller of two objects so it is adjacent to the larger object.

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
    properties: remains unchanged

  - type: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: varies (green, red, yellow observed)
      - shape: varies (rectangles, hollow/solid observed)
      - size: varies
      - role: potential (mover or stationary)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are initially separated on the background.
  - type: size
    description: One object has a smaller bounding box area than the other.

actions:
  - type: identify
    actor: system
    target: two non-background objects
    result: determines mover (smaller) and stationary (larger) objects

  - type: determine_movement_axis
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - mover_position
      - stationary_position
    description: Find the primary axis (horizontal or vertical) along which the objects are separated.

  - type: calculate_target_position
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - mover_object
      - stationary_object
      - movement_axis
    description: >
      Calculate the final position for the mover object such that it becomes
      adjacent to the stationary object along the movement axis.
      If moving horizontally towards the stationary object, stop when edges are 1 pixel apart horizontally.
      If moving vertically towards the stationary object, stop when edges are 1 pixel apart vertically.

  - type: translate
    actor: system
    target: mover_object
    from: original_position
    to: target_position
    effect: Modifies the grid by erasing the mover from the original location and drawing it at the target location.

final_state:
  - description: The grid contains the stationary object in its original position and the mover object in its new, adjacent position.
  - condition: All other pixels match the original background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct colored objects in the input grid, ignoring the background color.
2.  Determine the bounding box for each object. Calculate the area of each bounding box.
3.  Designate the object with the smaller bounding box area as the "mover" and the object with the larger area as the "stationary" object.
4.  Determine the primary axis of separation between the mover and the stationary object (either horizontal or vertical). This is the axis where the gap between their bounding boxes is largest or where their centers differ most significantly.
5.  Calculate the target position for the mover:
    *   If the mover is horizontally separated from the stationary object (e.g., mover is to the left): Move the mover horizontally towards the stationary object until its edge along the direction of movement is exactly one pixel away from the corresponding edge of the stationary object. (e.g., mover's right edge stops 1 pixel left of stationary's left edge).
    *   If the mover is vertically separated from the stationary object (e.g., mover is above): Move the mover vertically towards the stationary object until its edge along the direction of movement is exactly one pixel away from the corresponding edge of the stationary object (e.g., mover's bottom edge stops 1 pixel above stationary's top edge).
6.  Create the output grid by taking the input grid, erasing the mover object from its original location (filling with the background color), and drawing the mover object at its calculated target position. The stationary object remains unchanged.
