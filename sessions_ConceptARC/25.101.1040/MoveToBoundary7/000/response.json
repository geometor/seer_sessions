One object appears larger than the other.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving one of the objects.\n    *   The larger object remains stationary in both examples.\n    *   The smaller object is translated (moved without rotation or resizing).\n    *   The direction of movement is directly towards the stationary object along the primary axis of separation (horizontal in `train_1`, vertical in `train_2`).\n    *   The movement stops when the moving object becomes adjacent to the stationary object along the axis of movement. The smaller object effectively docks against the larger one.\n*   **Consistency:** The shapes, colors, and sizes of the objects are preserved during the transformation, only the position of the smaller object changes. The background remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Calculate the target position for the mover:\n    *   If the mover is horizontally separated from the stationary object (e.g., mover is to the left): Move the mover horizontally towards the stationary object until its edge along the direction of movement is exactly one pixel away from the corresponding edge of the stationary object. (e.g., mover's right edge stops 1 pixel left of stationary's left edge).\n    *   If the mover is vertically separated from the stationary object (e.g., mover is above): Move the mover vertically towards the stationary object until its edge along the direction of movement is exactly one pixel away from the corresponding edge of the stationary object (e.g., mover's bottom edge stops 1 pixel above stationary's top edge).\n6.  Create the output grid by taking the input grid, erasing the mover object from its original location (filling with the background color), and drawing the mover object at its calculated target position.
