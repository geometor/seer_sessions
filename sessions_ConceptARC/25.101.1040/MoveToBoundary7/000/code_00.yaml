task_description: Move the smaller of two objects so it is adjacent to the larger object.

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
    properties: remains unchanged

  - type: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      - color: varies (green, red, yellow observed)
      - shape: varies (rectangles, hollow/solid observed)
      - size: varies
      - role: potential (mover or stationary)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are initially separated on the background.
  - type: size
    description: One object has a smaller bounding box area than the other.

actions:
  - type: identify
    actor: system
    target: two non-background objects
    result: determines mover (smaller) and stationary (larger) objects

  - type: determine_movement_axis
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - mover_position
      - stationary_position
    description: Find the primary axis (horizontal or vertical) along which the objects are separated.

  - type: calculate_target_position
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - mover_object
      - stationary_object
      - movement_axis
    description: >
      Calculate the final position for the mover object such that it becomes
      adjacent to the stationary object along the movement axis.
      If moving horizontally towards the stationary object, stop when edges are 1 pixel apart horizontally.
      If moving vertically towards the stationary object, stop when edges are 1 pixel apart vertically.

  - type: translate
    actor: system
    target: mover_object
    from: original_position
    to: target_position
    effect: Modifies the grid by erasing the mover from the original location and drawing it at the target location.

final_state:
  - description: The grid contains the stationary object in its original position and the mover object in its new, adjacent position.
  - condition: All other pixels match the original background color.
