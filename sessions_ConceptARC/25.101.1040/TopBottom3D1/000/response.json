The grids contain pixels colored white (0) and two other distinct non-white colors.\n2.  **Object Identification:** In each example, there are typically two main non-white objects. One object appears to act as a frame, boundary, or central line (Red plus, Yellow rectangle, Magenta line), while the second object is located inside or adjacent to the first (Blue rectangle, Green rectangle, Orange shape).\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the 'inner' or 'adjacent' object (let's call it Object A) based on its relationship with the 'outer' or 'boundary' object (Object B). Specifically, Object A undergoes a horizontal expansion or filling.\n4.  **Expansion Logic:**\n    *   In `train_1` and `train_2`, Object B (Red plus, Yellow rectangle) forms clear vertical boundaries. Object A (Blue, Green) expands horizontally to fill the entire space between these vertical boundaries, but only on the rows where Object A was originally present. The color used for filling is the color of Object A. Pixels originally belonging to Object B within the fill area are overwritten.\n    *   In `train_3`, Object B (Magenta line) is *between* parts of Object A (Orange shape). Object A expands horizontally to connect its leftmost and rightmost points *within each row it occupies*, overwriting Object B where they intersect.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The color of Object B generally remains unchanged outside the fill area. The color of Object A is used for the fill operation. Background (white) pixels within the fill area are colored. Pixels of Object B within the fill area are also recolored with Object A's color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
