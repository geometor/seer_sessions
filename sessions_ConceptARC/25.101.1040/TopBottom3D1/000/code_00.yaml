task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  size: 8x8
  colors_used: 3 per example (white background + 2 object colors)

objects:
  - id: A # The 'inner' object that expands/fills
    properties:
      - color: variable (Blue, Green, Orange in examples)
      - shape: variable (rectangle, complex shape)
      - role: fill_source
  - id: B # The 'outer' object that defines boundaries or is overwritten
    properties:
      - color: variable (Red, Yellow, Magenta in examples)
      - shape: variable (plus, rectangle, line)
      - role: boundary_or_intersected

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Object A is spatially related to Object B (inside, adjacent, surrounding).
  - type: boundary_definition
    description: Object B either defines vertical boundaries for Object A's horizontal expansion, or Object A's own horizontal extent per row defines the expansion.

actions:
  - name: horizontal_fill
    parameters:
      - fill_color: color of Object A
      - target_rows: rows where Object A is present
      - target_columns:
          conditional:
            - if: Object B provides left/right boundaries enclosing A
              then: columns between and including B's boundaries
            - else: columns between and including A's min/max extent per row
    output: Modifies a copy of the input grid by applying the fill.
