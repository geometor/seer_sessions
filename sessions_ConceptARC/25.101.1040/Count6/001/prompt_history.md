**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves identifying and counting specific objects within a framed area in the input grid and representing this count in a standardized output format.

*   **Input:** The input grids contain a background (white/0), a frame object made of a single color (green/3 in train_1, gray/5 in train_2), and several "inner" pixels of another distinct color (blue/1 in train_1, orange/7 in train_2) located within the boundaries defined by the frame.
*   **Output:** The output is always a 7x1 column grid. It uses yellow (4) pixels at the top to represent the count of the "inner" pixels found within the frame in the input grid. The remaining cells are filled with the background color (white/0).
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves locating the frame, identifying the color of the pixels *inside* the frame (excluding the frame itself and the background), counting these inner pixels, and then generating the output column based on this count. The specific colors of the frame and inner pixels in the input vary, but the output always uses yellow (4) to represent the count.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Count specific colored pixels within a framed region and represent the count vertically in a fixed-size output grid.

elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: occupies empty space

  - object: frame
    property: contiguous block of a single non-background color, forms a boundary
    color: variable (e.g., green/3, gray/5)
    role: defines the region of interest

  - object: inner_pixels
    property: located strictly inside the bounding box defined by the frame
    color: variable, distinct from background and frame (e.g., blue/1, orange/7)
    role: items to be counted

  - object: output_grid
    property: fixed size (7x1)
    role: displays the result of the count

transformation:
  - action: identify_frame
    input: input_grid
    output: frame_object, frame_color, frame_bounding_box

  - action: identify_inner_color
    input: input_grid, frame_color, frame_bounding_box
    output: inner_color
    logic: find pixel color inside frame_bounding_box that is not background (0) and not frame_color

  - action: count_inner_pixels
    input: input_grid, inner_color, frame_bounding_box
    output: count (N)
    logic: count pixels with inner_color strictly inside the frame_bounding_box

  - action: generate_output
    input: count (N)
    output: output_grid (7x1)
    logic: create 7x1 grid, set top N cells to yellow (4), set remaining cells to white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: inner_pixels are located strictly inside the frame boundary.
  - type: quantitative
    description: the number of yellow pixels in the output_grid equals the count of inner_pixels in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the largest contiguous object composed of a single non-background color; this is the 'frame'. Determine the color of the frame.
2.  Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column) occupied by the frame pixels.
3.  Scan the area strictly *inside* this bounding box (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves). Identify the color of any pixels found in this area that are not the background color (white/0); this is the 'inner color'.
4.  Count the total number (N) of pixels possessing this 'inner color' within the strict inner area of the frame's bounding box.
5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 7 rows by 1 column, initially filled with the background color (white/0).
6.  Set the color of the top N cells in the first column of the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  The resulting 7x1 grid is the final output.
