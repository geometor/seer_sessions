task_description: Count specific colored pixels within a framed region and represent the count vertically in a fixed-size output grid.

elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: occupies empty space

  - object: frame
    property: contiguous block of a single non-background color, forms a boundary
    color: variable (e.g., green/3, gray/5)
    role: defines the region of interest

  - object: inner_pixels
    property: located strictly inside the bounding box defined by the frame
    color: variable, distinct from background and frame (e.g., blue/1, orange/7)
    role: items to be counted

  - object: output_grid
    property: fixed size (7x1)
    role: displays the result of the count

transformation:
  - action: identify_frame
    input: input_grid
    output: frame_object, frame_color, frame_bounding_box

  - action: identify_inner_color
    input: input_grid, frame_color, frame_bounding_box
    output: inner_color
    logic: find pixel color inside frame_bounding_box that is not background (0) and not frame_color

  - action: count_inner_pixels
    input: input_grid, inner_color, frame_bounding_box
    output: count (N)
    logic: count pixels with inner_color strictly inside the frame_bounding_box

  - action: generate_output
    input: count (N)
    output: output_grid (7x1)
    logic: create 7x1 grid, set top N cells to yellow (4), set remaining cells to white (0)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: inner_pixels are located strictly inside the frame boundary.
  - type: quantitative
    description: the number of yellow pixels in the output_grid equals the count of inner_pixels in the input grid.
