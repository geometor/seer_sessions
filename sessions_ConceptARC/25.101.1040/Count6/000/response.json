It uses yellow (4) pixels at the top to represent the count of the \"inner\" pixels found within the frame in the input grid. The remaining cells are filled with the background color (white/0).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves locating the frame, identifying the color of the pixels *inside* the frame (excluding the frame itself and the background), counting these inner pixels, and then generating the output column based on this count. The specific colors of the frame and inner pixels in the input vary, but the output always uses yellow (4) to represent the count.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
