**Perception:**

The input grid contains four distinct objects composed of non-white pixels, placed on a white background.
1.  A hollow yellow rectangle in the top-left quadrant.
2.  A solid gray rectangle in the top-right quadrant.
3.  A green 'C' shape (like a hollow rectangle with one side open) in the bottom-left quadrant.
4.  A solid yellow rectangle in the bottom-middle area.

The output grid maintains the same dimensions, background color, and the locations and primary colors of the objects. The transformation involves altering the internal structure of each object based on whether it was initially solid or hollow relative to its bounding box.

-   The hollow yellow rectangle in the input becomes a solid yellow rectangle in the output (its internal hole is filled with yellow).
-   The solid gray rectangle in the input becomes a hollow gray rectangle in the output (its interior pixels are changed to white, leaving a border).
-   The green 'C' shape in the input becomes a solid green rectangle in the output (its internal gap is filled with green).
-   The solid yellow rectangle in the input becomes a hollow yellow rectangle in the output (its interior pixels are changed to white, leaving a border).

The core transformation rule appears to be: If an object is solid (completely fills its bounding box), hollow it out by removing its interior pixels (pixels not adjacent to the exterior). If an object is hollow (contains background-colored pixels within its bounding box), fill the internal background pixels with the object's color.

relationships:
  - Objects are distinct and do not overlap.
  - Each object undergoes a transformation based on its solidity relative to its bounding box.
transformation_rule:
  - identify_objects: find connected components of non-white pixels.
  - for_each_object:
    - determine color and bounding box.
    - check_solidity: determine if the object's pixels completely fill its bounding box.
    - apply_change:
      - if solid: change interior pixels (those not on the bounding box edge) to white.
      - if hollow: change interior white pixels (those within the bounding box) to the object's color.
  - maintain_background: white pixels outside object bounding boxes remain white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its color (C).
    b.  Find the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this object.
    c.  Calculate the minimum bounding box containing all the object's pixels.
    d.  Determine if the object is "solid" by checking if its pixels occupy every cell within its bounding box.
    e.  **If the object is solid:** Iterate through each pixel (r, c) belonging to the object. If this pixel (r, c) has all 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) also belonging to the *same* object, change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to white (0).
    f.  **If the object is not solid (hollow):** Iterate through each coordinate (r, c) *within* the object's bounding box. If the pixel at (r, c) in the *input* grid is white (0), change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to the object's color (C).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
