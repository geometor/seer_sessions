"""
This module transforms an input grid based on the solidity of its non-background objects.

The transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying distinct connected objects (groups of non-white pixels).
2. For each object:
   a. Determine its color and bounding box.
   b. Check if the object completely fills its bounding box (is "solid").
   c. If the object is solid: Hollow it out by changing its interior pixels (those whose 8 neighbors are also part of the object) to white (0).
   d. If the object is not solid (hollow): Fill its internal holes by changing any white pixels within its bounding box to the object's color.
3. Pixels outside any object's bounding box remain unchanged.
