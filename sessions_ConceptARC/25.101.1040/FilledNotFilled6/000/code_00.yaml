relationships:
  - Objects are distinct and do not overlap.
  - Each object undergoes a transformation based on its solidity relative to its bounding box.
transformation_rule:
  - identify_objects: find connected components of non-white pixels.
  - for_each_object:
    - determine color and bounding box.
    - check_solidity: determine if the object's pixels completely fill its bounding box.
    - apply_change:
      - if solid: change interior pixels (those not on the bounding box edge) to white.
      - if hollow: change interior white pixels (those within the bounding box) to the object's color.
  - maintain_background: white pixels outside object bounding boxes remain white.
