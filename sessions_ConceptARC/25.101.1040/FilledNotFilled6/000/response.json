A hollow yellow rectangle in the top-left quadrant.\n2.  A solid gray rectangle in the top-right quadrant.\n3.  A green 'C' shape (like a hollow rectangle with one side open) in the bottom-left quadrant.\n4.  A solid yellow rectangle in the bottom-middle area.\n\nThe output grid maintains the same dimensions, background color, and the locations and primary colors of the objects. The transformation involves altering the internal structure of each object based on whether it was initially solid or hollow relative to its bounding box.\n\n-   The hollow yellow rectangle in the input becomes a solid yellow rectangle in the output (its internal hole is filled with yellow).\n-   The solid gray rectangle in the input becomes a hollow gray rectangle in the output (its interior pixels are changed to white, leaving a border).\n-   The green 'C' shape in the input becomes a solid green rectangle in the output (its internal gap is filled with green).\n-   The solid yellow rectangle in the input becomes a hollow yellow rectangle in the output (its interior pixels are changed to white, leaving a border).\n\nThe core transformation rule appears to be: If an object is solid (completely fills its bounding box), hollow it out by removing its interior pixels (pixels not adjacent to the exterior). If an object is hollow (contains background-colored pixels within its bounding box), fill the internal background pixels with the object's color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
