Some shapes are \"hollow\" or incomplete squares (like the blue 'C' shapes in `train_1` and green 'C' shapes in `train_2`). There is also always one prominent solid, single-color square object present (green in `train_1`, magenta in `train_2`). The other shapes seem extraneous.\n\nThe output grid is consistently a smaller grid that exactly matches the solid square object identified in the input grid, preserving its color and dimensions. The task appears to involve identifying and isolating this specific solid square object from the rest of the input content. The key distinguishing feature of the target object is that it's a solid, single-color rectangle (specifically a square in these examples), and it seems to be the largest such object in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Filter out any blocks that are not solid rectangles.\n4.  Calculate the area (width * height) of each remaining solid rectangular block.\n5.  Identify the solid rectangular block with the maximum area. If there's a tie, any of the largest ones might be chosen (though the examples don't show ties).\n6.

Copy the pixels (colors) from the identified largest solid rectangle in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid."
