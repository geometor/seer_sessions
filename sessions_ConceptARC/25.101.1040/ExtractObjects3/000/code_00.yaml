task_type: object_extraction
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, green, magenta)
        - structure: can be solid or hollow
        - form: appears as rectangles, squares, or incomplete squares ('C' shapes)
  grid_properties:
    - multiple distinct objects can exist
    - one object is a solid, single-color rectangle (square in examples)
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white (implicitly, if the extracted object doesn't fill the output grid, though not seen here)
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: matches the color of the extracted input object
        - structure: solid
        - form: rectangle (square in examples)
  grid_properties:
    - contains exactly one object
    - the object is a copy of a specific object from the input
transformation:
  action: identify_and_extract
  selection_criteria:
    - object_type: solid rectangle
    - color: non-white
    - size_metric: maximum area
  process:
    - find all contiguous, single-color, non-white objects
    - filter for objects that form solid rectangles
    - determine the area of each solid rectangle
    - select the solid rectangle with the largest area
    - create the output grid containing only this selected rectangle
relationship:
  - output grid is a subgrid or cropped version of the input grid, containing only the largest solid rectangular object.
