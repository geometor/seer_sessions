            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the initial perception of the task was incorrect. It assumed the goal was to extract the largest *solid* rectangle, while the examples clearly show the output is a *hollow* square frame present in the input. The transformed outputs were empty because the code couldn't find any objects matching the `is_solid_rectangle` criteria that corresponded to the expected output structure.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n1.  Correcting the perception: Identify the target object as a hollow square frame.\n2.  Refining the identification criteria: Develop logic to specifically find objects that are complete square frames with a hollow (white) interior.\n3.  Verifying uniqueness: Ensure this hollow square frame is uniquely identifiable in the input, possibly by its completeness or color.\n4.  Updating the extraction process: Extract the identified hollow square frame based on its bounding box from the input grid.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nUsing code execution to analyze the objects in the training examples based on the revised hypothesis (looking for hollow square frames):\n"
