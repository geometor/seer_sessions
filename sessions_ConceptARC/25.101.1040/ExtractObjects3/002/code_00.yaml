task_type: object_transformation_extraction
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, green, magenta)
        - structure: can be solid frame, hollow frame, or incomplete frame ('C' shapes)
        - form: primarily square-like shapes of different sizes
  grid_properties:
    - multiple distinct objects can exist
    - one object forms the perimeter of a square (may or may not be hollow in the input)
    - this square perimeter object is the largest among all such perimeter objects
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: matches the color of the identified largest square perimeter object from input
        - structure: hollow square frame (perimeter only, white interior)
        - form: square
  grid_properties:
    - contains exactly one object
    - the object's size matches the size of the largest square perimeter object from the input
    - the object's color matches the color of the largest square perimeter object from the input
    - the object's interior is white
transformation:
  action: identify_transform_extract
  selection_criteria:
    - object_type: square perimeter (contiguous pixels forming the border of a square bounding box)
    - size_metric: maximum side length (or area) of the bounding box
  process:
    - find all contiguous, single-color, non-white objects
    - for each object, determine if its pixels exactly match the perimeter of its bounding box and if the bounding box is a square.
    - select the object that satisfies the square perimeter condition and has the largest bounding box size (side length).
    - create a new output grid with the dimensions of the selected object's bounding box.
    - fill the perimeter of the output grid with the color of the selected object.
    - fill the interior of the output grid with white (0).
relationship:
  - output grid represents a hollowed-out version of the largest square perimeter object found in the input grid.
