## Perception

The input grids contain various geometric shapes composed of different colors against a white background. Some shapes are "hollow" or incomplete squares (like the blue 'C' shapes in `train_1` and green 'C' shapes in `train_2`). There is also always one prominent solid, single-color square object present (green in `train_1`, magenta in `train_2`). The other shapes seem extraneous.

The output grid is consistently a smaller grid that exactly matches the solid square object identified in the input grid, preserving its color and dimensions. The task appears to involve identifying and isolating this specific solid square object from the rest of the input content. The key distinguishing feature of the target object is that it's a solid, single-color rectangle (specifically a square in these examples), and it seems to be the largest such object in the input.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_extraction
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, green, magenta)
        - structure: can be solid or hollow
        - form: appears as rectangles, squares, or incomplete squares ('C' shapes)
  grid_properties:
    - multiple distinct objects can exist
    - one object is a solid, single-color rectangle (square in examples)
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white (implicitly, if the extracted object doesn't fill the output grid, though not seen here)
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: matches the color of the extracted input object
        - structure: solid
        - form: rectangle (square in examples)
  grid_properties:
    - contains exactly one object
    - the object is a copy of a specific object from the input
transformation:
  action: identify_and_extract
  selection_criteria:
    - object_type: solid rectangle
    - color: non-white
    - size_metric: maximum area
  process:
    - find all contiguous, single-color, non-white objects
    - filter for objects that form solid rectangles
    - determine the area of each solid rectangle
    - select the solid rectangle with the largest area
    - create the output grid containing only this selected rectangle
relationship:
  - output grid is a subgrid or cropped version of the input grid, containing only the largest solid rectangular object.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
2.  For each identified block, determine if it forms a solid rectangle (i.e., it has a rectangular bounding box, and all pixels within that bounding box share the same color as the block).
3.  Filter out any blocks that are not solid rectangles.
4.  Calculate the area (width * height) of each remaining solid rectangular block.
5.  Identify the solid rectangular block with the maximum area. If there's a tie, any of the largest ones might be chosen (though the examples don't show ties).
6.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the dimensions of the identified largest solid rectangle.
7.  Copy the pixels (colors) from the identified largest solid rectangle in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed because the initial perception of the task was incorrect. It assumed the goal was to extract the largest *solid* rectangle, while the examples clearly show the output is a *hollow* square frame present in the input. The transformed outputs were empty because the code couldn't find any objects matching the `is_solid_rectangle` criteria that corresponded to the expected output structure.

The strategy to resolve this involves:
1.  Correcting the perception: Identify the target object as a hollow square frame.
2.  Refining the identification criteria: Develop logic to specifically find objects that are complete square frames with a hollow (white) interior.
3.  Verifying uniqueness: Ensure this hollow square frame is uniquely identifiable in the input, possibly by its completeness or color.
4.  Updating the extraction process: Extract the identified hollow square frame based on its bounding box from the input grid.

## Metrics and Analysis

Using code execution to analyze the objects in the training examples based on the revised hypothesis (looking for hollow square frames):

    # 1. Check if bounding box is square and minimum size 3x3
    if width != height or width < 3:
        return False

    # 2. Check if object pixels form only the perimeter

    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        expected_perimeter_pixels.add((r, min_c))

        expected_perimeter_pixels.add((min_r, c))
        expected_perimeter_pixels.add((max_r, c))

    if obj['pixels'] != expected_perimeter_pixels:
        return False

    # 3. Check if the interior is white (color 0) in the original grid

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Train_1:** The code identified 9 blue (color 2) 3x3 hollow square frames and one green (color 3) 5x5 object which is *not* a hollow frame (it's solid). The expected output is a 5x5 *green* frame. The `is_hollow_square_frame` logic seems flawed, or my interpretation is still wrong. Let's re-examine `train_1` input/output.
    *   Input `train_1` has a green border shape (0,4) to (4,8). Let's check its pixels manually.
        *   Top: `(0,4)` to `(0,8)` - 5 pixels (3)
        *   Bottom: `(4,4)` to `(4,8)` - 5 pixels (3)
        *   Left: `(1,4)` to `(3,4)` - 3 pixels (3)
        *   Right: `(1,8)` to `(3,8)` - 3 pixels (3)
        *   Total green pixels = 5+5+3+3 = 16 pixels.
        *   Interior check: `(1,5)` to `(3,7)`. The grid shows `2 2 2`, `2 0 2`, `2 2 2` in this area. It's *not* white inside.
    *   Output `train_1` is:
        
```
        3 3 3 3 3
        3 0 0 0 3
        3 0 0 0 3
        3 0 0 0 3
        3 3 3 3 3
        ```

        This *is* a 5x5 hollow square frame made of green (3).

    *   **Conclusion:** The task extracts the green shape *and then makes its interior white*. The identification criterion might be the largest square perimeter, or the green object itself. The green object is the only green one. The blue objects are smaller frames. The green object is the largest perimeter object (5x5).

*   **Train_2:** The code identified three green (color 3) 4x4 hollow square frames. It did *not* identify the magenta (color 6) object `(0,0)` to `(4,4)` as a hollow frame because its interior is not white (contains green 3s). The expected output is a 5x5 magenta frame:
    
```
    6 6 6 6 6
    6 0 0 0 6
    6 0 0 0 6
    6 0 0 0 6
    6 6 6 6 6
    ```

    *   **Conclusion:** Similar to `train_1`, the task identifies the magenta perimeter shape (which is 5x5) and then makes its interior white. The magenta object is the only magenta one. It is also the largest perimeter object (5x5). The green frames are smaller (4x4).

**Revised Hypothesis 2:** The task is to find the object that forms the largest square perimeter (regardless of interior content) and then output that perimeter shape as a hollow square frame (with a white interior) of the same size and color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation_extraction
input_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: background
      color: white
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, green, magenta)
        - structure: can be solid frame, hollow frame, or incomplete frame ('C' shapes)
        - form: primarily square-like shapes of different sizes
  grid_properties:
    - multiple distinct objects can exist
    - one object forms the perimeter of a square (may or may not be hollow in the input)
    - this square perimeter object is the largest among all such perimeter objects
output_features:
  grid_elements:
    - type: shape
      properties:
        - color: matches the color of the identified largest square perimeter object from input
        - structure: hollow square frame (perimeter only, white interior)
        - form: square
  grid_properties:
    - contains exactly one object
    - the object's size matches the size of the largest square perimeter object from the input
    - the object's color matches the color of the largest square perimeter object from the input
    - the object's interior is white
transformation:
  action: identify_transform_extract
  selection_criteria:
    - object_type: square perimeter (contiguous pixels forming the border of a square bounding box)
    - size_metric: maximum side length (or area) of the bounding box
  process:
    - find all contiguous, single-color, non-white objects
    - for each object, determine if its pixels exactly match the perimeter of its bounding box and if the bounding box is a square.
    - select the object that satisfies the square perimeter condition and has the largest bounding box size (side length).
    - create a new output grid with the dimensions of the selected object's bounding box.
    - fill the perimeter of the output grid with the color of the selected object.
    - fill the interior of the output grid with white (0).
relationship:
  - output grid represents a hollowed-out version of the largest square perimeter object found in the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of non-white pixels. Record each object's color, pixels, and bounding box.
2.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check if its bounding box is a square (width equals height).
    b.  If the bounding box is square, check if the object's pixels perfectly form the perimeter of that bounding box (i.e., `pixels = {(r, c) | r=min_r or r=max_r or c=min_c or c=max_c}` within the bounding box `(min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)`).
3.  Filter the objects, keeping only those that are square perimeters based on steps 2a and 2b.
4.  From the filtered list, identify the object with the largest bounding box (maximum side length). If there's a tie in size, the examples don't specify how to break it, but assume one will be uniquely largest based on the training data provided.
5.  Let the identified object have color `C` and a bounding box size of `S x S`.
6.  Create a new output grid of size `S x S`.
7.  Fill the perimeter cells (top row, bottom row, first column, last column) of the output grid with color `C`.
8.  Fill all interior cells of the output grid with white (0).
9.  Return the generated output grid.
