Assume the rest of the grid is background (0).\n2. Determine if the object is \"solid\" or \"hollow\": Check if any pixel in `P` has all 8 of its neighbours also having color C. If yes, the object is \"solid\"; otherwise, it is \"hollow\".\n3. If the object is \"solid\":\n    a. Create a new output grid initialized with the background color (0).\n    b. For each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in the input set `P`: If `(r, c)` has at least one neighbour (8 directions) in the input grid with the background color (0), set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to color C.\n    c. The resulting output grid is the outline.\n4. If the object is \"hollow\":\n    a. **(Requires `scipy` and `skimage` libraries)**\n    b. Create a new output grid by copying the input grid.\n    c. Treat the coordinates in `P` as points. Calculate the convex hull polygon enclosing these points.\n    d. Identify all grid cells `(r', c')` that fall inside or on the boundary of this convex hull polygon.\n    e. Set the color of each identified cell `(r', c')` in the output grid to C.\n    f. The resulting output grid is the filled shape.\n    g. **(Fallback if libraries unavailable):** Return the original input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\n\n# Attempt to import optional libraries for convex hull calculation\ntry:\n    from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n    from skimage.draw import polygon\n    _SCIPY_AVAILABLE = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    _SCIPY_AVAILABLE = False\n    #
