Task: Toggle between a filled convex hull representation and its vertices.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a background color (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of a non-background color (C).

Object_Properties:
  - Color: The specific non-background color (C) of the object.
  - Pixels: Set of coordinates `P = {(r, c)}` occupied by the object.
  - Points: Geometric points `G = {(c, r)}` corresponding to pixels P.

Derived_Properties (Requires scipy library):
  - Convex_Hull_Fill: A grid (`HullGrid`) generated by filling the convex hull polygon defined by the geometric points G with color C.
  - Convex_Hull_Vertices: The set of points from G (`V`) that form the vertices of the convex hull polygon.
  - State:
    - Solid: If the `InputGrid` is identical to the `HullGrid`.
    - Hollow: If the `InputGrid` is different from the `HullGrid`.

Transformation_Rule (Requires scipy library):
  - Condition: Determine the object's State (Solid or Hollow) by comparing the `InputGrid` to its `HullGrid`.
  - Action_If_Solid:
    - Goal: Produce the vertices of the convex hull.
    - Method: Create a new grid containing color C only at the pixel coordinates `(r, c)` corresponding to the `Convex_Hull_Vertices` V. All other pixels are background (0).
  - Action_If_Hollow:
    - Goal: Produce the filled convex hull.
    - Method: The output grid is the `HullGrid`.

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a background color (0).
  - Grid contains object pixels of color C.
  - If the input State was Solid, the output object consists of pixels corresponding to the convex hull vertices of the input points.
  - If the input State was Hollow, the output object is the filled convex hull of the input points.

Dependencies:
  - The identification of State (Solid/Hollow) and both transformation actions rely on convex hull calculations (finding the hull, filling it, identifying vertices), typically requiring the `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull` and `skimage.draw.polygon` functionalities.
