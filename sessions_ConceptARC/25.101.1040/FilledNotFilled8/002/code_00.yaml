Task: Toggle between a filled shape and its outline or boundary representation.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a white background (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of a non-white color (C).

Object_Properties:
  - Color: The specific non-white color (C) of the object (e.g., magenta/6, green/3).
  - Pixels: Set of coordinates `(r, c)` occupied by the object.
  - Solidity: Determined by the presence or absence of "interior" pixels.
    - Interior_Pixel: A pixel of color C where all 8 neighbours are also color C.
    - Solid_Object: Contains at least one Interior_Pixel.
    - Hollow_Object: Contains no Interior_Pixels (all object pixels are adjacent to the background in the input grid).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Condition: Check if the input object is Solid or Hollow using the `_is_solid` definition.
  - Action_If_Solid:
    - Goal: Produce the outline of the object.
    - Method: Keep only input object pixels (C) that are adjacent (8 directions) to at least one background pixel (0) in the input grid. Change all other pixels (including interior object pixels) to background (0).
  - Action_If_Hollow:
    - Goal: Produce a filled version of the shape implied by the hollow object.
    - Method:
      - Identify the coordinates of all pixels with color C in the input.
      - Calculate the convex hull of these coordinates.
      - Create a new grid, initially matching the input grid.
      - Fill the area defined by the convex hull polygon with the object color C, overwriting background pixels but preserving the original object pixels. (Requires geometric polygon filling).

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a white background (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of color C.
  - If the input object was Solid, the output object is Hollow (an outline/boundary).
  - If the input object was Hollow, the output object is Solid (filled convex hull).
