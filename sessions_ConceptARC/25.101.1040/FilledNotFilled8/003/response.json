Determine if the object is \"solid\" or \"hollow\".\n    - An object is \"solid\" if at least one pixel of color C has all 8 of its neighbors also being color C.\n    - Otherwise, the object is \"hollow\".\n3. If the object is \"solid\", create an \"outline\" of the object.\n    - The outline consists of only those pixels of color C from the input that were adjacent (8 directions) to at least one background pixel (0). All other pixels become background (0).\n4. If the object is \"hollow\", create a \"filled\" version of the shape based on its convex hull.\n    - Calculate the convex hull of the coordinates of the object pixels.\n    - Fill the area within this convex hull with the object color C, preserving the original object pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\n\n# Attempt to import optional libraries for convex hull calculation\ntry:\n    from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n    from skimage.draw import polygon\n    _SCIPY_AVAILABLE = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    _SCIPY_AVAILABLE = False\n    # Define dummy classes/functions if imports fail to avoid runtime errors later\n    # This allows the code structure to remain, but hull calculation will fail gracefully.\n    class ConvexHull:\n         def __init__(self, points):\n            pass\n    def polygon(r, c, shape=None):\n         # Return empty arrays if polygon can't be drawn\n         return np.array([], dtype=int), np.array([], dtype=int)\n\n\n# === Helper Functions ===\n\ndef _get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, height: int, width: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Get valid 8-directional neighbor coordinates.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef _find_object_pixels(grid: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[int, Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:\n    \"\"\"Find the non-background color and the set of coordinates for the object.\"\"\"\n    object_color = -1\n    object_pixels = set()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through the grid to find non-background pixels\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                # Assign the first non-zero color found as the object color\n                if object_color == -1:\n                    object_color = grid[r, c]\n                \n                # Add pixel coordinate if it matches the object color\n                # (Assumes only one non-background color forms the object)\n                if grid[r, c] == object_color:\n                     object_pixels.add((r, c))\n\n    # Handle case where grid is all background\n    if object_color == -1:\n        object_color = 0 # Default to background color\n\n    return object_color, object_pixels\n\ndef _is_solid(grid: np.ndarray, object_pixels: Set[Tuple[int, int]], object_color: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if any object pixel has all 8 neighbors of the same object color.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    if not object_pixels: return False # Empty object is not solid\n\n    # Check each object pixel\n    for r, c in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = _get_neighbors(r, c, height, width)\n        \n        # An interior pixel must have exactly 8 neighbors within the grid\n        if len(neighbors) == 8:\n            all_neighbors_are_object_color = True\n            # Check if all neighbors have the object color\n            for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                if grid[nr, nc] != object_color:\n                    all_neighbors_are_object_color = False\n                    break\n            # If all neighbors match, we found an interior pixel, object is solid\n            if all_neighbors_are_object_color:\n                return True\n                \n    # If no interior pixel was found after checking all object pixels\n    return False\n\ndef _create_outline(grid: np.ndarray, object_pixels: Set[Tuple[int, int]], object_color: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Keep only object pixels adjacent to background.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid) # Start with all background\n\n    # Iterate through the original object pixels\n    for r, c in object_pixels:\n        is_boundary = False\n        neighbors = _get_neighbors(r, c, height, width)\n        # Check if any neighbor is background (color 0)\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                is_boundary = True\n                break\n        \n        # If it's a boundary pixel, add it to the output\n        if is_boundary:\n            output_grid[r, c] = object_color\n            \n    return output_grid\n\ndef _fill_convex_hull(grid: np.ndarray, object_pixels: Set[Tuple[int, int]], object_color: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Fill the convex hull defined by the object pixels.\"\"\"\n    if not _SCIPY_AVAILABLE:\n        print(\"Warning: Scipy/Scikit-image not available.
