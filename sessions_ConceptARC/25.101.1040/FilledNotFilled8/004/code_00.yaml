Task: Toggle between a filled shape and its outline representation.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a background color (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of a non-background color (C).

Object_Properties:
  - Color: The specific non-background color (C) of the object.
  - Pixels: Set of coordinates `(r, c)` occupied by the object.
  - Solidity: Determined by the presence or absence of "interior" pixels.
    - Interior_Pixel: An object pixel (C) where all 8 neighbours are also color C.
    - Solid_Object: Contains at least one Interior_Pixel.
    - Hollow_Object: Contains no Interior_Pixels.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Condition: Check if the input object is Solid or Hollow using the `_is_solid` definition.
  - Action_If_Solid:
    - Goal: Produce the outline of the object.
    - Method: Create a new grid containing only those input object pixels (C) that are adjacent (8 directions) to at least one background pixel (0) in the input grid. All other pixels become background (0).
  - Action_If_Hollow:
    - Goal: Produce a filled version of the shape implied by the hollow object.
    - Method:
      - Identify the coordinates of all pixels with color C in the input.
      - Calculate the convex hull polygon of these coordinates. (Requires `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull`).
      - Create a new grid, initially matching the input grid.
      - Fill the area inside or on the boundary of the convex hull polygon with the object color C. (Requires `skimage.draw.polygon`).
      - Note: Requires external libraries `scipy` and `skimage`. Without them, this step cannot be completed correctly.

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a background color (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of color C.
  - If the input object was Solid, the output object is its outline/boundary.
  - If the input object was Hollow, the output object is its filled convex hull.
