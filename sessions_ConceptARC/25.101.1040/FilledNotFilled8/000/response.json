            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, primarily white (0) with a single contiguous shape made of another color (magenta/6 in train_1, green/3 in train_2).\n2.  **Object Identification:** In each example, there's one main non-white object. The background is white.\n3.  **Transformation in train_1:** The input shows a sparse collection of magenta pixels that seem to outline a region. The output fills this region with magenta pixels, effectively creating a solid shape bounded by the original pixels (and potentially extending slightly). The original magenta pixels remain.\n4.  **Transformation in train_2:** The input shows a solid green shape. The output removes the interior of this shape, leaving only the pixels that were on the boundary (adjacent to white pixels in the input).\n5.  **Core Logic:** The two examples demonstrate inverse operations. One goes from an outline-like structure to a filled shape, the other goes from a filled shape to an outline. The key seems to be determining whether the input shape is \"hollow\" (like an outline) or \"solid\" (filled) and then applying the corresponding transformation (fill or outline).\n6.  **Determining Solid/Hollow:** A shape can be considered \"solid\" if it contains at least one pixel whose neighbours (including diagonals) are *all* the same color as the pixel itself. If all pixels of the shape have at least one neighbour that is white (background), the shape can be considered \"hollow\" or an outline.\n7.  **Fill Mechanism (train_1):** The fill seems to happen for white pixels that lie \"between\" pixels of the shape's color, both horizontally and vertically. A white pixel is filled if there's a shape pixel to its left and right on the same row, OR if there's a shape pixel above and below it in the same column.\n8.  **Outline Mechanism (train_2):** The outline keeps only those shape pixels from the input that were adjacent (including diagonals) to a white background pixel. Interior pixels are removed (turned white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
