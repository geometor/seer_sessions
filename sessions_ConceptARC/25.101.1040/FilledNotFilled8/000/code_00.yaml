Task: Toggle between filled shape and outline shape representation.

Input_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a white background (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of a non-white color (C).

Object_Properties:
  - Color: The specific non-white color (C) of the object (e.g., magenta/6, green/3).
  - Solidity: Determined by the presence or absence of "interior" pixels.
    - Interior_Pixel: A pixel of color C where all 8 neighbours are also color C.
    - Solid_Object: Contains at least one Interior_Pixel.
    - Hollow_Object: Contains no Interior_Pixels (all object pixels are adjacent to the background).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Condition: Check if the input object is Solid or Hollow.
  - Action_If_Solid:
    - Goal: Produce the outline of the object.
    - Method: Keep only object pixels (C) that are adjacent (8 directions) to at least one background pixel (0) in the input. Change all other pixels (including interior object pixels) to background (0).
  - Action_If_Hollow:
    - Goal: Produce a filled version of the shape defined by the hollow object.
    - Method:
      - Start with a copy of the input grid.
      - Identify all background pixels (0).
      - For each background pixel (r, c):
        - Check_Horizontal: Are there pixels of color C at (r, c1) and (r, c2) where c1 < c < c2?
        - Check_Vertical: Are there pixels of color C at (r1, c) and (r2, c) where r1 < r < r2?
        - If Check_Horizontal is TRUE OR Check_Vertical is TRUE, change the pixel at (r, c) to color C.

Output_Characteristics:
  - Grid contains a white background (0).
  - Grid contains a single contiguous object of color C.
  - If the input object was Solid, the output object is Hollow (an outline).
  - If the input object was Hollow, the output object is Solid (filled).
