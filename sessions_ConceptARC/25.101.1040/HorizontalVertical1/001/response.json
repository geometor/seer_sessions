All adjacent non-white pixels surrounding the region belong to a single shape and have the same color.\n4.  **Apply Fill Rule:**\n    *   **If 2 or fewer distinct shape colors exist:**\n        *   Regions enclosed by Red (2) are filled with Green (3).\n        *   Regions enclosed by Yellow (4) are filled with Orange (7).\n        *   (Other color mappings might exist but are not shown in examples).\n    *   **If 3 or more distinct shape colors exist:**\n        *   Regions enclosed by Red (2) are filled with Orange (7).\n        *   Regions enclosed by Yellow (4) are filled with Green (3).\n        *   Regions enclosed by Orange (7) are filled with Green (3).\n        *   (Other color mappings might exist but are not shown in examples).\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid with enclosed regions filled according to the rules.
