            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous execution (Code v3) failed on both training examples, reverting to producing the original input as the output. This indicates that the condition intended to trigger the filling (`is_fillable`) evaluated to `False` for all candidate regions. The `is_fillable` condition depended on three sub-conditions:\n1.  The region does not touch the border (`not touches_border`).\n2.  The region is surrounded by exactly one non-white color (`len(adjacent_colors) == 1`).\n3.  The region touches at least one white pixel external to itself (`touches_external_white`).\n\nGiven that the first version of the code (which only checked conditions 1 and 2) correctly filled regions in Example 1, it strongly suggests that the implementation of the third condition (`touches_external_white`) in Code v3 consistently and incorrectly returned `False`.\n\nVisual inspection of the examples still supports the hypothesis that all three conditions combined are necessary to correctly determine which regions should be filled. The filled regions in both examples appear to be enclosed by a single color, do not touch the border, and have an \"opening\" or adjacency to the main background or another distinct white area. The single unfilled region (the lower Orange-enclosed area in Example 2) appears to be a true \"hole\" lacking adjacency to external white pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the 3-condition logic (no border, single enclosing color, touches external white) as the target transformation rule. The failure is assumed to be in the *implementation* of the `touches_external_white` check within the `_find_white_regions_and_properties` function. The natural language program and YAML facts will be updated to clearly state this 3-part condition. The subsequent coder phase must focus on correctly implementing this check.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics are based on the execution results provided for the third code attempt (labelled `code_00.py` in the prompt, but representing the code with the `touches_external_white` check).\n\n*code_execution:*\n"

Count how many distinct non-white colors are adjacent.\n        iii. **External White Contact:** Is any pixel within this region adjacent (including diagonals) to a white pixel that does *not* belong to this same contiguous region?\n3.  **Determine Fill Rule:** Select a color mapping based on the total count from step 1:\n    *   If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 2 or less, use Rule A: Red (2) becomes Green (3), Yellow (4) becomes Orange (7).\n    *   If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 3 or more, use Rule B: Red (2) becomes Orange (7), Yellow (4) becomes Green (3), Orange (7) becomes Green (3).\n4.  **Fill Qualifying Regions:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output. Iterate through each white region identified in step 2. A region qualifies for filling if it meets **all** of these conditions based on its properties:\n    *   It does **not** have Border Contact (must be False).\n    *   It has exactly **one** unique Adjacent non-white Color. Let this color be the `enclosing_color`.\n    *   It **does** have External White Contact (must be True).\n    If a region qualifies, look up its `enclosing_color` in the selected Fill Rule (A or B). If a corresponding `fill_color` exists in the rule, change all pixels within that region to the `fill_color` in the output grid. Otherwise (if the region doesn't qualify or the enclosing color isn't in the rule's map), leave the region white in the output grid.\n5.  **Return Result:** The final modified grid copy is the output."
