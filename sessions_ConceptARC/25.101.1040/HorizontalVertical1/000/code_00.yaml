elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - type: shape
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: [red (2), yellow (4), orange (7), ...]
      - connectivity: Assumed 8-way adjacency for shape pixels.
  - type: enclosed_region
    description: A contiguous region of white (0) pixels that does not touch the grid border and is entirely surrounded by pixels of a single shape/color.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - connectivity: Assumed 8-way adjacency for region pixels.
      - status: enclosed (boolean)
      - enclosing_color: The color of the single shape surrounding the region.
      - border_touching: (boolean) True if any pixel is on the grid edge.

grid_properties:
  - name: distinct_shape_colors
    description: The set of unique non-white colors present in the shapes of the input grid.
  - name: num_distinct_shape_colors
    description: The count of unique non-white colors.

transformation:
  - action: identify_shapes
    description: Locate all contiguous non-white shapes.
  - action: count_distinct_colors
    description: Determine the number of unique colors used in the identified shapes.
  - action: identify_white_regions
    description: Locate all contiguous white (0) regions.
  - action: check_enclosure
    description: For each white region, determine if it is enclosed.
    criteria:
      - Must not touch the grid border.
      - All adjacent (8-way) non-white pixels must belong to a single shape and have the same color.
  - action: determine_enclosing_color
    description: Identify the color of the shape enclosing a white region.
  - action: apply_fill_rule
    description: Select a fill color based on the enclosing color and the total number of distinct shape colors in the grid.
    rules:
      - condition: num_distinct_shape_colors <= 2
        mapping:
          - input_color: red (2)
            output_color: green (3)
          - input_color: yellow (4)
            output_color: orange (7)
          # Add other colors if observed in more examples
      - condition: num_distinct_shape_colors >= 3

          - input_color: red (2)
            output_color: orange (7)
          - input_color: yellow (4)
            output_color: green (3)
          - input_color: orange (7)
            output_color: green (3)
          # Add other colors if observed in more examples
  - action: fill_region
    description: Change the color of the pixels within an enclosed white region to the determined fill color.

output_constraints:
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - The original shapes remain unchanged in color and position.
  - Only the enclosed white regions are modified.
  - Background pixels not part of an enclosed region remain white.
