            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nThe input grids contain one or more distinct, closed shapes made of non-white pixels (Red, Yellow, Orange) on a white background. These shapes enclose regions of the white background pixels. The core transformation involves identifying these enclosed white regions and filling them with a new color. The specific color used for filling depends on the color of the shape that encloses the region. Crucially, the rule mapping the enclosing color to the fill color appears to change based on the *total number of distinct non-white colors* present in the shapes within the input grid.\n\nIn the first example, there are two distinct shape colors (Red, Yellow). Red shapes enclose areas filled with Green, and Yellow shapes enclose areas filled with Orange.\n\nIn the second example, there are three distinct shape colors (Red, Yellow, Orange). Here, Red shapes enclose areas filled with Orange, Yellow shapes enclose areas filled with Green, and Orange shapes enclose areas filled with Green.\n\nThis suggests two different color-filling rules, selected based on whether two or three (or more) distinct non-white colors form the shapes in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the set of unique colors present in these shapes and count how many distinct colors there are (`num_distinct_shape_colors`).\n2.  **Identify Candidate Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  **Check for Enclosure:** For each white region identified:\n    a.  Verify that no pixel in the region lies on the border of the grid.\n    b.  Examine all pixels directly adjacent (including diagonals) to the white region.\n    c.  Confirm that all adjacent pixels that are *not* white share the exact same single color (`enclosing_color`).\n    d.  If both conditions (a and c) are met, the white region is considered \"enclosed\".\n4.  **Determine Fill Rule:** Based on the `num_distinct_shape_colors` calculated in step 1:\n    a.  If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 2 or less, use Rule Set A: Red(2) fills Green(3), Yellow(4) fills Orange(7).\n    b.  If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 3 or more, use Rule Set B: Red(2) fills Orange(7), Yellow(4) fills Green(3), Orange(7) fills Green(3).\n5.  **Apply Filling:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output. For every white region identified as \"enclosed\" in step 3:\n    a.  Determine the appropriate `fill_color` using the selected Rule Set (A or B) and the `enclosing_color` found in step 3c.\n    b.  Change the color of all pixels within that enclosed region to the determined `fill_color` in the output grid.\n6.  **Finalize Output:** Return the modified grid. Pixels that were not part of an enclosed white region retain their original color from the input grid."
