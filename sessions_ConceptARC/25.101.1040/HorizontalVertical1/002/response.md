**General Assessment**

The provided `transform` function correctly implements the logic described in the initial natural language program. It successfully identifies enclosed white regions, counts distinct shape colors, selects a fill rule based on that count, and applies the corresponding color transformations.

The code passed Example 1, where there were 2 distinct shape colors (Red, Yellow). The failure occurred in Example 2, which has 3 distinct shape colors (Red, Yellow, Orange). The code correctly identified the 3 colors and applied the corresponding fill rule ({Red: Orange, Yellow: Green, Orange: Green}). However, the *expected output* for Example 2 shows that the region enclosed by the Orange shape should *not* be filled, contradicting the observed pattern from Example 1 and the Red/Yellow shapes in Example 2.

The core algorithm for finding enclosed white regions (BFS, checking border proximity, ensuring a single enclosing color) appears sound and correctly identified all relevant regions in both examples. The discrepancy lies specifically in the fill rule applied when 3 distinct colors are present, particularly for regions enclosed by Orange (7).

**Strategy for Resolution:**

The most direct way to reconcile the code's behavior with the expected outputs is to adjust the fill rule for the case where 3 or more distinct colors are present. Specifically, the rule derived from Example 2 indicates that regions enclosed by Orange (7) should *not* be filled under this condition, while regions enclosed by Red (2) and Yellow (4) should be filled according to the mapping {Red: Orange, Yellow: Green}. The natural language program and facts will be updated to reflect this refined rule.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze Grid Colors:** Examine the input grid and identify all unique non-white pixel colors present. Count the number of these distinct colors (`num_distinct_shape_colors`).
2.  **Identify White Regions:** Find all contiguous areas composed solely of white (0) pixels using 8-way adjacency. Keep track of the pixels belonging to each distinct white region.
3.  **Determine Enclosure Status:** For each identified white region:
    a.  Check if any pixel within the region lies on the outermost border of the grid. If yes, the region is not enclosed.
    b.  Examine all pixels immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to the white region. Collect the colors of all *non-white* adjacent pixels.
    c.  If the region does not touch the border (passes 3a) AND all adjacent non-white pixels have the exact same single color (passes 3b), then the region is considered "enclosed". Record the single color of these adjacent non-white pixels as the `enclosing_color`.
4.  **Select Fill Mapping:** Choose the appropriate color transformation rule based on `num_distinct_shape_colors`:
    *   **If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 2 or less:** Use Rule Set A: {Red(2) maps to Green(3), Yellow(4) maps to Orange(7)}.
    *   **If `num_distinct_shape_colors` is 3 or more:** Use Rule Set B: {Red(2) maps to Orange(7), Yellow(4) maps to Green(3), Orange(7) maps to White(0) (i.e., no change)}.
5.  **Apply Transformations:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through all white regions identified as "enclosed" in Step 3. For each enclosed region:
    a.  Look up its `enclosing_color` in the selected fill mapping (Rule Set A or B).
    b.  If a mapping exists, change the color of all pixels within that region in the copied grid to the corresponding mapped `fill_color`.
    c.  If no mapping exists for the `enclosing_color` in the selected rule set (or if the mapped color is White(0)), leave the region's pixels as white (0).
6.  **Return Output:** The modified grid copy is the final output.
