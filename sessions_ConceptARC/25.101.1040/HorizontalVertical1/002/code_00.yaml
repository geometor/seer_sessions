elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
  - type: shape
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency).
    properties:
      - color: [red (2), yellow (4), orange (7), ...]
  - type: enclosed_region
    description: A contiguous region of white (0) pixels (using 8-way adjacency) meeting specific criteria.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - status: enclosed (boolean)
      - criteria_for_enclosed:
          - All pixels in the region must NOT be on the grid border (row 0, col 0, row max, col max).
          - All non-white pixels immediately adjacent (8-way) to any pixel in the region must have the exact same color (`enclosing_color`).
      - enclosing_color: The single non-white color surrounding the region.

grid_properties:
  - name: distinct_shape_colors
    description: The set of unique non-white colors present in the shapes of the input grid.
  - name: num_distinct_shape_colors
    description: The count of unique non-white colors (e.g., 2 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2).

transformation:
  - action: identify_shapes_and_colors
    description: Determine the set of unique non-white colors present (`distinct_shape_colors`) and their count (`num_distinct_shape_colors`).
  - action: identify_white_regions
    description: Locate all contiguous white (0) regions using 8-way adjacency.
  - action: check_enclosure_and_identify_enclosing_color
    description: For each white region, determine if it is enclosed based on the criteria (not touching border, surrounded by single non-white color). If enclosed, record the `enclosing_color`.
  - action: select_fill_rule
    description: Choose a specific color mapping rule based on `num_distinct_shape_colors`.
    rules:
      - condition: num_distinct_shape_colors <= 2
        description: Rule Set A
        mapping:
          - enclosing_color: red (2)
            fill_color: green (3)
          - enclosing_color: yellow (4)
            fill_color: orange (7)
          # Note: Add rules for other colors if observed in future examples.
      - condition: num_distinct_shape_colors >= 3
        description: Rule Set B
        mapping:
          - enclosing_color: red (2)
            fill_color: orange (7)
          - enclosing_color: yellow (4)
            fill_color: green (3)
          - enclosing_color: orange (7)
            fill_color: white (0) # Explicitly does not fill (or fills with background)
          # Note: Add rules for other colors if observed in future examples.
  - action: apply_fill
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each region identified as 'enclosed', find the corresponding `fill_color` from the selected rule set based on its `enclosing_color`. Change the color of all pixels within that region to the `fill_color` in the copied grid. If an enclosing color doesn't have a mapping in the rule set, the region remains white.

output_constraints:
  - Grid dimensions are preserved.
  - Original non-white shapes remain unchanged.
  - Only white regions meeting the 'enclosed' criteria are potentially modified.
  - White regions not meeting the criteria remain white.
