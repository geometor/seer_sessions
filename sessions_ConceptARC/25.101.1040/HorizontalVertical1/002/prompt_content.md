"""
Identifies enclosed regions of white pixels (0) within the input grid and fills them based on the color of the enclosing shape.

The fill color depends on the number of distinct non-white colors present in the shapes across the entire grid:

1.  **Count Distinct Shape Colors:** Determine the number of unique non-white colors (1-9) present in the input grid.
2.  **Identify White Regions:** Find contiguous regions of white pixels (0).
3.  **Check for Enclosure:** A white region is considered "enclosed" if:
    a. It does not touch the border of the grid.
    b. All adjacent non-white pixels surrounding the region belong to a single shape and have the same color.
4.  **Apply Fill Rule:**
    *   **If 2 or fewer distinct shape colors exist:**
        *   Regions enclosed by Red (2) are filled with Green (3).
        *   Regions enclosed by Yellow (4) are filled with Orange (7).
        *   (Other color mappings might exist but are not shown in examples).
    *   **If 3 or more distinct shape colors exist:**
        *   Regions enclosed by Red (2) are filled with Orange (7).
        *   Regions enclosed by Yellow (4) are filled with Green (3).
        *   Regions enclosed by Orange (7) are filled with Green (3).
        *   (Other color mappings might exist but are not shown in examples).
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid with enclosed regions filled according to the rules. Shapes and unenclosed areas remain unchanged.
