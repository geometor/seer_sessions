task_description: Move a single pixel towards a boundary line until adjacent.
components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      size: variable (e.g., 10x10 in examples)
  - type: object
    id: boundary_line
    properties:
      shape: line (horizontal or vertical)
      location: along one edge of the grid (top or right in examples)
      color: variable (yellow or green in examples)
      static: true
  - type: object
    id: moving_pixel
    properties:
      shape: single pixel
      location: somewhere within the grid, not on the boundary
      color: variable (green or magenta in examples), different from boundary
      static: false
actions:
  - action: move
    target: moving_pixel
    constraints:
      - type: direction
        value: perpendicular to the boundary_line orientation (horizontal towards vertical boundary, vertical towards horizontal boundary)
      - type: destination
        value: position immediately adjacent to the boundary_line
      - type: path
        value: straight line
      - type: preserve_coordinate
        value: the coordinate parallel to the boundary_line remains unchanged
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: moving_pixel (final position)
    object2: boundary_line
    condition: directly adjacent (sharing an edge)
