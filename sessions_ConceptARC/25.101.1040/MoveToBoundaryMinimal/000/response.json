There are two distinct colored objects in the input: a single pixel (the \"mover\") and a line of pixels along one edge (the \"boundary\"). The boundary line remains unchanged in the output. The mover pixel changes its position, moving in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically) until it is immediately adjacent to the boundary line. The direction of movement is perpendicular to the orientation of the boundary line. If the boundary is vertical, the mover moves horizontally. If the boundary is horizontal, the mover moves vertically. The mover retains its original color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the boundary line object: a contiguous line of pixels of the same color located along one edge of the input grid. Note its color, location (which edge), and orientation (horizontal or vertical).\n3.  Identify the moving pixel object: a single pixel with a color different from both the background and the boundary line. Note its color and initial position (row, column).\n4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  Erase the moving pixel from its original position in the output grid (set the cell to the background color).\n6.  Determine the target position for the moving pixel:\n    *   If the boundary line is vertical (e.g., along the rightmost column `C`): The target position has the same row as the moving pixel's original row, and its column is `C-1` (immediately to the left of the boundary).\n    *   If the boundary line is horizontal (e.g., along the topmost row `R`): The target position has the same column as the moving pixel's original column, and its row is `R+1` (immediately below the boundary).\n    *   *(Generalize for other edges if necessary: left boundary -> target col = boundary_col + 1; bottom boundary -> target row = boundary_row - 1)*\n7.  Place the moving pixel (with its original color) at the calculated target position in the output grid.\n8.  The boundary line remains in its original position."
