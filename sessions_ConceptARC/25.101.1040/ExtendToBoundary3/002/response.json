            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism (drawing a line from an agent pixel) and the two distinct stopping behaviors ('solid_line' vs 'scattered'). However, the code failed on `train_2`, revealing an issue in the agent identification logic. The initial logic prioritized unique color, then spatial isolation, but incorrectly handled the case in `train_2` where multiple pixels of the same color were spatially isolated.\n\nThe `code_output` from the metric gathering confirms this. The refined identification logic (unique color -> unique isolation) still failed on `train_2` because multiple pixels were isolated. This necessitates a revised hypothesis for agent identification.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\nThe new hypothesis prioritizes structural patterns:\n1.  Look for a dominant line structure (multiple pixels of the same color in a single row or column). If found, these are the obstacles, and the single remaining non-background pixel (if one exists) is the agent.\n2.  If the above doesn't apply, revert to the previous logic: unique color identifies the agent.\n3.  If neither applies, unique spatial isolation identifies the agent.\n4.  All non-agent, non-background pixels become obstacles.\n\nThis strategy correctly identifies the agent and obstacles in all three training examples:\n*   `train_1`: Unique color (yellow) identifies agent. Gray pixels form a line and are obstacles. Fits both rules.\n*   `train_2`: Orange pixels in row 1 form a line (obstacles). Single remaining orange pixel (7,8) is the agent. Fits the new primary rule.\n*   `train_3`: Unique color (red) identifies agent. Green pixels are scattered obstacles. Fits the secondary rule.\n\nThe drawing direction and stopping logic based on 'solid_line' vs 'scattered' obstacles seem correct and do not need revision based on the analysis.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nBased on the refined understanding (\"line structure first\" or \"unique characteristic\"):\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Agent Identification: Yellow (4) at (5, 11) identified by unique color.\n    *   Obstacles: Gray (5) pixels at (0,1), (2,1), (4,1), (6,1), (8,1), (10,1).\n    *   Structure: `solid_line` (all obstacles in column 1).\n    *   Agent Location: Near right edge (row 5, col 11 in 12x12).\n    *   Direction: Away from right edge -> Left (0, -1).\n    *   Stopping Rule: Stop before column 1.\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Agent Identification: Orange (7) pixels in row 1 form a line structure. The single other orange pixel at (7, 8) is the agent.\n    *   Obstacles: Orange (7) pixels at (1,0), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (1,10), (1,12).\n    *   Structure: `solid_line` (all obstacles in row 1).\n    *   Agent Location: Near bottom edge (row 7, col 8 in 9x14).\n    *   Direction: Away from bottom edge -> Up (-1, 0).\n    *   Stopping Rule: Stop before row 1.\n    *   Result: Initial code failed due to incorrect agent ID. Refined logic should work.\n\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Agent Identification: Red (2) at (6, 0) identified by unique color.\n    *   Obstacles: Green (3) pixels at (0,0), (2,2), (4,4), (6,6).\n    *   Structure: `scattered` (obstacles in multiple rows and columns).\n    *   Agent Location: Near bottom-left corner (row 6, col 0 in 7x11).\n    *   Direction: Away from bottom-left -> Up-Right (-1, 1).\n    *   Stopping Rule: Stop after drawing on first pixel whose row OR column contains an obstacle.\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
