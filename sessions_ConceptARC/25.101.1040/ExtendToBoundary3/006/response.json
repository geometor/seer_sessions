            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code execution failed on `train_2`, despite correctly identifying the agent and obstacle types (`solid_line` vs. `scattered`) and refining the stopping logic for `solid_line` cases. The root cause was traced to a flaw in the `find_largest_line_structure` helper function. It incorrectly required *all* pixels of a given color to be part of the line structure, rather than finding the largest *subset* of same-colored pixels forming a horizontal or vertical line. This led to Rule 1 of agent identification (Structural Separation) failing for `train_2`, causing the subsequent logic to misidentify the agent or obstacles, ultimately resulting in incorrect output.\n\nThe core transformation logic (drawing a line away from the nearest edge, with two distinct stopping behaviors based on obstacle structure) remains sound. The primary fix involves correcting the implementation of `find_largest_line_structure` to correctly identify the dominant line structure even when other pixels of the same color exist elsewhere.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Correct `find_largest_line_structure`:** Modify the function to iterate through pixels grouped by color, and within each color group, find the maximum number of pixels lying on a single row and the maximum number lying on a single column. The overall largest of these row/column counts across all colors determines the \"largest line structure\".\n2.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to re-run the identification and parameter determination steps (`identify_agent_and_obstacles_refined`, `classify_obstacle_structure`, `determine_direction`) for all training examples using the corrected helper function to ensure they now produce the expected intermediate results.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML and Natural Language Program definitions, particularly for `line_structure_pixels`, to accurately reflect the process of finding the largest *subset* line.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nExecuting the core logic steps with the *corrected* `find_largest_line_structure`:\n"
