task_description: Draw a line from a single 'agent' pixel, using its color, until the line reaches a boundary defined by 'obstacle' pixels. The agent is identified via prioritized rules (structural separation, unique color, unique isolation). The stopping rule depends on the obstacle configuration ('solid_line' vs 'scattered') and the direction of movement.

definitions:
  - name: background_pixel
    value: 0 # white
  - name: non_background_pixels
    description: All pixels with color != 0.
    properties:
      - positions: List of (r, c, color) tuples.
  - name: line_structure_pixels
    description: >
      The largest possible subset of non-background pixels that
      share the same color AND lie entirely on a single row OR
      entirely on a single column. Requires a minimum of 2 pixels.
      If multiple lines have the same maximum length, the first one
      encountered (consistent iteration order) is chosen. Can be empty if no such line exists.
  - name: agent_pixel
    description: The single pixel initiating the line draw. Identified via prioritized rules.
    properties:
      - color: C
      - position: (r0, c0)
    identification_rules: # Priority Order
      - 1: If line_structure_pixels exist AND exactly one non-background pixel remains outside this structure, that remaining pixel is the agent.
      - 2: If rule 1 doesn't apply, find pixels with a color appearing only once grid-wide. If exactly one such pixel exists, it's the agent.
      - 3: If rules 1 & 2 don't apply, find non-background pixels with no neighbors (Moore neighborhood) of the same color. If exactly one such pixel exists (first found in consistent scan order), it's the agent.
      - 4: Otherwise, no agent is identified.
  - name: obstacle_pixels
    description: >
      All non-background pixels excluding the identified agent pixel.
      If rule 1 identifies the agent, obstacles are precisely the line_structure_pixels.
      Otherwise, obstacles are all other non-background pixels.
    properties:
      - positions: Set of (r, c) coordinates.
      - occupied_rows: R_O (Set of row indices containing obstacles).
      - occupied_cols: C_O (Set of column indices containing obstacles).
      - structure: Derived property, either 'solid_line' (if obstacles occupy only one row OR only one column, including single-pixel cases) or 'scattered'.

parameters:
  - name: line_direction
    description: Vector (dr, dc) determined by agent position relative to grid boundaries.
    values: # Examples
      - (-1, 0) # Up
      - (1, 0)  # Down
      - (0, -1) # Left
      - (0, 1)  # Right
      - (-1, 1) # Up-Right
    determination: Move away from the nearest grid edge/corner. Ties favor Up and/or Left components.

transformations:
  - step: Identify all non_background_pixels.
  - step: Attempt to identify agent using rule 1 (line structure separation).
  - step: If no agent yet, attempt using rule 2 (unique color).
  - step: If no agent yet, attempt using rule 3 (unique spatial isolation).
  - step: If an agent (C, (r0, c0)) was identified, define the obstacle_pixels based on the rule used. If no agent, stop and return input grid.
  - step: Analyze obstacles to determine structure ('solid_line' or 'scattered') and get occupied rows (R_O) and columns (C_O).
  - step: Determine line_direction (dr, dc) based on agent position (r0, c0) and grid dimensions.
  - step: Initialize current position (r, c) = (r0, c0).
  - step: Draw line segment:
      - Loop:
          - Calculate next position (nr, nc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
          - Check grid bounds for (nr, nc). If out, stop loop.
          - Define stop_before_coloring = False, stop_after_coloring = False.
          - if structure == 'solid_line':
              # Stop *before* entering the line's row/col based on move direction
              - if dr != 0 and dc == 0 and nr in R_O: stop_before_coloring = True # Pure vertical move into obstacle row
              - elif dr == 0 and dc != 0 and nc in C_O: stop_before_coloring = True # Pure horizontal move into obstacle col
              - elif dr != 0 and dc != 0 and (nr in R_O or nc in C_O): stop_before_coloring = True # Diagonal move into obstacle row/col
          - elif structure == 'scattered':
              # Stop *after* entering any row/col containing an obstacle
              - if nr in R_O or nc in C_O: stop_after_coloring = True
          - If stop_before_coloring: break loop.
          - Color pixel (nr, nc) with C.
          - If stop_after_coloring: break loop.
          - Update (r, c) = (nr, nc).

output_grid: The input grid modified by coloring the pixels along the drawn line segment. If no agent was identified, the output is identical to the input.
