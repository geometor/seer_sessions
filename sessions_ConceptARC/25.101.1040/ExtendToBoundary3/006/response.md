**General Assessment**

The previous code execution failed on `train_2`, despite correctly identifying the agent and obstacle types (`solid_line` vs. `scattered`) and refining the stopping logic for `solid_line` cases. The root cause was traced to a flaw in the `find_largest_line_structure` helper function. It incorrectly required *all* pixels of a given color to be part of the line structure, rather than finding the largest *subset* of same-colored pixels forming a horizontal or vertical line. This led to Rule 1 of agent identification (Structural Separation) failing for `train_2`, causing the subsequent logic to misidentify the agent or obstacles, ultimately resulting in incorrect output.

The core transformation logic (drawing a line away from the nearest edge, with two distinct stopping behaviors based on obstacle structure) remains sound. The primary fix involves correcting the implementation of `find_largest_line_structure` to correctly identify the dominant line structure even when other pixels of the same color exist elsewhere.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Correct `find_largest_line_structure`:** Modify the function to iterate through pixels grouped by color, and within each color group, find the maximum number of pixels lying on a single row and the maximum number lying on a single column. The overall largest of these row/column counts across all colors determines the "largest line structure".
2.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to re-run the identification and parameter determination steps (`identify_agent_and_obstacles_refined`, `classify_obstacle_structure`, `determine_direction`) for all training examples using the corrected helper function to ensure they now produce the expected intermediate results.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML and Natural Language Program definitions, particularly for `line_structure_pixels`, to accurately reflect the process of finding the largest *subset* line.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Find all non-background pixels in the input grid. If none exist, return the input grid.
2.  **Identify the Agent:**
    *   a. Find the largest possible group (minimum 2 pixels) of non-background pixels that share the same color AND all lie on the same single row OR the same single column (this is the 'line structure'). If there's a tie for largest, use the first one found.
    *   b. If such a line structure exists and there is *exactly one* other non-background pixel anywhere else in the grid, designate that single pixel as the **agent**. The pixels in the line structure become the **obstacles**.
    *   c. If step (b) did not identify an agent, check if there is *exactly one* pixel whose color is unique across the entire grid. If so, designate that pixel as the **agent**. All other non-background pixels become **obstacles**.
    *   d. If steps (b) and (c) did not identify an agent, check if there is *exactly one* non-background pixel that has no neighbors (including diagonals) of the same color (first found in a consistent scan). If so, designate that pixel as the **agent**. All other non-background pixels become **obstacles**.
    *   e. If no agent was identified by steps (b), (c), or (d), return the input grid unchanged.
3.  Note the agent's color (C) and position (r0, c0).
4.  Analyze the **obstacle** positions: Determine if they occupy only a single row OR a single column (structure is 'solid\_line'), or if they occupy multiple rows AND columns (structure is 'scattered'). Record the set of rows (R\_O) and columns (C\_O) occupied by any obstacle.
5.  Determine the drawing direction vector (dr, dc) based on the agent's position (r0, c0). The direction moves away from the nearest grid edge or corner (ties favor Up and/or Left components).
6.  Initialize the current drawing position (r, c) to the agent's position (r0, c0).
7.  **Draw the Line:**
    *   Repeatedly calculate the next potential position (nr, nc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
    *   Stop drawing if (nr, nc) is outside the grid boundaries.
    *   **Check Stopping Conditions:**
        *   If the obstacle structure is 'solid\_line':
            *   If moving purely vertically (`dc == 0`) and the next row `nr` is in R\_O, stop drawing *before* coloring (nr, nc).
            *   If moving purely horizontally (`dr == 0`) and the next column `nc` is in C\_O, stop drawing *before* coloring (nr, nc).
            *   If moving diagonally (`dr != 0` and `dc != 0`) and (the next row `nr` is in R\_O OR the next column `nc` is in C\_O), stop drawing *before* coloring (nr, nc).
        *   If the obstacle structure is 'scattered':
            *   If the next row `nr` is in R\_O OR the next column `nc` is in C\_O, plan to stop drawing *after* coloring this pixel (nr, nc).
    *   If the decision was made to stop *before* coloring, exit the drawing loop now.
    *   Color the pixel at (nr, nc) with the agent's color C.
    *   If the decision was made to stop *after* coloring (in the 'scattered' case), exit the drawing loop now.
    *   Update the current position (r, c) = (nr, nc) and continue the loop.
8.  Output the resulting grid.
