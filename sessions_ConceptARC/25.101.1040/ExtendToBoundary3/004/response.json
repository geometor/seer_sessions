            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous iteration successfully identified the agent and obstacle structures for all examples, including the challenging `train_2` case, by introducing prioritized agent identification rules (structural separation first). However, the code execution revealed that `train_2` still failed.\n\nThe error lies in the stopping condition logic for the 'solid\\_line' obstacle structure. The code incorrectly stopped the line drawing immediately if the *next* pixel's column was occupied by an obstacle, even when moving vertically towards a horizontal obstacle line. The stopping condition for a solid line needs to be more specific: the line should only stop when the next step would cross into the specific row (for a horizontal line) or column (for a vertical line) occupied by the obstacles, considering the direction of movement. The 'scattered' obstacle stopping logic appears correct.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Refine 'solid\\_line' Stopping Logic:** Modify the drawing loop. When the obstacle structure is 'solid\\_line', the stopping check must depend on the direction of movement (`dr`, `dc`):\n    *   If moving purely vertically (`dc == 0`), stop only if `next_r` is in `obstacle_rows`.\n    *   If moving purely horizontally (`dr == 0`), stop only if `next_c` is in `obstacle_cols`.\n    *   If moving diagonally (`dr != 0` and `dc != 0`), stop if `next_r` is in `obstacle_rows` OR `next_c` is in `obstacle_cols`.\n2.  **Verify Agent Identification and Direction:** Double-check that the agent identification and direction logic remain correct for all examples with the refined understanding. (The previous analysis indicated they were correct).\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML definitions and Natural Language Program to reflect the precise stopping logic for 'solid\\_line' obstacles based on movement direction.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\n*   **train\\_1:**\n    *   Agent: Yellow (4) at (5, 11). Rule: Unique Color. Correct.\n    *   Obstacles: Gray (5) line in column 1. Structure: `solid_line`. Correct.\n    *   Direction: (0, -1) (Left). Correct.\n    *   Stopping: Obstacle column = {1}. Moving horizontally (`dr=0, dc=-1`). Should stop *before* `next_c` is 1. `classify_obstacle_structure` correctly identifies `solid_line` (since `len(occupied_cols) == 1`). The refined logic will check `if dr == 0: stop if next_c in obstacle_cols`. This is correct. Expected output matches.\n*   **train\\_2:**\n    *   Agent: Orange (7) at (7, 8). Rule: Structural Separation. Correct.\n    *   Obstacles: Orange (7) line in row 1. Structure: `solid_line`. Correct.\n    *   Direction: (-1, 0) (Up). Correct.\n    *   Stopping: Obstacle row = {1}. Moving vertically (`dr=-1, dc=0`). Should stop *before* `next_r` is 1. `classify_obstacle_structure` correctly identifies `solid_line` (since `len(occupied_rows) == 1`). The refined logic will check `if dc == 0: stop if next_r in obstacle_rows`. This corrects the previous error. Expected output should now match.\n*   **train\\_3:**\n    *   Agent: Red (2) at (6, 0). Rule: Unique Color. Correct.\n    *   Obstacles: Green (3) scattered points. Structure: `scattered`. Correct.\n    *   Direction: (-1, 1) (Up-Right). Correct.\n    *   Stopping: Obstacle rows = {0, 2, 4, 6}, Obstacle cols = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Moving diagonally. Should stop *after* drawing on the first pixel where `next_r` is in {0, 2, 4, 6} OR `next_c` is in {0, 2, 4, 6}.\n        *   Start: (6, 0)\n        *   Step 1: Draw at (5, 1). `5 not in R_O`, `1 not in C_O`. Continue.\n        *   Step 2: Draw at (4, 2). `4 in R_O`, `2 in C_O`. Draw here and stop.\n    *   This matches the expected output. The 'scattered' logic is correct.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
