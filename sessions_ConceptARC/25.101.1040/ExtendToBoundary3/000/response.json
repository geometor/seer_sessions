            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Key Elements:** The grids contain distinct types of non-background elements:\n    *   A single \"agent\" pixel: This pixel seems to initiate the transformation. In the examples, it's often identified by being the only pixel of its color (yellow in train_1, red in train_3) or being spatially isolated from other pixels of the same color (the single orange pixel in train_2, distinct from the orange pixels in the top row).\n    *   A set of \"obstacle\" pixels: These are the other non-background pixels. They seem to define boundaries or stopping points for the action initiated by the agent. They can form structures like lines (gray vertical line in train_1, orange horizontal line in train_2) or be scattered points (green diagonal points in train_3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is drawing a line segment originating from the agent pixel, using the agent pixel's color.\n4.  **Line Direction:** The direction of the line appears determined by the agent's position relative to the grid boundaries. Agents near an edge or corner seem to draw lines moving away from that edge/corner (e.g., right edge -> move left, bottom edge -> move up, bottom-left corner -> move up-right).\n5.  **Stopping Condition:** The line segment stops based on interaction with the obstacle pixels. The specific rule seems to depend on the arrangement of the obstacles:\n    *   If obstacles form a solid line (like train_1, train_2), the drawn line stops exactly one pixel *before* reaching the row or column occupied by the obstacle line.\n    *   If obstacles are scattered points (like train_3), the drawn line stops *at* the first pixel whose row OR column contains any obstacle pixel.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
