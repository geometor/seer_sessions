**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding two overlapping objects, determining which one "interrupts" the other based on connectivity, and using the "interrupted" object's color for the output. However, the previous code failed because it incorrectly defined the output shape as the simple union of *all* pixels from both input objects.

The execution results show that the output shape is more constrained. By comparing the `Transformed Output` with the `Expected Output` in each example, we observe that the final shape corresponds to the union of the two input objects' pixels, but only those pixels falling *within the bounding box of the originally interrupted object*. The parts of the "interrupting" object that extend beyond the spatial extent (specifically, the row range or column range, depending on orientation) of the "interrupted" object are excluded from the final output shape.

The strategy is to:
1.  Retain the logic for identifying the two non-background colors (Color A, Color B).
2.  Retain the logic for determining the "interrupted" color by checking connectivity after temporarily removing the other color.
3.  Modify the output shape generation. Instead of taking the full union of pixels, calculate the bounding box of the *interrupted* object.
4.  The final output shape will consist of all pixels from *both* original objects (Color A and Color B) that lie *within* this calculated bounding box.
5.  Fill this constrained union shape with the color of the interrupted object.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid, Color A and Color B. Record the set of pixel coordinates for each color (Coords A and Coords B).
2.  Determine which object is "interrupted".
    a. Create a temporary grid 1 by replacing all pixels at Coords B with the background color. Check if the remaining pixels of Color A form a single connected component. Note if Color A became disconnected.
    b. Create a temporary grid 2 by replacing all pixels at Coords A with the background color. Check if the remaining pixels of Color B form a single connected component. Note if Color B became disconnected.
    c. The color that *became disconnected* is the `interrupted_color`. Let its coordinates be `coords_interrupted`. The other color is the `interrupting_color`, and its coordinates are `coords_interrupting`.
3.  Calculate the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) of the `coords_interrupted`.
4.  Create the set of all non-background pixel coordinates from the input grid: `all_input_coords` = `coords_interrupted` ∪ `coords_interrupting`.
5.  Filter `all_input_coords` to create the `output_coords`: include only those coordinates `(r, c)` from `all_input_coords` where `r` is between the minimum and maximum rows (inclusive) and `c` is between the minimum and maximum columns (inclusive) of the bounding box calculated in step 3.
6.  Create the output grid, having the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color.
7.  For every pixel coordinate `(r, c)` in the `output_coords` set (from step 5), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the `interrupted_color` (determined in step 2c).
