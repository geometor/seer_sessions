            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: finding two overlapping objects, determining which one \"interrupts\" the other based on connectivity, and using the \"interrupted\" object's color for the output. However, the previous code failed because it incorrectly defined the output shape as the simple union of *all* pixels from both input objects.\n\nThe execution results show that the output shape is more constrained. By comparing the `Transformed Output` with the `Expected Output` in each example, we observe that the final shape corresponds to the union of the two input objects' pixels, but only those pixels falling *within the bounding box of the originally interrupted object*. The parts of the \"interrupting\" object that extend beyond the spatial extent (specifically, the row range or column range, depending on orientation) of the \"interrupted\" object are excluded from the final output shape.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Retain the logic for identifying the two non-background colors (Color A, Color B).\n2.  Retain the logic for determining the \"interrupted\" color by checking connectivity after temporarily removing the other color.\n3.  Modify the output shape generation. Instead of taking the full union of pixels, calculate the bounding box of the *interrupted* object.\n4.  The final output shape will consist of all pixels from *both* original objects (Color A and Color B) that lie *within* this calculated bounding box.\n5.  Fill this constrained union shape with the color of the interrupted object.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
