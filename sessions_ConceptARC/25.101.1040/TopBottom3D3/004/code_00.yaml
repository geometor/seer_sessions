task_type: object_completion_within_bounds
grid_properties:
  size: variable
  background_color: 0 (white)
input_features:
  num_objects: 2 (excluding background)
  object_properties:
    - color: two distinct non-white colors (color_A, color_B)
    - shape: contiguous blocks
    - overlap: the two objects always overlap
relationship:
  - type: spatial_interruption
    determining_factor: connectivity check
    definitions:
      - interrupted_object: The object (e.g., Object A) whose pixels become disconnected when the other object's (Object B) pixels are temporarily replaced with the background color. Identified by its color (interrupted_color) and coordinates (coords_interrupted).
      - interrupting_object: The object (e.g., Object B) whose pixels remain connected when the other object's (Object A) pixels are temporarily replaced with the background color. Identified by its color (interrupting_color) and coordinates (coords_interrupting).
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects_and_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: color_A, color_B, coords_A, coords_B
  - action: determine_interrupted_object
    input: input_grid, color_A, color_B, coords_A, coords_B
    logic: Perform connectivity checks by temporarily removing each object to see which one disconnects the other.
    output: interrupted_color, coords_interrupted, interrupting_color, coords_interrupting
  - action: calculate_interrupted_bounding_box
    input: coords_interrupted
    output: bbox (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
  - action: determine_output_shape
    input: coords_A, coords_B, bbox
    logic: Find the union of coords_A and coords_B. Filter this union to include only coordinates within the calculated bbox.
    output: output_coords
  - action: generate_output_grid
    input: grid_dimensions, background_color, output_coords, interrupted_color
    logic: Create a new grid filled with background_color, then set pixels at output_coords to interrupted_color.
output_features:
  num_objects: 1 (excluding background)
  object_properties:
    - color: the color of the 'interrupted' object from the input (interrupted_color)
    - shape: All pixels corresponding to either original object within the bounding box of the 'interrupted' object.
