**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid containing two overlapping, single-color objects into an output grid with a single object. The transformation identifies which of the two input objects "interrupts" the continuity of the other object. The interrupting object's color is discarded. The final object in the output grid occupies the combined area (union) of the two original objects and takes the color of the object that was interrupted (or not interrupted, depending on perspective).

1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and exactly two distinct non-white colored objects. These objects are contiguous blocks of single colors, but they overlap each other.
2.  **Object Interaction:** One object's shape cuts through the other object, potentially splitting the second object into disconnected parts if the first object were removed.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   Identify the two non-white objects (Object A and Object B).
    *   Determine which object (e.g., Object A) interrupts the other (Object B). This means that the pixels belonging to Object B would be disconnected if Object A were removed (changed to white).
    *   The color of the interrupting object (Object A) is discarded.
    *   The color of the non-interrupting/interrupted object (Object B) is kept.
    *   The output grid contains a single object whose shape is the union of the shapes of Object A and Object B.
    *   This resulting union shape is filled with the kept color (color of Object B).
    *   All other grid cells are white (color 0).
4.  **Output Analysis:** The output grid contains only the background color and the single resulting object colored with the "kept" color, occupying the union of the areas of the original two objects.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid, Color A and Color B. Let the set of pixels for Color A be Pixels A, and for Color B be Pixels B.
2.  Create a temporary grid 1 by replacing all pixels in Pixels B with the background color (white). Check if the remaining pixels of Color A (originally Pixels A) form a single connected component.
3.  Create a temporary grid 2 by replacing all pixels in Pixels A with the background color (white). Check if the remaining pixels of Color B (originally Pixels B) form a single connected component.
4.  Determine the "interrupting" color:
    *   If Pixels A became disconnected in step 2, then Color B is the interrupting color, and Color A is the kept color.
    *   If Pixels B became disconnected in step 3, then Color A is the interrupting color, and Color B is the kept color.
    *   (Assumption based on examples: exactly one color will be interrupting).
5.  Create the output grid, initially filled with the background color (white).
6.  Find the union of the pixel coordinates from Pixels A and Pixels B.
7.  For every pixel coordinate in the union set, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the kept color determined in step 4.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components of the task: identifying two overlapping objects, determining an interaction based on connectivity, and producing an output object based on the union of shapes and a selected color. However, the crucial step of determining *which* color to keep based on the connectivity test was inverted.

The results show that the generated code consistently selected the color of the "interrupting" object (the one that remains connected when the other is removed) instead of the "interrupted" object (the one that becomes disconnected when the other is removed), which is required by the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the interpretation of the connectivity test results. The color to be kept for the final output is the one belonging to the object that *becomes disconnected* when the other object's pixels are temporarily removed.
2.  Update the natural language program to reflect this corrected logic accurately.
3.  Update the YAML facts to clearly define the "interrupted" object and its role in determining the output color.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Based on the code execution results and re-evaluation:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Colors: Blue (1), Red (2).
    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Red (2) makes Blue (1) *disconnected*. Removing Blue (1) leaves Red (2) *connected*.
    *   Conclusion: Red (2) interrupts Blue (1). Blue (1) is the "interrupted" color.
    *   Expected Output Color: Blue (1).
    *   Previous Code Output Color: Red (2). (Incorrect)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Colors: Green (3), Yellow (4).
    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Yellow (4) makes Green (3) *disconnected*. Removing Green (3) leaves Yellow (4) *connected*.
    *   Conclusion: Yellow (4) interrupts Green (3). Green (3) is the "interrupted" color.
    *   Expected Output Color: Green (3).
    *   Previous Code Output Color: Yellow (4). (Incorrect)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Colors: Magenta (6), Orange (7).
    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Magenta (6) makes Orange (7) *disconnected*. Removing Orange (7) leaves Magenta (6) *connected*.
    *   Conclusion: Magenta (6) interrupts Orange (7). Orange (7) is the "interrupted" color.
    *   Expected Output Color: Orange (7).
    *   Previous Code Output Color: Magenta (6). (Incorrect)

The common pattern is that the previous logic selected the color that remained connected, while the correct logic requires selecting the color that became disconnected.

      1. Temporarily remove color_B pixels from grid -> grid_temp_A.
      2. Check connectivity of color_A pixels in grid_temp_A.

      5. If color_A became disconnected AND color_B remained connected, then color_A is the interrupted_color.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid, Color A and Color B. Record the set of pixel coordinates for each color (Coords A and Coords B).
2.  Create a temporary grid 1 by replacing all pixels at Coords B with the background color (white). Check if the remaining pixels of Color A (at Coords A) form a single connected component (using 4-connectivity). Note whether Color A remained connected or became disconnected.
3.  Create a temporary grid 2 by replacing all pixels at Coords A with the background color (white). Check if the remaining pixels of Color B (at Coords B) form a single connected component (using 4-connectivity). Note whether Color B remained connected or became disconnected.
4.  Determine the "kept" color: The kept color is the color (either Color A or Color B) that became *disconnected* during the connectivity checks in steps 2 and 3. (Based on the examples, exactly one color will become disconnected).
5.  Calculate the union of the two sets of pixel coordinates: Union Coords = Coords A ∪ Coords B.
6.  Create the output grid, having the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white).
7.  For every pixel coordinate in the Union Coords set, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the "kept" color determined in step 4.
