Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the two distinct non-white colors (Color A, Color B) and their pixel locations (Coords A, Coords B) in the input grid.
2. Determine which object is 'interrupted' by the other. This is done by:
    a. Temporarily removing Color B's pixels (setting them to white) and checking if Color A's pixels remain a single connected component.
    b. Temporarily removing Color A's pixels and checking if Color B's pixels remain a single connected component.
3. The 'kept' color for the output is the color of the object that *became disconnected* in the test above (i.e., the 'interrupted' object).
4. Calculate the union of the pixel locations of both original non-white objects (Union Coords = Coords A U Coords B).
5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
6. Fill the pixels corresponding to the calculated Union Coords with the 'kept' color.
