Identify the two distinct non-white colors (Color A, Color B) and their pixel locations in the input grid.\n2. Determine which color acts as the 'interrupting' color. This is done by temporarily removing one color (setting its pixels to white) and checking if the other color's pixels remain a single connected component.\n3. The color whose pixels *remain* connected when the *other* color is removed is the 'kept' color (it was the one being interrupted). The other color is the 'interrupting' color and is discarded.\n4. Calculate the union of the pixel locations of both original non-white colors.\n5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n6.
