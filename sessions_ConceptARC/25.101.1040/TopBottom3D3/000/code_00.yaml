task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  size: variable (8x8 in examples)
  background_color: 0 (white)
input_features:
  num_objects: 2 (excluding background)
  object_properties:
    - color: distinct non-white colors (e.g., blue/red, yellow/green, magenta/orange)
    - shape: contiguous blocks (rectangles, lines in examples)
    - overlap: the two objects always overlap
relationship:
  - type: interruption
    description: One object's placement visually divides the other object into multiple segments.
    determining_factor: Removing the 'interrupting' object would leave the 'interrupted' object as disconnected components.
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: non-white contiguous pixel groups
    count: 2
  - action: determine_interruption
    input_objects: object1, object2
    output: interrupting_object, interrupted_object
    logic: Check connectivity of object2 pixels if object1 pixels are removed, and vice-versa.
  - action: determine_output_color
    source: interrupted_object.color
  - action: determine_output_shape
    input_objects: object1, object2
    logic: Calculate the union of the pixel coordinates of object1 and object2.
  - action: generate_output_grid
    output_shape: calculated union shape
    output_color: determined output color
    background_color: 0 (white)
output_features:
  num_objects: 1 (excluding background)
  object_properties:
    - color: color of the 'interrupted' object from the input
    - shape: union of the shapes of the two input objects
