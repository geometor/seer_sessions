The transformation identifies which of the two input objects \"interrupts\" the continuity of the other object. The interrupting object's color is discarded. The final object in the output grid occupies the combined area (union) of the two original objects and takes the color of the object that was interrupted (or not interrupted, depending on perspective).\n\n1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and exactly two distinct non-white colored objects. These objects are contiguous blocks of single colors, but they overlap each other.\n2.  **Object Interaction:** One object's shape cuts through the other object, potentially splitting the second object into disconnected parts if the first object were removed.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Identify the two non-white objects (Object A and Object B).\n    *   Determine which object (e.g., Object A) interrupts the other (Object B). This means that the pixels belonging to Object B would be disconnected if Object A were removed (changed to white).\n    *   The color of the interrupting object (Object A) is discarded.\n    *   The color of the non-interrupting/interrupted object (Object B) is kept.\n    *   The output grid contains a single object whose shape is the union of the shapes of Object A and Object B.\n    *   This resulting union shape is filled with the kept color (color of Object B).\n    *   All other grid cells are white (color 0).\n4.  **Output Analysis:** The output grid contains only the background color and the single resulting object colored with the \"kept\" color, occupying the union of the areas of the original two objects.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
