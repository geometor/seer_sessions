            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components of the task: identifying two overlapping objects, determining an interaction based on connectivity, and producing an output object based on the union of shapes and a selected color. However, the crucial step of determining *which* color to keep based on the connectivity test was inverted.\n\nThe results show that the generated code consistently selected the color of the \"interrupting\" object (the one that remains connected when the other is removed) instead of the \"interrupted\" object (the one that becomes disconnected when the other is removed), which is required by the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the interpretation of the connectivity test results. The color to be kept for the final output is the one belonging to the object that *becomes disconnected* when the other object's pixels are temporarily removed.\n2.  Update the natural language program to reflect this corrected logic accurately.\n3.  Update the YAML facts to clearly define the \"interrupted\" object and its role in determining the output color.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nBased on the code execution results and re-evaluation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Colors: Blue (1), Red (2).\n    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Red (2) makes Blue (1) *disconnected*. Removing Blue (1) leaves Red (2) *connected*.\n    *   Conclusion: Red (2) interrupts Blue (1). Blue (1) is the \"interrupted\" color.\n    *   Expected Output Color: Blue (1).\n    *   Previous Code Output Color: Red (2). (Incorrect)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Colors: Green (3), Yellow (4).\n    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Yellow (4) makes Green (3) *disconnected*. Removing Green (3) leaves Yellow (4) *connected*.\n    *   Conclusion: Yellow (4) interrupts Green (3). Green (3) is the \"interrupted\" color.\n    *   Expected Output Color: Green (3).\n    *   Previous Code Output Color: Yellow (4). (Incorrect)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Colors: Magenta (6), Orange (7).\n    *   Connectivity Test: Removing Magenta (6) makes Orange (7) *disconnected*. Removing Orange (7) leaves Magenta (6) *connected*.\n    *   Conclusion: Magenta (6) interrupts Orange (7). Orange (7) is the \"interrupted\" color.\n    *   Expected Output Color: Orange (7).\n    *   Previous Code Output Color: Magenta (6). (Incorrect)\n\nThe common pattern is that the previous logic selected the color that remained connected, while the correct logic requires selecting the color that became disconnected.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts**\n\n"
