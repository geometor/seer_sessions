Task: Extract a specific rectangular object from the input grid.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects: Contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
  - Properties:
    - Color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in an object.
    - Shape: Geometric form of the object (rectangle, irregular, etc.).
    - Solid_Rectangle: An object whose bounding box contains only pixels of its own color.
    - Area: Number of pixels in an object (or its bounding box).
    - Position: Coordinates (row, column) of the object or its bounding box.
    - Border_Color: The color of the largest non-white object adjacent to the grid edges.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array representing the selected object.
  - Content: A single, solid, monochromatic rectangle extracted from the input.

Relationships_and_Rules:
  - Selection_Criteria: Identify all solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangles in the input.
  - Primary_Rule: Select the solid rectangle with the largest area.
  - Tie_Breaking_Rule_1: If multiple rectangles share the largest area, check if any have the same color as the identified Border_Color. If one does, select it.
  - Tie_Breaking_Rule_2: If multiple rectangles share the largest area and none match the Border_Color, find the median color index among the tied rectangles. Select the rectangle with that median color index.

Examples_Analysis:
  - train_1:
    - Border_Color: Blue(1).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Yellow(4) [Area 16].
    - Max_Area: 16. Only Yellow qualifies.
    - Output: Yellow(4) rectangle.
  - train_2:
    - Border_Color: Red(2).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Green(3)[4], Orange(7)[4], Magenta(6)[4], Maroon(9)[4], Blue(1)[4].
    - Max_Area: 4. All five tie.
    - Border_Match: None match Red(2).
    - Tied_Colors: [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]. Median is 6.
    - Output: Magenta(6) rectangle.
  - train_3:
    - Border_Color: Yellow(4).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Yellow(4)[Area 24], smaller green shapes (not solid rectangles or smaller area).
    - Max_Area: 24. Only Yellow qualifies.
    - Output: Yellow(4) rectangle.
