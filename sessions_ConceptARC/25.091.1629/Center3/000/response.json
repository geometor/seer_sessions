There's usually a background color (white, 0) and often a frame or border object surrounding other objects.\n2.  **Objects:** The core elements are contiguous blocks of single colors. Some of these objects form simple geometric shapes, particularly solid rectangles. Other objects might have holes or irregular shapes (like the borders).\n3.  **Output Structure:** Each output is a smaller grid representing a solid rectangle.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting one specific object from the input grid and presenting it as the output. The selection criteria seem based on the object's shape (being a solid rectangle) and its properties (area, color) relative to other objects and potentially the border color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If one does, select it.\n  - Tie_Breaking_Rule_2: If multiple rectangles share the largest area and none match the Border_Color, find the median color index among the tied rectangles.

Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous objects made of a single color (excluding white/0).\n3.  For each object found, determine its bounding box.\n4.  Check if the object is a 'solid rectangle' by verifying that all pixels within its bounding box have the same color as the object itself.\n5.  Calculate the area (width * height) of each solid rectangle.\n6.  Identify the maximum area found among all solid rectangles.\n7.  Filter the list of solid rectangles to keep only those with the maximum area.\n8.  If only one solid rectangle has the maximum area, select this rectangle as the target.\n9.  If multiple solid rectangles share the maximum area (a tie):\n    a.  Check if any of the tied rectangles have the same color as the 'border color' identified in step 1.\n    b.  If exactly one tied rectangle matches the border color, select that rectangle as the target.\n    c.  If none of the tied rectangles match the border color, collect the color indices of all the tied rectangles. Find the median value among these indices. Select the rectangle whose color index is this median value as the target. (Assumption: If there's an even number of tied colors, a consistent rule like choosing the lower median might be needed, but current examples suggest an odd number).\n10. Create the output grid containing only the pixels of the selected target rectangle."
