Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a grid containing multiple distinct regions (objects) of different colors. There's usually a background color (white, 0) and often a frame or border object surrounding other objects.
2.  **Objects:** The core elements are contiguous blocks of single colors. Some of these objects form simple geometric shapes, particularly solid rectangles. Other objects might have holes or irregular shapes (like the borders).
3.  **Output Structure:** Each output is a smaller grid representing a solid rectangle.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting one specific object from the input grid and presenting it as the output. The selection criteria seem based on the object's shape (being a solid rectangle) and its properties (area, color) relative to other objects and potentially the border color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Extract a specific rectangular object from the input grid.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects: Contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
  - Properties:
    - Color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in an object.
    - Shape: Geometric form of the object (rectangle, irregular, etc.).
    - Solid_Rectangle: An object whose bounding box contains only pixels of its own color.
    - Area: Number of pixels in an object (or its bounding box).
    - Position: Coordinates (row, column) of the object or its bounding box.
    - Border_Color: The color of the largest non-white object adjacent to the grid edges.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array representing the selected object.
  - Content: A single, solid, monochromatic rectangle extracted from the input.

Relationships_and_Rules:
  - Selection_Criteria: Identify all solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangles in the input.
  - Primary_Rule: Select the solid rectangle with the largest area.
  - Tie_Breaking_Rule_1: If multiple rectangles share the largest area, check if any have the same color as the identified Border_Color. If one does, select it.
  - Tie_Breaking_Rule_2: If multiple rectangles share the largest area and none match the Border_Color, find the median color index among the tied rectangles. Select the rectangle with that median color index.

Examples_Analysis:
  - train_1:
    - Border_Color: Blue(1).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Yellow(4) [Area 16].
    - Max_Area: 16. Only Yellow qualifies.
    - Output: Yellow(4) rectangle.
  - train_2:
    - Border_Color: Red(2).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Green(3)[4], Orange(7)[4], Magenta(6)[4], Maroon(9)[4], Blue(1)[4].
    - Max_Area: 4. All five tie.
    - Border_Match: None match Red(2).
    - Tied_Colors: [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]. Median is 6.
    - Output: Magenta(6) rectangle.
  - train_3:
    - Border_Color: Yellow(4).
    - Solid_Rectangles: Yellow(4)[Area 24], smaller green shapes (not solid rectangles or smaller area).
    - Max_Area: 24. Only Yellow qualifies.
    - Output: Yellow(4) rectangle.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the 'border color' by finding the color (excluding white/0) of the largest object that touches the edges of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous objects made of a single color (excluding white/0).
3.  For each object found, determine its bounding box.
4.  Check if the object is a 'solid rectangle' by verifying that all pixels within its bounding box have the same color as the object itself.
5.  Calculate the area (width * height) of each solid rectangle.
6.  Identify the maximum area found among all solid rectangles.
7.  Filter the list of solid rectangles to keep only those with the maximum area.
8.  If only one solid rectangle has the maximum area, select this rectangle as the target.
9.  If multiple solid rectangles share the maximum area (a tie):
    a.  Check if any of the tied rectangles have the same color as the 'border color' identified in step 1.
    b.  If exactly one tied rectangle matches the border color, select that rectangle as the target.
    c.  If none of the tied rectangles match the border color, collect the color indices of all the tied rectangles. Find the median value among these indices. Select the rectangle whose color index is this median value as the target. (Assumption: If there's an even number of tied colors, a consistent rule like choosing the lower median might be needed, but current examples suggest an odd number).
10. Create the output grid containing only the pixels of the selected target rectangle.
