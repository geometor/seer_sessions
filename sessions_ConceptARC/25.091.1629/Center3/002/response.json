The examples show that the target object isn't necessarily a \"solid\" rectangle filled *only* with its own color. Instead, the outputs correspond to the *bounding box region* of an input object, and this region can contain the object's color and the background color (white, 0).\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify \"Candidate Objects\":** Find all non-white objects. An object `O` of color `C` is a \"Candidate\" if its bounding box contains *only* pixels of color `C` and the background color `0`.\n2.  **Selection Logic:**\n    *   If only one Candidate Object exists, select it.\n    *   If multiple Candidates exist:\n        *   Determine the Border Color (color of the largest object touching the grid edges).\n        *   Get the list of colors of all Candidate Objects.\n        *   **Primary Selection:** Find the median color from the list of candidate colors (use the lower median if the count is even). Select the Candidate Object with this median color.\n        *   **Override Condition:** If the Border Color is present among the candidate colors *and* it is the *maximum* value among the candidate colors, override the median selection and choose the Candidate Object matching the Border Color instead.\n3.  **Output:** Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the finally selected Candidate Object.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the properties of objects in the examples based on the new \"Candidate Object\" definition.\n\n"
