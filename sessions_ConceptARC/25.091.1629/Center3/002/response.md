Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code failed on `train_1` and `train_3`, succeeding only on `train_2`.
*   `train_1` failure (output `[[0]]` instead of the Yellow object) suggests the target object (Yellow, `[[4,4,4,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,4,4,4]]`) was not identified correctly by the "solid rectangle" criteria (where object pixels must equal bounding box area).
*   `train_3` failure (output `[[3,3,3]]` instead of the large Yellow object) indicates that either the wrong object was selected (a small solid Green rectangle perhaps) or the criteria were misapplied.

The core issue seems to be the definition of the target object. The examples show that the target object isn't necessarily a "solid" rectangle filled *only* with its own color. Instead, the outputs correspond to the *bounding box region* of an input object, and this region can contain the object's color and the background color (white, 0).

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  **Identify "Candidate Objects":** Find all non-white objects. An object `O` of color `C` is a "Candidate" if its bounding box contains *only* pixels of color `C` and the background color `0`.
2.  **Selection Logic:**
    *   If only one Candidate Object exists, select it.
    *   If multiple Candidates exist:
        *   Determine the Border Color (color of the largest object touching the grid edges).
        *   Get the list of colors of all Candidate Objects.
        *   **Primary Selection:** Find the median color from the list of candidate colors (use the lower median if the count is even). Select the Candidate Object with this median color.
        *   **Override Condition:** If the Border Color is present among the candidate colors *and* it is the *maximum* value among the candidate colors, override the median selection and choose the Candidate Object matching the Border Color instead.
3.  **Output:** Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the finally selected Candidate Object.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's verify the properties of objects in the examples based on the new "Candidate Object" definition.
