"""
The transformation rule identifies colors within an input list that appear exactly once.
1. Count the frequency of each color in the input list.
2. Identify the set of colors that appear exactly once (let's call them 'unique_colors').
3. If there is only one color in 'unique_colors', that color is the output.
4. If there are multiple colors in 'unique_colors':
    a. Find the first index (position) of each color from 'unique_colors' in the original input list.
    b. Collect these indices.
    c. Sort the collected indices.
    d. Find the median index from this sorted list. For an even number of indices, use the lower middle index (floor((n-1)/2)).
    e. The output is the color located at this median index in the original input list.
