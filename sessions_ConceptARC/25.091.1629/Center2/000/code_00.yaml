Task: Select a specific color from a list based on frequency and position.

Input:
  - Type: List of integers (colors)
  - Constraints: Values 0-9. List length varies.

Output:
  - Type: Single integer (color)

Core_Logic:
  - Step_1: Count the frequency of each distinct color in the input list.
  - Step_2: Identify the set of colors that appear exactly once. Let this set be S.
  - Step_3: Determine the output based on the size of S:
      - Case_A (Size of S == 1): The single color in S is the output.
      - Case_B (Size of S > 1): 
          - Find the first index (position) of each color from S in the original input list.
          - Identify the median index from this list of indices. (For an even number of indices, use the lower middle index, corresponding to floor((n-1)/2)).
          - The color in the original input list located at this median index is the output.
      - Case_C (Size of S == 0): (Not observed in examples, but logically possible). If no color appears exactly once, the rule is undefined by the examples. Assume this case won't occur or needs clarification.

Examples_Analysis:
  - Example 1:
      - Input: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]
      - Frequencies: All 1.
      - Set S: {3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9} (Size 7 > 1) -> Case B
      - Indices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      - Median Index: floor((7-1)/2) = 3.
      - Output: Element at index 3 -> 2. Correct.
  - Example 2:
      - Input: [8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]
      - Frequencies: {8:1, 3:6, 7:1, 4:1}
      - Set S: {8, 7, 4} (Size 3 > 1) -> Case B
      - Indices of first occurrence: [0, 4, 8] (corresponding to 8, 7, 4)
      - Median Index Value: 4 (from sorted indices [0, 4, 8], the median value is 4)
      - Output: Element at index 4 -> 7. Correct.
  - Example 3:
      - Input: [4, 3, 1, 3, 4]
      - Frequencies: {4:2, 3:2, 1:1}
      - Set S: {1} (Size 1) -> Case A
      - Output: 1. Correct.
