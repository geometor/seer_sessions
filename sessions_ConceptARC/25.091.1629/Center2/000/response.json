            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The input is a one-dimensional list (or array) of integers, where each integer represents a color according to the ARC standard mapping. The length of the list varies between examples.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is always a single integer (color).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to determine which single color from the input list should be selected as the output based on some criteria related to the numbers present in the list.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]`. Output `2`.\n    *   All numbers in the input list appear exactly once.\n    *   The numbers are `3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9`. Their indices are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.\n    *   The median index is `3`. The number at index `3` is `2`.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]`. Output `7`.\n    *   Frequencies: `8:1, 3:6, 7:1, 4:1`.\n    *   Numbers appearing exactly once: `8, 7, 4`.\n    *   Their first indices are `0, 4, 8`.\n    *   The median index among `[0, 4, 8]` is `4`. The number at index `4` is `7`.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[4, 3, 1, 3, 4]`. Output `1`.\n    *   Frequencies: `4:2, 3:2, 1:1`.\n    *   Number appearing exactly once: `1`.\n    *   Since only one number appears exactly once, that number (`1`) is the output.\n\n**Hypothesized Rule:**\n\nThe transformation identifies numbers within the input list that appear exactly once.\n*   If exactly one number appears once, that number is the output.\n*   If multiple numbers appear exactly once (or if all numbers appear exactly once, as in Example 1), the output is determined by the median position (index) of these single-occurrence numbers in the original list. Specifically, find the first index of each number that appears exactly once, find the median of these indices, and the output is the number located at that median index in the original input list.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"

List length varies.\n\nOutput:\n  - Type: Single integer (color)\n\nCore_Logic:\n  - Step_1: Count the frequency of each distinct color in the input list.\n  - Step_2: Identify the set of colors that appear exactly once. Let this set be S.\n  - Step_3: Determine the output based on the size of S:\n      - Case_A (Size of S == 1): The single color in S is the output.\n      - Case_B (Size of S > 1): \n          - Find the first index (position) of each color from S in the original input list.\n          - Identify the median index from this list of indices. (For an even number of indices, use the lower middle index, corresponding to floor((n-1)/2)).\n          - The color in the original input list located at this median index is the output.\n      - Case_C (Size of S == 0): (Not observed in examples, but logically possible). If no color appears exactly once, the rule is undefined by the examples. Assume this case won't occur or needs clarification.\n\nExamples_Analysis:\n  - Example 1:\n      - Input: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]\n      - Frequencies: All 1.\n      - Set S: {3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9} (Size 7 > 1) -> Case B\n      - Indices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n      - Median Index: floor((7-1)/2) = 3.\n      - Output: Element at index 3 -> 2.

Correct.\n  - Example 3:\n      - Input: [4, 3, 1, 3, 4]\n      - Frequencies: {4:2, 3:2, 1:1}\n      - Set S: {1} (Size 1) -> Case A\n      - Output: 1. Correct.\n```"
