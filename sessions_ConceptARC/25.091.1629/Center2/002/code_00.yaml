Task: Select a specific color from a grid based on frequency and position within the flattened grid.

Input:
  - Type: 2D NumPy array (grid) of integers (colors)
  - Constraints: Values 0-9. Grid dimensions vary. Examples show grids with 1 row.

Output:
  - Type: Single integer (color)

Core_Logic:
  - Step_1: Flatten the input 2D grid into a 1D list (preserving row-major order).
  - Step_2: Count the frequency of each distinct color in the flattened list.
  - Step_3: Identify the set of colors that appear exactly once in the flattened list. Let this set be S.
  - Step_4: Determine the output based on the size of S:
      - Case_A (Size of S == 1): The single color in S is the output.
      - Case_B (Size of S > 1):
          - Find the first index (position) of each color from S in the flattened list.
          - Collect these indices into a list.
          - Sort the list of indices in ascending order.
          - Identify the median index from this sorted list. For an even number n of indices, use the index at position floor((n-1)/2) in the sorted list (the lower median index). Let this be the `target_index_value`.
          - The color located at the `target_index_value` in the original flattened list is the output.
      - Case_C (Size of S == 0): (Not observed) The rule is undefined by the examples. Assume this won't occur based on provided data.

Examples_Analysis:
  - Example 1:
      - Input Grid: [[3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]]
      - Flattened: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]
      - Frequencies: All 1.
      - Set S: {3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9} (Size 7 > 1) -> Case B
      - First Indices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      - Sorted Indices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      - Median Index Value (at pos floor((7-1)/2)=3): 3.
      - Output: Element at index 3 in flattened list -> 2. Correct.
  - Example 2:
      - Input Grid: [[8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]]
      - Flattened: [8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]
      - Frequencies: {8:1, 3:6, 7:1, 4:1}
      - Set S: {8, 7, 4} (Size 3 > 1) -> Case B
      - First Indices: [0, 4, 8] (corresponding to 8, 7, 4)
      - Sorted Indices: [0, 4, 8]
      - Median Index Value (at pos floor((3-1)/2)=1): 4.
      - Output: Element at index 4 in flattened list -> 7. Correct.
  - Example 3:
      - Input Grid: [[4, 3, 1, 3, 4]]
      - Flattened: [4, 3, 1, 3, 4]
      - Frequencies: {4:2, 3:2, 1:1}
      - Set S: {1} (Size 1) -> Case A
      - Output: 1. Correct.
