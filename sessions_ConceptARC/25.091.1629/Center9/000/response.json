            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of varying sizes (6x6, 9x9, 8x8).\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color is white (0), acting as the background.\n3.  **Static Lines:** Each input grid contains two parallel lines (either horizontal or vertical) made of a single color. These lines remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   Train 1: Vertical magenta (6) lines.\n    *   Train 2: Horizontal green (3) lines.\n    *   Train 3: Horizontal azure (8) lines.\n    *   Train 4: Vertical yellow (4) lines.\n4.  **Moving Pixel:** Each input grid contains a single, isolated pixel of a distinct color (different from the background and the lines). This pixel changes its position in the output grid.\n    *   Train 1: Azure (8) pixel.\n    *   Train 2: Orange (7) pixel.\n    *   Train 3: Yellow (4) pixel.\n    *   Train 4: Magenta (6) pixel.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the isolated pixel. The static lines appear to define boundaries or influence the movement. The background and the lines themselves are preserved. The movement direction (horizontal/vertical) is perpendicular to the orientation of the lines. The distance moved seems dependent on the relative distance of the pixel to the two lines.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, `distance_moved = abs(distance_to_far_line - distance_to_closer_line) / 2`.\n  - Constraint: The input always contains exactly two parallel lines and one distinct mover pixel.\n\n```"

Locate all non-background pixels and group them into distinct objects (contiguous areas of the same color).\n4.  Identify the three key objects: two parallel lines (object 1 and object 2) and a single pixel (the \"mover\"). Determine the color and position(s) of each.\n5.  Determine the orientation of the lines (horizontal or vertical) and find their respective row or column indices (L1 and L2, where L1 < L2).\n6.  Get the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) and color (`mover_color`) of the mover pixel.\n7.  Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n8.  Set the original position (`r`, `c`) of the mover pixel in the output grid to the background color.\n9.  **Calculate the new position:**\n    *   **If the lines are horizontal** (at rows L1 and L2):\n        *   Calculate the distance to the closer line (`d_close = min(abs(r - L1), abs(r - L2))`).\n        *   Calculate the distance to the farther line (`d_far = max(abs(r - L1), abs(r - L2))`).\n        *   Calculate the movement distance: `d_move = (d_far - d_close) / 2`.\n        *   Determine the movement direction: If the pixel is closer to L1 (`abs(r - L1) < abs(r - L2)`), move away from L1 (increase row index). If closer to L2 (`abs(r - L2) < abs(r - L1)`), move away from L2 (decrease row index). If equidistant, do not move (`d_move = 0`).\n        *   Calculate the new row: `new_r = r + d_move` if moving away from L1, or `new_r = r - d_move` if moving away from L2. The column `new_c` remains `c`.\n    *   **If the lines are vertical** (at columns L1 and L2):\n        *   Calculate the distance to the closer line (`d_close = min(abs(c - L1), abs(c - L2))`).\n        *   Calculate the distance to the farther line (`d_far = max(abs(c - L1), abs(c - L2))`).\n        *   Calculate the movement distance: `d_move = (d_far - d_close) / 2`.\n        *   Determine the movement direction: If the pixel is closer to L1 (`abs(c - L1) < abs(c - L2)`), move away from L1 (increase column index). If closer to L2 (`abs(c - L2) < abs(c - L1)`), move away from L2 (decrease column index). If equidistant, do not move (`d_move = 0`).\n        *   Calculate the new column: `new_c = c + d_move` if moving away from L1, or `new_c = c - d_move` if moving away from L2. The row `new_r` remains `r`.\n10. Set the calculated new position (`new_r`, `new_c`) in the output grid to the `mover_color`.\n11. Return the modified output grid."
