Task: Move a single pixel based on proximity to parallel lines.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Objects:
    - Background: Pixels with value 0 (white).
    - Lines: Two parallel lines (horizontal or vertical) of a uniform color.
    - Mover_Pixel: One single pixel of a distinct color, not part of the lines or background.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input.
  - Background: Identical to the input background.
  - Lines: Identical position and color as the input lines.
  - Mover_Pixel:
    - Color: Same color as the input mover pixel.
    - Position: Changed from the input position.

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Relationship: The mover pixel is located between the two parallel lines.
  - Relationship: The orientation of the lines determines the axis of movement for the mover pixel (vertical lines -> horizontal movement, horizontal lines -> vertical movement).
  - Action: The mover pixel is moved away from the closer line and towards the farther line.
  - Property: The distance moved is calculated based on the difference in distances between the pixel and the two lines. Specifically, `distance_moved = abs(distance_to_far_line - distance_to_closer_line) / 2`.
  - Constraint: The input always contains exactly two parallel lines and one distinct mover pixel.
