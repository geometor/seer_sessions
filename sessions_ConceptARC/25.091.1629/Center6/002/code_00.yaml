objects:
  - type: container
    description: The largest non-white object, identified by finding contiguous pixels of the same color using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals). Can be solid or hollow. Defines a region.
    examples:
      - train_1: Red (2) diamond shape (pixels are only diagonally adjacent).
      - train_2: Green (3) rectangular frame.
      - train_3: Yellow (4) solid rectangle.
  - type: content
    description: The smaller non-white object, also identified using 8-directional connectivity (usually a single pixel in these examples). Located outside the container in the input.
    examples:
      - train_1: Single yellow (4) pixel.
      - train_2: Single orange (7) pixel.
      - train_3: Single azure (8) pixel.
  - type: background
    description: The default grid color, white (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The content object is initially outside the container object's main area or bounding box.
  - type: connectivity
    description: Objects are defined by contiguous pixels of the same color, considering pixels connected horizontally, vertically, and diagonally (8-directional) as part of the same object.
  - type: relative_size
    description: The container object has more pixels than the content object.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects_8_connectivity
    description: Find all distinct groups of contiguous, non-background pixels using 8-directional connectivity.
  - action: classify_objects
    description: Identify the largest object (by pixel count) as the 'container' and the other non-background object as the 'content'. Store the content's color and original coordinates.
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the container object.
  - action: find_bounding_box_center
    description: Calculate the geometric center coordinates (row, column) of the container object's bounding box using floor division: `center_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2)`, `center_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)`.
  - action: erase_original_content
    description: Change the pixel(s) at the original coordinate(s) of the content object to the background color (white/0).
  - action: place_content_at_center
    description: Change the pixel at the calculated center coordinates of the container's bounding box to the stored color of the content object.

properties:
  - property: color
    description: Pixels have colors (0-9). Colors distinguish objects. The content object's color is preserved.
  - property: location
    description: Pixels have (row, column) coordinates. The location of the content object changes.
  - property: coordinates
    description: Each object comprises a set of pixel coordinates.
  - property: bounding_box
    description: The minimum rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object. Used to find the center of the container.
  - property: size
    description: The number of pixels belonging to an object. Used to differentiate container and content.
