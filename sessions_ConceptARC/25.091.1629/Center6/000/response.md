## Perception

The task involves identifying two primary objects in the input grid based on color: a larger "container" object and a smaller, often single-pixel, "content" object. The container object can be hollow (like the diamond in example 1 or the rectangle frame in example 2) or solid (like the rectangle in example 3). The content object is always located outside the main structure of the container object in the input. The transformation consists of moving the content object to the geometric center of the container object. The original location of the content object is then replaced with the background color (white/0). The container object itself remains unchanged. The color of the content object is preserved during the move.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - type: container
    description: The largest contiguous or structured group of non-white pixels. Can be solid or hollow. Defines a region.
    examples:
      - train_1: Red (2) diamond shape.
      - train_2: Green (3) rectangular frame.
      - train_3: Yellow (4) solid rectangle.
  - type: content
    description: A smaller, often single-pixel, non-white object distinct from the container. Located outside the container in the input.
    examples:
      - train_1: Single yellow (4) pixel.
      - train_2: Single orange (7) pixel.
      - train_3: Single azure (8) pixel.
  - type: background
    description: The default grid color, white (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The content object is initially outside the container object's main area or bounding box.
  - type: containment (implied in output)
    description: The content object is moved to be inside the container object's central region in the output.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Distinguish the container object, the content object(s), and the background based on color and size/structure. The container is typically the largest object.
  - action: find_center
    description: Calculate the geometric center coordinates (row, column) of the container object. This might be the center of its bounding box.
  - action: erase_original_content
    description: Change the pixel(s) at the original location of the content object to the background color (white/0).
  - action: place_content_at_center
    description: Change the pixel at the calculated center coordinates of the container object to the color of the content object.

properties:
  - property: color
    description: Pixels have colors (0-9). Colors distinguish objects. The content object's color is preserved.
  - property: location
    description: Pixels have (row, column) coordinates. The location of the content object changes.
  - property: shape/structure
    description: Objects have shapes (diamond, rectangle, etc.). The container's shape determines the center point.
  - property: size
    description: Objects have sizes (pixel count or bounding box). Size helps differentiate the container from the content.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify** all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
2.  **Determine** which object is the "container" (typically the largest object by pixel count or bounding box area) and which is the "content" (the other non-white object, often a single pixel). Store the color and original location(s) of the content object.
3.  **Calculate** the coordinates (row, column) of the geometric center of the container object. This can be approximated by finding the center of the container's bounding box: `center_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2)`, `center_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)`.
4.  **Create** a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  **Modify** the output grid:
    a.  Change the pixel(s) at the original location of the content object to the background color (white/0).
    b.  Change the pixel at the calculated center coordinates to the stored color of the content object.
6.  **Return** the modified grid as the output.
