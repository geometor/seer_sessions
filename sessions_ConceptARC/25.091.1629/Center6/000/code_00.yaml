objects:
  - type: container
    description: The largest contiguous or structured group of non-white pixels. Can be solid or hollow. Defines a region.
    examples:
      - train_1: Red (2) diamond shape.
      - train_2: Green (3) rectangular frame.
      - train_3: Yellow (4) solid rectangle.
  - type: content
    description: A smaller, often single-pixel, non-white object distinct from the container. Located outside the container in the input.
    examples:
      - train_1: Single yellow (4) pixel.
      - train_2: Single orange (7) pixel.
      - train_3: Single azure (8) pixel.
  - type: background
    description: The default grid color, white (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The content object is initially outside the container object's main area or bounding box.
  - type: containment (implied in output)
    description: The content object is moved to be inside the container object's central region in the output.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Distinguish the container object, the content object(s), and the background based on color and size/structure. The container is typically the largest object.
  - action: find_center
    description: Calculate the geometric center coordinates (row, column) of the container object. This might be the center of its bounding box.
  - action: erase_original_content
    description: Change the pixel(s) at the original location of the content object to the background color (white/0).
  - action: place_content_at_center
    description: Change the pixel at the calculated center coordinates of the container object to the color of the content object.

properties:
  - property: color
    description: Pixels have colors (0-9). Colors distinguish objects. The content object's color is preserved.
  - property: location
    description: Pixels have (row, column) coordinates. The location of the content object changes.
  - property: shape/structure
    description: Objects have shapes (diamond, rectangle, etc.). The container's shape determines the center point.
  - property: size
    description: Objects have sizes (pixel count or bounding box). Size helps differentiate the container from the content.
