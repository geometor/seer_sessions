The container object can be hollow (like the diamond in example 1 or the rectangle frame in example 2) or solid (like the rectangle in example 3). The content object is always located outside the main structure of the container object in the input. The transformation consists of moving the content object to the geometric center of the container object. The original location of the content object is then replaced with the background color (white/0). The container object itself remains unchanged. The color of the content object is preserved during the move.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
