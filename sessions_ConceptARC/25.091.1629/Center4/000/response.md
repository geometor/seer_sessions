*   **Perception:** The task involves processing grids containing pixels of different colors. In each example, the input grid is modified to produce the output grid. The modification involves changing certain colored pixels to the background color (white, 0). Specifically, it appears that one specific color present in the input is entirely removed (replaced by white) in the output. The selection of which color to remove seems related to the grid's structure, particularly its center.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    background_color: white (0)
    elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - height
          - width
          - pixels (cells with colors)
      - element: center_pixel
        properties:
          - location: (floor(height/2), floor(width/2))
          - color: the color value at the center location
      - element: target_color_pixels
        properties:
          - color: same as the center_pixel's color (if not white)
          - location: all locations in the grid with this color
    actions:
      - action: identify_center_pixel
        inputs: input_grid
        outputs: center_pixel_location, center_pixel_color
      - action: conditional_replacement
        condition: center_pixel_color is not white (0)
        inputs: input_grid, center_pixel_color
        outputs: output_grid
        description: Replace all pixels in the input_grid that have the center_pixel_color with the background_color (white, 0).
      - action: copy_grid
        condition: center_pixel_color is white (0)
        inputs: input_grid
        outputs: output_grid
        description: The output_grid is an identical copy of the input_grid.
    relationships:
      - The color targeted for removal is determined solely by the color of the pixel at the exact center of the input grid.
      - All pixels matching the target color are changed, regardless of their position.
      - If the center pixel is the background color, no changes are made.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
    2.  Calculate the coordinates of the center pixel using integer division: `center_row = height // 2`, `center_col = width // 2`.
    3.  Identify the color (`target_color`) of the pixel located at (`center_row`, `center_col`) in the input grid.
    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
    5.  If the `target_color` is not white (0):
        *   Iterate through every pixel in the copied grid.
        *   If a pixel's color matches the `target_color`, change its color to white (0).
    6.  If the `target_color` is white (0), make no changes to the copied grid.
    7.  The final modified grid is the output.
