The modification involves changing certain colored pixels to the background color (white, 0). Specifically, it appears that one specific color present in the input is entirely removed (replaced by white) in the output. The selection of which color to remove seems related to the grid's structure, particularly its center.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
