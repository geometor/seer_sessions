            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples operate on grids containing a background color (white, 0) and distinct colored objects.\n2.  **Input Objects:** The inputs feature two main types of objects relevant to the transformation:\n    *   A horizontal line segment of a uniform color (green in train_1, yellow in train_2).\n    *   A single pixel of a different color located directly above the *start* of the horizontal line (red in train_1, azure in train_2).\n3.  **Output Objects:** The outputs retain the original horizontal line, but modify it and add pixels. A new vertical line segment, 3 pixels high, appears.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve using the single pixel's color and the horizontal line's position to create the new vertical line.\n5.  **Positional Relationship:**\n    *   The vertical line in the output is centered horizontally at the midpoint of the input horizontal line.\n    *   The vertical line in the output is centered vertically on the row containing the horizontal line.\n    *   The color of the new vertical line matches the color of the single pixel found above the start of the horizontal line in the input.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The new vertical line overwrites any pixels previously at its location, including the pixel at the midpoint of the original horizontal line.\n7.  **Multiple Instances:** Example train_2 shows that this transformation applies independently to multiple occurrences of the pattern within the same grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the input grid to identify the start of any potential horizontal line segments (a non-white pixel preceded by a white pixel or grid edge).\n3.  For each potential start found at `(row, start_col)` with color `line_color`:\n    a.  Determine the end column `end_col` of this contiguous horizontal line segment of `line_color`.\n    b.  Check the pixel at `(row - 1, start_col)`. If this pixel exists (i.e., `row > 0`) and is not white (color 0), record its color as `marker_color`.\n    c.  If a valid `marker_color` was found:\n        i.  Calculate the midpoint column index: `mid_col = floor((start_col + end_col) / 2)`.\n        ii. Modify the output grid:\n            *   Set the pixel at `(row - 1, mid_col)` to `marker_color`.\n            *   Set the pixel at `(row, mid_col)` to `marker_color`.\n            *   Set the pixel at `(row + 1, mid_col)` to `marker_color` (ensure `row + 1` is within grid bounds).\n4.
