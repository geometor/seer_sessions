```python
"""
Identifies horizontal line segments in the input grid. For each horizontal line, it checks if there is a non-white 'marker' pixel directly above the starting pixel of the line. If a marker pixel exists, a 3-pixel high vertical line is drawn in the output grid. This vertical line uses the color of the marker pixel and is centered horizontally at the midpoint of the original horizontal line, and vertically centered on the row of the original horizontal line. All other pixels from the input are preserved unless overwritten by the new vertical line.
