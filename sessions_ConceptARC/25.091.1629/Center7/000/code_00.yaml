task_description: Generate a single row output grid based on the input grid's properties.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - shape: Square (NxN)
      - content: Contains a single contiguous object (a right triangle) of a non-white color against a white background.
      - color: The specific non-white color varies (blue, red, yellow in examples).
      - dimension: The side length (N) of the square grid varies (5x5, 5x5, 9x9 in examples).
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - shape: Single row (1xM)
      - content: Filled entirely with a single color.
      - color: Same as the non-white color found in the input grid.
      - dimension: The length (M) is determined by the input grid's dimension (N).
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule:
      - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input_grid.
      - Determine the dimension (N) of the input_grid (it's an NxN grid).
      - Calculate the length (M) of the output row using the formula: M = (N + 1) // 2 (integer division).
      - Construct the output_grid as a 1xM grid filled entirely with the color C.
