The size and color of the triangle vary across examples. The output grid is always a single row (1xM) filled entirely with the same non-white color found in the input triangle. The length (M) of the output row appears to be derived from the dimension (N) of the input grid. Specifically, the length M seems to be calculated as `(N + 1) // 2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n"
