**Perception:**
The input grids are square (NxN) and contain a single large object, a right triangle, composed of a single non-white color against a white background. The size and color of the triangle vary across examples. The output grid is always a single row (1xM) filled entirely with the same non-white color found in the input triangle. The length (M) of the output row appears to be derived from the dimension (N) of the input grid. Specifically, the length M seems to be calculated as `(N + 1) // 2`.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_description: Generate a single row output grid based on the input grid's properties.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - shape: Square (NxN)
      - content: Contains a single contiguous object (a right triangle) of a non-white color against a white background.
      - color: The specific non-white color varies (blue, red, yellow in examples).
      - dimension: The side length (N) of the square grid varies (5x5, 5x5, 9x9 in examples).
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - shape: Single row (1xM)
      - content: Filled entirely with a single color.
      - color: Same as the non-white color found in the input grid.
      - dimension: The length (M) is determined by the input grid's dimension (N).
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule:
      - Identify the non-white color (C) present in the input_grid.
      - Determine the dimension (N) of the input_grid (it's an NxN grid).
      - Calculate the length (M) of the output row using the formula: M = (N + 1) // 2 (integer division).
      - Construct the output_grid as a 1xM grid filled entirely with the color C.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimension (N) of the square input grid (i.e., its height or width).
3.  Calculate the required width (M) for the output grid by taking the input grid dimension (N), adding 1, and then performing integer division by 2 (M = (N + 1) // 2).
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 1 row and M columns.
5.  Fill this output grid entirely with the non-white color identified in step 1.
