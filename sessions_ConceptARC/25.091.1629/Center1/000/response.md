**Perception:**
The task involves identifying enclosed empty spaces (regions of white pixels) within colored shapes in a grid. The transformation focuses on modifying the center pixel of these enclosed spaces based on their size.

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and one or more contiguous shapes made of a single non-white color (e.g., green (3) or yellow (4)).
2.  **Enclosed Regions:** Some of these colored shapes fully enclose regions of white pixels.
3.  **Targeted Regions:** The transformation specifically targets enclosed white regions whose dimensions (height and width) are both greater than 1 pixel. Enclosed regions that are only 1x1 are ignored.
4.  **Central Modification:** For the targeted enclosed regions (larger than 1x1), the single pixel located at the geometric center of the region is identified.
5.  **Color Change:** The color of this central pixel is changed from white (0) to the color of the shape that encloses the region.
6.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**Example 1 Walkthrough:**
-   Input has a 5x5 green frame enclosing a 3x3 white region.
-   The enclosed white region (3x3) has dimensions greater than 1x1.
-   The center of this 3x3 region is at row 3, column 3 (0-indexed).
-   The output changes the pixel at (3, 3) from white (0) to green (3).

**Example 2 Walkthrough:**
-   Input has two yellow shapes.
    -   Shape 1 (3x3 frame) encloses a 1x1 white region at (2, 2). Since the dimensions are not both > 1, this region is ignored.
    -   Shape 2 (L-shape) encloses a 3x3 white region from (4, 6) to (6, 8). The dimensions (3x3) are greater than 1x1.
-   The center of the 3x3 region is at row 5, column 7 (calculated as top_row + floor((bottom_row - top_row)/2), etc. which is 4 + floor((6-4)/2) = 5 and 6 + floor((8-6)/2) = 7). *Correction: The hollow space is rows 4-6, cols 6-8. Center row = 4 + floor(2/2) = 5. Center col = 6 + floor(2/2) = 7. Wait, looking at the output, the changed pixel is at (4,7). Let's re-examine the hollow space in input 2. The L-shape is `40004`, `40004`, `44444`. The white space is `000` at row 3, `0 0` at row 4, `000` at row 5. No, that's not right. Input 2: `404`, `444`, `000`. The shape is `444` (row 1), `404` (row 2), `444` (row 3). Okay, Shape 1 encloses (2,2) - ignored. Shape 2: `44444` (row 2, col 5-9), `40004` (row 3), `40004` (row 4), `40004` (row 5), `44444` (row 6). The enclosed white region is 3x3, from (3,6) to (5,8). Center row = 3 + floor((5-3)/2) = 3 + 1 = 4. Center col = 6 + floor((8-6)/2) = 6 + 1 = 7. The center is at (4, 7).*
-   The output changes the pixel at (4, 7) from white (0) to yellow (4).

The initial center calculation needs refinement based on grid indexing and how center is defined for even/odd dimensions. The core logic of finding enclosed spaces > 1x1 and filling their center seems correct. Let's assume standard geometric center calculation (rounding down if necessary).


```yaml
facts:
  - setup:
      - The grid contains a background color (white, 0) and one or more objects.
      - Objects are contiguous areas of a single non-white color.
  - objects:
      - type: colored_shape
        properties:
          - color: non-white integer (1-9)
          - pixels: list of coordinates forming the shape
      - type: enclosed_region
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - pixels: list of coordinates forming the region
          - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
          - dimensions: [height, width] calculated from bounding_box
          - center_pixel: coordinate [row, col]
        relationships:
          - is_completely_surrounded_by: colored_shape
  - actions:
      - find_objects: Identify all contiguous colored_shapes.
      - find_enclosed_regions: For each colored_shape, identify any fully enclosed_regions of white pixels.
      - filter_regions_by_size: Select only enclosed_regions where both height and width > 1.
      - calculate_center: For each selected region, determine the coordinates of its center pixel. (e.g., center_row = min_row + floor((max_row - min_row) / 2))
      - modify_pixel: Change the color of the center_pixel from white (0) to the color of the surrounding colored_shape.
  - output:
      - The grid is modified by changing the color of the center pixels of specific enclosed_regions.
      - All other pixels remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
3.  For each white region found:
    a.  Check if it is completely enclosed by pixels of a single non-white color (let this color be `C`). To check for enclosure, verify that all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of every pixel bordering the *outside* of the white region's bounding box belong to the same non-white shape `C` or are outside the grid boundaries. More robustly: perform a flood fill starting from a white pixel; if the fill encounters the grid boundary, it's not enclosed. If the fill stops and all boundary pixels encountered belong to a single non-white color `C`, it is enclosed by color `C`.
    b.  If the region is enclosed by color `C`:
        i.  Determine the bounding box of the enclosed white region (minimum and maximum row and column).
        ii. Calculate the height and width of the bounding box.
        iii. If both height > 1 AND width > 1:
            1.  Calculate the center coordinates (center_row, center_col) of the bounding box using: `center_row = min_row + floor((max_row - min_row) / 2)`, `center_col = min_col + floor((max_col - min_col) / 2)`.
            2.  Update the output grid by setting the pixel at (center_row, center_col) to color `C`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
