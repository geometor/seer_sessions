            "text": "**Perception:**\nThe task involves identifying enclosed empty spaces (regions of white pixels) within colored shapes in a grid. The transformation focuses on modifying the center pixel of these enclosed spaces based on their size.\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and one or more contiguous shapes made of a single non-white color (e.g., green (3) or yellow (4)).\n2.  **Enclosed Regions:** Some of these colored shapes fully enclose regions of white pixels.\n3.  **Targeted Regions:** The transformation specifically targets enclosed white regions whose dimensions (height and width) are both greater than 1 pixel. Enclosed regions that are only 1x1 are ignored.\n4.  **Central Modification:** For the targeted enclosed regions (larger than 1x1), the single pixel located at the geometric center of the region is identified.\n5.  **Color Change:** The color of this central pixel is changed from white (0) to the color of the shape that encloses the region.\n6.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n-   Input has a 5x5 green frame enclosing a 3x3 white region.\n-   The enclosed white region (3x3) has dimensions greater than 1x1.\n-   The center of this 3x3 region is at row 3, column 3 (0-indexed).\n-   The output changes the pixel at (3, 3) from white (0) to green (3).\n\n**Example 2 Walkthrough:**\n-   Input has two yellow shapes.\n    -   Shape 1 (3x3 frame) encloses a 1x1 white region at (2, 2). Since the dimensions are not both > 1, this region is ignored.\n    -   Shape 2 (L-shape) encloses a 3x3 white region from (4, 6) to (6, 8). The dimensions (3x3) are greater than 1x1.\n-   The center of the 3x3 region is at row 5, column 7 (calculated as top_row + floor((bottom_row - top_row)/2), etc. which is 4 + floor((6-4)/2) = 5 and 6 + floor((8-6)/2) = 7). *Correction: The hollow space is rows 4-6, cols 6-8. Center row = 4 + floor(2/2) = 5. Center col = 6 + floor(2/2) = 7. Wait, looking at the output, the changed pixel is at (4,7). Let's re-examine the hollow space in input 2. The L-shape is `40004`, `40004`, `44444`. The white space is `000` at row 3, `0 0` at row 4, `000` at row 5. No, that's not right. Input 2: `404`, `444`, `000`. The shape is `444` (row 1), `404` (row 2), `444` (row 3). Okay, Shape 1 encloses (2,2) - ignored. Shape 2: `44444` (row 2, col 5-9), `40004` (row 3), `40004` (row 4), `40004` (row 5), `44444` (row 6). The enclosed white region is 3x3, from (3,6) to (5,8). Center row = 3 + floor((5-3)/2) = 3 + 1 = 4. Center col = 6 + floor((8-6)/2) = 6 + 1 = 7. The center is at (4, 7).*\n-   The output changes the pixel at (4, 7) from white (0) to yellow (4).\n\nThe initial center calculation needs refinement based on grid indexing and how center is defined for even/odd dimensions. The core logic of finding enclosed spaces > 1x1 and filling their center seems correct. Let's assume standard geometric center calculation (rounding down if necessary).\n\n"
