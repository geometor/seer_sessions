facts:
  - setup:
      - The grid contains a background color (white, 0) and one or more objects.
      - Objects are contiguous areas of a single non-white color.
  - objects:
      - type: colored_shape
        properties:
          - color: non-white integer (1-9)
          - pixels: list of coordinates forming the shape
      - type: enclosed_region
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
          - pixels: list of coordinates forming the region
          - bounding_box: [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
          - dimensions: [height, width] calculated from bounding_box
          - center_pixel: coordinate [row, col]
        relationships:
          - is_completely_surrounded_by: colored_shape
  - actions:
      - find_objects: Identify all contiguous colored_shapes.
      - find_enclosed_regions: For each colored_shape, identify any fully enclosed_regions of white pixels.
      - filter_regions_by_size: Select only enclosed_regions where both height and width > 1.
      - calculate_center: For each selected region, determine the coordinates of its center pixel. (e.g., center_row = min_row + floor((max_row - min_row) / 2))
      - modify_pixel: Change the color of the center_pixel from white (0) to the color of the surrounding colored_shape.
  - output:
      - The grid is modified by changing the color of the center pixels of specific enclosed_regions.
      - All other pixels remain unchanged.
