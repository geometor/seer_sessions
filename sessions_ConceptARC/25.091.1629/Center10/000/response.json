            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input and output is a grid of pixels with values 0 (white) and 5 (gray). The output grid introduces a single pixel with value 1 (blue).\n2.  **Background:** The predominant color is white (0), serving as the background.\n3.  **Objects:** Gray pixels (5) form distinct objects within the grid. In all examples, there appear to be exactly two separate gray objects, often resembling 'L' shapes or small clusters.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the change of a single white (0) pixel to a blue (1) pixel. The gray pixels remain unchanged in position and color.\n5.  **Location of Change:** The blue pixel consistently appears in a location that is roughly central to the overall distribution of the gray pixels. It occupies a position that was originally white (0) in the input. It seems to be located \"between\" the two gray objects.\n6.  **Calculating the Location:** By finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by any gray pixel, we can define a bounding box for the gray content. The coordinates of the blue pixel in the output correspond to the floor of the average row and column indices of this bounding box (i.e., the center coordinates of the bounding box, rounded down).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
