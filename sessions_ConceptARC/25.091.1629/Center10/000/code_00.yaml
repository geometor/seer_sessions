task_description: Identify the central point within the bounding box of all gray pixels and change its color to blue if it is currently white.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      objects_present: true
  - type: object
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      count: 2 (in all examples)
      shape: variable (often L-shaped clusters)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color_change: white (0) -> blue (1)
      location: center of the bounding box containing all gray pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    parameters:
      color: gray (5)
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing gray pixels.
    input: coordinates of gray pixels
    output: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
  - action: calculate_center
    description: Calculate the geometric center of the bounding box, rounding down coordinates.
    input: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
    formula: center_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2), center_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)
    output: center_coordinates (row, col)
  - action: check_pixel_color
    description: Verify if the pixel at the calculated center coordinates in the input grid is white.
    input: input_grid, center_coordinates
    condition: input_grid[center_row, center_col] == 0
  - action: change_pixel_color
    description: If the center pixel is white, change its color to blue in the output grid.
    input: input_grid, center_coordinates
    output_grid: copy of input_grid
    effect: output_grid[center_row, center_col] = 1
    condition: The check_pixel_color condition was met.

relationships:
  - relation: spatial
    description: The location of the blue pixel is determined by the overall spatial extent (bounding box) of the gray objects.
  - relation: state_change
    description: A single white pixel changes state to blue based on its position relative to the gray objects. The gray objects themselves remain unchanged.
