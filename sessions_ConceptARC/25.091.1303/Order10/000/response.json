These colored layers are surrounded by a white (color 0) background.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output is always a single row (1D array or 1xN grid) containing a sequence of colors.\n*   **Transformation:** The sequence of colors in the output corresponds to the colors of the nested layers in the input, ordered from the outermost layer (the one touching the white background) to the innermost layer. The white background itself is not included in the output.\n*   **Color Usage:** Colors 0 (white), 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure) are used across the examples. The specific colors change between examples, but the nesting structure and the extraction logic remain consistent.\n*   **Object Identification:** Each contiguous block of a single non-white color can be considered an \"object\" or a \"layer\". These layers are nested within each other.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the adjacency relationships between pixels of different colors. Specifically, find which colors are adjacent to the white (0) background and which colors are adjacent to each other.\n3.  Identify the outermost non-white color layer (`C_outer`) as the one whose pixels are adjacent to the white (0) background.\n4.  Initialize an empty sequence for the output colors. Add `C_outer` to this sequence.\n5.  Iteratively find the next inner layer:\n    a.  Let the last color added to the sequence be `CurrentColor`.\n    b.  Find the unique non-white color (`C_next`) whose pixels are adjacent to pixels of `CurrentColor`, and which has not already been added to the sequence.\n    c.  Add `C_next` to the sequence.\n    d.  Repeat this step until no more new adjacent inner colors can be found (i.e., the innermost layer has been reached).\n6.  Construct a 1-row output grid containing the colors in the generated sequence."
