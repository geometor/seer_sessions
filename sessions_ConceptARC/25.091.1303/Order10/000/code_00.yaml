Input:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - contains_multiple_colors: true
    - has_background_color: true
      color: 0 (white)
    - features_nested_layers: true
      layer_colors: non-zero integers
      layer_shapes: roughly rectangular, solid fill
      nesting_order: concentric, from outside inwards

Output:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - is_1D_array: true (single row)
    - contains_sequence_of_colors: true

Transformation:
  action: extract_layer_colors
  input_selection: non-white layers in the input grid
  output_generation: sequence of layer colors ordered by nesting
  order: from outermost layer (adjacent to white background) to innermost layer
  relationships:
    - adjacency: determines which layer surrounds which other layer
    - containment: defines the nesting structure
