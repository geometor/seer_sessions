The blocks in each example have different sizes and colors. The blocks within a single input grid are aligned along the same vertical columns.\n*   **Output:** The output grids are single rows (1D arrays) containing a sequence of colors.\n*   **Transformation:** The colors in the output row correspond to the colors of the blocks in the input grid. The order of the colors in the output matches the top-to-bottom order of the colored blocks in the input. The shape, size, and exact position of the input blocks do not seem to influence the output, only their color and relative vertical order.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
