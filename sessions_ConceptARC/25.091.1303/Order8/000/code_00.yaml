  - item: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid containing a white background (0) and several distinct, contiguous blocks of non-white colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: colored_block
            description: Contiguous area of a single non-white color.
            properties:
              - color: Varies (e.g., magenta, yellow, green, red, maroon, orange)
              - shape: Rectangular (in examples, but potentially other contiguous shapes)
              - arrangement: Stacked vertically, occupying overlapping column ranges.
  - item: output_grid
    description: A 1D grid (single row) containing a sequence of colors.
    properties:
      - dimension: 1xN, where N is the number of colored blocks in the input.
      - content: Colors derived from the input grid's blocks.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: input_grid.objects.colored_block
    target: output_grid.content
    description: Each color value in the output grid corresponds to the color of one unique colored block from the input grid.
  - type: ordering
    basis: vertical_position (top-to-bottom)
    source: input_grid.objects.colored_block
    target: output_grid.content
    description: The sequence of colors in the output grid matches the top-to-bottom order of the corresponding colored blocks in the input grid. The block with the lowest starting row index appears first in the output.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: List of colored blocks with their colors and vertical positions (e.g., minimum row index).
  - action: sort_blocks
    input: List of colored blocks
    criteria: Top-most position (minimum row index).
    output: Sorted list of block colors.
  - action: construct_output
    input: Sorted list of block colors
    output: output_grid (1D row).
