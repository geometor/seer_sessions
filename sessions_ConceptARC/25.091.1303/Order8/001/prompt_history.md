Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception**

*   **Input:** The input grids contain multiple rectangular blocks of solid, non-white colors stacked vertically on a white background. The blocks in each example have different sizes and colors. The blocks within a single input grid are aligned along the same vertical columns.
*   **Output:** The output grids are single rows (1D arrays) containing a sequence of colors.
*   **Transformation:** The colors in the output row correspond to the colors of the blocks in the input grid. The order of the colors in the output matches the top-to-bottom order of the colored blocks in the input. The shape, size, and exact position of the input blocks do not seem to influence the output, only their color and relative vertical order.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid containing a white background (0) and several distinct, contiguous blocks of non-white colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: colored_block
            description: Contiguous area of a single non-white color.
            properties:
              - color: Varies (e.g., magenta, yellow, green, red, maroon, orange)
              - shape: Rectangular (in examples, but potentially other contiguous shapes)
              - arrangement: Stacked vertically, occupying overlapping column ranges.
  - item: output_grid
    description: A 1D grid (single row) containing a sequence of colors.
    properties:
      - dimension: 1xN, where N is the number of colored blocks in the input.
      - content: Colors derived from the input grid's blocks.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: input_grid.objects.colored_block
    target: output_grid.content
    description: Each color value in the output grid corresponds to the color of one unique colored block from the input grid.
  - type: ordering
    basis: vertical_position (top-to-bottom)
    source: input_grid.objects.colored_block
    target: output_grid.content
    description: The sequence of colors in the output grid matches the top-to-bottom order of the corresponding colored blocks in the input grid. The block with the lowest starting row index appears first in the output.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: List of colored blocks with their colors and vertical positions (e.g., minimum row index).
  - action: sort_blocks
    input: List of colored blocks
    criteria: Top-most position (minimum row index).
    output: Sorted list of block colors.
  - action: construct_output
    input: Sorted list of block colors
    output: output_grid (1D row).

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-white colors.
2.  For each identified block, record its color and its top-most row index.
3.  Create a list of the unique colors found, ensuring each distinct block's color is represented once.
4.  Sort this list of colors based on the top-most row index associated with the block of that color in the input grid, from lowest index (top) to highest index (bottom).
5.  Construct the output grid as a single row containing the sorted list of colors.
