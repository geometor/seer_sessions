Okay, let's break down the `train_1` example.

**Perception**

1.    **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (8x13) and share a white background (color 0).
2.  **Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct colored regions or "objects", arranged horizontally and separated by columns of white pixels.
3.  **Object Composition:** These objects are primarily rectangular or composed of stacked rectangles. Notably, some input objects contain more than one color. Specifically, gray (color 5) appears mixed with other colors (blue-1, red-2, yellow-4, green-3) within the objects.
    *   Object 1 (Columns 1-2): Gray (5) and Blue (1)
    *   Object 2 (Columns 4-5): Red (2) and Gray (5)
    *   Object 3 (Columns 7-8): Yellow (4) and Gray (5)
    *   Object 4 (Columns 10-11): Green (3) and Gray (5)
4.  **Transformation - Color:** In the output grid, the objects occupy the same column ranges, but their colors have changed. Gray is no longer present within the main objects. The other colors seem to have undergone a specific substitution:
    *   The object originally containing Blue (1) is now Yellow (4).
    *   The object originally containing Red (2) is still Red (2).
    *   The object originally containing Yellow (4) is now Green (3).
    *   The object originally containing Green (3) is now Blue (1).
    This suggests a mapping: 1 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 4 -> 3, 3 -> 1. The gray color (5) in the input seems to be disregarded when determining the output color.
5.  **Transformation - Shape:** The shapes of the objects have also changed. In the output, each object is a solid rectangle filled with a single color. The extent (bounding box) of this rectangle appears to be determined by the maximal vertical and horizontal extent of the non-white pixels of the corresponding object in the input grid within its column band.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 8x13
  - Background Color: White (0)

Output Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 8x13
  - Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Vertically oriented colored regions separated by white columns.
  - Count: 4 in both input and output.
  - Input Object Properties:
    - Can contain multiple colors (primary color + Gray-5).
    - Occupy specific column ranges (1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11).
    - Shape: Composed of adjacent non-white pixels within their column range.
  - Output Object Properties:
    - Contain a single color.
    - Occupy the same column ranges as corresponding input objects.
    - Shape: Solid rectangles defined by the bounding box of the corresponding input object's non-white pixels within its column range.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Object Identification: Objects are identified by finding contiguous blocks of columns containing non-white pixels, separated by all-white columns.
  - Color Transformation:
    - The primary non-gray color of each input object determines the color of the corresponding output object.
    - Mapping Rule: Blue(1) -> Yellow(4), Red(2) -> Red(2), Green(3) -> Blue(1), Yellow(4) -> Green(3).
    - Gray(5) is ignored for color determination.
  - Shape Transformation:
    - The bounding box of the non-white pixels for each input object (within its column band) is calculated.
    - The corresponding area in the output grid is filled entirely with the transformed color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid to be the same size as the input grid and filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid column by column to identify vertical "bands" containing non-white pixels. These bands are separated by columns consisting entirely of white pixels.
3.  For each identified band:
    a.  Determine the column range (start and end column index) of the band.
    b.  Find all non-white pixels within this column range in the input grid.
    c.  Calculate the bounding box of these non-white pixels (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column within the band, maximum column within the band).
    d.  Identify the unique colors present among these non-white pixels.
    e.  Filter out the gray color (5) from the set of unique colors.
    f.  Assume the remaining set contains exactly one color (the primary `input_color`).
    g.  Apply the following color mapping rule to determine the `output_color`:
        *   If `input_color` is Blue (1), set `output_color` to Yellow (4).
        *   If `input_color` is Red (2), set `output_color` to Red (2).
        *   If `input_color` is Green (3), set `output_color` to Blue (1).
        *   If `input_color` is Yellow (4), set `output_color` to Green (3).
    h.  Fill the rectangular area in the output grid defined by the bounding box calculated in step 3c with the `output_color`.
