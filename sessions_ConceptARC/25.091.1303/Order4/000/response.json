            "text": "Okay, let's break down the `train_1` example.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.    **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (8x13) and share a white background (color 0).\n2.  **Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct colored regions or \"objects\", arranged horizontally and separated by columns of white pixels.\n3.  **Object Composition:** These objects are primarily rectangular or composed of stacked rectangles. Notably, some input objects contain more than one color. Specifically, gray (color 5) appears mixed with other colors (blue-1, red-2, yellow-4, green-3) within the objects.\n    *   Object 1 (Columns 1-2): Gray (5) and Blue (1)\n    *   Object 2 (Columns 4-5): Red (2) and Gray (5)\n    *   Object 3 (Columns 7-8): Yellow (4) and Gray (5)\n    *   Object 4 (Columns 10-11): Green (3) and Gray (5)\n4.  **Transformation - Color:** In the output grid, the objects occupy the same column ranges, but their colors have changed. Gray is no longer present within the main objects. The other colors seem to have undergone a specific substitution:\n    *   The object originally containing Blue (1) is now Yellow (4).\n    *   The object originally containing Red (2) is still Red (2).\n    *   The object originally containing Yellow (4) is now Green (3).\n    *   The object originally containing Green (3) is now Blue (1).\n    This suggests a mapping: 1 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 4 -> 3, 3 -> 1. The gray color (5) in the input seems to be disregarded when determining the output color.\n5.  **Transformation - Shape:** The shapes of the objects have also changed. In the output, each object is a solid rectangle filled with a single color. The extent (bounding box) of this rectangle appears to be determined by the maximal vertical and horizontal extent of the non-white pixels of the corresponding object in the input grid within its column band.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
