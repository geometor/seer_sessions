Input Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 8x13
  - Background Color: White (0)

Output Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 8x13
  - Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Vertically oriented colored regions separated by white columns.
  - Count: 4 in both input and output.
  - Input Object Properties:
    - Can contain multiple colors (primary color + Gray-5).
    - Occupy specific column ranges (1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11).
    - Shape: Composed of adjacent non-white pixels within their column range.
  - Output Object Properties:
    - Contain a single color.
    - Occupy the same column ranges as corresponding input objects.
    - Shape: Solid rectangles defined by the bounding box of the corresponding input object's non-white pixels within its column range.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Object Identification: Objects are identified by finding contiguous blocks of columns containing non-white pixels, separated by all-white columns.
  - Color Transformation:
    - The primary non-gray color of each input object determines the color of the corresponding output object.
    - Mapping Rule: Blue(1) -> Yellow(4), Red(2) -> Red(2), Green(3) -> Blue(1), Yellow(4) -> Green(3).
    - Gray(5) is ignored for color determination.
  - Shape Transformation:
    - The bounding box of the non-white pixels for each input object (within its column band) is calculated.
    - The corresponding area in the output grid is filled entirely with the transformed color.
