            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct, solid-colored, often rectangular or near-rectangular shapes (objects) separated by the white background (color 0).\n2.  **Arrangement:** These objects are arranged either primarily horizontally (example 1: blue, yellow, green, red blocks side-by-side) or primarily vertically (example 2: gray, red, orange shapes stacked).\n3.  **Separators:** White pixels act as separators between the colored objects. In example 1, white columns separate the blocks. In example 2, white rows separate the shapes.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the *order* of these colored objects, while preserving their individual shapes and internal structure.\n5.  **Arrangement-Dependent Rule:** The rearrangement rule seems to depend on the initial arrangement:\n    *   **Horizontal Arrangement (Example 1):** The objects [Blue, Yellow, Green, Red] are reordered based on their width. The widths are approximately Blue(5), Yellow(3), Green(4), Red(6). Sorting by width gives Yellow(3), Green(4), Blue(5), Red(6). The output order is [Yellow, Green, Blue, Red], matching the sort by width. The horizontal spacing (1 white column) between objects is preserved.\n    *   **Vertical Arrangement (Example 2):** The objects [Gray, Red, Orange] are simply reversed in their vertical order to become [Orange, Red, Gray]. The vertical spacing (1 white row) between objects is preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

For each object, determine its color, its exact shape (relative pixel coordinates), its bounding box (top-left corner coordinates, width, height), and its position in the grid.\n2.  **Determine Layout:** Analyze the relative positions and separations of the object bounding boxes.\n    *   If the objects are primarily separated by white columns and largely aligned vertically (significant overlap in row ranges), classify the layout as 'horizontal'. Record the initial horizontal order of objects and the width of the white column gaps between them.\n    *   If the objects are primarily separated by white rows and largely aligned horizontally (significant overlap in column ranges), classify the layout as 'vertical'.

Start placing the first object at the original horizontal starting position (e.g., the column where the first object in the *original* sequence started, or simply column 0 if padding allows). Maintain each object's original top row position relative to its bounding box. Insert the original white column gaps between the objects as they are placed sequentially from left to right.\n    *   **If Vertical Layout:** Place the objects onto the new grid according to the reversed vertical order. Start placing the first object (originally the last) at the original vertical starting position (e.g., the row where the first object in the *original* sequence started, or simply row 0 if padding allows). Maintain each object's original leftmost column position relative to its bounding box. Insert the original white row gaps between the objects as they are placed sequentially from top to bottom.\n5.  **Return Result:** Output the newly constructed grid."
