Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct, solid-colored, often rectangular or near-rectangular shapes (objects) separated by the white background (color 0).
2.  **Arrangement:** These objects are arranged either primarily horizontally (example 1: blue, yellow, green, red blocks side-by-side) or primarily vertically (example 2: gray, red, orange shapes stacked).
3.  **Separators:** White pixels act as separators between the colored objects. In example 1, white columns separate the blocks. In example 2, white rows separate the shapes.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the *order* of these colored objects, while preserving their individual shapes and internal structure.
5.  **Arrangement-Dependent Rule:** The rearrangement rule seems to depend on the initial arrangement:
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement (Example 1):** The objects [Blue, Yellow, Green, Red] are reordered based on their width. The widths are approximately Blue(5), Yellow(3), Green(4), Red(6). Sorting by width gives Yellow(3), Green(4), Blue(5), Red(6). The output order is [Yellow, Green, Blue, Red], matching the sort by width. The horizontal spacing (1 white column) between objects is preserved.
    *   **Vertical Arrangement (Example 2):** The objects [Gray, Red, Orange] are simply reversed in their vertical order to become [Orange, Red, Gray]. The vertical spacing (1 white row) between objects is preserved.

task_context:
  description: Rearranges colored objects within a grid based on their layout.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - objects_present: true
    - object_colors: non-white (1-9)
    - object_shapes: variable, often rectangular or simple geometric forms
    - object_separation: objects are separated by background pixels

objects:
  - definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color of the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object.
      - width: The width of the bounding box.
      - height: The height of the bounding box.
      - pixel_mask: The relative positions of the object's pixels within its bounding box.
      - position: The top-left coordinate (row, col) of the bounding box in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_layout
    description: Objects are arranged primarily along one axis (horizontal or vertical).
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal | vertical
      - separation: The number of background pixels separating adjacent objects along the primary axis.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects [object_data, bounding_box, position]
  - name: determine_layout
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: layout_axis (horizontal | vertical), object_order_in, separation_distances
  - name: sort_objects_horizontally
    inputs: list_of_objects
    criteria: sort by object width (ascending)
    outputs: object_order_out
  - name: reverse_objects_vertically
    inputs: list_of_objects
    criteria: reverse the vertical order
    outputs: object_order_out
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    inputs: original_grid_dimensions, layout_axis, object_order_out, separation_distances, object_data
    outputs: output_grid
    process: Create an empty grid. Place objects according to the new order, preserving original separation distances and the object's position along the non-primary axis.

transformation_rule:
  - if layout is horizontal:
      - sort objects by width (ascending)
      - reconstruct grid horizontally using sorted order and original spacing
  - if layout is vertical:
      - reverse the order of objects
      - reconstruct grid vertically using reversed order and original spacing

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Segment Objects:** Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, its exact shape (relative pixel coordinates), its bounding box (top-left corner coordinates, width, height), and its position in the grid.
2.  **Determine Layout:** Analyze the relative positions and separations of the object bounding boxes.
    *   If the objects are primarily separated by white columns and largely aligned vertically (significant overlap in row ranges), classify the layout as 'horizontal'. Record the initial horizontal order of objects and the width of the white column gaps between them.
    *   If the objects are primarily separated by white rows and largely aligned horizontally (significant overlap in column ranges), classify the layout as 'vertical'. Record the initial vertical order of objects and the height of the white row gaps between them.
3.  **Apply Reordering Rule:**
    *   **If Horizontal Layout:** Sort the identified objects based on the width of their bounding boxes in ascending order.
    *   **If Vertical Layout:** Reverse the initial vertical order of the identified objects.
4.  **Reconstruct Output Grid:** Create a new grid filled with the background color (white), having the same dimensions as the input grid.
    *   **If Horizontal Layout:** Place the objects onto the new grid according to the width-sorted order. Start placing the first object at the original horizontal starting position (e.g., the column where the first object in the *original* sequence started, or simply column 0 if padding allows). Maintain each object's original top row position relative to its bounding box. Insert the original white column gaps between the objects as they are placed sequentially from left to right.
    *   **If Vertical Layout:** Place the objects onto the new grid according to the reversed vertical order. Start placing the first object (originally the last) at the original vertical starting position (e.g., the row where the first object in the *original* sequence started, or simply row 0 if padding allows). Maintain each object's original leftmost column position relative to its bounding box. Insert the original white row gaps between the objects as they are placed sequentially from top to bottom.
5.  **Return Result:** Output the newly constructed grid.
