task_context:
  description: Rearranges colored objects within a grid based on their layout.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - objects_present: true
    - object_colors: non-white (1-9)
    - object_shapes: variable, often rectangular or simple geometric forms
    - object_separation: objects are separated by background pixels

objects:
  - definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color of the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object.
      - width: The width of the bounding box.
      - height: The height of the bounding box.
      - pixel_mask: The relative positions of the object's pixels within its bounding box.
      - position: The top-left coordinate (row, col) of the bounding box in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_layout
    description: Objects are arranged primarily along one axis (horizontal or vertical).
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal | vertical
      - separation: The number of background pixels separating adjacent objects along the primary axis.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects [object_data, bounding_box, position]
  - name: determine_layout
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: layout_axis (horizontal | vertical), object_order_in, separation_distances
  - name: sort_objects_horizontally
    inputs: list_of_objects
    criteria: sort by object width (ascending)
    outputs: object_order_out
  - name: reverse_objects_vertically
    inputs: list_of_objects
    criteria: reverse the vertical order
    outputs: object_order_out
  - name: reconstruct_grid
    inputs: original_grid_dimensions, layout_axis, object_order_out, separation_distances, object_data
    outputs: output_grid
    process: Create an empty grid. Place objects according to the new order, preserving original separation distances and the object's position along the non-primary axis.

transformation_rule:
  - if layout is horizontal:
      - sort objects by width (ascending)
      - reconstruct grid horizontally using sorted order and original spacing
  - if layout is vertical:
      - reverse the order of objects
      - reconstruct grid vertically using reversed order and original spacing
