In both examples, the input grid contains colored pixels (yellow in train_1, magenta in train_2) scattered on a white background. The output grid shows these same colored pixels consolidated at the bottom of their respective columns. Each colored pixel appears to \"fall\" downwards within its column until it reaches the bottom edge of the grid or rests upon another colored pixel already settled in that column. The relative vertical order of the colored pixels within a single column seems to be preserved during this process. The background white pixels essentially act as empty space through which the colored pixels fall.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
