**Perception**

The task involves rearranging colored pixels within a grid based on a gravity-like principle. In both examples, the input grid contains colored pixels (yellow in train_1, magenta in train_2) scattered on a white background. The output grid shows these same colored pixels consolidated at the bottom of their respective columns. Each colored pixel appears to "fall" downwards within its column until it reaches the bottom edge of the grid or rests upon another colored pixel already settled in that column. The relative vertical order of the colored pixels within a single column seems to be preserved during this process. The background white pixels essentially act as empty space through which the colored pixels fall.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: tuple (row, column)
      is_background: boolean (true if color is 0)
      is_colored: boolean (true if color is not 0)
actions:
  - name: fall_down
    target: colored_pixel
    constraints:
      - moves_within_same_column
      - stops_at_grid_bottom
      - stops_at_another_colored_pixel_below
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels exist within a 2D grid structure.
  - type: column_constraint
    description: Movement (falling) is restricted to the pixel's original column.
  - type: stacking
    description: Falling pixels stack vertically upon other pixels or the grid bottom within the same column.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative vertical order of colored pixels within a column is maintained after falling.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Process the input grid column by column, from left to right.
3.  For each column:
    a.  Identify all the colored (non-white) pixels within that column.
    b.  Collect the colors of these pixels in a list, maintaining their top-to-bottom order as found in the input grid column.
    c.  Starting from the bottom row of the output grid and moving upwards within the current column, place the collected colored pixels from the list (in their original relative order) into the available cells.
4.  The resulting grid, after processing all columns, is the final output.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implemented a simple "gravity" effect within each column independently. The results show this is incorrect. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs, indicating a more complex rearrangement involving horizontal movement and consolidation of colored pixels.

Specifically, comparing the input, expected output, and transformed output for both examples reveals:
1.  **Consolidation:** All colored pixels from the input grid seem to be gathered together in the output.
2.  **Location:** The consolidated pixels are placed in the bottom-left area of the output grid.
3.  **Ordering:** The simple column-based gravity failed because pixels changed columns. The relative ordering must be preserved differently. The `Transformed Output` shows pixels falling straight down, while the `Expected Output` shows them packed into a shape at the bottom-left.
4.  **Shape:** The final arrangement forms a packed shape, filling from the bottom row upwards, and from the leftmost column rightwards.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the total count and colors of non-background pixels are preserved between input and output.
2.  Determine the exact ordering used to collect the input pixels. Row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) seems likely based on initial analysis.
3.  Determine the exact algorithm for generating the target coordinates in the output grid. The pattern observed suggests filling layers bottom-up, left-to-right, until all collected pixels have a target coordinate.
4.  Update the Natural Language Program to describe this refined process: collect all colored pixels in order, generate target coordinates in order, place pixels into target coordinates.
