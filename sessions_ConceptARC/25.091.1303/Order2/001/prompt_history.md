**Perception**

The task involves rearranging colored pixels within a grid based on a gravity-like principle. In both examples, the input grid contains colored pixels (yellow in train_1, magenta in train_2) scattered on a white background. The output grid shows these same colored pixels consolidated at the bottom of their respective columns. Each colored pixel appears to "fall" downwards within its column until it reaches the bottom edge of the grid or rests upon another colored pixel already settled in that column. The relative vertical order of the colored pixels within a single column seems to be preserved during this process. The background white pixels essentially act as empty space through which the colored pixels fall.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: tuple (row, column)
      is_background: boolean (true if color is 0)
      is_colored: boolean (true if color is not 0)
actions:
  - name: fall_down
    target: colored_pixel
    constraints:
      - moves_within_same_column
      - stops_at_grid_bottom
      - stops_at_another_colored_pixel_below
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels exist within a 2D grid structure.
  - type: column_constraint
    description: Movement (falling) is restricted to the pixel's original column.
  - type: stacking
    description: Falling pixels stack vertically upon other pixels or the grid bottom within the same column.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative vertical order of colored pixels within a column is maintained after falling.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Process the input grid column by column, from left to right.
3.  For each column:
    a.  Identify all the colored (non-white) pixels within that column.
    b.  Collect the colors of these pixels in a list, maintaining their top-to-bottom order as found in the input grid column.
    c.  Starting from the bottom row of the output grid and moving upwards within the current column, place the collected colored pixels from the list (in their original relative order) into the available cells.
4.  The resulting grid, after processing all columns, is the final output.
