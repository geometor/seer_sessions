"""
Applies a gravity-like transformation to a 2D grid. Colored pixels (non-zero)
in each column "fall" downwards, stacking at the bottom of the column or on top
of other fallen pixels within the same column, while maintaining their original
relative vertical order. The background pixels (zero) are treated as empty space.
