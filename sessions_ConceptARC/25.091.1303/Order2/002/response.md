**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implemented a simple "gravity" effect within each column independently. The results show this is incorrect. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs, indicating a more complex rearrangement involving horizontal movement and consolidation of colored pixels.

Specifically, comparing the input, expected output, and transformed output for both examples reveals:
1.  **Consolidation:** All colored pixels from the input grid seem to be gathered together in the output.
2.  **Location:** The consolidated pixels are placed in the bottom-left area of the output grid.
3.  **Ordering:** The simple column-based gravity failed because pixels changed columns. The relative ordering must be preserved differently. The `Transformed Output` shows pixels falling straight down, while the `Expected Output` shows them packed into a shape at the bottom-left.
4.  **Shape:** The final arrangement forms a packed shape, filling from the bottom row upwards, and from the leftmost column rightwards.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the total count and colors of non-background pixels are preserved between input and output.
2.  Determine the exact ordering used to collect the input pixels. Row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) seems likely based on initial analysis.
3.  Determine the exact algorithm for generating the target coordinates in the output grid. The pattern observed suggests filling layers bottom-up, left-to-right, until all collected pixels have a target coordinate.
4.  Update the Natural Language Program to describe this refined process: collect all colored pixels in order, generate target coordinates in order, place pixels into target coordinates.
