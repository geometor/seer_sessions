These blocks vary in color, width, and height. The transformation rearranges these blocks vertically. Observing the examples, the relative vertical order of the blocks in the output seems determined by their width. Specifically, the blocks are re-stacked in ascending order of their width, from narrowest to widest. The original content (shape and color) and height of each block are preserved. The vertical stacking in the output starts at the row where the topmost block began in the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
