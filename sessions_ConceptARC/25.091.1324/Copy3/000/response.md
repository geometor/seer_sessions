Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements and Transformation**

Both examples involve taking an input grid and producing an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve copying or reflecting parts of the input grid onto other parts of the output grid. The specific method seems conditional.

*   **Example 1 (train_1):** The input grid has various colored shapes (yellow, blue, green) mostly on the left side. The output grid retains the left side identically and populates the right side as a mirror image (reflection) of the left side across the vertical midline. The grid width is 16 (even). The reflection occurs across the line between columns 7 and 8. Magenta (color 6) is absent.

*   **Example 2 (train_2):** The input grid has shapes of multiple colors (magenta, green, orange, yellow). The output grid retains most of the input, but a specific region from the input appears copied to a different location. Magenta (color 6) is present.
    *   A "source" region in the input, specifically the cluster of green, yellow, and orange pixels (rows 2-7, columns 0-2), seems to be identified. This region is characterized by containing the highest diversity of colors (3 colors: green, yellow, orange) compared to other objects (magenta: 1 color).
    *   A "target" location in the output (top-left corner at row 5, column 6) is determined. This location seems related to the positions of specific magenta objects in the input. Specifically, the target row (5) appears to be the sum of the source region's top row (2) and the top row of the highest magenta object in the right half (object at (3,6), row=3 -> 2+3=5). The target column (6) appears to be the column of that same magenta object (object at (3,6), col=6).
    *   The source region from the input is then copied ("pasted") onto the target location in the output grid, overwriting any previous content in that area. The rest of the output grid remains identical to the input.

**Hypothesized Rule:**

The transformation rule depends on the presence and distribution of Magenta (color 6) pixels.

1.  **If Magenta is absent, OR if all Magenta pixels are on one side of the vertical midline:** The transformation is a reflection. The left half of the grid (up to `floor(width/2)`) is reflected across the vertical midline to create the right half of the output. The left half of the output is identical to the left half of the input.
2.  **If Magenta is present AND distributed on both sides of the vertical midline:** The transformation is a selective copy/paste.
    *   Identify the region (bounding box) containing the connected component(s) with the highest number of distinct non-background colors. This is the "Source Region".
    *   Identify key Magenta objects: M_tr (highest one starting at or right of the midline) and M_ll (lowest one ending left of the midline).
    *   Determine the "Target Location" (top-left corner) based on the Source Region's top-left corner (Sr, Sc) and M_tr's top-left corner
