            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: duplicating a \"composite object\" based on the position of a \"secondary object\". However, the implementation failed on the second example (`train_2`). The key issue appears to be in the definition and extraction of the \"composite object\" pattern.\n\nThe failed output for `train_2` showed the *secondary* object being duplicated, instead of the primary composite object (yellow diamond frame + enclosed blue plus). While the code logic *appeared* to select the correct objects and calculate the correct placement, the resulting output suggests that either the wrong pattern was extracted or the wrong object was identified as primary.\n\nReviewing the logic against both examples suggests a refinement: the object to be duplicated isn't just the pixels of the primary and enclosed objects, but rather the entire rectangular region defined by their combined minimal bounding box, including any background pixels within that box. The previous `extract_pattern` function only copied the specific non-background pixels, which was incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the definition of the \"composite object pattern\" to be the full rectangular slice of the input grid defined by the minimal bounding box containing the primary (largest BB area) object and any objects enclosed within the primary's bounding box.\n2.  Update the Natural Language Program and YAML facts to reflect this understanding.\n3.  The coder phase will then implement this refined pattern extraction.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
