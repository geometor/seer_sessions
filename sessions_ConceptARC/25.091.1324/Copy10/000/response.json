Let's call the main structure and its enclosed content the \"composite object\".\n    *   There is also usually at least one other separate, smaller object located elsewhere in the grid (\"secondary object\").\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:**\n    *   The output grid contains exactly two copies of the \"composite object\" identified in the input.\n    *   The secondary object(s) from the input are *not* present in the output.\n    *   The two copies of the composite object are spatially separated by a gap of white pixels.\n    *   The orientation of the duplication (horizontal or vertical) and the size of the gap seem dependent on the input configuration.\n3.  **Transformation Inference:**\n    *   The core operation is the duplication of a specific complex structure (the composite object) found in the input.\n    *   The process involves identifying the primary structure, any structures contained within it, and at least one secondary structure outside of it.\n    *   The relative position of the secondary structure to the primary/composite structure appears to determine the axis of duplication:\n        *   If the secondary object is primarily to the right/left of the composite object, duplication occurs horizontally. (Observed in `train_1`: secondary red rectangle is to the right, duplication is horizontal).\n        *   If the secondary object is primarily above/below the composite object, duplication occurs vertically. (Observed in `train_2`: secondary blue plus is below, duplication is vertical).\n    *   A specific gap size is introduced between the original composite object and its copy:\n        *   A 2-column gap for horizontal duplication.\n        *   A 1-row gap for vertical duplication.\n    *   The final output grid retains only the original composite object and its translated copy, with everything else becoming the background color (white).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Extract the pattern of pixels (Primary + Enclosed) within this bounding box.\n5.  **Identify the Secondary Object(s):** Find all objects located entirely outside the bounding box of the Primary Object. (If there are multiple, assume the task uses a consistent rule, e.g., the one closest to the Composite Object, or the largest one, to determine direction. Based on examples, there seems to be one clearly distinct secondary object).\n6.  **Determine Duplication Direction:** Compare the position (e.g., center coordinates or bounding box edges) of the Secondary Object to the Composite Object's bounding box.\n    *   If the Secondary Object is predominantly to the right or left, set the duplication direction to 'horizontal'.\n    *   If the Secondary Object is predominantly below or above, set the duplication direction to 'vertical'.\n7.  **Determine Gap Size:**\n    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the gap is 2 columns wide.\n    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the gap is 1 row high.\n8.  **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n9.  **Place the Original Composite Object:** Copy the pixel pattern of the Composite Object into the output grid at its original coordinates.\n10. **Calculate Placement for the Copy:**\n    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the top-left corner of the copy will be at the same row as the original, and the column will be the original starting column + width of the Composite Object + 2 (gap).\n    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the top-left corner of the copy will be at the same column as the original, and the row will be the original starting row + height of the Composite Object + 1 (gap).\n11. **Place the Copied Composite Object:** Copy the pixel pattern of the Composite Object into the output grid at the calculated coordinates, ensuring it fits within the grid boundaries.\n12. **Finalize:** The resulting grid is the output."
