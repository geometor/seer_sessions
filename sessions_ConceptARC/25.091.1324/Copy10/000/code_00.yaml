task_type: conditional object duplication and placement

input_features:
  - objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - background: White pixels (value 0).
  - composition:
      - primary_object: Typically the largest object by bounding box area. Often acts as a frame or container.
      - enclosed_objects: Objects located entirely within the bounding box of the primary_object.
      - composite_object: The minimal bounding box containing the primary_object and all its enclosed_objects, including all pixels within that box belonging to these objects.
      - secondary_objects: Objects located outside the bounding box of the primary_object.

relationships:
  - containment: enclosed_objects are inside the primary_object.
  - relative_position: The spatial relationship (e.g., right-of, below) between the secondary_object(s) and the composite_object. Primarily determined by comparing the coordinates of their bounding boxes.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Segment the input grid into distinct non-white objects and the background.
  - select_primary: Identify the primary_object (e.g., largest bounding box).
  - identify_enclosed: Find objects fully contained within the primary_object's bounding box.
  - define_composite: Determine the bounding box and pixel content of the composite_object (primary + enclosed).
  - select_secondary: Identify the relevant secondary_object (if multiple exist, potentially the closest or largest one).
  - determine_duplication_axis:
      - If the secondary_object is primarily horizontally displaced from the composite_object (center or edge comparison), the axis is horizontal.
      - If the secondary_object is primarily vertically displaced, the axis is vertical.
  - determine_gap_size:
      - 2 columns of white pixels if the axis is horizontal.
      - 1 row of white pixels if the axis is vertical.
  - duplicate_composite: Create an identical copy of the composite_object.
  - place_copies:
      - Position the original composite_object at its original location.
      - Position the duplicated composite_object adjacent to the original along the determined axis, separated by the calculated gap.
  - generate_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white), and draw the original and duplicated composite_objects at their calculated positions.

output_features:
  - grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - content: Contains two identical copies of the input's composite_object, separated by a specific white gap (either horizontal or vertical).
  - background: White pixels (value 0) fill the rest of the grid.
