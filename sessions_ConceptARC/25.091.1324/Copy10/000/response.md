Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple distinct objects composed of colored pixels (non-white).
    *   Typically, there's one larger, often framing or enclosing, structure (e.g., the green frame in `train_1`, the yellow diamond in `train_2`).
    *   This main structure might contain other distinct objects within its boundaries (e.g., the red rectangle inside the green frame in `train_1`, the blue plus inside the yellow diamond in `train_2`). Let's call the main structure and its enclosed content the "composite object".
    *   There is also usually at least one other separate, smaller object located elsewhere in the grid ("secondary object").
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:**
    *   The output grid contains exactly two copies of the "composite object" identified in the input.
    *   The secondary object(s) from the input are *not* present in the output.
    *   The two copies of the composite object are spatially separated by a gap of white pixels.
    *   The orientation of the duplication (horizontal or vertical) and the size of the gap seem dependent on the input configuration.
3.  **Transformation Inference:**
    *   The core operation is the duplication of a specific complex structure (the composite object) found in the input.
    *   The process involves identifying the primary structure, any structures contained within it, and at least one secondary structure outside of it.
    *   The relative position of the secondary structure to the primary/composite structure appears to determine the axis of duplication:
        *   If the secondary object is primarily to the right/left of the composite object, duplication occurs horizontally. (Observed in `train_1`: secondary red rectangle is to the right, duplication is horizontal).
        *   If the secondary object is primarily above/below the composite object, duplication occurs vertically. (Observed in `train_2`: secondary blue plus is below, duplication is vertical).
    *   A specific gap size is introduced between the original composite object and its copy:
        *   A 2-column gap for horizontal duplication.
        *   A 1-row gap for vertical duplication.
    *   The final output grid retains only the original composite object and its translated copy, with everything else becoming the background color (white).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: conditional object duplication and placement

input_features:
  - objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - background: White pixels (value 0).
  - composition:
      - primary_object: Typically the largest object by bounding box area. Often acts as a frame or container.
      - enclosed_objects: Objects located entirely within the bounding box of the primary_object.
      - composite_object: The minimal bounding box containing the primary_object and all its enclosed_objects, including all pixels within that box belonging to these objects.
      - secondary_objects: Objects located outside the bounding box of the primary_object.

relationships:
  - containment: enclosed_objects are inside the primary_object.
  - relative_position: The spatial relationship (e.g., right-of, below) between the secondary_object(s) and the composite_object. Primarily determined by comparing the coordinates of their bounding boxes.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Segment the input grid into distinct non-white objects and the background.
  - select_primary: Identify the primary_object (e.g., largest bounding box).
  - identify_enclosed: Find objects fully contained within the primary_object's bounding box.
  - define_composite: Determine the bounding box and pixel content of the composite_object (primary + enclosed).
  - select_secondary: Identify the relevant secondary_object (if multiple exist, potentially the closest or largest one).
  - determine_duplication_axis:
      - If the secondary_object is primarily horizontally displaced from the composite_object (center or edge comparison), the axis is horizontal.
      - If the secondary_object is primarily vertically displaced, the axis is vertical.
  - determine_gap_size:
      - 2 columns of white pixels if the axis is horizontal.
      - 1 row of white pixels if the axis is vertical.
  - duplicate_composite: Create an identical copy of the composite_object.
  - place_copies:
      - Position the original composite_object at its original location.
      - Position the duplicated composite_object adjacent to the original along the determined axis, separated by the calculated gap.
  - generate_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white), and draw the original and duplicated composite_objects at their calculated positions.

output_features:
  - grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - content: Contains two identical copies of the input's composite_object, separated by a specific white gap (either horizontal or vertical).
  - background: White pixels (value 0) fill the rest of the grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Identify all distinct, contiguous non-white objects.
2.  **Identify the Primary Object:** Find the object with the largest bounding box.
3.  **Identify Enclosed Objects:** Find all objects located entirely within the bounding box of the Primary Object.
4.  **Define the Composite Object:** Determine the smallest bounding box that contains both the Primary Object and all Enclosed Objects. Extract the pattern of pixels (Primary + Enclosed) within this bounding box.
5.  **Identify the Secondary Object(s):** Find all objects located entirely outside the bounding box of the Primary Object. (If there are multiple, assume the task uses a consistent rule, e.g., the one closest to the Composite Object, or the largest one, to determine direction. Based on examples, there seems to be one clearly distinct secondary object).
6.  **Determine Duplication Direction:** Compare the position (e.g., center coordinates or bounding box edges) of the Secondary Object to the Composite Object's bounding box.
    *   If the Secondary Object is predominantly to the right or left, set the duplication direction to 'horizontal'.
    *   If the Secondary Object is predominantly below or above, set the duplication direction to 'vertical'.
7.  **Determine Gap Size:**
    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the gap is 2 columns wide.
    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the gap is 1 row high.
8.  **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
9.  **Place the Original Composite Object:** Copy the pixel pattern of the Composite Object into the output grid at its original coordinates.
10. **Calculate Placement for the Copy:**
    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the top-left corner of the copy will be at the same row as the original, and the column will be the original starting column + width of the Composite Object + 2 (gap).
    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the top-left corner of the copy will be at the same column as the original, and the row will be the original starting row + height of the Composite Object + 1 (gap).
11. **Place the Copied Composite Object:** Copy the pixel pattern of the Composite Object into the output grid at the calculated coordinates, ensuring it fits within the grid boundaries.
12. **Finalize:** The resulting grid is the output.
