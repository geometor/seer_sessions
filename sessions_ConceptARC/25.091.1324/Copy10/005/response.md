# --- Main Transformation Function ---

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by identifying a 'composite object' and a 'trigger object'.
    The composite object consists of the object with the largest bounding box ('primary') 
    and any other objects fully enclosed within the primary object's bounding box.
    The trigger object is the object with the largest bounding box among those completely 
    outside the primary object's bounding box.

    The transformation duplicates the rectangular region defined by the minimal bounding 
    box of the composite object. The placement of the duplicate depends on the relative 
    position of the trigger object to the composite object's bounding box:
    1. If the trigger object is primarily horizontally separated (larger horizontal gap 
       between bounding boxes), the composite region is duplicated horizontally with a 
       2-column gap of background color (0) in between.
    2. If the trigger object is primarily vertically separated (larger vertical gap), 
       the composite region is duplicated vertically with a 1-row gap of background 
       color (0) in between. If gaps are equal, horizontal duplication is preferred.
    3. If no trigger object exists, horizontal duplication with a 2-column gap is used.

    The final output grid contains only the original composite region and its duplicate 
    placed according to the determined direction and gap, on a background of color 0. 
    All other elements from the input grid (like the trigger object) are removed.
