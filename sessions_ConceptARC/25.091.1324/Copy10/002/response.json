            "text": "Okay, let's refine the understanding based on the results.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code correctly processed `train_1` but failed on `train_2`. The failure analysis using `tool_code` revealed a critical flaw in object definition: the code treated every contiguous block of the *same* color as an object. This fragmented the yellow diamond in `train_2` into many small objects, leading to the incorrect identification of the inner blue plus as the \"primary\" object (based on its bounding box area being larger than any single yellow pixel's).\n\nThe core transformation logic (duplication based on relative position of a secondary object) seems directionally correct, but its application depends heavily on correctly identifying the primary/composite object to be duplicated and the secondary object determining the direction.\n\n**Strategy Revision**\n\nThe strategy needs to be updated to correctly group potentially multi-colored or fragmented shapes into a single \"composite object\" and distinguish it from the \"secondary object\". The key is to correctly identify the main structure (like the green frame or the yellow diamond) even if it's composed of multiple pieces or colors internally.\n\n1.  **Component Identification:** First, find all basic connected components of non-white pixels, regardless of color changes within the component (though the examples only show single-color components).\n2.  **Frame Identification:** Identify the \"frame\" or main containing structure. The rule \"largest bounding box area\" applied to *components* seems promising. Let's call the component with the largest bounding box the `frame_component`.\n3.  **Composite Definition:** Define the `composite_object` as the `frame_component` plus any other components *fully enclosed* within the `frame_component`'s bounding box. The pattern to be duplicated is the combined set of pixels from these components within their overall bounding box.\n4.  **Secondary Identification:** Identify `secondary_objects` as components lying entirely *outside* the `frame_component`'s bounding box. Select the one with the largest bounding box area as the `determining_secondary_object`.\n5.  **Duplication Logic:** Use the relative position between the `composite_object`'s bounding box and the `determining_secondary_object`'s bounding box to determine the duplication axis (horizontal/vertical) and apply the corresponding gap (2 columns/1 row).\n\n**Example Metrics (Re-evaluated with Revised Strategy)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Components: Green Frame (large BB), Inner Red (small BB), Outer Red (small BB).\n    *   Frame Component (Largest BB): Green Frame. BB: (2, 2, 9, 9). Area: 8*8=64.\n    *   Composite Region: (2, 2, 9, 9).\n    *   Enclosed: Inner Red (BB: (4, 4, 7, 7)) is inside.\n    *   Composite Object: Green Frame pixels + Inner Red pixels. Overall BB: (2, 2, 9, 9).\n    *   Secondary: Outer Red (BB: (4, 14, 7, 17)) is outside the composite region. Largest (only) secondary.\n    *   Relative Position: Secondary is Right -> Horizontal Duplication. Gap=2.\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Components: Many Yellow pixels (various small BBs), Inner Blue plus (BB: (3, 2, 5, 4), Area 9), Outer Blue plus (BB: (11, 2, 13, 4), Area 9).\n    *   Frame Component (Largest BB): We need to group the yellow pixels conceptually. If treated as one object, the Yellow Diamond's BB is (1, 0, 7, 6), Area 7*8=56. This is larger than the blue plus components. Let's assume the grouping works or that one yellow component coincidentally has the largest BB. *Correction*: The `find_objects` function *as written* finds individual components. The largest *single* component BB area is 9 (both blue pluses). This strategy still fails unless `find_objects` is changed or we group adjacent/overlapping components first.\n    *   *Revised Assumption*: Let's assume a better grouping identifies the \"Yellow Diamond\" structure as having the largest effective bounding box (1, 0, 7, 6).\n    *   Frame Component: Yellow Diamond structure.\n    *   Composite Region: (1, 0, 7, 6).\n    *   Enclosed: Inner Blue plus (BB: (3, 2, 5, 4)) is inside.\n    *   Composite Object: Yellow Diamond pixels + Inner Blue plus pixels. Overall BB: (1, 0, 7, 6).\n    *   Secondary: Outer Blue plus (BB: (11, 2, 13, 4)) is outside the composite region. Largest (only) secondary.\n    *   Relative Position: Secondary is Below -> Vertical Duplication. Gap=1.\n    *   Result: Correct (matches expected output).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

For each component, determine its pixel coordinates and its bounding box.\n2.  **Identify Frame:** Find the single component that has the largest bounding box area. This is the 'Frame Component'. Its bounding box defines the 'Composite Region'.\n3.  **Find Enclosed:** Identify all other components whose bounding boxes lie entirely inside the 'Composite Region'. These are the 'Enclosed Components'.\n4.  **Define Composite Object:** Collect all pixel coordinates belonging to the 'Frame Component' and all 'Enclosed Components'. Calculate the overall bounding box that minimally encloses all these collected coordinates. Extract the pattern of pixels from the input grid within this overall bounding box. This pattern is the 'Composite Pattern', and its bounding box defines its origin and dimensions.\n5.  **Find Secondary Components:** Identify all components whose bounding boxes lie entirely outside the 'Composite Region'.\n6.  **Select Secondary Trigger:** From the Secondary Components, select the one with the largest bounding box area. This is the 'Trigger Object'.\n7.  **Determine Duplication Direction:** Compare the bounding box of the 'Composite Object' and the 'Trigger Object'. If they are separated more horizontally than vertically (e.g., based on the distance between their centers or the gap between their edges), the direction is 'horizontal'. Otherwise, the direction is 'vertical'.\n8.  **Set Gap:** If the direction is 'horizontal', the gap is 2 white columns. If the direction is 'vertical', the gap is 1 white row.\n9.  **Create Output Grid:** Make a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white).\n10. **Place Original:** Draw the 'Composite Pattern' onto the output grid at the location defined by its bounding box top-left corner.\n11. **Place Copy:** Calculate the top-left corner for the copy by shifting the original position rightwards (by pattern width + gap) if direction is 'horizontal', or downwards (by pattern height + gap) if direction is 'vertical'. Draw the 'Composite Pattern' again at this new position.\n12. **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
