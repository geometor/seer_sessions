"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying a 'composite object' (a primary object, often the largest by bounding box, plus any objects fully enclosed within its bounding box) and a 'secondary object' (an object outside the primary's bounding box).

The transformation duplicates the composite object. The placement of the duplicate depends on the relative position of the secondary object to the composite object:
1. If the secondary object is primarily horizontally displaced from the composite object, the composite object is duplicated horizontally with a 2-column gap of background color (0) in between.
2. If the secondary object is primarily vertically displaced, the composite object is duplicated vertically with a 1-row gap of background color (0) in between.

The final output grid contains only the original composite object and its duplicate placed according to the determined direction and gap, on a background of color 0. All other elements from the input grid (like the secondary object) are removed.
