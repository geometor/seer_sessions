task_description: Copy a specific object based on its relationship to a pair of identical anchor objects.

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input_grid_size: [10, 17]
    output_grid_size: [10, 17]
    objects:
      - color: red
        count: 1
        role: mobile
        location_relation: Above the first blue object.
      - color: blue
        count: 2
        role: anchor
        description: Rectangular shapes.
    transformation:
      action: copy
      source_object_color: red
      target_location_rule: Maintain the same relative position (above) with respect to the second blue anchor object as the original red object has to the first blue anchor object.

  - id: train_2
    input_grid_size: [11, 13]
    output_grid_size: [11, 13]
    objects:
      - color: green
        count: 1
        role: mobile
        location_relation: Below the first yellow object.
      - color: yellow
        count: 2
        role: anchor
        description: Shapes resembling the number 8.
    transformation:
      action: copy
      source_object_color: green
      target_location_rule: Maintain the same relative position (below) with respect to the second yellow anchor object as the original green object has to the first yellow anchor object.

general_rules:
  - Find all distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels).
  - Identify the color with exactly two objects (anchor color).
  - Identify the color with exactly one object (mobile color).
  - Determine the 'first' and 'second' anchor objects (e.g., by top-left coordinate).
  - Calculate the positional offset (vector) from the top-left corner of the first anchor object to the top-left corner of the mobile object.
  - Calculate the target position for the copy by adding this offset to the top-left corner of the second anchor object.
  - Copy the pixel pattern of the mobile object to the target position in the output grid.
  - All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.
