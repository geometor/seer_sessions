**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern of copying one object based on its relative position to a pair of anchor objects. The code implemented this logic successfully for `train_1`. However, the failure on `train_2` revealed an incorrect assumption about the definition of the "mobile object". The initial code assumed the mobile object must be a single, contiguous block of pixels. Example `train_2` shows that the "mobile object" can be a collection of disconnected pixels of the same color, which are treated as a single entity for the copy operation.

The strategy needs refinement to handle potentially disconnected pixels for the mobile object. The anchor objects still appear to be single, contiguous blocks.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's gather metrics for the objects based on the *revised* understanding. We need to identify the anchor color (2 contiguous objects) and the mobile color (all pixels of another color treated as one object).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Copy a set of pixels ('mobile object') based on its positional relationship to a pair of identical 'anchor objects'.

definitions:
  anchor_objects: Two distinct, contiguous objects of the same color.
  mobile_object: The complete set of all pixels of a different, single color (these pixels may or may not be contiguous).
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing a set of pixels.
  top_left_corner: The (row, column) coordinate of the top-leftmost pixel of a bounding box.

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input_grid_size: [10, 17]
    output_grid_size: [10, 17]
    anchor_objects:
      color: blue (1)
      count: 2
      top_left_corners: [(3, 1), (3, 10)]
    mobile_object:
      color: red (2)
      pixel_count: 12
      bounding_box_top_left: (0, 1) # Note: Bbox includes pixels (0,3), (0,4), (1,2) etc.
    relationship:
      offset_vector: (mobile_bbox_top_left - anchor1_bbox_top_left) = (0, 1) - (3, 1) = (-3, 0)
    transformation:
      action: copy
      source_object_color: red
      target_location_rule: Add offset (-3, 0) to anchor2_bbox_top_left (3, 10) -> Target top-left = (0, 10). Copy all red pixels relative to this new top-left.

  - id: train_2
    input_grid_size: [11, 13]
    output_grid_size: [11, 13]
    anchor_objects:
      color: yellow (4)
      count: 2
      top_left_corners: [(0, 1), (0, 7)]
    mobile_object:
      color: green (3)
      pixel_count: 5
      pixels_are_contiguous: false
      bounding_box_top_left: (7, 1) # Bbox includes pixels (7,1), (7,5), (8,2), (8,4), (9,3)
    relationship:
      offset_vector: (mobile_bbox_top_left - anchor1_bbox_top_left) = (7, 1) - (0, 1) = (7, 0)
    transformation:
      action: copy
      source_object_color: green
      target_location_rule: Add offset (7, 0) to anchor2_bbox_top_left (0, 7) -> Target top-left = (7, 7). Copy all green pixels relative to this new top-left.

general_rules:
  - Find all distinct contiguous objects using 4-connectivity.
  - Group these contiguous objects by color. Identify the color that has exactly two objects ('anchor_color').
  - Find all unique non-background colors present in the grid. Identify the color that is not the 'anchor_color' ('mobile_color'). Assume there is only one such color.
  - Collect all pixels in the grid that have the 'mobile_color'. This set constitutes the 'mobile_object'.
  - Determine the overall bounding box for all pixels of the 'mobile_object' and find its top-left corner ('mobile_bbox_top_left').
  - Identify the two anchor objects. Determine which is 'Anchor1' (e.g., the one whose bounding box top-left corner is top-leftmost) and 'Anchor2'. Get their bounding box top-left corners ('anchor1_bbox_top_left', 'anchor2_bbox_top_left').
  - Calculate the offset vector: `offset = mobile_bbox_top_left - anchor1_bbox_top_left`.
  - Calculate the target top-left corner for the copy: `copy_target_bbox_top_left = anchor2_bbox_top_left + offset`.
  - Create a copy of the input grid. For each pixel belonging to the 'mobile_object', calculate its position relative to 'mobile_bbox_top_left'. Add this relative position to 'copy_target_bbox_top_left' to get the final target coordinate in the output grid. Place the 'mobile_color' at this target coordinate.
  - All other pixels (background and anchor objects) remain unchanged from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Contiguous Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all separate contiguous blocks of same-colored, non-white pixels using 4-way adjacency. Record each block's color, pixels, and bounding box.
2.  **Find Anchor Color:** Group the identified contiguous objects by color. Find the color that corresponds to exactly two distinct contiguous objects. This is the `anchor_color`.
3.  **Identify Anchor Objects:** Label the two objects with the `anchor_color` as `anchor_objects`. Determine which is `Anchor1` (e.g., top-leftmost bounding box) and which is `Anchor2`. Record the top-left corner coordinates of their respective bounding boxes (`anchor1_top_left`, `anchor2_top_left`).
4.  **Find Mobile Color:** Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid. The color that is *not* the `anchor_color` is the `mobile_color`. (Assume only one such color exists besides the anchor color).
5.  **Define Mobile Object Pixels:** Collect the coordinates of *all* pixels in the input grid that have the `mobile_color`. This set of coordinates represents the `mobile_object`, regardless of whether the pixels are connected.
6.  **Calculate Mobile Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest bounding box that encloses all pixels of the `mobile_object`. Record the top-left corner coordinates of this bounding box (`mobile_bbox_top_left`).
7.  **Calculate Offset:** Compute the vector difference (delta_row, delta_col) between `mobile_bbox_top_left` and `anchor1_top_left`. `offset = mobile_bbox_top_left - anchor1_top_left`.
8.  **Determine Copy Target Origin:** Calculate the target top-left corner for placing the copied object: `copy_target_origin = anchor2_top_left + offset`.
9.  **Generate Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through each pixel coordinate (`r_mob`, `c_mob`) belonging to the `mobile_object`. Calculate its position relative to the mobile object's bounding box origin: `relative_pos = (r_mob - mobile_bbox_top_left[0], c_mob - mobile_bbox_top_left[1])`. Calculate the final target coordinate in the output grid: `target_pos = copy_target_origin + relative_pos`. Place the `mobile_color` at `target_pos` in the copied grid, ensuring it's within grid bounds. The resulting grid is the output.
