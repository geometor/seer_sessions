            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nBoth examples seem to involve two distinct primary objects or regions within the grid, separated by the background color (white, 0). In `train_1`, there's a magenta-framed region on the left and an orange-framed region on the right, separated by a white column. In `train_2`, there's a yellow/blue object on the left and a red object on the right, separated by white columns.\n\nWithin the first (left) object/region of each example, there's a \"pattern\" composed of pixels of a specific color that is different from the main color of the object and the background (green within magenta/white in `train_1`, blue within yellow/white in `train_2`).\n\nThe transformation appears to copy this pattern from the source (left) region to the target (right) region. The copying mechanism preserves the row position of each pattern pixel but adjusts its column position based on the horizontal shift between the two regions. The copied pattern overwrites the existing pixels in the target region, but only within the bounds of the target object/region. If the translated pattern pixel falls outside the target region's bounds, it is not drawn.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
