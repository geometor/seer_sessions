Task: Copy a specific pattern from a source region to a corresponding target region within a grid.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - BackgroundColor: White (0), separates distinct regions.
  - Regions: Contiguous blocks of non-background pixels. Typically two main regions horizontally separated by BackgroundColor.
    - SourceRegion: The leftmost main region.
      - Properties: Set of coordinates, set of contained colors, bounding box, minimum column index (`min_col_source`).
      - SourceFrameColor: The most frequent non-background color within the SourceRegion's coordinates.
      - PatternColor: The numerically lowest non-background color within the SourceRegion's coordinates that is *not* the SourceFrameColor.
      - PatternPixels: The set of coordinates `(row, col)` within the SourceRegion where the pixel color matches the PatternColor.
    - TargetRegion: The rightmost main region.
      - Properties: Set of coordinates, set of contained colors, bounding box, minimum column index (`min_col_target`).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: A 2D array of pixels, same dimensions as the input, modified based on the transformation.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identification: Identify the SourceRegion and TargetRegion based on horizontal position and separation by BackgroundColor. Determine their respective coordinates.
  - Pattern_Extraction: Identify the PatternColor and PatternPixels within the SourceRegion as defined above.
  - Translation_Vector: Calculate the horizontal shift `delta_col = min_col_target - min_col_source`.
  - Copying: For each PatternPixel `(r_s, c_s)`:
    - Calculate the potential target coordinate `(target_r, target_c) = (r_s, c_s + delta_col)`.
    - Check if `(target_r, target_c)` is within the grid boundaries AND if `(target_r, target_c)` is one of the coordinates belonging to the TargetRegion.
    - If both conditions are true, set the color of the output grid at `(target_r, target_c)` to the PatternColor. Otherwise, make no change for this PatternPixel.
  - Preservation: Pixels not part of the copied pattern within the TargetRegion, and all pixels outside the TargetRegion, remain unchanged from the input grid.

Example_Notes:
  - train_1: Source (Cols 0-5, Frame=6, Pattern=3), Target (Cols 7-12, Frame=7). delta_col=7. Pattern pixels (color 3) copied.
  - train_2: Source (Cols 0-4, Frame=4, Pattern=1), Target (Cols 7-9, Frame=2). delta_col=7. Pattern pixels (color 1) copied only to coordinates within the TargetRegion.
