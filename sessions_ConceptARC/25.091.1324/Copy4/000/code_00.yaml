  description: Replace certain objects with copies of the largest object of the same color based on relative position.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - objects_are_contiguous: true
    - multiple_colors_per_grid: true

example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: yellow (4)
      type: rectangle
      size: [4, 5] # height, width
      pixels: 20
      position_top_left: [1, 1]
      role: prototype
    - color: yellow (4)
      type: pixel
      size: [1, 1]
      pixels: 1
      position_top_left: [1, 9]
      role: seed (replace)
    - color: yellow (4)
      type: pixel
      size: [1, 1]
      pixels: 1
      position_top_left: [1, 17]
      role: seed (replace)
    - color: green (3)
      type: rectangle
      size: [3, 5]
      pixels: 15
      position_top_left: [6, 12]
      role: prototype (only one)
  output_description:
    - Single yellow pixels at (1,9) and (1,17) are replaced.
    - Replacement_rule: They are replaced because their top-left coordinates (1,9) and (1,17) come after the prototype's (1,1) in reading order (same row, greater column).
    - Copied_pattern: 4x5 yellow rectangle from bounding box of prototype at (1,1).
    - Placement: Copied pattern starts at (1,9) and (1,17) respectively.
    - Green object remains unchanged as it's the only one of its color.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: magenta (6)
      type: rectangle
      size: [2, 3]
      pixels: 6
      position_top_left: [0, 3]
      role: seed (keep)
    - color: magenta (6)
      type: rectangle
      size: [5, 6]
      pixels: 30
      position_top_left: [2, 8]
      role: prototype
    - color: magenta (6)
      type: rectangle
      size: [3, 2]
      pixels: 6
      position_top_left: [10, 12]
      role: seed (replace)
    - color: green (3)
      type: U-shape
      pixels: 12 # approx, counting green only
      position_top_left: [3, 1] # Top-left of bounding box
      bounding_box_size: [4, 4]
      role: prototype
    - color: green (3)
      type: pixel
      size: [1, 1]
      pixels: 1
      position_top_left: [9, 2]
      role: seed (replace)
    - color: green (3)
      type: pixel
      size: [1, 1]
      pixels: 1
      position_top_left: [12, 7]
      role: seed (replace)
    - color: yellow (4)
      type: square
      size: [2, 2]
      pixels: 4
      position_top_left: [4, 2]
      role: part_of_green_prototype_pattern (no independent role)
  output_description:
    - Magenta object at (10,12) is replaced. Magenta object at (0,3) is kept.
    - Replacement_rule_magenta: Object at (10,12) is replaced because its row (10) > prototype's row (2). Object at (0,3) is kept because its row (0) < prototype's row (2).
    - Copied_pattern_magenta: 5x6 magenta rectangle from bounding box of prototype at (2,8).
    - Placement_magenta: Copied pattern starts at (10,12).
    - Single green pixels at (9,2) and (12,7) are replaced.
    - Replacement_rule_green: They are replaced because their rows (9 and 12) > prototype's row (3).
    - Copied_pattern_green: The 4x4 pattern within the bounding box of the green U-shape prototype (including the yellow square).
    - Placement_green: Copied pattern starts at (9,2) and (12,7) respectively.
