            "text": "## Perception of Task Elements\n\nThe task involves identifying patterns within a grid and replicating them based on certain criteria. Each grid contains a background (white) and several distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. For each color present, there appears to be a primary \"prototype\" object, typically the largest one of that color. Other, smaller objects of the same color act as \"seeds\" or placeholders. The transformation involves copying the pattern associated with the prototype object onto the locations of specific seed objects. The key is to determine which objects are prototypes and which are seeds to be replaced.\n\nObservations across examples:\n1.  **Object Identification**: Objects are contiguous blocks of a single color.\n2.  **Prototype Identification**: For each color present, the object with the largest area (number of pixels) seems to serve as the prototype.\n3.  **Pattern Definition**: The pattern to be copied is the content within the bounding box of the prototype object. This pattern may include multiple colors if they fall within that bounding box (as seen with the green/yellow shape in example 2).\n4.  **Seed Identification & Replacement Rule**: Other objects of the same color as the prototype are considered potential seeds. A seed object is replaced by the prototype's pattern if its top-left corner is positioned *after* the prototype's top-left corner in reading order (either lower row, or same row but greater column index).\n5.  **Placement**: The copied pattern's top-left corner aligns with the original seed object's top-left corner.\n6.  **Overwriting**: The copying process overwrites existing pixels in the target area.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

If a `Seed Component` needs replacement, overwrite the area in the output grid starting at `(seed_r, seed_c)` with the `Pattern To Copy`. Ensure the copy respects the grid boundaries.\n4.
