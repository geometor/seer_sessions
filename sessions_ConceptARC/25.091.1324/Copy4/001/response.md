"""
Identify all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color) for each non-background color.
For each color, if there are multiple objects, find the largest one (by pixel count, breaking ties with top-left position) as the prototype.
Extract the pattern within the bounding box of the prototype.
Find all other objects (seeds) of the same color whose top-left corner comes *after* the prototype's top-left corner in reading order (row-major).
Replace each such seed object by pasting the prototype's pattern, aligning the top-left corner of the pattern with the top-left corner of the seed.
