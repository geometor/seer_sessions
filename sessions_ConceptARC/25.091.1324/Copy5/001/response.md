Transforms the input grid based on a signal color (blue=1) indicating repetition.

The transformation rule involves identifying a 'payload' region and a 'signal' region
(containing blue=1 pixels) within the input grid. The relative position of these
regions determines the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the transformation.

1. Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2. Determine Orientation and Payload:
   - If the minimum column index of any blue pixel (`min_c`) is greater than 0, AND the region of the grid to the left of this column (`grid[:, :min_c]`) contains NO blue pixels, then the orientation is 'horizontal'. The payload is this left region (`grid[:, :min_c]`).
   - Otherwise, if the minimum row index of any blue pixel (`min_r`) is greater than 0, AND the region of the grid above this row (`grid[:min_r, :]`) contains NO blue pixels, then the orientation is 'vertical'. The payload is this top region (`grid[:min_r, :]`).
   - If neither condition is met, the input format is unexpected.
3. Count the total number of blue pixels found (N).
4. Calculate the number of times the payload should be repeated: R = N + 1.
5. Define a Separator:
   - If orientation is 'horizontal', the separator is a single column of white (0) pixels with the same height as the payload.
   - If orientation is 'vertical', the separator is a single row of white (0) pixels with the same width as the payload.
6. Construct the Output Grid:
   - Create the output by concatenating R copies of the payload grid.
   - Insert R-1 copies of the separator grid between adjacent payload copies.
   - The concatenation is performed horizontally (`hstack`) or vertically (`vstack`) based on the determined orientation.
