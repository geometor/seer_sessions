The relative position of these\nregions determines the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the transformation.\n\n1. Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n2. Determine Orientation and Payload:\n   - If the minimum column index of any blue pixel (`min_c`) is greater than 0, AND the region of the grid to the left of this column (`grid[:, :min_c]`) contains NO blue pixels, then the orientation is 'horizontal'. The payload is this left region (`grid[:, :min_c]`).\n   - Otherwise, if the minimum row index of any blue pixel (`min_r`) is greater than 0, AND the region of the grid above this row (`grid[:min_r, :]`) contains NO blue pixels, then the orientation is 'vertical'. The payload is this top region (`grid[:min_r, :]`).\n   - If neither condition is met, the input format is unexpected.\n3. Count the total number of blue pixels found (N).\n4. Calculate the number of times the payload should be repeated: R = N + 1.\n5. Define a Separator:\n   - If orientation is 'horizontal', the separator is a single column of white (0) pixels with the same height as the payload.\n   - If orientation is 'vertical', the separator is a single row of white (0) pixels with the same width as the payload.\n6. Construct the Output Grid:\n   - Create the output by concatenating R copies of the payload grid.\n   - Insert R-1 copies of the separator grid between adjacent payload copies.\n   - The concatenation is performed horizontally (`hstack`) or vertically (`vstack`) based on the determined orientation.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for efficient processing\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    signal_color = 1      # Blue pixels act as the signal\n    separator_color = 0   # White pixels are used for separators\n\n    # Find coordinates of all signal pixels (blue=1)\n    signal_coords = np.argwhere(grid == signal_color)\n\n    # If no signal pixels are found, return the original grid (or handle as error)\n    # Based on ARC task structure, assume signal pixels are always present in valid inputs.\n    if signal_coords.shape[0] == 0:\n        # No signal found, maybe return input or specific error state\n        # For now, returning input grid.\n        # print(\"Warning: No signal pixels (1) found in the input grid.\")\n        return input_grid\n\n    # Count the number of signal pixels (N) to determine repetitions (R = N + 1)\n    num_signal_pixels = signal_coords.shape[0]\n    repetitions ="
