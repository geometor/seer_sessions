task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes: [input, output, 2D, colored_pixels]
  - element: pixel
    attributes: [color_value_0_to_9]
  - element: signal_pixels
    value: 1 # Blue
    role: control_information
    properties:
      - count (N): Determines repetition frequency.
      - location: Defines the payload boundary (left/top) and repetition orientation (horizontal/vertical).
  - element: payload_grid
    description: The sub-grid identified for repetition. It's the portion of the input grid spatially distinct from the signal_pixels (either to the left or above).
    attributes: [sub_grid, variable_color, variable_shape]
  - element: separator
    value: 0 # White
    role: delimiter_between_repetitions
    properties:
      - shape: Either a single column (height of payload) or a single row (width of payload).
      - orientation: Matches the repetition direction.
actions:
  - action: identify_signal
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [signal_pixels_location, signal_pixels_count (N), repetition_orientation]
    criteria: Find blue (1) pixels. Determine their collective bounding box and location relative to the rest of the grid content.
  - action: identify_payload
    inputs: [input_grid, signal_pixels_location]
    outputs: [payload_grid]
    criteria: Extract the sub-grid that does not contain the signal pixels (based on location - left or above).
  - action: determine_repetition_count
    inputs: [signal_pixels_count (N), repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [total_repetitions (R)]
    logic: If orientation is horizontal, R = N + 1. If orientation is vertical, R = N.
  - action: determine_separator
    inputs: [payload_grid, repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [separator_grid]
    logic: Create a grid of white (0) pixels. If orientation is horizontal, separator is a column with payload's height. If orientation is vertical, separator is a row with payload's width.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: [payload_grid, separator_grid, total_repetitions (R), repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    logic: Concatenate R copies of the payload_grid, interleaved with R-1 copies of the separator_grid, either horizontally or vertically based on orientation.
relationships:
  - relationship: spatial_separation
    between: [payload_grid, signal_pixels]
    description: The payload and signal pixels occupy distinct regions of the input grid (e.g., payload left, signal right; payload top, signal bottom).
  - relationship: control
    subject: signal_pixels
    object: output_grid_structure
    description: The count and arrangement of signal pixels dictate the repetition count, direction, and separation pattern in the output.
