            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The output grids are generally larger than the input grids, suggesting repetition or expansion.\n2.  **Key Colors:** Blue (1) and White (0) seem to play special roles. Blue pixels appear to act as signals or instructions, while white pixels are used as separators in the output. Other colors (Yellow 4, Green 3, Magenta 6) form the primary content or 'payload' that gets manipulated.\n3.  **Core Operation:** The central operation is the repetition of a specific part of the input grid (the 'payload').\n4.  **Signal Identification:** The blue pixels (1) seem to indicate:\n    *   Which part of the grid is the payload (the part *not* containing the blue pixels).\n    *   The number of times the payload should be repeated.\n    *   The direction (horizontal or vertical) of repetition.\n5.  **Repetition Logic:**\n    *   The number of repetitions seems linked to the count (N) of blue pixels. If the blue pixels indicate horizontal repetition, the payload is repeated N+1 times. If they indicate vertical repetition, the payload is repeated N times.\n    *   The orientation of the blue signal pixels (forming a predominantly horizontal or vertical pattern/location) determines the direction of repetition. Blue pixels located to the right of the payload signal horizontal repetition. Blue pixels located below the payload signal vertical repetition.\n6.  **Separator:** A separator pattern (a column or row of white pixels) is inserted between the repeated copies of the payload in the output. The separator's orientation matches the repetition direction (white column for horizontal, white row for vertical).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
