**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels. The output grids are generally larger than the input grids, suggesting repetition or expansion.
2.  **Key Colors:** Blue (1) and White (0) seem to play special roles. Blue pixels appear to act as signals or instructions, while white pixels are used as separators in the output. Other colors (Yellow 4, Green 3, Magenta 6) form the primary content or 'payload' that gets manipulated.
3.  **Core Operation:** The central operation is the repetition of a specific part of the input grid (the 'payload').
4.  **Signal Identification:** The blue pixels (1) seem to indicate:
    *   Which part of the grid is the payload (the part *not* containing the blue pixels).
    *   The number of times the payload should be repeated.
    *   The direction (horizontal or vertical) of repetition.
5.  **Repetition Logic:**
    *   The number of repetitions seems linked to the count (N) of blue pixels. If the blue pixels indicate horizontal repetition, the payload is repeated N+1 times. If they indicate vertical repetition, the payload is repeated N times.
    *   The orientation of the blue signal pixels (forming a predominantly horizontal or vertical pattern/location) determines the direction of repetition. Blue pixels located to the right of the payload signal horizontal repetition. Blue pixels located below the payload signal vertical repetition.
6.  **Separator:** A separator pattern (a column or row of white pixels) is inserted between the repeated copies of the payload in the output. The separator's orientation matches the repetition direction (white column for horizontal, white row for vertical).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes: [input, output, 2D, colored_pixels]
  - element: pixel
    attributes: [color_value_0_to_9]
  - element: signal_pixels
    value: 1 # Blue
    role: control_information
    properties:
      - count (N): Determines repetition frequency.
      - location: Defines the payload boundary (left/top) and repetition orientation (horizontal/vertical).
  - element: payload_grid
    description: The sub-grid identified for repetition. It's the portion of the input grid spatially distinct from the signal_pixels (either to the left or above).
    attributes: [sub_grid, variable_color, variable_shape]
  - element: separator
    value: 0 # White
    role: delimiter_between_repetitions
    properties:
      - shape: Either a single column (height of payload) or a single row (width of payload).
      - orientation: Matches the repetition direction.
actions:
  - action: identify_signal
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [signal_pixels_location, signal_pixels_count (N), repetition_orientation]
    criteria: Find blue (1) pixels. Determine their collective bounding box and location relative to the rest of the grid content.
  - action: identify_payload
    inputs: [input_grid, signal_pixels_location]
    outputs: [payload_grid]
    criteria: Extract the sub-grid that does not contain the signal pixels (based on location - left or above).
  - action: determine_repetition_count
    inputs: [signal_pixels_count (N), repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [total_repetitions (R)]
    logic: If orientation is horizontal, R = N + 1. If orientation is vertical, R = N.
  - action: determine_separator
    inputs: [payload_grid, repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [separator_grid]
    logic: Create a grid of white (0) pixels. If orientation is horizontal, separator is a column with payload's height. If orientation is vertical, separator is a row with payload's width.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: [payload_grid, separator_grid, total_repetitions (R), repetition_orientation]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    logic: Concatenate R copies of the payload_grid, interleaved with R-1 copies of the separator_grid, either horizontally or vertically based on orientation.
relationships:
  - relationship: spatial_separation
    between: [payload_grid, signal_pixels]
    description: The payload and signal pixels occupy distinct regions of the input grid (e.g., payload left, signal right; payload top, signal bottom).
  - relationship: control
    subject: signal_pixels
    object: output_grid_structure
    description: The count and arrangement of signal pixels dictate the repetition count, direction, and separation pattern in the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan Input:** Examine the input grid to locate all blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Identify Signal Region and Orientation:** Determine the bounding box of the blue pixels.
    *   If the blue pixels are located primarily to the right side of the grid content (i.e., there's a clear block of non-blue content entirely to the left of the first column containing blue), identify the 'payload' as the sub-grid to the left of the blue signal region. The orientation is 'horizontal'.
    *   If the blue pixels are located primarily towards the bottom of the grid content (i.e., there's a clear block of non-blue content entirely above the first row containing blue), identify the 'payload' as the sub-grid above the blue signal region. The orientation is 'vertical'.
3.  **Count Signal Pixels:** Count the total number (N) of blue pixels found.
4.  **Calculate Repetitions:**
    *   If the orientation is 'horizontal', the number of repetitions (R) is N + 1.
    *   If the orientation is 'vertical', the number of repetitions (R) is N.
5.  **Define Separator:**
    *   If the orientation is 'horizontal', create a separator consisting of a single column of white (0) pixels, with the same height as the payload.
    *   If the orientation is 'vertical', create a separator consisting of a single row of white (0) pixels, with the same width as the payload.
6.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by arranging R copies of the payload, placing a copy of the separator between each adjacent pair of payload copies. The arrangement (concatenation) is done horizontally or vertically according to the determined orientation.
