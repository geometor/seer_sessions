This frame encloses an area of the white background.\n    *   The second object is a smaller, potentially multi-colored pattern or shape (a red/yellow diamond in `train_1`, a magenta/blue flower-like shape in `train_2`).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a copy-and-paste operation. The smaller 'content' object is copied.\n4.  **Placement:** The copied object is placed *inside* the hollow area of the frame object.\n5.  **Preservation:** Both original objects (the frame and the content object) remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid. The copied object retains the exact colors and structure of the original content object.\n6.  **Centering:** The placement of the copied object within the frame's interior appears to be centered both horizontally and vertically within the available white space.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine which object is the 'frame' by identifying the one that encloses a rectangular area of white pixels. Record the color of the frame and the coordinates of the enclosed white area (inner bounding box).\n3.  Identify the other object as the 'content' object. Record its pattern and colors relative to its own bounding box.\n4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n5.  Calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the content object and the inner bounding box of the frame.\n6.  Calculate the top-left starting coordinates (row, column) to place the content object such that it is centered within the frame's inner bounding box. This is done by finding the center of the inner box and offsetting by half the dimensions of the content object (integer division, effectively rounding towards top-left if centering is imperfect).\n7.  Iterate through the pixels of the content object (relative to its bounding box). For each non-white pixel in the content object, copy its color to the corresponding position in the output grid, offset by the calculated starting coordinates determined in step 6."
