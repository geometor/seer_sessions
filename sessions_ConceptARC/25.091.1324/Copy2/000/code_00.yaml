      relationships:

    output:
      actions:

          placement: centered

        - object: content # Unchanged
        - object: copied_content # Added inside frame

          location: [(7, 8), (11, 12)]

general_rules:
  - Find two distinct non-background objects.
  - One object is a 'frame' enclosing a background (white) area.
  - The other object is the 'content'.
  - The transformation copies the 'content' object.
  - The copy is placed centered within the background area enclosed by the 'frame'.
  - Original objects remain in place.
