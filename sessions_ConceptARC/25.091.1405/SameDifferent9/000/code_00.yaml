Task: Recolor two shapes based on pixel count comparison.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Background_Color: Always white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Two distinct, non-overlapping, hollow rectangular shapes.
    - Object_1_Color: Yellow (4).
    - Object_2_Color: Orange (7).
    - Properties:
      - Position: Variable.
      - Size: Variable (number of colored pixels).
      - Shape: Hollow rectangle.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background_Color: Preserved white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Same two shapes as input (position and structure preserved).
    - Color: All pixels originally yellow (4) or orange (7) are changed to a single new color.
      - New_Color_Option_1: Azure (8).
      - New_Color_Option_2: Gray (5).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify all pixels with color yellow (4).
  - Identify all pixels with color orange (7).
  - Count the number of yellow pixels (Count_Yellow).
  - Count the number of orange pixels (Count_Orange).
  - Condition: Compare Count_Yellow and Count_Orange.
    - If Count_Yellow equals Count_Orange:
      - Action: Change all yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels to azure (8).
    - If Count_Yellow does not equal Count_Orange:
      - Action: Change all yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels to gray (5).
  - Preserve all background (0) pixels.
