The background remains white (color 0). The positions and shapes of the rectangles are preserved.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of all yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels to a single new color. The background pixels (0) are unchanged.\n5.  **Color Change Rule:** The target color depends on the relative number of pixels composing the yellow and orange rectangles:\n    *   If the number of yellow pixels is equal to the number of orange pixels, both shapes are colored azure (color 8) in the output.\n    *   If the number of yellow pixels is *not* equal to the number of orange pixels, both shapes are colored gray (color 5) in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
