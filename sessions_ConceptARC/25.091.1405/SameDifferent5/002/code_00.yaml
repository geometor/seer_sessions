task_type: analysis
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9). White (0) is the background color.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_background: True if color is 0 (white).
      - neighbors: The four pixels cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right).
  - type: inner_pixel
    description: A pixel that is not background (color != 0) and whose four cardinal neighbors are all within the grid boundaries and are also not background (color != 0).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the inner pixel.
  - type: inner_color_list
    description: A collection of the colors of all inner_pixels found in the grid.
  - type: color_frequency
    description: The count of occurrences for each unique color within the inner_color_list.
  - type: output_value
    description: A single digit (0-9) representing a color.
relationships:
  - The output_value corresponds to the color that appears most frequently (the mode) in the inner_color_list. If there are ties for the most frequent color, any of the tied colors is acceptable (the examples suggest picking one, potentially the smallest value, although this isn't explicitly confirmed as a general rule).
actions:
  - Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
  - For a given pixel, check if its color is non-white (not 0).
  - If non-white, check its four cardinal neighbors.
  - Determine if all four neighbors are within grid bounds and are also non-white.
  - If both conditions are met, classify the pixel as an inner_pixel and record its color.
  - Collect all recorded inner_pixel colors into the inner_color_list.
  - Calculate the frequency of each color in the inner_color_list.
  - Identify the color(s) with the highest frequency.
  - Select one of the most frequent colors as the output_value.
