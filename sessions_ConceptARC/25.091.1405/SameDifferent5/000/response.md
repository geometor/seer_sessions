*   **Perception:** The input is a grid containing multiple distinct shapes or objects, often composed of a primary "boundary" color and a secondary "inner" or "center" color. The background is typically white (0). The output is always a single digit, which corresponds to one of the colors present in the input grid. The task seems to involve analyzing the properties of the objects, specifically their inner colors, and determining which inner color is the most common across all objects in the grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: analysis
    elements:
      - type: grid
        description: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
      - type: object
        description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - boundary_color: The primary color forming the outer part of the object.
          - inner_color: A color different from the boundary_color, located inside the object. Not all objects have an inner_color.
      - type: color_count
        description: Frequency of occurrence for each inner_color across all objects in the grid.
      - type: output_value
        description: A single digit (0-9) representing a color.
    relationships:
      - The output_value corresponds to the inner_color that appears most frequently among all objects in the input grid.
    actions:
      - Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
      - For each object, determine its boundary_color and, if present, its inner_color.
      - Count the occurrences of each unique inner_color found.
      - Identify the inner_color with the highest count.
      - Output the digit corresponding to the most frequent inner_color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all separate objects (contiguous groups of non-white pixels).
    2.  For each identified object:
        a.  Determine its main boundary color.
        b.  Check if there are any pixels inside the object (surrounded by the boundary color) that have a different color. This is the object's "inner color". Note that an object might not have an inner color, or it might have multiple pixels of the same inner color.
        c.  If an inner color exists, record it.
    3.  Create a list of all inner colors found across all objects in the grid.
    4.  Count the frequency of each unique color in this list.
    5.  Find the color that has the highest frequency (the mode).
    6.  The output is the single digit representing this most frequent inner color.
