White (color 0) serves as the background.\n2.  **Object Property - Solid Rectangle:** Each identified object can be characterized by whether it forms a \"solid rectangle\". A solid rectangle is an object whose pixels exactly fill its minimum bounding box (i.e., the number of pixels in the object equals the product of the height and width of its bounding box). Objects that do not meet this criterion (having internal holes relative to their bounding box, or having an irregular shape) are considered \"non-solid\".\n3.  **Classification and Counting:** All objects in the input grid are classified as either \"solid\" or \"non-solid\". The total count of solid objects (N_solid) and non-solid objects (N_non_solid) is determined.\n4.  **Conditional Filtering Rule:** The core transformation logic depends on comparing N_solid and N_non_solid:\n    *   If the number of solid objects is strictly greater than the number of non-solid objects (N_solid > N_non_solid), then *only the non-solid objects* are kept in the output grid. All solid objects are removed.\n    *   If the number of non-solid objects is strictly greater than the number of solid objects (N_non_solid > N_solid), then *only the non-solid objects* are kept in the output grid. All solid objects are removed.\n    *   If the number of solid objects is equal to the number of non-solid objects (N_solid == N_non_solid), then *only the solid objects* are kept in the output grid. All non-solid objects are removed.\n5.  **Output Generation:** The output grid is generated by starting with a white background grid of the same dimensions as the input. The pixels corresponding to the objects designated to be \"kept\" by the conditional rule are then copied from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original colors and positions. Pixels corresponding to \"removed\" objects become white (0) in the output.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (train_2):**\n*   Input Objects: Magenta block (Solid), Yellow block (Solid), Yellow shape (Non-solid), Red shape (Non-solid), Orange block (Solid).\n*   Counts: N_solid = 3, N_non_solid = 2.\n*   Condition: N_solid > N_non_solid.\n*   Rule: Keep Non-Solid objects.\n*   Output: Yellow shape and Red shape are retained; others are removed (replaced with white).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
