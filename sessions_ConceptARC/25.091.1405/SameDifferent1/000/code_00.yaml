# Overall Task Description: Filter objects based on whether they form solid rectangles,
# conditional on the relative counts of solid vs. non-solid objects.

# Definitions:
- object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color (using orthogonal adjacency).
- background_color: white (0).
- bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
- is_solid: A boolean property of an object. True if the number of pixels in the object equals the height * width of its bounding_box. False otherwise.

# Global Properties (Input Analysis):
- N_solid: The total count of objects where is_solid is True.
- N_non_solid: The total count of objects where is_solid is False.

# Transformation Rule (Conditional Filtering):
- condition_1: N_solid > N_non_solid
  - action: Keep only objects where is_solid is False. Remove objects where is_solid is True.
- condition_2: N_non_solid > N_solid
  - action: Keep only objects where is_solid is False. Remove objects where is_solid is True.
- condition_3: N_solid == N_non_solid
  - action: Keep only objects where is_solid is True. Remove objects where is_solid is False.

# Output Generation:
- Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background_color.
- For each object identified in the input:
  - Apply the conditional filtering rule based on N_solid and N_non_solid.
  - If the object is designated to be kept, copy its pixels (color and position) from the input grid to the output grid.
