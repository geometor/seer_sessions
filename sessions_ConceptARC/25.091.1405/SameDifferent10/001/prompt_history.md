Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Separator:** Each input grid contains a single, continuous vertical line of gray pixels (color 5). This line perfectly bisects the grid horizontally if the grid width is odd, or lies between two central columns if the width is even. It acts as a central axis or separator.
2.  **Symmetry/Comparison:** The core task seems to involve comparing the patterns of non-white pixels on the left side of the gray line with the patterns on the right side.
3.  **Conditional Modification:** The output depends on the result of this comparison.
    *   If the patterns on both sides of the gray line are identical (perfectly mirrored across the gray line), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
    *   If the patterns on the two sides are different in any way (different colors, shapes, positions relative to the gray line), the output grid retains the left side and the gray line, but all pixels to the right of the gray line are replaced with white pixels (color 0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - object: separator
    type: vertical line
    color: gray (5)
    position: central column(s)
    function: divides grid into left and right sections
  - object: left_pattern
    type: collection of non-white pixels/shapes
    location: columns to the left of the separator
  - object: right_pattern
    type: collection of non-white pixels/shapes
    location: columns to the right of the separator
properties:
  - grid_width: varies
  - grid_height: varies
  - separator_column_index: calculated based on grid width and gray pixel location
relationships:
  - comparison: left_pattern is compared to right_pattern for identity (mirror symmetry across the separator)
actions:
  - identify_separator: locate the column(s) containing only gray pixels.
  - extract_sides: isolate the subgrids representing the left_pattern and right_pattern.
  - compare_sides: check if the left_pattern subgrid is identical to the right_pattern subgrid.
  - conditional_output:
    - if identical: output the original input grid.
    - if different: output a modified grid where the right_pattern area is replaced with white (0), keeping the left_pattern and the separator.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels; determine its column index (`sep_col`).
2.  Extract the portion of the grid to the left of the gray line (columns `0` to `sep_col - 1`). Call this `left_side`.
3.  Extract the portion of the grid to the right of the gray line (columns `sep_col + 1` to the end). Call this `right_side`.
4.  Compare `left_side` and `right_side`.
5.  If `left_side` is identical to `right_side` (pixel by pixel), then the output is the original input grid.
6.  If `left_side` is *not* identical to `right_side`, then create the output grid by taking the original input grid and replacing all pixels in the columns to the right of the gray line (columns `sep_col + 1` onwards) with white (0) pixels. Keep the left side and the gray line unchanged.
