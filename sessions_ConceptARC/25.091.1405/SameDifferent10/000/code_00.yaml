elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - object: separator
    type: vertical line
    color: gray (5)
    position: central column(s)
    function: divides grid into left and right sections
  - object: left_pattern
    type: collection of non-white pixels/shapes
    location: columns to the left of the separator
  - object: right_pattern
    type: collection of non-white pixels/shapes
    location: columns to the right of the separator
properties:
  - grid_width: varies
  - grid_height: varies
  - separator_column_index: calculated based on grid width and gray pixel location
relationships:
  - comparison: left_pattern is compared to right_pattern for identity (mirror symmetry across the separator)
actions:
  - identify_separator: locate the column(s) containing only gray pixels.
  - extract_sides: isolate the subgrids representing the left_pattern and right_pattern.
  - compare_sides: check if the left_pattern subgrid is identical to the right_pattern subgrid.
  - conditional_output:
    - if identical: output the original input grid.
    - if different: output a modified grid where the right_pattern area is replaced with white (0), keeping the left_pattern and the separator.
