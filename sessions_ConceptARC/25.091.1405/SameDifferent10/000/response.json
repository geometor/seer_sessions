This line perfectly bisects the grid horizontally if the grid width is odd, or lies between two central columns if the width is even. It acts as a central axis or separator.\n2.  **Symmetry/Comparison:** The core task seems to involve comparing the patterns of non-white pixels on the left side of the gray line with the patterns on the right side.\n3.  **Conditional Modification:** The output depends on the result of this comparison.\n    *   If the patterns on both sides of the gray line are identical (perfectly mirrored across the gray line), the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n    *   If the patterns on the two sides are different in any way (different colors, shapes, positions relative to the gray line), the output grid retains the left side and the gray line, but all pixels to the right of the gray line are replaced with white pixels (color 0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Extract the portion of the grid to the left of the gray line (columns `0` to `sep_col - 1`). Call this `left_side`.\n3.  Extract the portion of the grid to the right of the gray line (columns `sep_col + 1` to the end). Call this `right_side`.\n4.  Compare `left_side` and `right_side`.\n5.  If `left_side` is identical to `right_side` (pixel by pixel), then the output is the original input grid.\n6.  If `left_side` is *not* identical to `right_side`, then create the output grid by taking the original input grid and replacing all pixels in the columns to the right of the gray line (columns `sep_col + 1` onwards) with white (0) pixels. Keep the left side and the gray line unchanged."
