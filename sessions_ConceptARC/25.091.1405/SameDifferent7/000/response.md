Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct "objects". These objects are contiguous regions of non-white pixels, separated by white (0) background pixels.
2.  **Object Composition:** Each object appears to be composed of exactly two colors:
    *   An "outer" or "border" color that forms the perimeter of the object.
    *   An "inner" or "content" color that fills the space inside the border.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are mostly white (0), containing only the "inner" parts of *some* of the objects from the input grid, placed in their original positions.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to identify which objects in the input have their inner content preserved in the output and extract only that inner content.

## Identifying the Rule

By comparing the objects whose inner content is kept versus those whose inner content is discarded, we need to find the discriminating property.

Let's define:
*   **Object:** A connected component of non-white pixels.
*   **Border Color (C_border):** The color of the object's pixels that are adjacent (including diagonally) to the white background (0) or the grid edge. Assume each object has only one border color.
*   **Inner Pixels (P_inner):** The pixels within the object that are *not* the border color.
*   **Inner Color (C_inner):** The color of the inner pixels. Assume each object has only one inner color.

Now, let's test conditions for keeping the inner pixels (P_inner):

*   **Condition 1: Enclosure.** Are the inner pixels fully enclosed, cardinally, by the border pixels? Meaning, can you draw a path using only up, down, left, right steps from any inner pixel to the grid edge *without* passing through a border pixel?
    *   Kept Objects (Pass Enclosure): (4,3), (6,8) [Ex1]; (1,6), (7,3) [Ex2]; (5,4), (7,8) [Ex3]
    *   Discarded Objects (Fail Enclosure): (7,4) [Ex1]; (9,4), (3,1) [Ex2]
    *   Discarded Objects (Pass Enclosure): (3,2) [Ex1]; (6,3) [Ex3]
    *   *Conclusion:* Passing the enclosure test is necessary but not sufficient. We need another condition to filter out (3,2) and (6,3).

*   **Condition 2: Border Intrusion into Inner Bounding Box.** Consider the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains all the inner pixels (P_inner). Does this bounding box contain *any* pixels of the border color (C_border)?
    *   Kept Objects (Pass Enclosure AND Border Intrusion):
        *   (4,3) [Ex1]: Inner='+' shape. Bbox 3x3. Contains border pixels (4). -> Keep.
        *   (6,8) [Ex1]: Inner=square-corners. Bbox
