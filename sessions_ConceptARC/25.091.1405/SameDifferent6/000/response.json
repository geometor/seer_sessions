An enclosed pixel is one whose eight neighbors (including diagonals) are all part of the surrounding object.\n    *   The transformation rule involves selectively removing *all* objects of a specific color based on a condition applied to the entire grid's set of objects.\n    *   There appear to be two distinct conditions for removal:\n        1.  If *any* object in the input grid encloses a pixel of a different color, the objects to be removed are those whose color is the *minimum* numerical value among all colors of enclosing objects.\n        2.  If *no* object in the input grid encloses a pixel of a different color, the objects to be removed are those whose color appears most frequently (i.e., there are more distinct objects of that color than any other color).\n    *   Removing an object means replacing all its pixels with the background color (white, 0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
