The transformation selectively removes some of these shapes based on their orientation (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). By comparing the input and output grids in the examples, it appears that the orientation present in the majority of the shapes is identified, and all shapes *not* matching that majority orientation are removed (turned white).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Use a method like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all connected pixels of the same color for each object, ensuring each pixel is assigned to only one object.\n    2.  For each identified object, determine its orientation:\n        *   If all pixels in the object have the same row coordinate, classify it as \"Horizontal\".\n        *   If all pixels in the object have the same column coordinate, classify it as \"Vertical\".\n        *   Otherwise (if neither of the above conditions is met), classify it as \"Diagonal\".\n    3.  Count how many objects fall into each orientation category (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal).\n    4.  Identify the \"majority orientation\" - the orientation category with the highest count of objects. (Assume there will be a unique majority based on the examples).\n    5.  Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. This will become the output grid.\n    6.  Iterate through all the objects identified in step 1.\n    7.  For each object, compare its orientation (determined in step 2) to the majority orientation (determined in step 4).\n    8.  If an object's orientation is *different* from the majority orientation, change the color of all pixels belonging to that object to white (0) in the output grid.\n    9.  The final state of the modified grid is the result of the transformation."
