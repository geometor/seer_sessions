task_description: Extract a frame defined by a specific color and create a minimal grid containing only that frame on a white background.

elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - Contains multiple colors.
      - Has a background color (white/0).
      - Contains primary object shapes of one color.
      - Contains frame/border elements of another color ('frame_color').
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - Contains only two colors: the 'frame_color' and the background color (white/0).
      - Dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the 'frame_color' pixels in the input.
      - Represents the isolated frame structure from the input.

relationships:
  - type: color_identification
    description: The 'frame_color' in the input is the non-background color with the minimum count of pixels.
  - type: extraction
    description: All pixels matching the 'frame_color' are identified in the input grid.
  - type: bounding_box
    description: The minimum row/column and maximum row/column containing any 'frame_color' pixel define a bounding box.
  - type: construction
    description: The output grid's dimensions match the size of the bounding box.
  - type: placement
    description: The 'frame_color' pixels are transferred from the input to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box. The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color (white/0).

example_specifics:
  - example: train_1
    input_colors: white(0), red(2), green(3)
    frame_color: green(3) (17 pixels vs 48 red pixels)
    input_frame_pixels_bounding_box: rows 0-4, columns 4-8 (size 5x5)
    output: 5x5 grid containing only green(3) pixels from input (relative to box origin) on a white(0) background.
  - example: train_2
    input_colors: white(0), green(3), magenta(6)
    frame_color: magenta(6) (16 pixels vs 48 green pixels)
    input_frame_pixels_bounding_box: rows 0-4, columns 0-4 (size 5x5)
    output: 5x5 grid containing only magenta(6) pixels from input (relative to box origin) on a white(0) background.
