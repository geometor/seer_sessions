Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects, primarily rectangular or frame-like shapes, drawn with different colors against a white background (color 0). There are typically two main non-background colors present.
2.  **Color Roles:** One color seems to form the primary shapes or objects (e.g., red 'boxes' in example 1, green 'boxes' in example 2). Another color forms lines or borders that separate or enclose these primary shapes (e.g., green lines in example 1, magenta lines/frame in example 2). Let's call the latter the "frame color".
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It consists of a single object: a hollow frame structure made of the "frame color" identified in the input, placed on a white background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve:
    *   Identifying the specific "frame color" in the input. This seems to be the non-background color with the fewest pixels.
    *   Extracting all pixels of this frame color from the input grid.
    *   Determining the minimum bounding box required to contain all these extracted frame pixels.
    *   Creating a new output grid sized according to this bounding box.
    *   Placing the extracted frame pixels into the output grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box, on a white background.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Extract a frame defined by a specific color and create a minimal grid containing only that frame on a white background.

elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - Contains multiple colors.
      - Has a background color (white/0).
      - Contains primary object shapes of one color.
      - Contains frame/border elements of another color ('frame_color').
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - Contains only two colors: the 'frame_color' and the background color (white/0).
      - Dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the 'frame_color' pixels in the input.
      - Represents the isolated frame structure from the input.

relationships:
  - type: color_identification
    description: The 'frame_color' in the input is the non-background color with the minimum count of pixels.
  - type: extraction
    description: All pixels matching the 'frame_color' are identified in the input grid.
  - type: bounding_box
    description: The minimum row/column and maximum row/column containing any 'frame_color' pixel define a bounding box.
  - type: construction
    description: The output grid's dimensions match the size of the bounding box.
  - type: placement
    description: The 'frame_color' pixels are transferred from the input to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box. The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color (white/0).

example_specifics:
  - example: train_1
    input_colors: white(0), red(2), green(3)
    frame_color: green(3) (17 pixels vs 48 red pixels)
    input_frame_pixels_bounding_box: rows 0-4, columns 4-8 (size 5x5)
    output: 5x5 grid containing only green(3) pixels from input (relative to box origin) on a white(0) background.
  - example: train_2
    input_colors: white(0), green(3), magenta(6)
    frame_color: magenta(6) (16 pixels vs 48 green pixels)
    input_frame_pixels_bounding_box: rows 0-4, columns 0-4 (size 5x5)
    output: 5x5 grid containing only magenta(6) pixels from input (relative to box origin) on a white(0) background.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid and count the occurrences (pixels) of each.
3.  Determine the "frame color" by selecting the non-background color that has the minimum pixel count.
4.  Create a list of the coordinates (row, column) for every pixel in the input grid that matches the identified "frame color".
5.  If no "frame color" pixels are found, return an empty or minimal grid (e.g., 1x1 white).
6.  Calculate the minimum bounding box enclosing all the identified frame pixel coordinates: find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`).
7.  Calculate the height (`h = max_r - min_r + 1`) and width (`w = max_c - min_c + 1`) of the bounding box.
8.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `h` x `w`.
9.  Initialize all cells of the output grid with the background color (white/0).
10. Iterate through the list of frame pixel coordinates identified in step 4. For each input coordinate (`r`, `c`):
    *   Calculate the corresponding coordinate in the output grid: `out_r = r - min_r`, `out_c = c - min_c`.
    *   Set the pixel at (`out_r`, `out_c`) in the output grid to the "frame color".
11. Return the generated output grid.
