There are typically two main non-background colors present.\n2.  **Color Roles:** One color seems to form the primary shapes or objects (e.g., red 'boxes' in example 1, green 'boxes' in example 2). Another color forms lines or borders that separate or enclose these primary shapes (e.g., green lines in example 1, magenta lines/frame in example 2). Let's call the latter the \"frame color\".\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It consists of a single object: a hollow frame structure made of the \"frame color\" identified in the input, placed on a white background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve:\n    *   Identifying the specific \"frame color\" in the input. This seems to be the non-background color with the fewest pixels.\n    *   Extracting all pixels of this frame color from the input grid.\n    *   Determining the minimum bounding box required to contain all these extracted frame pixels.\n    *   Creating a new output grid sized according to this bounding box.\n    *   Placing the extracted frame pixels into the output grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box, on a white background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
