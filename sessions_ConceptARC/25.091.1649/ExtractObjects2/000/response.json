            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid. The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid. Both grids contain pixels represented by integers (colors).\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use various colors. White (0) often acts as a background. Other colors (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Gray, Magenta, Orange, Azure, Maroon) form patterns or shapes.\n3.  **Patterns in Input:**\n    *   Example 1: Alternating horizontal Blue and White lines, with a sparse pattern of Green pixels mostly on the White lines.\n    *   Example 2: Various checkerboard/alternating patterns using Red, Yellow, Magenta, Azure, and Gray. A distinct rectangular shape made of Maroon pixels exists separately from these patterns.\n    *   Example 3: Alternating Yellow pixel patterns. A distinct 'T' shape made of Magenta pixels exists.\n4.  **Content of Output:**\n    *   Example 1: Contains only Green pixels and White pixels, arranged in the same relative configuration as the Green pixels in the input, cropped to their bounding box.\n    *   Example 2: Contains only Maroon pixels and White pixels, forming the same hollow rectangle shape as in the input, cropped to its bounding box.\n    *   Example 3: Contains only Magenta pixels and White pixels, forming the 'T' shape from the input, cropped to its bounding box.\n5.  **Key Observation:** In each case, the output seems to isolate a specific \"figure\" or \"object\" from the input grid, discarding the \"background\" patterns. This figure is defined by a single non-white color. The output grid represents the smallest bounding box around this figure in the input, but only contains pixels of the figure's color (preserving their relative positions) and White pixels for everything else within that box.\n6.  **Identifying the Target Object/Color:** The crucial step is identifying which color's shape to extract.\n    *   In Ex 1, Green (3) is extracted. Blue (1) forms two distinct lines. Green forms one connected shape.\n    *   In Ex 2, Maroon (9) is extracted. All other non-white colors form multiple, small, repeating patterns/objects. Maroon forms one connected shape.\n    *   In Ex 3, Magenta (6) is extracted. Yellow (4) forms multiple small patterns/objects. Magenta forms one connected shape.\n    *   The rule appears to be: find the non-white color that forms exactly **one** contiguous object (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals) in the input grid. This color becomes the \"target color\".\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
