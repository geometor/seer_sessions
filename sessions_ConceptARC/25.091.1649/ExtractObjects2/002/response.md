## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core task: isolating a specific colored object, cropping it, and removing other colors. The function implemented this logic but failed on Example 2 because the initial rule for identifying the "target" object ("the unique non-white color that forms exactly one contiguous object") was ambiguous when multiple colors met this criterion.

The failure in Example 2 revealed that additional criteria are needed to uniquely identify the target object. Analysis showed that in all examples, the desired target object, besides being the *only* object of its color, also *does not touch the outer boundary* of the input grid. Other single objects (like Red, Gray, Azure in Example 2) *do* touch the boundary. Objects of colors forming multiple instances (like Blue in Ex 1, Yellow/Magenta in Ex 2, Yellow in Ex 3) often touch the boundary as well.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the rule for identifying the target object: it must be the *unique* non-white color that forms exactly one contiguous object (8-way adjacency) AND that single object does not touch any of the four outer edges of the input grid.
2.  Verify this refined rule against all examples using code execution to count objects and check boundary contact.
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this more precise identification criterion.
4.  The existing code structure (finding objects, calculating bounding box, creating output) remains largely valid, but the initial object selection loop needs modification to incorporate the boundary check.

## Metrics and Analysis

Using code execution to analyze object counts and boundary contact for each non-white color in the training examples:

**Summary of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Blue (1): 13 objects.
    *   Green (3): 1 object, does **not** touch boundary. --> **Target**
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Red (2): 1 object, touches boundary.
    *   Yellow (4): 3 objects.
    *   Gray (5): 1 object, touches boundary.
    *   Magenta (6): 3 objects.
    *   Azure (8): 1 object, touches boundary.
    *   Maroon (9): 1 object, does **not** touch boundary. --> **Target**
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Yellow (4): 5 objects.
    *   Magenta (6): 1 object, does **not** touch boundary. --> **Target**

The analysis confirms that the target color in each example is the one forming a single object that does not touch the grid boundaries.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
task_description: Extract a specific object from the input grid based on color, connectivity, and boundary non-contact properties. Crop the object to its bounding box, retaining only its color against a white background.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity is 8-way (includes diagonals).
  - background_pixel: A pixel with color white (0).
  - figure_pixel: A pixel belonging to the target object.
  - other_pixel: A non-white pixel that is not part of the target object.
  - grid_boundary: The set of pixels in the first or last row, or the first or last column of the input grid.
  - target_object: The single, contiguous object identified for extraction.
  - target_color: The color of the target_object.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of the target_object in the input grid.

selection_criteria:
  - criterion: Find all unique non-white colors in the input grid.
  - criterion: For each color, count the number of distinct, contiguous objects formed by pixels of that color.
  - criterion: For each color forming exactly one object, check if any pixel of that object lies on the grid_boundary.
  - criterion: The target_color is the unique color C such that:
      1. All pixels of color C form exactly one object.
      2. That single object does not contain any pixels on the grid_boundary.

transformation_steps:
  - step: Identify the target_color and the set of coordinates (pixels) belonging to the target_object based on the selection_criteria.
  - step: Determine the bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) enclosing all pixels of the target_object.
  - step: Create an output grid with dimensions derived from the bounding_box (height = max_row - min_row + 1, width = max_col - min_col + 1). Initialize all pixels to white (0).
  - step: Iterate through the coordinates (r, c) of the pixels belonging to the target_object.
  - step: For each target_object pixel at (r, c), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid at relative coordinates (r - min_row, c - min_col) to the target_color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each unique non-white color, find all separate contiguous objects formed by pixels of that color, using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). Record the count of objects for each color.
3.  For each color that forms exactly one object, determine if any pixel belonging to that object is located on the outermost border (first/last row or first/last column) of the input grid.
4.  Select the "target color" which is the unique color that satisfies both conditions: it forms exactly one object, AND that object does not touch the grid boundary. Also, retain the set of coordinates corresponding to the pixels of this target object.
5.  If no such unique color is found, the task cannot be solved according to the observed pattern (handle as error or default).
6.  Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) occupied by the pixels of the target object. This defines the bounding box.
7.  Create a new output grid with height `max_row - min_row + 1` and width `max_col - min_col + 1`. Initialize all its pixels to white (0).
8.  Iterate through the previously retained set of coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to the target object.
9.  For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the pixel in the output grid at position (`r - min_row`, `c - min_col`) to the `target_color`.
10. Return the completed output grid.
