**Perception of task elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of two colors: white (0) and one other dominant foreground color (red, magenta, yellow). The output grid is a solid rectangle filled with the dominant foreground color from the input.
2.  **Grid Pattern:** The input grids generally display a pattern of alternating rows: rows filled entirely with white and rows containing the foreground color.
3.  **Foreground Color Rows:** Rows containing the foreground color are often solid horizontal lines spanning the grid width. However, some of these rows contain interruptions where white pixels break the line, creating shorter segments of the foreground color.
4.  **Key Feature:** The critical feature appears to be the *shortest* contiguous horizontal segment (run) of the foreground color found anywhere in the input grid. The width of this shortest segment determines the width of the output grid.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the column range covered by such a shortest horizontal segment. It then looks vertically *within these columns only* to find the tallest contiguous block consisting solely of the foreground color. This tallest block becomes the output grid.
6.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the output grid is the same as the dominant foreground color in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Find the tallest solid block of the main color, constrained horizontally by the narrowest occurrence of that color.
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills some rows entirely and interrupts foreground color segments in others.
  - role: foreground
    color: variable (red(2), magenta(6), yellow(4) in examples)
    description: The dominant color forming horizontal segments, sometimes interrupted by the background color. Forms the entirety of the output grid.
  - role: segment
    property: horizontal contiguous run of foreground color pixels
    property: length (width)
    relationship: Multiple segments exist in the input grid.
  - role: shortest_segment
    property: segment with the minimum length among all segments.
    relationship: Defines the column range for the next step. Determines the width of the output.
  - role: target_column_range
    property: columns spanned by a shortest_segment.
    relationship: Restricts the vertical search area.
  - role: tallest_block
    property: The vertically largest contiguous block of foreground color pixels within the target_column_range.
    relationship: This block constitutes the final output grid. Determines the height of the output.
actions:
  - Identify background and foreground colors.
  - Scan input grid to find all horizontal segments of the foreground color.
  - Calculate the length of each segment.
  - Find the minimum segment length.
  - Identify the column range(s) corresponding to the minimum length segment(s).
  - Within one such column range, find the tallest contiguous vertical block of the foreground color.
  - Create the output grid as a copy of this tallest block.
output_properties:
  - shape: rectangle
  - content: solid fill of the input's foreground color
  - width: equal to the minimum horizontal segment length of the foreground color in the input
  - height: equal to the height of the tallest contiguous vertical block of the foreground color found within the columns defined by the minimum segment length
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the primary foreground color (the color other than white) present in the input grid.
2.  Examine all rows in the input grid. For each row, identify all continuous horizontal segments (runs) composed solely of the foreground color.
3.  Calculate the length (width) of every horizontal foreground color segment found across all rows.
4.  Find the minimum length among all these segments. Let this minimum length be `W`.
5.  Locate one of the segments that has this minimum length `W`. Determine the starting column index (`C_start`) and ending column index (`C_end`) of this specific segment.
6.  Focus on the vertical strip of the input grid defined by the columns from `C_start` to `C_end`.
7.  Within this vertical strip, identify all contiguous blocks of rows where every cell contains the foreground color.
8.  Find the block among these that has the greatest height (the tallest block).
9.  The output grid is a rectangle with width `W` and the height of the tallest block identified in the previous step, completely filled with the foreground color. This output grid corresponds precisely to the pixels of the tallest block found.
