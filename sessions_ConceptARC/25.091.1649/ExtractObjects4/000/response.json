The output grid is a solid rectangle filled with the dominant foreground color from the input.\n2.  **Grid Pattern:** The input grids generally display a pattern of alternating rows: rows filled entirely with white and rows containing the foreground color.\n3.  **Foreground Color Rows:** Rows containing the foreground color are often solid horizontal lines spanning the grid width. However, some of these rows contain interruptions where white pixels break the line, creating shorter segments of the foreground color.\n4.  **Key Feature:** The critical feature appears to be the *shortest* contiguous horizontal segment (run) of the foreground color found anywhere in the input grid. The width of this shortest segment determines the width of the output grid.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the column range covered by such a shortest horizontal segment. It then looks vertically *within these columns only* to find the tallest contiguous block consisting solely of the foreground color. This tallest block becomes the output grid.\n6.  **Color Preservation:** The color of the output grid is the same as the dominant foreground color in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Focus on the vertical strip of the input grid defined by the columns from `C_start` to `C_end`.\n7.  Within this vertical strip, identify all contiguous blocks of rows where every cell contains the foreground color.\n8.  Find the block among these that has the greatest height (the tallest block).\n9.
