task_description: Find the tallest solid block of the main color, constrained horizontally by the narrowest occurrence of that color.
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills some rows entirely and interrupts foreground color segments in others.
  - role: foreground
    color: variable (red(2), magenta(6), yellow(4) in examples)
    description: The dominant color forming horizontal segments, sometimes interrupted by the background color. Forms the entirety of the output grid.
  - role: segment
    property: horizontal contiguous run of foreground color pixels
    property: length (width)
    relationship: Multiple segments exist in the input grid.
  - role: shortest_segment
    property: segment with the minimum length among all segments.
    relationship: Defines the column range for the next step. Determines the width of the output.
  - role: target_column_range
    property: columns spanned by a shortest_segment.
    relationship: Restricts the vertical search area.
  - role: tallest_block
    property: The vertically largest contiguous block of foreground color pixels within the target_column_range.
    relationship: This block constitutes the final output grid. Determines the height of the output.
actions:
  - Identify background and foreground colors.
  - Scan input grid to find all horizontal segments of the foreground color.
  - Calculate the length of each segment.
  - Find the minimum segment length.
  - Identify the column range(s) corresponding to the minimum length segment(s).
  - Within one such column range, find the tallest contiguous vertical block of the foreground color.
  - Create the output grid as a copy of this tallest block.
output_properties:
  - shape: rectangle
  - content: solid fill of the input's foreground color
  - width: equal to the minimum horizontal segment length of the foreground color in the input
  - height: equal to the height of the tallest contiguous vertical block of the foreground color found within the columns defined by the minimum segment length
