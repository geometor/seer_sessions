However, it made two incorrect assumptions:\n1.  It assumed the output segments were always solid-colored rectangles.\n2.  It used an incorrect rule (`W+1`) for adjusting the width of the segment corresponding to the color with the maximum number of objects.\n\nThe comparison with expected outputs reveals two distinct behaviors:\n*   **Example 1:** The output segments preserve the *shape* of the largest object within its bounding box. The width is simply the bounding box width.\n*   **Example 2:** The output segments are *solid* rectangles. The width is doubled (`W*2`) for the color with the maximum object count, otherwise it's the bounding box width (`W`).\n\nThe strategy is to"
