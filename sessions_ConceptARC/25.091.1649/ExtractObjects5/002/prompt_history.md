Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a grid containing scattered pixels of various colors (1-9) on a white background (0). These non-white pixels sometimes form contiguous shapes or patterns.
*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid composed of several solid-colored rectangles placed side-by-side horizontally.
*   **Relationship:** The colors of the rectangles in the output correspond to the non-white colors present in the input. The size and order of these rectangles seem related to the shapes formed by those colors in the input.

**Analysis of Transformation:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  **Analyze Objects:** For each unique color:
    *   Find all contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels) of that color.
    *   Count how many distinct objects exist for that color (`num_objects`).
    *   Identify the "largest" object (the one with the most pixels). If there's a tie in pixel count, prioritize the object whose top-left corner is highest (smallest row index), and then leftmost (smallest column index).
    *   Determine the bounding box of this largest object. Record its height (`H`) and width (`W`).
    *   Record the row and column index of the top-left corner (`r`, `col`) of this largest object.
3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The height of the output grid seems to be uniform and equal to the height (`H`) of the bounding boxes of the largest objects identified in step 2. (Both examples show consistent heights for the largest objects of each color within that example).
    *   The width of the rectangle for each color (`W_out`) depends on the bounding box width (`W`) of its largest object and the count of objects for that color (`num_objects`). Specifically, find the maximum object count (`max_num_objects`) among all colors present. If a color's `num_objects` equals `max_num_objects`, its output width `W_out = W + 1`. Otherwise, `W_out = W`.
4.  **Determine Order:** The order of the colored rectangles in the output grid is determined by the position of their corresponding largest objects in the input grid. Sort the colors based on the row index (`r`) of their largest object's top-left corner, then by the column index (`col`).
5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by horizontally concatenating solid rectangles for each color. The rectangles should have the common height (`H`) and their calculated individual widths (`W_out`), arranged according to the order determined in step 4.

**Example Walkthrough (train_2):**

*   **Colors:** Azure (8), Green (3), Blue (1), Orange (7).
*   **Objects & Properties:**
    *   Azure (8): Largest obj at (1,1), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 8.
    *   Green (3): Largest obj at (3,5), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 13.
    *   Blue (1): Largest obj at (3,13), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 7.
    *   Orange (7): Largest obj at (7,18), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 4.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Output Height `H_out` = 3 (consistent BB height).
    *   `max_num_objects` = 13 (Green).
    *   Azure width: W=3. num=8 != 13. `W_out` = 3.
    *   Green width: W=3. num=13 == 13. `W_out` = 3 + 1 = 4.
    *   Blue width: W=3. num=7 != 13. `W_out` = 3.
    *   Orange width: W=3. num=4 != 13. `W_out` = 3.
*   **Order:** Sort by top-left (r, col): Azure (1,1), Green (3,5), Blue (3,13), Orange (7,18). Order: Azure, Green, Blue, Orange.
*   **Output:** Concatenate 3x3 Azure, 3x4 Green, 3x3 Blue, 3x3 Orange. Matches example output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each identified color:
    a.  Find all separate contiguous objects composed of that color's pixels.
    b.  Count the total number of these objects.
    c.  Find the object with the largest number of pixels (the "largest object"). If multiple objects have the same largest size, choose the one whose top-left corner appears highest first, then leftmost.
    d.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the bounding box around this largest object.
    e.  Record the row and column of the top-left corner (r, c) of the largest object.
3.  Determine the overall output grid height, which is the height (H) of the bounding boxes found in step 2d (these heights should be consistent across all colors in a given input).
4.  Find the maximum object count among all counts calculated in step 2b.
5.  Prepare a list to store information for each color: its value, its largest object's top-left position (r, c), its largest object's bounding box width (W), and its total object count.
6.  Sort this list primarily by the row (r) and secondarily by the column (c) of the largest object's top-left corner.
7.  Construct the output grid by iterating through the sorted list:
    a.  For each color, determine its rectangle's width: use the bounding box width (W) from step 2d, but add 1 if that color's object count (from step 2b) equals the maximum object count found in step 4.
    b.  Create a solid rectangle filled with the current color, having the height determined in step 3 and the width calculated in step 7a.
    c.  Append this rectangle horizontally to the right of the previously appended rectangles in the output grid.
8.  The final arrangement of horizontally concatenated rectangles is the output.

"""
Identifies unique non-white colors in the input grid. For each color, it finds all contiguous objects, counts them, and identifies the 'largest' object (most pixels, tie-broken by top-left position). It determines the bounding box (height H, width W) and top-left position (r, c) of this largest object. The output grid height is H (assumed consistent across largest objects of all colors). The width of the rectangle for each color is W, plus 1 if its object count equals the maximum object count found across all colors. These rectangles are then ordered based on the (r, c) position of their corresponding largest objects in the input and concatenated horizontally to form the final output grid.
