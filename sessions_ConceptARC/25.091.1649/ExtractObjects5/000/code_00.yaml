task_description: Extract characteristic rectangles for each color and arrange them horizontally.
elements:
  - role: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid with a white background and scattered pixels of various colors forming objects.
  - role: output_grid
    description: A 2D grid composed of solid-colored rectangles placed adjacent horizontally.
  - role: color
    description: Non-white pixel values (1-9) present in the input.
  - role: object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - role: largest_object
    description: For a given color, the object with the most pixels. Ties broken by top-left position.
  - role: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of the largest object.
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - top_left_coordinate
  - role: object_count
    description: The total number of distinct contiguous objects for a given color.
  - role: max_object_count
    description: The maximum object_count found among all colors in the input.
transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify unique non-white colors in the input.
  - step: 2
    action: For each color, find all its objects, count them, identify the largest object, and determine its bounding box (height H, width W) and top-left position (r, c).
  - step: 3
    action: Determine the output height H_out (equal to the consistent H from step 2).
  - step: 4
    action: Determine the max_object_count across all colors.
  - step: 5
    action: Calculate the output width W_out for each color's rectangle (W+1 if its object_count equals max_object_count, else W).
  - step: 6
    action: Determine the horizontal order of rectangles based on the top-left position (r, then c) of the largest objects.
  - step: 7
    action: Create solid rectangles of size H_out x W_out for each color.
  - step: 8
    action: Concatenate the rectangles horizontally in the determined order to form the output grid.
