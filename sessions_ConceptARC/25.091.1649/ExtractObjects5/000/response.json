            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is a grid containing scattered pixels of various colors (1-9) on a white background (0). These non-white pixels sometimes form contiguous shapes or patterns.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid composed of several solid-colored rectangles placed side-by-side horizontally.\n*   **Relationship:** The colors of the rectangles in the output correspond to the non-white colors present in the input. The size and order of these rectangles seem related to the shapes formed by those colors in the input.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Colors:** Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.\n2.  **Analyze Objects:** For each unique color:\n    *   Find all contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels) of that color.\n    *   Count how many distinct objects exist for that color (`num_objects`).\n    *   Identify the \"largest\" object (the one with the most pixels). If there's a tie in pixel count, prioritize the object whose top-left corner is highest (smallest row index), and then leftmost (smallest column index).\n    *   Determine the bounding box of this largest object. Record its height (`H`) and width (`W`).\n    *   Record the row and column index of the top-left corner (`r`, `col`) of this largest object.\n3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The height of the output grid seems to be uniform and equal to the height (`H`) of the bounding boxes of the largest objects identified in step 2. (Both examples show consistent heights for the largest objects of each color within that example).\n    *   The width of the rectangle for each color (`W_out`) depends on the bounding box width (`W`) of its largest object and the count of objects for that color (`num_objects`). Specifically, find the maximum object count (`max_num_objects`) among all colors present. If a color's `num_objects` equals `max_num_objects`, its output width `W_out = W + 1`. Otherwise, `W_out = W`.\n4.  **Determine Order:** The order of the colored rectangles in the output grid is determined by the position of their corresponding largest objects in the input grid. Sort the colors based on the row index (`r`) of their largest object's top-left corner, then by the column index (`col`).\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by horizontally concatenating solid rectangles for each color. The rectangles should have the common height (`H`) and their calculated individual widths (`W_out`), arranged according to the order determined in step 4.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (train_2):**\n\n*   **Colors:** Azure (8), Green (3), Blue (1), Orange (7).\n*   **Objects & Properties:**\n    *   Azure (8): Largest obj at (1,1), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 8.\n    *   Green (3): Largest obj at (3,5), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 13.\n    *   Blue (1): Largest obj at (3,13), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 7.\n    *   Orange (7): Largest obj at (7,18), BB H=3, W=3. Num objects = 4.\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   Output Height `H_out` = 3 (consistent BB height).\n    *   `max_num_objects` = 13 (Green).\n    *   Azure width: W=3. num=8 != 13. `W_out` = 3.\n    *   Green width: W=3. num=13 == 13. `W_out` = 3 + 1 = 4.\n    *   Blue width: W=3. num=7 != 13. `W_out` = 3.\n    *   Orange width: W=3. num=4 != 13. `W_out` = 3.\n*   **Order:** Sort by top-left (r, col): Azure (1,1), Green (3,5), Blue (3,13), Orange (7,18). Order: Azure, Green, Blue, Orange.\n*   **Output:** Concatenate 3x3 Azure, 3x4 Green, 3x3 Blue, 3x3 Orange. Matches example output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Prepare a list to store information for each color: its value, its largest object's top-left position (r, c), its largest object's bounding box width (W), and its total object count.\n6.

For each color, determine its rectangle's width: use the bounding box width (W) from step 2d, but add 1 if that color's object count (from step 2b) equals the maximum object count found in step 4.\n    b.  Create a solid rectangle filled with the current color, having the height determined in step 3 and the width calculated in step 7a.\n    c.  Append this rectangle horizontally to the right of the previously appended rectangles in the output grid.\n8.  The final arrangement of horizontally concatenated rectangles is the output."
