task_type: pattern_extraction
input_features:
  grid_structure: Contains multiple instances of subgrids (patterns).
  elements:
    - type: background_color
      properties:
        - identification: Most frequent color in the entire input grid.
        - role: Used for filtering candidate patterns.
    - type: candidate_pattern
      properties:
        - repetition: Must occur more than once in the input grid.
        - monochromatic: Must be False (contain at least two different colors).
        - contains_background_color: Must be False.
output_features:
  grid_structure: A single instance of a specific pattern extracted from the input.
  relationship_to_input: The output grid is a subgrid of the input that matches the selected 'target_pattern'.
  selection_criterion:
    - primary: Largest area (height * width) among all 'candidate_patterns'.
    - secondary: (Implied, possibly largest height or first found if areas tie, but area seems sufficient based on examples).
transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: Determine the `background_color` (most frequent overall).
    - find_all: Locate all unique subgrids (patterns) and their counts within the input.
    - filter: Select patterns that meet all `candidate_pattern` properties (repeats > 1, non-monochromatic, excludes `background_color`).
    - select_largest: Choose the candidate pattern with the maximum area.
    - output: Return a single instance of the selected largest pattern.
