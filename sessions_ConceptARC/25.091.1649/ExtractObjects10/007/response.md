"""
Analyzes the input grid to determine the most frequent pixel color (background_color).
Searches the input grid exhaustively to identify all unique rectangular subgrids (patterns) 
and counts their occurrences. Filters these patterns to keep only those that are repeating 
(appear more than once), are not monochromatic (contain more than one color), and do not 
contain the background_color. From the remaining valid patterns, selects the one with the 
largest area (height * width). Assumes a unique largest pattern exists among the valid 
candidates based on the provided examples. Returns a single instance of this selected pattern.
