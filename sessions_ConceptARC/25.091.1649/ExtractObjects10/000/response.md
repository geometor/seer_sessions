**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Relation:** The output grid appears to be a sub-pattern extracted from the input grid.
2.  **Repetition in Input:** Both input grids exhibit repetition. The input grid seems to be composed of repeating blocks or patterns.
3.  **Pattern Extraction:** The task involves identifying a specific repeating pattern within the input grid and outputting a single instance of it.
4.  **Pattern Characteristics:**
    *   In `train_1`, the input is a 2x4 tiling of two distinct 4x5 blocks: an all-blue block and a green/red block. The output is the green/red block.
    *   In `train_2`, the input contains three instances of a 2x4 gray/green pattern, embedded within a larger structure padded with white background pixels. The output is this 2x4 gray/green pattern.
5.  **Filtering/Selection:** A mechanism is needed to distinguish the desired pattern from other elements in the input (like background padding or other repeating patterns).
    *   The desired pattern is not monochromatic (unlike the blue block in `train_1` or the white blocks in `train_2`).
    *   The desired pattern appears multiple times in the input.
    *   The desired pattern does not seem to contain the most frequent color of the input grid (blue in `train_1`, white in `train_2`), suggesting this frequent color acts as a background or separator.

  relationship_to_input: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid that matches the target repeating pattern.
transformation:
  steps:
    - Identify repeating subgrids within the input.
    - Filter out trivial or background patterns (e.g., monochromatic, containing only background color).
    - Select the repeating pattern that does not contain the overall background color.
  background_color_identification: Determined by the most frequent color in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input grid to find the most frequent pixel color; designate this as the `background_color`.
2.  Search the input grid for all unique subgrids (patterns) that appear more than once (i.e., repeating patterns). Consider various possible dimensions for these subgrids.
3.  From the set of repeating patterns found in step 2, filter out any pattern that is monochromatic (consists of only one color).
4.  From the remaining set of non-monochromatic repeating patterns, select the pattern that does *not* contain any pixels of the `background_color` identified in step 1.
5.  The output is a single instance of the selected pattern.
