The input grid seems to be composed of repeating blocks or patterns.\n3.  **Pattern Extraction:** The task involves identifying a specific repeating pattern within the input grid and outputting a single instance of it.\n4.  **Pattern Characteristics:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the input is a 2x4 tiling of two distinct 4x5 blocks: an all-blue block and a green/red block. The output is the green/red block.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input contains three instances of a 2x4 gray/green pattern, embedded within a larger structure padded with white background pixels. The output is this 2x4 gray/green pattern.\n5.  **Filtering/Selection:** A mechanism is needed to distinguish the desired pattern from other elements in the input (like background padding or other repeating patterns).\n    *   The desired pattern is not monochromatic (unlike the blue block in `train_1` or the white blocks in `train_2`).\n    *   The desired pattern appears multiple times in the input.\n    *   The desired pattern does not seem to contain the most frequent color of the input grid (blue in `train_1`, white in `train_2`), suggesting this frequent color acts as a background or separator.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
