task_type: pattern_extraction
input_features:
  grid_structure: Tiled or contains repeating subgrids.
  elements:
    - type: repeating_pattern
      properties:
        - target_pattern: True
        - occurrences: multiple (>1)
        - monochromatic: False
        - contains_background_color: False # Based on hypothesis
    - type: repeating_pattern | background
      properties:
        - target_pattern: False
        - occurrences: multiple (>1)
        - monochromatic: True | False
        - contains_background_color: True
    - type: background_pixels
      properties:
        - color: most_frequent_color_in_input
        - role: padding_or_separator | part_of_non_target_pattern
output_features:
  grid_structure: Single instance of the target repeating pattern.
  relationship_to_input: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid that matches the target repeating pattern.
transformation:
  steps:
    - Identify repeating subgrids within the input.
    - Filter out trivial or background patterns (e.g., monochromatic, containing only background color).
    - Select the repeating pattern that does not contain the overall background color.
  background_color_identification: Determined by the most frequent color in the input grid.
