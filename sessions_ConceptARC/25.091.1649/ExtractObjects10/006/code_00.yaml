task_type: pattern_extraction
input_features:
  grid_structure: Contains multiple instances of one or more distinct subgrids (patterns). May include padding/background pixels.
  elements:
    - type: target_pattern
      properties:
        occurrences: multiple (>1)
        monochromatic: False
        contains_background_color: False
        relative_size: largest_area_among_valid_patterns # Corrected property
    - type: other_pattern # Could be background tiles or other repeating patterns
      properties:
        occurrences: multiple (>1) | single (1)
        monochromatic: True | False
        contains_background_color: True | False # Cannot be the target if it contains background or is monochromatic and repeats
    - type: background_pixels
      properties:
        color: most_frequent_color_in_input
        role: padding_or_separator | part_of_non_target_pattern
output_features:
  grid_structure: A single instance of the target pattern.
  relationship_to_input: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid that matches the target pattern criteria.
transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: most frequent color -> background_color
    - find: all unique rectangular subgrids (patterns) and their counts
    - filter: keep patterns where count > 1
    - filter: keep patterns where monochromatic == False
    - filter: keep patterns where contains_background_color == False
    - select: the pattern with the largest area (height * width) from the filtered set
  output: the selected pattern
