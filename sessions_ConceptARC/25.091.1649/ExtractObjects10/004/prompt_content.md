"""
Analyzes the input grid to find the most frequent pixel color (background_color).
Searches the input grid for all unique subgrids (patterns) that appear more than once.
Filters these repeating patterns to exclude any that are monochromatic or contain the background_color.
From the remaining valid candidate patterns, selects the one with the largest area (height * width).
If there's a tie in area, the current implementation relies on the stability of the sort or the first encountered pattern during iteration, which seems sufficient for the provided examples.
Returns a single instance of the selected pattern.
