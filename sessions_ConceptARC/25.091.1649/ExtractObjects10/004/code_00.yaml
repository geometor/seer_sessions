task_type: pattern_extraction
input_features:
  grid_structure: Contains multiple instances of one or more distinct subgrids (patterns).
  elements:
    - type: target_pattern # The pattern to be extracted
      properties:
        - repeating: True # Appears more than once in the input grid
        - monochromatic: False # Contains more than one color
        - contains_background_color: False # Does not contain the most frequent color of the input grid
        - unique_qualifier: True # Assumed to be the only pattern meeting all criteria
    - type: non_target_pattern # Other patterns present in the input
      properties:
        - repeating: True | False
        - monochromatic: True | False
        - contains_background_color: True | False
    - type: background_color # The most frequent color in the input grid
      properties:
        - role: May form patterns or act as padding/separator. Is used as a filter criterion.
output_features:
  grid_structure: A single instance of the target_pattern.
  content: Identical to one instance of the target_pattern found in the input.
  relationship_to_input: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid that matches the target_pattern.
transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: Determine the most frequent color (`background_color`) in the input grid.
    - search: Find all unique subgrids (patterns) within the input grid that occur more than once.
    - filter: Remove patterns that are monochromatic (contain only one color).
    - filter: Remove patterns that contain the `background_color`.
    - select: Choose the single remaining pattern after filtering. (Assumes uniqueness based on examples).
  output_generation: Return the selected pattern as the output grid.
