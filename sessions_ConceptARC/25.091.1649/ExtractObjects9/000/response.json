Inside this border, there's a large contiguous object of a single color (red=2 in example 1, green=3 in example 2), which acts like a \"frame\". Within this frame object, there is another distinct, smaller object (or potentially multiple) of a different color (yellow=4 in example 1, red=2 in example 2). The inner object in example 2 also contains some background-colored pixels (white=0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. It seems to represent the inner object(s) from the input, possibly cropped and with some color changes. The output grid dimensions appear related to the bounding box of the inner object(s) in the input.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** In example 1, the inner object (yellow=4) is preserved in the output, but the pixels that were part of the frame object (red=2) *within the bounds of the inner object* are changed to the background color (white=0). In example 2, the inner object (red=2) and the background pixels (white=0) within its bounding box are preserved directly, and since no frame color (green=3) pixels were within its bounding box, no color substitution occurs.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The task appears to be about isolating the \"inner\" object(s) that are distinct from the main \"frame\" object and the background. The process involves finding the bounding box of these inner objects, potentially adjusting this bounding box based on the frame object's presence at the edges, extracting the content within this final bounding box, and then replacing any pixels matching the frame color with the background color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
