Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids feature a background color (white=0) forming a border. Inside this border, there's a large contiguous object of a single color (red=2 in example 1, green=3 in example 2), which acts like a "frame". Within this frame object, there is another distinct, smaller object (or potentially multiple) of a different color (yellow=4 in example 1, red=2 in example 2). The inner object in example 2 also contains some background-colored pixels (white=0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. It seems to represent the inner object(s) from the input, possibly cropped and with some color changes. The output grid dimensions appear related to the bounding box of the inner object(s) in the input.
3.  **Color Transformation:** In example 1, the inner object (yellow=4) is preserved in the output, but the pixels that were part of the frame object (red=2) *within the bounds of the inner object* are changed to the background color (white=0). In example 2, the inner object (red=2) and the background pixels (white=0) within its bounding box are preserved directly, and since no frame color (green=3) pixels were within its bounding box, no color substitution occurs.
4.  **Core Logic:** The task appears to be about isolating the "inner" object(s) that are distinct from the main "frame" object and the background. The process involves finding the bounding box of these inner objects, potentially adjusting this bounding box based on the frame object's presence at the edges, extracting the content within this final bounding box, and then replacing any pixels matching the frame color with the background color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Extract an inner object from within a frame object, clean up frame color remnants within its bounding box.

definitions:
  - object: Background
    properties:
      - role: Canvas/Border
      - color: Typically white (0), often the most frequent color or surrounds other objects.
  - object: Frame
    properties:
      - role: Container for Inner objects
      - color: The color of the largest object connected to the Background (or largest non-background object). (Red=2 in ex1, Green=3 in ex2)
      - shape: Large, contiguous, often rectangular or frame-like.
  - object: Inner
    properties:
      - role: Target object(s) for extraction
      - color: Any color distinct from Background and Frame. (Yellow=4 in ex1, Red=2 in ex2)
      - location: Enclosed or contained within the Frame object.
      - pixels: May include Background colored pixels within its area.
  - concept: BoundingBox
    properties:
      - definition: Smallest rectangle containing all pixels of a specified object or set of pixels.
      - attributes: top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col

transformation:
  - step: Identify Colors
    actions:
      - Determine Background color.
      - Determine Frame color (color of the large object adjacent to/inside the background).
      - Identify Inner object color(s) (colors different from Background and Frame).
  - step: Locate Inner Object(s)
    actions:
      - Find all pixels matching Inner object color(s).
      - Calculate the initial BoundingBox encompassing all these Inner object pixels.
  - step: Adjust BoundingBox (Trim)
    actions:
      - Examine the content of the initial BoundingBox within the input grid.
      - Check the last row of the BoundingBox: if it contains *only* pixels of the Frame color, shrink the BoundingBox by excluding this row (decrement bottom_row). Repeat if the new last row also meets the condition.
      - Check the last column of the BoundingBox: if it contains *only* pixels of the Frame color, shrink the BoundingBox by excluding this column (decrement right_col). Repeat if the new last column also meets the condition.
      - Check the first row and first column similarly, incrementing top_row / left_col if they contain only Frame color. (Though not needed for these examples, this might be a general rule).
  - step: Extract Subgrid
    actions:
      - Create a new grid (Output Grid) with dimensions determined by the final, adjusted BoundingBox.
      - Copy the pixels from the input grid within the adjusted BoundingBox to the Output Grid.
  - step: Apply Color Replacement
    actions:
      - Iterate through each pixel in the Output Grid.
      - If a pixel's color matches the Frame color, change its color to the Background color.
      - Otherwise, keep the pixel's color as it is.
  - step: Final Output
    actions:
      - The resulting Output Grid is the final result.

relationships:
  - containment: Inner object(s) are contained within the Frame object.
  - distinctness: Background, Frame, and Inner objects generally have distinct colors.
  - transformation_rule: Frame color pixels within the final extracted region are replaced by the Background color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the background color (usually white '0', the color forming the outer border or the most prevalent color).
2.  Identify the 'frame' color, which is the color of the large object directly inside or adjacent to the background.
3.  Identify the 'inner' object color(s), which are any colors present that are neither the background nor the frame color.
4.  Find all pixels belonging to the inner object(s).
5.  Determine the initial bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) that encloses all identified inner object pixels.
6.  Refine the bounding box:
    *   Examine the pixels within the initial bounding box on the input grid.
    *   If the bottom-most row of the bounding box consists *entirely* of pixels matching the 'frame' color, reduce the height of the bounding box by one (effectively removing this row from the bottom). Repeat this check for the new bottom row until it contains at least one pixel that is not the 'frame' color.
    *   If the right-most column of the bounding box consists *entirely* of pixels matching the 'frame' color, reduce the width of the bounding box by one (removing this column from the right). Repeat this check for the new right-most column until it contains at least one pixel that is not the 'frame' color.
    *   (Optional but safer: Perform similar checks for the top-most row and left-most column, removing them if they contain only the 'frame' color).
7.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid defined by the final, refined bounding box coordinates.
8.  Create the output grid by iterating through the extracted subgrid: for each pixel, if its color is the 'frame' color, replace it with the 'background' color; otherwise, keep its original color.
