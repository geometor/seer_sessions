Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids appear to be divided into two main regions by a single, solid line (row or column) of yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Regions:** Each region contains a background color and one or more "object" colors forming distinct shapes.
    *   In `train_1`, the input is split vertically by a yellow column. The left region has a magenta (6) diamond on a white (0) background. The right region has green (3) pixels within a gray (5) frame, also on a white background outside the frame.
    *   In `train_2`, the input is split horizontally by a yellow row. The top region has a red (2) 'T' shape on an orange (7) background. The bottom region has a green (3) cross shape on an azure (8) background.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The yellow separator line is removed in the output.
    *   The objects from each region seem to be extracted.
    *   The original background colors within each region are replaced with a uniform white (0) background in the output.
    *   In `train_1`, the magenta diamond is copied directly. However, for the green/gray region, only the *outer perimeter* of the green shape is kept. The gray frame is discarded.
    *   In `train_2`, the red 'T' and green cross shapes are extracted.
    *   The extracted shapes/objects are placed onto the new white background.
    *   The relative orientation of the regions (side-by-side in `train_1`, top-bottom in `train_2`) is preserved.
4.  **Output Resizing/Alignment:**
    *   In `train_1` (horizontal split), the output height matches the input height (7). The widths of the processed regions (7 for the left, 4 for the right) are concatenated.
    *   In `train_2` (vertical split), the output width seems standardized. The red 'T' has a bounding box width of 5. The green cross has a bounding box width of 3. In the output, both shapes occupy a width of 5, with the narrower cross shape being centered horizontally. The heights of the processed regions (4 for the top, 3 for the bottom) are concatenated.
    *   This suggests that if the split is vertical (by a row), the *widths* of the resulting parts are standardized to the maximum width before concatenation. If the split is horizontal (by a column), the *heights* are standardized (though in `train_1`, they were already equal).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Find Separator:** Scan the input grid to locate a complete horizontal or vertical line composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. Note the orientation (horizontal/vertical) and position of this separator line.
2.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two subgrids along the separator line. The separator line itself is discarded.
3.  **Process Each Subgrid:** For each subgrid obtained in step 2, perform the following:
    a.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the background color (typically the most frequent color) and the object color(s) (the other non-yellow colors).
    b.  **Extract Feature:**
        i.  **Special Case:** If the subgrid contains green (3) pixels as the primary object and also contains gray (5) pixels (likely forming a frame or adjacent structure), identify only the pixels forming the outer perimeter of the green shape.
        ii. **General Case:** Otherwise, identify all pixels belonging to the primary object color(s).
    c.  **Create Output Subgrid:** Create a new grid containing only the extracted feature pixels (from step 3b) placed at their original relative positions within the feature's minimal bounding box. Fill the rest of the bounding box with white (0) pixels. Note the height and width of this new grid.
4.  **Standardize Dimensions:**
    a.  **Vertical Split (Row Separator):** If the separator found in step 1 was horizontal (a row), compare the *widths* of all output subgrids created in step 3c. Find the maximum width. For any subgrid narrower than this maximum, expand its width by adding columns of white (0) pixels equally to the left and right sides (centering the original content) until it matches the maximum width.
    b.  **Horizontal Split (Column Separator):** If the separator found in step 1 was vertical (a column), compare the *heights* of all output subgrids created in step 3c. Find the maximum height. For any subgrid shorter than this maximum, expand its height by adding rows of white (0) pixels equally to the top and bottom (centering the original content) until it matches the maximum height.
5.  **Combine Results:** Concatenate the standardized subgrids (from step 4) back together in their original relative order (top-to-bottom for a vertical split, left-to-right for a horizontal split) to form the final output grid.

Processes an input grid by performing the following steps:

1.  **Find Separator:** Locates a solid horizontal or vertical line of yellow (4) pixels that divides the grid.
2.  **Divide Input:** Splits the input grid into two subgrids based on the separator, discarding the separator itself.
3.  **Process Each Subgrid:**
    a.  Identifies object pixels (non-background, non-yellow).
    b.  Applies extraction logic:
        i.  **Special Case:** If green (3) and gray (5) pixels are present, extracts only the outer perimeter of the green shape(s). The perimeter is defined as green pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the most frequent non-green, non-gray color (assumed background).
        ii. **General Case:** Extracts all object pixels (non-background, non-yellow).
    c.  Creates a new grid containing the extracted pixels on a white (0) background, cropped to the minimal bounding box of the extracted pixels.
4.  **Standardize Dimensions:**
    a.  If the split was vertical (row separator), pads the width of the processed subgrids to match the maximum width found among them, centering the content horizontally.
    b.  If the split was horizontal (column separator), pads the height of the processed subgrids to match the maximum height found among them, centering the content vertically.
5.  **Combine Results:** Concatenates the standardized subgrids back together according to the original split orientation (vertically for vertical splits, horizontally for horizontal splits).

Processes an input grid by performing the following steps:

1.  **Find Separator:** Locates a solid horizontal or vertical line of yellow (4) pixels that divides the grid.
2.  **Divide Input:** Splits the input grid into two subgrids based on the separator, discarding the separator itself.
3.  **Process Each Subgrid:**
    a.  Identifies object pixels (non-background, non-yellow).
    b.  Applies extraction logic:
        i.  **Special Case:** If green (3) and gray (5) pixels are present, extracts only the outer perimeter of the green shape(s). The perimeter is defined as green pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the most frequent non-green, non-gray color (assumed background).
        ii. **General Case:** Extracts all object pixels (non-background, non-yellow).
    c.  Creates a new grid containing the extracted pixels on a white (0) background, cropped to the minimal bounding box of the extracted pixels.
4.  **Standardize Dimensions:**
    a.  If the split was vertical (row separator), pads the width of the processed subgrids to match the maximum width found among them, centering the content horizontally.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully processed `train_2`, indicating the core logic for separator detection, grid splitting, general object extraction (non-green/gray case), dimension standardization (width padding for vertical splits), and vertical combination (`vstack`) is sound.

However, the code failed on `train_1`. The transformed output only contained the left part (magenta diamond) and missed the right part (green perimeter). The failure occurred during the processing of the right subgrid, specifically in the `extract_feature` function's special case for green (3) and gray (5). The `find_green_perimeter` logic incorrectly required adjacency to a background color (assumed white/0), which wasn't present within that specific subgrid. The perimeter definition needs refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Perimeter Logic:** Modify `find_green_perimeter` to define the perimeter as green pixels adjacent (4-connectivity) to any *non-green* pixel within the subgrid's boundaries. This should correctly identify the outer green pixels bordering the gray frame in `train_1`.
2.  **Verify Combination:** Ensure the horizontal combination (`hstack`) works correctly once both subgrids are processed properly in `train_1`. The dimension standardization for horizontal splits (padding height) also needs implicit confirmation, although it wasn't explicitly tested by the failing `train_1`.
3.  **Re-evaluate `extract_feature`:** Double-check the extraction of the feature color and placement onto the white background after getting the correct perimeter coordinates.

actions:
  - name: identify_separator
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: separator_line (position, orientation), split_orientation (horizontal/vertical)
    description: Find the solid yellow line dividing the grid.

  - name: split_grid
    inputs: input_grid, separator_line
    outputs: list_of_subgrids
    description: Divide the input grid into subgrids based on the separator, excluding the separator line itself.

  - name: extract_feature_representation
    inputs: subgrid
    outputs: processed_subgrid (object/feature on white background, cropped), dimensions (height, width)
    description: >
      Check for the special green(3)/gray(5) condition.
      If true, apply the 'special_green_object' extraction rule (perimeter).
      Otherwise, apply the 'primary_object' extraction rule (extract all object pixels).
      Return the resulting grid cropped to the minimal bounding box of the feature, along with its dimensions.

  - name: standardize_dimensions
    inputs: list_of_processed_subgrids, split_orientation
    outputs: list_of_standardized_subgrids
    description: >
      If split_orientation is vertical (row separator), find the maximum width among processed subgrids. Pad narrower subgrids horizontally with white(0) to match the max width, centering the content.
      If split_orientation is horizontal (column separator), find the maximum height among processed subgrids. Pad shorter subgrids vertically with white(0) to match the max height, centering the content.

  - name: combine_subgrids
    inputs: list_of_standardized_subgrids, split_orientation
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Concatenate the standardized subgrids according to the original split orientation (vertically for vertical split/row separator, horizontally for horizontal split/column separator).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative positions of regions (top/bottom or left/right) are preserved in the output concatenation.
  - type: conditional_processing
    description: The object extraction logic changes specifically when both green (3) and gray (5) are present in a region.
  - type: dimensional_alignment
    description: The dimension orthogonal to the split axis (width for vertical split, height for horizontal split) is standardized across processed subgrids before combination using padding and centering.
  - type: color_mapping
    description: Original background colors are discarded; output background is always white (0). Object colors are preserved unless discarded (like gray in the special case).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Find Separator:** Scan the input grid to locate a complete horizontal or vertical line composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. Record whether the separator is horizontal (a row) or vertical (a column) and its index.
2.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two subgrids based on the separator line. Discard the separator line itself. Note the original relative orientation (top/bottom for horizontal separator, left/right for vertical separator).
3.  **Process Each Subgrid:** For each subgrid:
    a.  **Check for Special Case:** Determine if the subgrid contains both green (3) pixels and gray (5) pixels.
    b.  **Extract Feature Pixels:**
        i.  **If Special Case (Green and Gray):** Identify all green (3) pixels within the subgrid that are adjacent (sharing an edge - up, down, left, or right) to *any* pixel of a different color (e.g., gray 5) within that same subgrid. Collect the coordinates of these 'perimeter' green pixels. The feature color is green (3).
        ii. **If General Case:** Identify the primary object color(s) (non-background, non-yellow). Collect the coordinates of all pixels belonging to these object color(s). If multiple object colors exist, determine the main one (e.g., most frequent). The feature color is this main object color. (Note: Examples suggest objects are typically monochromatic outside the special case).
    c.  **Create Output Subgrid:** If feature pixels were identified:
        i.  Calculate the minimal bounding box containing all collected feature pixel coordinates.
        ii. Create a new grid with the dimensions of this bounding box, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
        iii. Place the identified feature pixels (using their feature color) into this new grid at positions relative to the bounding box's top-left corner.
        iv. If no feature pixels were found (e.g., an empty subgrid), create a 1x1 white (0) grid. Record the height and width of the created grid.
4.  **Standardize Dimensions:** Compare the dimensions of the two output subgrids created in step 3c.
    a.  **If Separator was Horizontal (Row):** Find the maximum *width* between the two subgrids. Pad the narrower subgrid by adding columns of white (0) pixels equally to the left and right sides until its width matches the maximum. Keep the height unchanged.
    b.  **If Separator was Vertical (Column):** Find the maximum *height* between the two subgrids. Pad the shorter subgrid by adding rows of white (0) pixels equally to the top and bottom sides until its height matches the maximum. Keep the width unchanged.
5.  **Combine Results:** Concatenate the two (now potentially padded) output subgrids based on their original relative orientation:
    a.  **If Separator was Horizontal (Row):** Stack the subgrid derived from the top region vertically above the subgrid derived from the bottom region.
    b.  **If Separator was Vertical (Column):** Place the subgrid derived from the left region horizontally next to the subgrid derived from the right region.
    c.  The result of this concatenation is the final output grid.
