            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids appear to be divided into two main regions by a single, solid line (row or column) of yellow (4) pixels.\n2.  **Regions:** Each region contains a background color and one or more \"object\" colors forming distinct shapes.\n    *   In `train_1`, the input is split vertically by a yellow column. The left region has a magenta (6) diamond on a white (0) background. The right region has green (3) pixels within a gray (5) frame, also on a white background outside the frame.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input is split horizontally by a yellow row. The top region has a red (2) 'T' shape on an orange (7) background. The bottom region has a green (3) cross shape on an azure (8) background.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The yellow separator line is removed in the output.\n    *   The objects from each region seem to be extracted.\n    *   The original background colors within each region are replaced with a uniform white (0) background in the output.\n    *   In `train_1`, the magenta diamond is copied directly. However, for the green/gray region, only the *outer perimeter* of the green shape is kept. The gray frame is discarded.\n    *   In `train_2`, the red 'T' and green cross shapes are extracted.\n    *   The extracted shapes/objects are placed onto the new white background.\n    *   The relative orientation of the regions (side-by-side in `train_1`, top-bottom in `train_2`) is preserved.\n4.  **Output Resizing/Alignment:**\n    *   In `train_1` (horizontal split), the output height matches the input height (7). The widths of the processed regions (7 for the left, 4 for the right) are concatenated.\n    *   In `train_2` (vertical split), the output width seems standardized. The red 'T' has a bounding box width of 5. The green cross has a bounding box width of 3. In the output, both shapes occupy a width of 5, with the narrower cross shape being centered horizontally. The heights of the processed regions (4 for the top, 3 for the bottom) are concatenated.\n    *   This suggests that if the split is vertical (by a row), the *widths* of the resulting parts are standardized to the maximum width before concatenation. If the split is horizontal (by a column), the *heights* are standardized (though in `train_1`, they were already equal).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Note the orientation (horizontal/vertical) and position of this separator line.\n2.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two subgrids along the separator line. The separator line itself is discarded.\n3.  **Process Each Subgrid:** For each subgrid obtained in step 2, perform the following:\n    a.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the background color (typically the most frequent color) and the object color(s) (the other non-yellow colors).\n    b.  **Extract Feature:**\n        i.  **Special Case:** If the subgrid contains green (3) pixels as the primary object and also contains gray (5) pixels (likely forming a frame or adjacent structure), identify only the pixels forming the outer perimeter of the green shape.\n        ii. **General Case:** Otherwise, identify all pixels belonging to the primary object color(s).\n    c.  **Create Output Subgrid:** Create a new grid containing only the extracted feature pixels (from step 3b) placed at their original relative positions within the feature's minimal bounding box. Fill the rest of the bounding box with white (0) pixels. Note the height and width of this new grid.\n4.  **Standardize Dimensions:**\n    a.  **Vertical Split (Row Separator):** If the separator found in step 1 was horizontal (a row), compare the *widths* of all output subgrids created in step 3c. Find the maximum width. For any subgrid narrower than this maximum, expand its width by adding columns of white (0) pixels equally to the left and right sides (centering the original content) until it matches the maximum width.\n    b.  **Horizontal Split (Column Separator):** If the separator found in step 1 was vertical (a column), compare the *heights* of all output subgrids created in step 3c. Find the maximum height. For any subgrid shorter than this maximum, expand its height by adding rows of white (0) pixels equally to the top and bottom (centering the original content) until it matches the maximum height.\n5.  **Combine Results:** Concatenate the standardized subgrids (from step 4) back together in their original relative order (top-to-bottom for a vertical split, left-to-right for a horizontal split) to form the final output grid."
