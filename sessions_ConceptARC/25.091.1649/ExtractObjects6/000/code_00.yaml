task_type: object_extraction_and_composition

components:
  - role: separator
    attributes:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: solid line (row or column)
      function: divides the input grid into distinct regions
      persistence: removed in output

  - role: region
    attributes:
      count: typically two per input grid, defined by the separator
      content: contains a background color and one or more object colors
      processing: processed independently

  - role: background
    attributes:
      location: within a region
      color: variable (white, gray, orange, azure observed)
      relation_to_object: surrounds or fills space around the object(s)
      persistence: replaced by white (0) in the output

  - role: object
    attributes:
      location: within a region
      color: variable (magenta, green, red observed)
      shape: variable (diamond, square-like, T, cross observed)
      relation_to_background: distinct from the region's background color
      persistence: extracted and placed onto the output grid's white background
    subtypes:
      - type: primary_object
        attributes:
          color: the main non-background color(s) in a region
          extraction_rule: typically extracted based on minimal bounding box
      - type: frame_object (optional)
        attributes:
          color: e.g., gray (5) in train_1
          relation_to_primary: often surrounds or is adjacent to the primary object
          persistence: usually discarded during extraction

actions:
  - name: identify_separator
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: separator_line (position, orientation), split_orientation (horizontal/vertical)
    description: Find the solid yellow line dividing the grid.

  - name: split_grid
    inputs: input_grid, separator_line
    outputs: list_of_subgrids
    description: Divide the input grid into subgrids based on the separator.

  - name: extract_object_representation
    inputs: subgrid
    outputs: processed_subgrid (object on white background, cropped), dimensions (height, width)
    description: >
      Identify background and object colors.
      Apply extraction logic:
      If green(3) object with gray(5) frame detected, extract green perimeter.
      Otherwise, extract primary object shape(s).
      Replace original background with white(0).
      Crop to minimal bounding box of the extracted object/perimeter.

  - name: standardize_dimensions
    inputs: list_of_processed_subgrids, split_orientation
    outputs: list_of_standardized_subgrids
    description: >
      If split_orientation is vertical (row separator), find max width. Pad narrower subgrids horizontally with white(0) to match max width, centering the object.
      If split_orientation is horizontal (column separator), find max height. Pad shorter subgrids vertically with white(0) to match max height, centering the object.

  - name: combine_subgrids
    inputs: list_of_standardized_subgrids, split_orientation
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Concatenate the standardized subgrids according to the original split orientation (horizontally for horizontal split, vertically for vertical split).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative positions of regions in the input are preserved in the output after processing and standardization.
  - type: conditional_processing
    description: The extraction logic for an object depends on the colors present (e.g., green and gray trigger perimeter extraction).
  - type: dimensional_alignment
    description: The dimension orthogonal to the split axis (width for vertical split, height for horizontal split) is standardized across processed subgrids before combination.
