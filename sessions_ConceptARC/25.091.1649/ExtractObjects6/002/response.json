            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully processed `train_2`, indicating the core logic for separator detection, grid splitting, general object extraction (non-green/gray case), dimension standardization (width padding for vertical splits), and vertical combination (`vstack`) is sound.\n\nHowever, the code failed on `train_1`. The transformed output only contained the left part (magenta diamond) and missed the right part (green perimeter). The failure occurred during the processing of the right subgrid, specifically in the `extract_feature` function's special case for green (3) and gray (5). The `find_green_perimeter` logic incorrectly required adjacency to a background color (assumed white/0), which wasn't present within that specific subgrid. The perimeter definition needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Perimeter Logic:** Modify `find_green_perimeter` to define the perimeter as green pixels adjacent (4-connectivity) to any *non-green* pixel within the subgrid's boundaries. This should correctly identify the outer green pixels bordering the gray frame in `train_1`.\n2.  **Verify Combination:** Ensure the horizontal combination (`hstack`) works correctly once both subgrids are processed properly in `train_1`. The dimension standardization for horizontal splits (padding height) also needs implicit confirmation, although it wasn't explicitly tested by the failing `train_1`.\n3.  **Re-evaluate `extract_feature`:** Double-check the extraction of the feature color and placement onto the white background after getting the correct perimeter coordinates.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather some specific metrics for `train_1` where the failure occurred."
