## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully processed `train_2`, indicating the core logic for separator detection, grid splitting, general object extraction (non-green/gray case), dimension standardization (width padding for vertical splits), and vertical combination (`vstack`) is sound.

However, the code failed on `train_1`. The transformed output only contained the left part (magenta diamond) and missed the right part (green perimeter). The failure occurred during the processing of the right subgrid, specifically in the `extract_feature` function's special case for green (3) and gray (5). The `find_green_perimeter` logic incorrectly required adjacency to a background color (assumed white/0), which wasn't present within that specific subgrid. The perimeter definition needs refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Perimeter Logic:** Modify `find_green_perimeter` to define the perimeter as green pixels adjacent (4-connectivity) to any *non-green* pixel within the subgrid's boundaries. This should correctly identify the outer green pixels bordering the gray frame in `train_1`.
2.  **Verify Combination:** Ensure the horizontal combination (`hstack`) works correctly once both subgrids are processed properly in `train_1`. The dimension standardization for horizontal splits (padding height) also needs implicit confirmation, although it wasn't explicitly tested by the failing `train_1`.
3.  **Re-evaluate `extract_feature`:** Double-check the extraction of the feature color and placement onto the white background after getting the correct perimeter coordinates.

## Metrics

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Find Separator:** Scan the input grid to locate a complete horizontal or vertical line composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. Record whether the separator is horizontal (a row) or vertical (a column) and its index.
2.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two subgrids based on the separator line. Discard the separator line itself. Note the original relative orientation (top/bottom for horizontal separator, left/right for vertical separator).
3.  **Process Each Subgrid:** For each subgrid:
    a.  **Check for Special Case:** Determine if the subgrid contains both green (3) pixels and gray (5) pixels.
    b.  **Extract Feature Pixels:**
        i.  **If Special Case (Green and Gray):** Identify all green (3) pixels within the subgrid that are adjacent (sharing an edge - up, down, left, or right) to *any* pixel of a different color (e.g., gray 5) within that same subgrid. Collect the coordinates of these 'perimeter' green pixels. The feature color is green (3).
        ii. **If General Case:** Identify the primary object color(s) (non-background, non-yellow). Collect the coordinates of all pixels belonging to these object color(s). If multiple object colors exist, determine the main one (e.g., most frequent). The feature color is this main object color. (Note: Examples suggest objects are typically monochromatic outside the special case).
    c.  **Create Output Subgrid:** If feature pixels were identified:
        i.  Calculate the minimal bounding box containing all collected feature pixel coordinates.
        ii. Create a new grid with the dimensions of this bounding box, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
        iii. Place the identified feature pixels (using their feature color) into this new grid at positions relative to the bounding box's top-left corner.
        iv. If no feature pixels were found (e.g., an empty subgrid), create a 1x1 white (0) grid. Record the height and width of the created grid.
4.  **Standardize Dimensions:** Compare the dimensions of the two output subgrids created in step 3c.
    a.  **If Separator was Horizontal (Row):** Find the maximum *width* between the two subgrids. Pad the narrower subgrid by adding columns of white (0) pixels equally to the left and right sides until its width matches the maximum. Keep the height unchanged.
    b.  **If Separator was Vertical (Column):** Find the maximum *height* between the two subgrids. Pad the shorter subgrid by adding rows of white (0) pixels equally to the top and bottom sides until its height matches the maximum. Keep the width unchanged.
5.  **Combine Results:** Concatenate the two (now potentially padded) output subgrids based on their original relative orientation:
    a.  **If Separator was Horizontal (Row):** Stack the subgrid derived from the top region vertically above the subgrid derived from the bottom region.
    b.  **If Separator was Vertical (Column):** Place the subgrid derived from the left region horizontally next to the subgrid derived from the right region.
    c.  The result of this concatenation is the final output grid.
