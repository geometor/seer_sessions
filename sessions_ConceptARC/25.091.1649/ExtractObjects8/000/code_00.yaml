task_context:
  description: The task seems to involve identifying objects made of non-background colors, specifically looking for objects that form closed loops enclosing a region of the background color. The output is derived from this enclosed region or the enclosing object.
  background_color: Determined as the most frequent color in the input grid.
  primary_object_type: Contiguous areas of non-background color.
  key_feature: Objects forming a closed loop structure.

example_1:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 10x12
    background_color: 3 (Green)
    objects:
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'C'
        location: Bounding box rows 2-5, cols 6-9
        properties: Forms a closed loop.
        enclosed_region:
          location: Bounding box rows 3-4, cols 7-8
          dimensions: 2x2
          color: 3 (Green)
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 2x2
    content: Filled with Green (3)
  relationship: The output grid is identical to the region enclosed by the White 'C' object in the input.

example_2:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 11x11
    background_color: 4 (Yellow)
    objects:
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: '1'
        location: Bounding box rows 2-5, col 2
        properties: Does not form a closed loop.
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'L'
        location: Bounding box rows 3-5, cols 3-5
        properties: Does not form a closed loop.
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'C'
        location: Bounding box rows 5-9, cols 6-9
        properties: Forms a closed loop.
        enclosed_region:
          location: Bounding box rows 6-8, cols 7-8
          dimensions: 3x2
          color: 4 (Yellow)
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x5
    content: Pattern of White (0) and Yellow (4)
  relationship: The relationship is unclear. The output dimensions (3x5) might relate to the enclosed region's height (3) and the enclosing 'C' object's height (5). However, the output content does not directly match the enclosed 3x2 Yellow region. The rule observed in Example 1 does not seem to apply directly here to produce the given output.
