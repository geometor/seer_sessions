            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples take a larger grid as input and produce a smaller grid as output.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Example 1 uses Green (3) as the background and White (0) for a shape. The output is entirely Green (3).\n    *   Example 2 uses Yellow (4) as the background and White (0) for several shapes. The output contains Yellow (4) and White (0).\n3.  **Shapes:**\n    *   Example 1 contains a single White object shaped like a 'C'. This shape encloses a 2x2 area filled with the background Green color.\n    *   Example 2 contains three distinct White objects: one resembling a '1', one like an 'L', and one like a 'C'. Only the 'C' shape encloses an area (3x2) filled with the background Yellow color.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation seems related to identifying specific shapes in the input and extracting or constructing a new grid based on them.\n5.  **Example 1 Analysis:** The input 'C' shape (White) encloses a 2x2 Green square. The output *is* exactly this 2x2 Green square. This suggests the task involves finding a closed loop and extracting the region it encloses.\n6.  **Example 2 Analysis:** The input contains three White shapes. Only the 'C' shape forms a closed loop, enclosing a 3x2 Yellow rectangle. However, the output is a 3x5 grid with a pattern of White and Yellow. This output does not directly match the enclosed region found in the input's 'C'.\n7.  **Inconsistency/Ambiguity:** There's a discrepancy between the rule suggested by Example 1 (output = enclosed region) and the output provided for Example 2. Example 1's rule is simple and clear. Example 2's output seems to follow a different or more complex logic, possibly related to the dimensions of the enclosing shape (5 rows high) and the number of shapes (3 shapes -> 3 rows output?), but the exact pattern generation isn't immediately obvious from just these two examples if the rule from Example 1 isn't applied.\n\n**Hypothesis:** Given the simplicity and directness in Example 1, the most likely core rule involves finding a single, non-background colored object that forms a closed loop, and extracting the rectangular region of the background color enclosed within that loop. Example 2 might be an anomaly, an error in the example, or represent a conditional rule not fully revealed. Based *primarily* on Example 1 and the shared feature of an enclosed region in Example 2, the \"extract enclosed region\" hypothesis is the most parsimonious starting point.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
