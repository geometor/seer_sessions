Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples take a larger grid as input and produce a smaller grid as output.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Example 1 uses Green (3) as the background and White (0) for a shape. The output is entirely Green (3).
    *   Example 2 uses Yellow (4) as the background and White (0) for several shapes. The output contains Yellow (4) and White (0).
3.  **Shapes:**
    *   Example 1 contains a single White object shaped like a 'C'. This shape encloses a 2x2 area filled with the background Green color.
    *   Example 2 contains three distinct White objects: one resembling a '1', one like an 'L', and one like a 'C'. Only the 'C' shape encloses an area (3x2) filled with the background Yellow color.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation seems related to identifying specific shapes in the input and extracting or constructing a new grid based on them.
5.  **Example 1 Analysis:** The input 'C' shape (White) encloses a 2x2 Green square. The output *is* exactly this 2x2 Green square. This suggests the task involves finding a closed loop and extracting the region it encloses.
6.  **Example 2 Analysis:** The input contains three White shapes. Only the 'C' shape forms a closed loop, enclosing a 3x2 Yellow rectangle. However, the output is a 3x5 grid with a pattern of White and Yellow. This output does not directly match the enclosed region found in the input's 'C'.
7.  **Inconsistency/Ambiguity:** There's a discrepancy between the rule suggested by Example 1 (output = enclosed region) and the output provided for Example 2. Example 1's rule is simple and clear. Example 2's output seems to follow a different or more complex logic, possibly related to the dimensions of the enclosing shape (5 rows high) and the number of shapes (3 shapes -> 3 rows output?), but the exact pattern generation isn't immediately obvious from just these two examples if the rule from Example 1 isn't applied.

**Hypothesis:** Given the simplicity and directness in Example 1, the most likely core rule involves finding a single, non-background colored object that forms a closed loop, and extracting the rectangular region of the background color enclosed within that loop. Example 2 might be an anomaly, an error in the example, or represent a conditional rule not fully revealed. Based *primarily* on Example 1 and the shared feature of an enclosed region in Example 2, the "extract enclosed region" hypothesis is the most parsimonious starting point.

**Facts YAML**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: The task seems to involve identifying objects made of non-background colors, specifically looking for objects that form closed loops enclosing a region of the background color. The output is derived from this enclosed region or the enclosing object.
  background_color: Determined as the most frequent color in the input grid.
  primary_object_type: Contiguous areas of non-background color.
  key_feature: Objects forming a closed loop structure.

example_1:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 10x12
    background_color: 3 (Green)
    objects:
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'C'
        location: Bounding box rows 2-5, cols 6-9
        properties: Forms a closed loop.
        enclosed_region:
          location: Bounding box rows 3-4, cols 7-8
          dimensions: 2x2
          color: 3 (Green)
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 2x2
    content: Filled with Green (3)
  relationship: The output grid is identical to the region enclosed by the White 'C' object in the input.

example_2:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: 11x11
    background_color: 4 (Yellow)
    objects:
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: '1'
        location: Bounding box rows 2-5, col 2
        properties: Does not form a closed loop.
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'L'
        location: Bounding box rows 3-5, cols 3-5
        properties: Does not form a closed loop.
      - color: 0 (White)
        shape: 'C'
        location: Bounding box rows 5-9, cols 6-9
        properties: Forms a closed loop.
        enclosed_region:
          location: Bounding box rows 6-8, cols 7-8
          dimensions: 3x2
          color: 4 (Yellow)
  output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x5
    content: Pattern of White (0) and Yellow (4)
  relationship: The relationship is unclear. The output dimensions (3x5) might relate to the enclosed region's height (3) and the enclosing 'C' object's height (5). However, the output content does not directly match the enclosed 3x2 Yellow region. The rule observed in Example 1 does not seem to apply directly here to produce the given output.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of colors other than the background color.
3.  Search among these objects for one that forms a "closed loop", meaning it fully encloses a rectangular area consisting solely of the background color. Assume there will be exactly one such object per input grid.
4.  Identify the rectangular region of the background color enclosed by this loop object.
5.  The output grid is this enclosed rectangular region.

**(Note:** This program accurately describes the transformation for Example 1. It predicts a 3x2 yellow grid for Example 2, which differs from the provided 3x5 output for Example 2. This suggests the actual rule might be more complex or that the examples are potentially inconsistent/insufficient.)
