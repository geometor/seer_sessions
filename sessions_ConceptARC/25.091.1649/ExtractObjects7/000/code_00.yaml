task_description: Combine two objects separated by a third object (separator), removing the separator and background. The combination orientation (horizontal/vertical) depends on the separator's orientation.

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      purpose: Canvas for other objects. Removed in the output.
  - role: object_to_keep
    properties:
      count: 2 per input
      color: Any non-white, non-separator color (e.g., blue, yellow in train_1; green, gray in train_2)
      shape: Variable (rectangle, hollow rectangle, diamond, etc.)
      contiguity: Contiguous block of a single color.
      relationship: Separated by the 'separator' object either horizontally or vertically.
      action: Extracted and combined in the output.
  - role: separator
    properties:
      count: 1 per input
      color: Specific colors (green '3' or magenta '6' observed) OR defined by shape/function.
      shape: Line or Bar (vertical line in train_1, horizontal bar in train_2).
      contiguity: Contiguous block of a single color.
      relationship: Positioned between the two 'object_to_keep'. Defines their relative position (left/right or above/below).
      action: Removed in the output. Determines the combination orientation of the other objects.

transformations:
  - identify_objects: Distinguish background, separator, and objects_to_keep based on color and contiguity.
  - determine_separator_orientation: Check if the separator is primarily vertical or horizontal.
  - extract_objects_to_keep: Isolate the two objects_to_keep, potentially by finding their bounding boxes excluding the background.
  - combine_objects:
      if separator is vertical:
        Place the object originally left of the separator to the left.
        Place the object originally right of the separator to the right.
        Align them vertically (e.g., top-align).
      if separator is horizontal:
        Place the object originally above the separator on top.
        Place the object originally below the separator below.
        Align them horizontally (e.g., left-align).
  - create_output_grid: Construct a new grid sized minimally to fit the combined objects. Fill with the combined object pixels.
