There are typically three main objects in the input.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The objects are contiguous blocks of single colors. In `train_1`, we see a blue (1) rectangle, a yellow (4) hollow rectangle, and a vertical green (3) line. In `train_2`, we see a green (3) diamond, a magenta (6) horizontal bar, and a gray (5) rectangle.\n3.  **Separator Object:** In both examples, one object appears to function as a separator or is simply discarded. In `train_1`, it's the vertical green line. In `train_2`, it's the horizontal magenta bar. These separator objects seem to define the relationship (horizontal vs. vertical separation) between the other two objects. The color of the separator object (green or magenta) might be significant, or its shape (line/bar) might be the key.\n4.  **Remaining Objects:** The other two objects in the input are preserved and combined in the output.\n5.  **Combination Logic:** The way the remaining objects are combined in the output depends on the orientation of the separator object in the input.\n    *   If the separator was vertical (like the green line in `train_1`), the remaining objects are placed side-by-side (horizontally) in the output. The object originally to the left of the separator goes to the left in the output, and the one to the right goes to the right.\n    *   If the separator was horizontal (like the magenta bar in `train_2`), the remaining objects are stacked one above the other (vertically) in the output. The object originally above the separator goes on top in the output, and the one below goes below.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains only the two combined objects. The background and the separator object are removed. The output grid is sized to be the minimal bounding box containing the combined shapes.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

This object is likely characterized by its color (green or magenta) and shape (a line or bar that spans between the other two main objects). *Correction:* The separator is the object that lies geometrically between the bounding boxes of the other two main non-background objects. Determine if this separator is primarily vertical or horizontal based on its aspect ratio (height > width for vertical, width > height for horizontal).\n3.  Identify the two 'objects to keep' \u2013 these are the non-background, non-separator objects.\n4.  Determine the relative positions of the 'objects to keep' with respect to the separator (e.g., one is left/above, the other is right/below).\n5.
