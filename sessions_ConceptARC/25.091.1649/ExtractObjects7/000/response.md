## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of non-white pixels (colors 1-9) set against a white (0) background. There are typically three main objects in the input.
2.  **Object Identification:** The objects are contiguous blocks of single colors. In `train_1`, we see a blue (1) rectangle, a yellow (4) hollow rectangle, and a vertical green (3) line. In `train_2`, we see a green (3) diamond, a magenta (6) horizontal bar, and a gray (5) rectangle.
3.  **Separator Object:** In both examples, one object appears to function as a separator or is simply discarded. In `train_1`, it's the vertical green line. In `train_2`, it's the horizontal magenta bar. These separator objects seem to define the relationship (horizontal vs. vertical separation) between the other two objects. The color of the separator object (green or magenta) might be significant, or its shape (line/bar) might be the key.
4.  **Remaining Objects:** The other two objects in the input are preserved and combined in the output.
5.  **Combination Logic:** The way the remaining objects are combined in the output depends on the orientation of the separator object in the input.
    *   If the separator was vertical (like the green line in `train_1`), the remaining objects are placed side-by-side (horizontally) in the output. The object originally to the left of the separator goes to the left in the output, and the one to the right goes to the right.
    *   If the separator was horizontal (like the magenta bar in `train_2`), the remaining objects are stacked one above the other (vertically) in the output. The object originally above the separator goes on top in the output, and the one below goes below.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains only the two combined objects. The background and the separator object are removed. The output grid is sized to be the minimal bounding box containing the combined shapes.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Combine two objects separated by a third object (separator), removing the separator and background. The combination orientation (horizontal/vertical) depends on the separator's orientation.

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      purpose: Canvas for other objects. Removed in the output.
  - role: object_to_keep
    properties:
      count: 2 per input
      color: Any non-white, non-separator color (e.g., blue, yellow in train_1; green, gray in train_2)
      shape: Variable (rectangle, hollow rectangle, diamond, etc.)
      contiguity: Contiguous block of a single color.
      relationship: Separated by the 'separator' object either horizontally or vertically.
      action: Extracted and combined in the output.
  - role: separator
    properties:
      count: 1 per input
      color: Specific colors (green '3' or magenta '6' observed) OR defined by shape/function.
      shape: Line or Bar (vertical line in train_1, horizontal bar in train_2).
      contiguity: Contiguous block of a single color.
      relationship: Positioned between the two 'object_to_keep'. Defines their relative position (left/right or above/below).
      action: Removed in the output. Determines the combination orientation of the other objects.

transformations:
  - identify_objects: Distinguish background, separator, and objects_to_keep based on color and contiguity.
  - determine_separator_orientation: Check if the separator is primarily vertical or horizontal.
  - extract_objects_to_keep: Isolate the two objects_to_keep, potentially by finding their bounding boxes excluding the background.
  - combine_objects:
      if separator is vertical:
        Place the object originally left of the separator to the left.
        Place the object originally right of the separator to the right.
        Align them vertically (e.g., top-align).
      if separator is horizontal:
        Place the object originally above the separator on top.
        Place the object originally below the separator below.
        Align them horizontally (e.g., left-align).
  - create_output_grid: Construct a new grid sized minimally to fit the combined objects. Fill with the combined object pixels.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid composed of non-white pixels.
2.  Identify the 'separator' object among them. This object is likely characterized by its color (green or magenta) and shape (a line or bar that spans between the other two main objects). *Correction:* The separator is the object that lies geometrically between the bounding boxes of the other two main non-background objects. Determine if this separator is primarily vertical or horizontal based on its aspect ratio (height > width for vertical, width > height for horizontal).
3.  Identify the two 'objects to keep' â€“ these are the non-background, non-separator objects.
4.  Determine the relative positions of the 'objects to keep' with respect to the separator (e.g., one is left/above, the other is right/below).
5.  Extract the pixel grids of the two 'objects to keep' (using their minimal bounding boxes).
6.  Create a new output grid.
7.  If the separator was primarily vertical:
    a. Calculate the output grid dimensions: height = max(height of object 1, height of object 2), width = width of object 1 + width of object 2.
    b. Place the object that was originally to the left of the separator into the left part of the output grid.
    c. Place the object that was originally to the right of the separator into the right part of the output grid, immediately adjacent to the first object.
8.  If the separator was primarily horizontal:
    a. Calculate the output grid dimensions: height = height of object 1 + height of object 2, width = max(width of object 1, width of object 2).
    b. Place the object that was originally above the separator into the top part of the output grid.
    c. Place the object that was originally below the separator into the bottom part of the output grid, immediately below the first object.
9.  Return the newly constructed output grid.
