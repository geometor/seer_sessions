Context:
  - The task involves extracting a specific region from a larger input grid based on the properties of colored objects within it.
  - Input grids contain a background color (white=0) and pixels of one other single color.
  - Output grids are smaller rectangular subgrids derived from the input.

Input Grid Properties:
  - Contains multiple pixels of a single non-white color.
  - These non-white pixels can form disconnected components (objects).
  - An 'object' is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity includes adjacent sides and corners (diagonal adjacency).

Transformation Steps:
  - Identify all connected components (objects) formed by the non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified component.
  - Determine the component with the largest size. (Assuming there will be a unique largest component based on the examples).
  - Find the minimal bounding box (top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, right-most column) that encloses all pixels of this largest component.
  - Crop the input grid using the coordinates of this bounding box.

Output Grid Properties:
  - The output grid is the subgrid extracted from the input grid corresponding to the bounding box of the largest non-white connected component.
  - It retains all original pixel colors (including white background pixels) within that bounding box.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the dimensions of the bounding box.
