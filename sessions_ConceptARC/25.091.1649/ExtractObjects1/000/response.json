These non-white pixels sometimes form connected shapes and sometimes appear as isolated points. The output grids are smaller rectangular subsections of the input grids. Visually, the output grids seem to capture the most prominent or largest connected shape formed by the non-white pixels in the corresponding input grid. The background color (white) and any other pixels within the selected region are preserved in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Connectivity includes adjacent sides and corners (diagonal adjacency).\n\nTransformation Steps:\n  - Identify all connected components (objects) formed by the non-white pixels in the input grid.\n  - Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified component.\n  - Determine the component with the largest size. (Assuming there will be a unique largest component based on the examples).\n  - Find the minimal bounding box (top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, right-most column) that encloses all pixels of this largest component.\n  - Crop the input grid using the coordinates of this bounding box.\n\nOutput Grid Properties:\n  - The output grid is the subgrid extracted from the input grid corresponding to the bounding box of the largest non-white connected component.\n  - It retains all original pixel colors (including white background pixels) within that bounding box.\n  - The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the dimensions of the bounding box.\n```"

Identify all distinct connected components formed by these non-white pixels. Pixels are considered connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each component will consist of pixels of the same color.\n3.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) for each connected component.\n4.  Select the connected component that has the largest size.\n5.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the pixels belonging to this largest component. This defines the bounding box.\n6.  Create the output grid by extracting the rectangular region from the input grid starting at `min_row` and ending at `max_row` (inclusive), and starting at `min_col` and ending at `max_col` (inclusive)."
