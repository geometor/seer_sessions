Some objects might be solid blocks of a single color.\n    *   The output grids are mostly white, retaining only specific pixels from the input grid.\n    *   The pixels retained in the output correspond to the \"core\" pixels from certain input objects.\n    *   The transformation appears to involve identifying pixels that are completely surrounded by other non-white pixels (i.e., not adjacent to any white pixels, including diagonally) and preserving only those pixels in their original positions. All other pixels, including the \"frames\" and solid objects, become white.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
