*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-white pixels, set against a white background.
    *   These objects often consist of an outer "frame" of one color surrounding an inner "core" of a different color(s). Some objects might be solid blocks of a single color.
    *   The output grids are mostly white, retaining only specific pixels from the input grid.
    *   The pixels retained in the output correspond to the "core" pixels from certain input objects.
    *   The transformation appears to involve identifying pixels that are completely surrounded by other non-white pixels (i.e., not adjacent to any white pixels, including diagonally) and preserving only those pixels in their original positions. All other pixels, including the "frames" and solid objects, become white.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object
        description: Contiguous block(s) of non-white pixels.
        properties:
          - May have an outer frame color and an inner core color.
          - May be a solid color.
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: (integer 0-9)
          - position: (row, column)
          - neighbors: Set of 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals).
    transformation:
      action: filter_pixels
      condition: A pixel is kept in the output grid if and only if all of its 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) in the input grid are non-white (not color 0).
      output_generation:
        - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
        - For each pixel in the input grid that meets the condition (all 8 neighbors are non-white), place that pixel's color at the corresponding position in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, excluding pixels on the border (as they cannot be fully surrounded).
    3.  For each non-border pixel, check its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
    4.  If the current pixel is not white AND *all* of its 8 neighbors are also not white (color is not 0), then copy the color of this current pixel to the corresponding position in the new grid.
    5.  All other positions in the new grid remain white.
    6.  The resulting new grid is the output.
