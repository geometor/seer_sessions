task_description: Draw lines from colored pixels towards a central gray barrier line.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: barrier_line
    color: 5 (gray)
    shape: straight line (either horizontal or vertical)
    role: Acts as a boundary for drawing lines.
  - type: source_pixel
    color: Any color except 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
    shape: single pixel
    role: Starting point for drawing lines.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: source_pixel
    object2: barrier_line
    description: The position of a source pixel relative to the barrier line (above/below or left/right) determines the drawing direction.
actions:
  - type: find_barrier
    description: Locate the gray (5) line and determine its orientation (horizontal/vertical) and index (row/column).
  - type: find_sources
    description: Locate all pixels that are not white (0) or gray (5).
  - type: draw_line
    actor: source_pixel
    target: position adjacent to barrier_line
    properties:
      - color: Same as the source_pixel.
      - direction: Perpendicular to the barrier_line, moving from the source_pixel towards the barrier_line.
      - extent: From the source_pixel up to, but not including, the barrier_line.
output_grid:
  - composition: Input grid modified by the 'draw_line' actions. The barrier_line and background remain unchanged except where lines are drawn.
