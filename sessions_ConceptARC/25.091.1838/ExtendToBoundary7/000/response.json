            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0), a single straight line of gray pixels (5) (either horizontal or vertical), and one or more isolated colored pixels (non-white, non-gray).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the white background and the gray line from the input. The key change is that the isolated colored pixels from the input have been extended into lines.\n*   **Transformation:** The colored pixels in the input act as starting points. Lines of the same color are drawn from these starting points towards the gray line.\n    *   If the gray line is vertical, horizontal lines are drawn from the colored pixels towards the gray line, stopping one pixel away from it.\n    *   If the gray line is horizontal, vertical lines are drawn from the colored pixels towards the gray line, stopping one pixel away from it.\n    *   Pixels to the left of a vertical gray line draw lines to the right. Pixels to the right draw lines to the left.\n    *   Pixels above a horizontal gray line draw lines downwards. Pixels below draw lines upwards.\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are the gray line (barrier) and the colored source pixels.\n*   **Relationships:** The core relationship is the position of the source pixels relative to the gray barrier, which determines the direction and extent of the drawn lines.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
