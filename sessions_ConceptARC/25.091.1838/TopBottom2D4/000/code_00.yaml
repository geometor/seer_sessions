- task_description: Selectively remove objects from the input grid based on their area and position relative to grid borders.
- grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: White (0) is the background color.
- objects:
    - definition: Contiguous areas of the same non-white color (1-9).
    - properties:
        - color: The pixel value (1-9).
        - pixels: A list of coordinates for each pixel in the object.
        - area: The count of pixels in the object.
        - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object.
        - touches_top_border: Boolean, true if any object pixel is in row 0.
        - touches_bottom_border: Boolean, true if any object pixel is in the last row.
- relationships:
    - max_area: The largest area among all identified objects in the input.
    - max_area_objects: The set of objects that have the maximum area.
    - count_max_area_objects: The number of objects in the `max_area_objects` set.
- actions:
    - identify_objects: Find all distinct objects and calculate their properties (area, border touching).
    - find_max_area: Determine the maximum area (`max_area`) among all objects.
    - count_max_objects: Count how many objects share this `max_area`.
    - filter_objects:
        - condition_1 (unique max area): If `count_max_area_objects` is 1, keep only the object with the `max_area`.
        - condition_2 (tied max area): If `count_max_area_objects` is greater than 1, keep all objects that do *not* touch the top border *and* do *not* touch the bottom border.
    - generate_output: Create the output grid by placing the kept objects onto a white background of the same dimensions as the input.
