            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors). The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels (1-9) in the input form distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of the same color. These objects are separated by white pixels (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively removing some objects from the input grid, turning their constituent pixels white (0) in the output grid. Some objects are preserved.\n4.  **Identifying Kept Objects (Examples):**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input has Green (3x3, area 9), Yellow (4x3, area 12), Orange (3x3, area 9). Output keeps only Yellow. Yellow has the unique maximum area.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input has Blue (2x2, area 4), Orange (3x8, area 24), Azure (2x2, area 4), Magenta (4x6, area 24), Gray (3x4, area 12), Green (2x2, area 4). Output keeps Orange, Azure, Magenta, Gray. It removes Blue and Green. Here, Orange and Magenta share the maximum area (24). The removed objects (Blue, Green) are the ones touching the top and bottom edges of the grid, respectively. The kept objects do not touch the top or bottom edges.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input has Red (L-shape, area 5), Maroon (complex shape, area 15), Yellow (T-shape, area 5). Output keeps only Maroon. Maroon has the unique maximum area.\n5.  **Core Logic:** The decision of which objects to keep seems to depend on two conditions: (a) whether an object has the maximum area compared to others, and (b) whether there's a tie for the maximum area. If the maximum area is unique to one object, only that object is kept. If multiple objects share the maximum area, a different rule applies: objects touching the top or bottom border are removed, and all others are kept.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
