task_description: Select a single color value from a 1xN input grid based on color frequency and median position of least frequent colors.
input_format: A grid (list of lists or NumPy array) with exactly one row containing colors (integers 0-9).
output_format: A single integer representing the selected color.
elements:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D structure containing a single row of colors.
  - type: color_list
    description: The sequence of colors extracted from the single row of the input grid.
  - type: color
    description: Individual items in the list are colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - type: frequency_map
    description: A mapping from each unique color in the color_list to its count.
  - type: minimum_frequency
    description: The lowest frequency count among all colors present in the color_list.
  - type: least_frequent_colors
    description: The set of colors that appear with the minimum_frequency.
  - type: index_list
    description: A list containing the original 0-based indices of all occurrences of the least_frequent_colors within the color_list.
  - type: sorted_index_list
    description: The index_list sorted in ascending order.
  - type: median_position
    description: The index within the sorted_index_list corresponding to its median element (calculated as floor((length - 1) / 2)).
  - type: target_index
    description: The numerical value stored at the median_position within the sorted_index_list. This value is an index pointing into the original color_list.
  - type: output_color
    description: The single color value located at the target_index in the original color_list.
