  """
  Selects a single color from an input list based on frequency and positional criteria.
  1. Counts the frequency of each color in the input list.
  2. Finds the minimum frequency among all colors present.
  3. Identifies all colors that appear with this minimum frequency.
  4. Collects the original 0-based indices of all occurrences of these least frequent colors from the input list.
  5. Sorts these collected indices in ascending order.
  6. Determines the median position within the sorted list of indices. For a list of n indices, this is the index at position floor((n-1)/2).
  7. Retrieves the index value stored at this median position in the sorted list. This value represents the target index in the original input list.
  8. Returns the color found at this target index in the original input list.
