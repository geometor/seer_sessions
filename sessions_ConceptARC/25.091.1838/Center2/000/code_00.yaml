task_description: Select a single color from an input list based on frequency and positional criteria.
elements:
  - type: list
    description: Input is a 1D list of colors (integers 0-9).
  - type: color
    description: Individual items in the list are colors represented by integers.
  - type: frequency
    description: The number of times each color appears in the input list.
  - type: position
    description: The index (0-based) of each color within the input list.
  - type: output_color
    description: The single color selected as the output.
properties:
  - property: minimum_frequency
    description: The lowest frequency count among all colors present in the input list.
relationships:
  - relationship: selection_criteria
    description: The output color is one of the colors having the minimum frequency in the input list.
  - relationship: tie_breaking
    description: If multiple colors have the minimum frequency, their original positions in the input list are considered. The color at the median position among these specific occurrences is chosen as the output.
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: count_frequencies
    input: input list
    output: frequency map (color -> count)
  - step: 2
    action: find_minimum_frequency
    input: frequency map
    output: minimum frequency value
  - step: 3
    action: identify_least_frequent_colors
    inputs:
      - frequency map
      - minimum frequency value
    output: list of colors with minimum frequency
  - step: 4
    action: collect_indices
    inputs:
      - input list
      - list of least frequent colors
    output: list of indices where least frequent colors appear in the input list
  - step: 5
    action: sort_indices
    input: list of indices
    output: sorted list of indices
  - step: 6
    action: find_median_index_position
    input: sorted list of indices
    output: index corresponding to the median position within the sorted list
  - step: 7
    action: get_median_index_value
    inputs:
      - sorted list of indices
      - median index position
    output: the actual index value from the input list that corresponds to the median position
  - step: 8
    action: select_output_color
    inputs:
      - input list
      - median index value
    output: the color at the median index in the original input list
