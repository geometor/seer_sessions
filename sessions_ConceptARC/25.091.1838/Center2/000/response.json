The output color often corresponds to one of the least frequent colors.\n5.  **Positional Analysis:** When multiple colors share the minimum frequency, their positions (indices) in the original list appear to be used to break the tie. Specifically, the color located at the median position among all occurrences of the least frequent colors is selected.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
