The noise pixels are replaced by the most common color found within their respective row or column, depending on the overall pattern orientation.\n\n    *   In `train_1`, the input grid shows horizontal stripes (yellow and green rows) with some magenta pixels interspersed, primarily within the green rows but also one in a yellow row. The output grid replaces these magenta pixels with the dominant color of the row they belong to (green for green rows, yellow for the yellow row). The dominant pattern is row-based.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input grid shows vertical stripes (orange and red columns) with some gray pixels interspersed. The output grid replaces these gray pixels with the dominant color of the column they belong to (orange for orange columns, red for red columns). The dominant pattern is column-based.\n\n    The core logic seems to be:\n    1.  Determine whether the grid's primary structure is row-based or column-based by comparing the color homogeneity within rows versus columns.\n    2.  Identify the \"noise\" pixels, which are those whose color does not match the majority color of their respective row (if row-based) or column (if column-based).\n    3.  Replace each noise pixel with the majority color of its row or column, according to the determined orientation.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
