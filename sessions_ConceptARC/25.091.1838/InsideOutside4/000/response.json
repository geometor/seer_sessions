These objects often form nested structures or frames.\n4.  **Key Pixel:** A single magenta pixel (color 6) appears in a specific location within the nested structures in each input grid.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed involves conditionally changing the color of the single magenta pixel to white (0). In some examples, the grid remains unchanged.\n6.  **Condition:** The change depends on the colors of the objects immediately surrounding the magenta pixel. Specifically, it seems related to the color pair of the innermost object containing the magenta pixel and the next object containing the innermost one.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"

If there isn't exactly one magenta pixel, return the input grid unchanged. Let the location of this pixel be `P`.\n2.  **Check Innermost Containment:** Determine the innermost object (`O_inner`) that completely encloses the magenta pixel `P`. This means any path from `P` travelling only through the background color (white, 0) cannot reach the grid boundary without hitting `O_inner`. If no such object exists (i.e., `P` can reach the boundary), return the input grid unchanged. Let the color of `O_inner` be `C_inner`.\n3.  **Check Next Outer Containment:** Determine the next object (`O_outer`) that completely encloses the object `O_inner`. This means any path starting from a pixel of `O_inner` and travelling only through the background color (white, 0) or the color `C_inner` cannot reach the grid boundary without hitting `O_outer`. If no such object `O_outer` exists, return the input grid unchanged. Let the color of `O_outer` be `C_outer`.\n4.  **Evaluate Condition:** Check if the colors `C_inner` and `C_outer` match specific pairs:\n    *   Is `C_inner` yellow (4) AND `C_outer` red (2)?\n    *   OR is `C_inner` blue (1) AND `C_outer` green (3)?\n5.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   If either condition in step 4 is true, create a copy of the input grid, change the color of the pixel at location `P` to white (0), and return this modified grid.\n    *   Otherwise (if neither condition is true), return the input grid unchanged."
