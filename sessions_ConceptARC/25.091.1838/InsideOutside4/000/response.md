**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. These objects often form nested structures or frames.
4.  **Key Pixel:** A single magenta pixel (color 6) appears in a specific location within the nested structures in each input grid.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation observed involves conditionally changing the color of the single magenta pixel to white (0). In some examples, the grid remains unchanged.
6.  **Condition:** The change depends on the colors of the objects immediately surrounding the magenta pixel. Specifically, it seems related to the color pair of the innermost object containing the magenta pixel and the next object containing the innermost one.

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
task_description: "Conditionally change a single magenta pixel based on the colors of its two innermost containing objects."

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9."
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - element: background
    value: 0 (white)
    description: "The default color filling empty space."
  - element: object
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color."
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the object.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
      - connectivity: Usually 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity (appears to be 8-connectivity here based on how objects enclose).
  - element: target_pixel
    description: "The specific pixel being evaluated for transformation."
    properties:
      - color: 6 (magenta)
      - uniqueness: Appears to be exactly one such pixel in relevant inputs.
  - element: containing_object
    description: "An object that encloses a given pixel or another object."
    relation: "A pixel P is contained within object O if any path from P to the grid border must intersect O."

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: target_pixel (magenta, 6)
    condition: "Must be exactly one magenta pixel present."
  - action: identify_containment
    target: target_pixel
    details: "Determine the sequence of nested objects containing the target_pixel. Need at least two levels of containment."
    outputs:
      - innermost_object: O_inner (Color: C_inner)
      - next_outer_object: O_outer (Color: C_outer)
  - action: conditional_change
    target: target_pixel
    condition: "(C_inner == 4 (yellow) AND C_outer == 2 (red)) OR (C_inner == 1 (blue) AND C_outer == 3 (green))"
    effect: "Change target_pixel color to 0 (white)."
  - action: no_change
    condition: "If the target_pixel is not found, not unique, not contained by at least two objects, or the color condition is not met."
    effect: "Output grid is identical to the input grid."

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Target:** Find the unique pixel with the color magenta (6) in the input grid. If there isn't exactly one magenta pixel, return the input grid unchanged. Let the location of this pixel be `P`.
2.  **Check Innermost Containment:** Determine the innermost object (`O_inner`) that completely encloses the magenta pixel `P`. This means any path from `P` travelling only through the background color (white, 0) cannot reach the grid boundary without hitting `O_inner`. If no such object exists (i.e., `P` can reach the boundary), return the input grid unchanged. Let the color of `O_inner` be `C_inner`.
3.  **Check Next Outer Containment:** Determine the next object (`O_outer`) that completely encloses the object `O_inner`. This means any path starting from a pixel of `O_inner` and travelling only through the background color (white, 0) or the color `C_inner` cannot reach the grid boundary without hitting `O_outer`. If no such object `O_outer` exists, return the input grid unchanged. Let the color of `O_outer` be `C_outer`.
4.  **Evaluate Condition:** Check if the colors `C_inner` and `C_outer` match specific pairs:
    *   Is `C_inner` yellow (4) AND `C_outer` red (2)?
    *   OR is `C_inner` blue (1) AND `C_outer` green (3)?
5.  **Apply Transformation:**
    *   If either condition in step 4 is true, create a copy of the input grid, change the color of the pixel at location `P` to white (0), and return this modified grid.
    *   Otherwise (if neither condition is true), return the input grid unchanged.
