Transformation Rule:
Conditionally change a single unique magenta pixel (color 6) to white (color 0)
based on the colors of its two innermost enclosing non-background objects.

1. Locate the unique magenta pixel (P, color 6). If not found or not unique, return the input grid.
2. Find the background region (color 0) immediately adjacent to P using flood fill (BFS) starting from a background neighbor of P.
3. Identify the color (C_inner) of the object forming the immediate boundary of this background region (excluding color 6). The fill must not reach the grid boundary, and C_inner must be unique. If not, return the input grid.
4. Find the background region (color 0) immediately adjacent to the C_inner object using flood fill starting from a background neighbor of any C_inner pixel.
5. Identify the color (C_outer) of the object forming the immediate boundary of this second background region (excluding C_inner). The fill must not reach the grid boundary, and C_outer must be unique. If not, return the input grid.
6. Check if the color pair (C_inner, C_outer) matches specific conditions:
   - (Yellow=4, Red=2) OR
   - (Blue=1, Green=3)
7. If a condition is met, change the magenta pixel P to white (0) in a copy of the grid and return the copy.
8. Otherwise, return the original input grid unchanged.
