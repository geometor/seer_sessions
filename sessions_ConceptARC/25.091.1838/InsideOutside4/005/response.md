"""
Conditionally changes a single unique magenta pixel (color 6) to white (color 0)
based on the colors of the two closest enclosing objects found by exploring outwards 
through adjacent background pixels using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Transformation Steps:
1. Locate the unique magenta pixel (P). Exit if not found or not unique.
2. Find the first non-background, non-magenta color (C_inner) encountered by BFS starting 
   from a background neighbor of P, exploring only background. Exit if none found.
3. Find the first non-background color (C_outer) encountered by BFS starting from a 
   background neighbor of any C_inner pixel, exploring only background. C_outer must not be C_inner or magenta. Exit if none found.
4. Check if (C_inner=4, C_outer=2) or (C_inner=1, C_outer=3).
5. If the condition holds, change pixel P to white (0). Otherwise, make no change.
