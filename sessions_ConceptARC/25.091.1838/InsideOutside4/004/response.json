            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed on examples where the transformation *should* have occurred (Examples 2 and 4). The debugging trace revealed that the initial flood fill (from a background neighbor of the magenta pixel) identified a boundary containing pixels from *both* the intended inner object and the outer object. This led to the `get_unique_colors` step finding multiple candidate colors for `C_inner` (after excluding the target magenta color), causing the function to exit prematurely and return the original grid.\n\nThe core issue lies in reliably identifying the \"innermost\" and \"next outer\" objects based solely on the boundary colors of a single flood fill. The strategy needs refinement to explicitly find the *first* distinct object encountered when exploring outwards from the target pixel's vicinity, and then repeating the process outwards from that first object.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  Implement a BFS-based search outwards from the background adjacent to the target pixel (P) to find the *first* non-background, non-target color encountered (`C_inner`).\n2.  Implement a second BFS-based search outwards from the background adjacent to the `C_inner` object to find the *first* non-background color that isn't `C_inner` or the target color (`C_outer`).\n3.  This approach prioritizes proximity and should correctly identify the nested layers even if the background regions connect in complex ways.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed (Incorrect Prediction). Expected: No change. Code Output: No change. **Previous Code Result: Correct.** Debug Info: C_inner=3, C_outer=1. Condition (1,3) or (4,2) not met.\n*   **Example 2:** Failed (Incorrect Prediction). Expected: Magenta->White. Code Output: No change. **Previous Code Result: Incorrect.** Debug Info: Fill 1 boundary colors {2, 4, 6}. Filtered {2, 4}.
