task_description: "Conditionally change a single magenta pixel to white based on the colors of its two innermost enclosing objects."

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9."
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - element: background
    value: 0 (white)
    description: "The default color filling empty space."
  - element: object
    description: "A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color."
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the object.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
  - element: target_pixel
    description: "The specific pixel being evaluated for transformation."
    properties:
      - color: 6 (magenta)
      - uniqueness: Must be exactly one such pixel in the grid.
  - element: container_relationship
    description: "How one object encloses another or a pixel."
    determination_method: "Flood Fill (BFS)"
    steps:
      - step: "Containment Check 1 (Pixel -> Inner Object)"
        start_point: target_pixel position
        traversable_colors: {0 (white), 6 (magenta)}
        boundary_condition: "Fill MUST NOT reach grid boundary."
        output: adjacent_pixels_1 (pixels neighboring the filled area but not traversable)
        container_color_derivation: "C_inner is the single unique non-background color present in adjacent_pixels_1. If zero or multiple colors, containment fails."
      - step: "Containment Check 2 (Inner Object -> Outer Object)"
        start_point: Any pixel belonging to C_inner that was identified in adjacent_pixels_1.
        traversable_colors: {0 (white), C_inner}
        boundary_condition: "Fill MUST NOT reach grid boundary."
        output: adjacent_pixels_2 (pixels neighboring the filled area but not traversable)
        container_color_derivation: "C_outer is the single unique non-background color present in adjacent_pixels_2. If zero or multiple colors, containment fails."

transformation:
  - action: locate
    target: target_pixel (magenta, 6)
    condition: "Exactly one magenta pixel must exist."
    failure_action: "Return input grid unchanged."
  - action: determine_inner_container
    method: "Containment Check 1 (see container_relationship)"
    outputs: C_inner
    failure_action: "Return input grid unchanged."
  - action: determine_outer_container
    method: "Containment Check 2 (see container_relationship)"
    inputs: C_inner
    outputs: C_outer
    failure_action: "Return input grid unchanged."
  - action: evaluate_condition
    condition: "(C_inner == 4 (yellow) AND C_outer == 2 (red)) OR (C_inner == 1 (blue) AND C_outer == 3 (green))"
  - action: apply_change
    condition: "evaluate_condition is true."
    effect: "Create copy of input grid, change target_pixel color to 0 (white), return copy."
  - action: no_change
    condition: "evaluate_condition is false."
    effect: "Return input grid unchanged."

implementation_note: "Previous code attempt failed to correctly derive C_inner and C_outer in some cases (Examples 2, 4), indicating potential issues in the flood fill's identification of adjacent boundary pixels or the interpretation thereof. Careful implementation of the 'container_color_derivation' step is crucial."
