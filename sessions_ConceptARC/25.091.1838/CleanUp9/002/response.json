            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: finding the most frequent non-background color and drawing a frame based on its location. However, the simple bounding box approach failed for the second example (`train_2`). The discrepancy arose because the output frame in `train_2` was smaller (specifically, one row shorter) than the bounding box containing *all* pixels of the most frequent color (gray, 5) in the input.\n\nThe failure indicates a more nuanced rule for determining the final frame's boundaries. The updated strategy involves iteratively refining the bounding box. We start with the box enclosing all pixels of the most frequent color. Then, we check pixels lying on the current box's perimeter. If a perimeter pixel is \"isolated\" (i.e., it's the *only* pixel of the frame color on its row or column *within the current box's extent*), it is discarded. This process repeats, potentially shrinking the box, until no more perimeter pixels are isolated. The final, potentially shrunk, bounding box defines the output frame.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were calculated to compare the bounding box of the most frequent color in the input (`input_bbox`) versus the bounding box defined by the output frame (`output_bbox`).\n\n"
