task_type: object_transformation # Could also be considered pattern generation based on input features

components:
  - role: input_grid
    attributes:
      - grid_dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_colors: multiple, variable
      - key_feature: distribution of pixels for one specific non-background color (frame_color)

  - role: output_grid
    attributes:
      - grid_dimensions: same as input_grid
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_colors: single color (frame_color from input)
      - structure: hollow rectangle defined by the frame_color

actions:
  - identify_frame_color:
      description: Determine the non-background color with the highest pixel count in the input grid.
      input: input_grid
      output: frame_color (e.g., blue(1) or gray(5))
  - calculate_bounding_box:
      description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing any pixel of the frame_color.
      input: input_grid, frame_color
      output: bounding_box {min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col}
  - generate_output_grid:
      description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
      input: input_grid_dimensions
      output: initial_output_grid
  - draw_hollow_rectangle:
      description: Set the pixels along the perimeter defined by the bounding_box to the frame_color on the output grid.
      input: initial_output_grid, bounding_box, frame_color
      output: final_output_grid

relationships:
  - The frame_color in the output is determined by the most frequent non-background color in the input.
  - The position and size of the hollow rectangle in the output are determined by the bounding box of the frame_color pixels in the input.
  - All pixels in the output grid are either the background color (white) or the frame_color.
