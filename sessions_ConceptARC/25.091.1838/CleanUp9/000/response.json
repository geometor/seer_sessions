The output grids use only two colors: white (0) as the background and one other color (blue (1) in train_1, gray (5) in train_2).\n3.  **Dominant Color:** In each input grid, there appears to be one non-white color that is more frequent than others (blue in train_1, gray in train_2). Let's call this the \"frame color\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the spatial extent (bounding box) of the frame color pixels in the input.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output consists of a hollow rectangle drawn using the frame color, positioned according to the bounding box derived from the input. The interior of the rectangle and the area outside the rectangle are filled with the background color (white).\n6.  **Other Colors:** All input colors other than the identified frame color and the background color are discarded or overwritten in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Analyze the input grid to find the non-background color (any color other than white, 0) that appears most frequently. Designate this color as the `frame_color`.\n3.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the `frame_color`.\n4.  Determine the bounding box enclosing all `frame_color` pixels found in step 3. This involves finding the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among these pixels.\n5.  Modify the output grid: For all pixels lying on the perimeter of the bounding box calculated in step 4, change their color to the `frame_color`. Specifically:\n    *   Set pixels at `(min_row, c)` to `frame_color` for `c` from `min_col` to `max_col`.\n    *   Set pixels at `(max_row, c)` to `frame_color` for `c` from `min_col` to `max_col`.\n    *   Set pixels at `(r, min_col)` to `frame_color` for `r` from `min_row` to `max_row`.\n    *   Set pixels at `(r, max_col)` to `frame_color` for `r` from `min_row` to `max_row`.\n6.  Ensure all other pixels in the output grid (those inside the hollow rectangle and those outside the bounding box) remain the background color (white, 0).\n7.  Return the modified output grid."
