Each shape typically has an outer \"frame\" of one color and an inner \"center\" area of another color. The output is a single color value (represented as a 1x1 grid). The relationship between the input and output appears to involve identifying a property common to multiple shapes within the input grid. Specifically, the output color corresponds to the color that appears most frequently as the \"center\" color within the identified shapes.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
