*   **Perception:** The task takes an input grid containing multiple distinct shapes, often resembling squares or rectangles, composed of non-white colors. Each shape typically has an outer "frame" of one color and an inner "center" area of another color. The output is a single color value (represented as a 1x1 grid). The relationship between the input and output appears to involve identifying a property common to multiple shapes within the input grid. Specifically, the output color corresponds to the color that appears most frequently as the "center" color within the identified shapes.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: property_identification
    input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - definition: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels, often forming a closed frame around a different non-white color.
          - properties:
              - frame_color: The color forming the outer boundary of the object.
              - center_color: The color enclosed within the frame. Multiple pixels of the same center color might exist.
    output_features:
      - grid: 1x1 array containing a single integer (color)
      - derivation: Represents the most frequently occurring 'center_color' among all identified objects in the input grid.
    relationship: Count the occurrences of each unique 'center_color' across all objects. The output color is the 'center_color' with the highest count.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify distinct objects. An object consists of a contiguous block of non-white pixels where an outer frame of one color encloses an inner area (center) of a different non-white color. Ignore the white background pixels.
    2.  For each identified object, determine the color of the pixels forming the inner center.
    3.  Create a list of all center colors found across all objects.
    4.  Count the frequency of each unique color in the list of center colors.
    5.  Identify the color that has the highest frequency count.
    6.  The output is this most frequent center color.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

"""
Identify distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined by a center 
pixel (or pixels) of one color completely surrounded (8 neighbors) by pixels 
of a single, different, non-white color (the frame color). Count the occurrences 
of each unique center color found across all such objects. The output is a 1x1 
grid containing the center color that occurs most frequently. In case of a tie 
in frequency, the color with the highest numerical value is chosen.
