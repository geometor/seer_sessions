"""
Identify distinct contiguous non-white regions (blobs) in the input grid. 
For each blob, determine if it consists of exactly two non-white colors where 
one color (the center color) is topologically enclosed by the other color (the 
frame color). A color is considered enclosed if all its pixels within the blob 
only have neighbors (8-connectivity) that are either the background color (0), 
the frame color, or the center color itself. Collect all identified center 
colors from all such valid frame/center blobs. The final output is a 1x1 grid 
containing the center color that appears most frequently across all identified 
blobs. If there is a tie in frequency, the color with the highest numerical 
value is chosen.
