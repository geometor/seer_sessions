task_type: property_identification
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - definition: Contiguous regions (blobs) of non-white pixels.
      - relevant_object_type: "Frame/Center Blobs"
      - properties:
          - Must contain exactly two distinct non-white colors. Let these be C1 and C2.
          - One color (C_center) must be topologically enclosed by the other color (C_frame).
          - Topological Enclosure Rule: Every pixel of C_center must have all its 8 neighbors colored *only* with C_center or C_frame. No neighbor can be the background color (0) or any other color.
          - center_color: The color C_center that satisfies the enclosure rule.
          - frame_color: The color C_frame that encloses C_center.
output_features:
  - grid: 1x1 array containing a single integer (color)
  - derivation: Represents the 'center_color' that appears most frequently across all identified "Frame/Center Blobs" in the input grid.
relationship:
  - Find all distinct contiguous non-white blobs.
  - For each blob, check if it qualifies as a "Frame/Center Blob":
      - Contains exactly two non-white colors, C1 and C2.
      - Check if C1 is topologically enclosed by C2 using the rule above.
      - Check if C2 is topologically enclosed by C1 using the rule above.
      - If exactly one color is enclosed by the other, identify the enclosed color as the 'center_color' for this blob.
  - Collect all identified 'center_color' values.
  - Count the frequency of each unique 'center_color'.
  - The output color is the 'center_color' with the highest frequency.
  - Tie-breaking: If multiple colors share the highest frequency, choose the color with the largest numerical value.
