"""
Identify distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined by a center 
pixel (or pixels) of one color completely surrounded (8 neighbors) by pixels 
of a single, different, non-white color (the frame color). Count the occurrences 
of each unique center color found across all such objects. The output is a 1x1 
grid containing the center color that occurs most frequently. In case of a tie 
in frequency, the color with the highest numerical value is chosen.
