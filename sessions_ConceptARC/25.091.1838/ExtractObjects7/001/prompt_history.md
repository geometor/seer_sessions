Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Separators:** The input grids contain distinct lines that act as separators between different regions or objects. In `train_1`, this is a vertical green (3) line. In `train_2`, it's two horizontal magenta (6) lines. The background color (white, 0) is generally ignored except when it forms the border *around* the main shapes.
2.  **Objects:** The primary elements are contiguous blocks of color other than the background and the separator color.
    *   `train_1`: A blue (1) rectangle and a yellow (4) 'C' shape.
    *   `train_2`: A green (3) diamond and a gray (5) rectangle.
3.  **Actions:**
    *   **Identification:** Separators and objects are identified.
    *   **Extraction/Isolation:** The objects are extracted from the input grid, removing the separator, background, and any surrounding white space that isn't part of the object itself (like the hole in the yellow 'C').
    *   **Cropping (Conditional):** In `train_1` (vertical separator), the top row of each extracted object is removed. This doesn't happen in `train_2` (horizontal separator).
    *   **Joining/Concatenation:** The processed objects are joined together. Horizontally if the separator was vertical (`train_1`), vertically if the separator was horizontal (`train_2`). The original relative order (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) is maintained.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Combine objects separated by a specific colored line, potentially cropping them based on separator orientation.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_separator: true
      - contains_objects: true

  - type: separator
    properties:
      - color: green (3) or magenta (6)
      - shape: line (vertical or horizontal)
      - function: divides the grid into distinct regions containing objects

  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: varies (blue, yellow, green, gray in examples)
      - shape: contiguous block of a single color (excluding background and separator colors)
      - location: positioned relative to the separator (e.g., left/right, above/below)

transformations:
  - action: identify_separator
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: separator_color, separator_orientation (vertical/horizontal)

  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid, separator_color
    outputs: list_of_objects (each object represented as a subgrid or bounding box)

  - action: filter_and_extract_objects
    inputs: list_of_objects
    description: Remove separator pixels and surrounding background pixels from the bounding box of each object.

  - action: conditional_crop
    inputs: extracted_objects, separator_orientation
    description: >
      If the separator_orientation is vertical, remove the top row from each extracted object's grid.
      If the separator_orientation is horizontal, do not crop.
    outputs: processed_objects

  - action: concatenate_objects
    inputs: processed_objects, separator_orientation
    description: >
      If the separator_orientation is vertical, join the processed objects horizontally in their original left-to-right order.
      If the separator_orientation is horizontal, join the processed objects vertically in their original top-to-bottom order.
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The separator divides the grid and determines the relative positioning of objects.
  - The separator's color and orientation dictate the specific processing steps (cropping) and the final concatenation direction.
  - The output grid's dimensions depend on the dimensions of the processed objects and the concatenation direction.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single-color line (either vertical or horizontal) that acts as a separator. Note its color (e.g., green or magenta) and orientation (vertical or horizontal).
2.  Identify the distinct, contiguous shapes (objects) on either side (if vertical separator) or above/below (if horizontal separator) of the separator line. Ignore the background color (white).
3.  Extract each identified object into its own minimal bounding box grid, excluding the separator line and any surrounding background color.
4.  **Conditional Step:** If the separator line identified in step 1 was **vertical**, remove the top row of pixels from *each* extracted object grid. If the separator line was **horizontal**, do not remove any rows or columns.
5.  Combine the processed object grids:
    *   If the separator was **vertical**, place the processed grid of the object originally on the left directly next to the processed grid of the object originally on the right (horizontal concatenation).
    *   If the separator was **horizontal**, place the processed grid of the object originally on top directly above the processed grid of the object originally below (vertical concatenation).
6.  The resulting combined grid is the final output.
