            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Separators:** The input grids contain distinct lines that act as separators between different regions or objects. In `train_1`, this is a vertical green (3) line. In `train_2`, it's two horizontal magenta (6) lines. The background color (white, 0) is generally ignored except when it forms the border *around* the main shapes.\n2.  **Objects:** The primary elements are contiguous blocks of color other than the background and the separator color.\n    *   `train_1`: A blue (1) rectangle and a yellow (4) 'C' shape.\n    *   `train_2`: A green (3) diamond and a gray (5) rectangle.\n3.  **Actions:**\n    *   **Identification:** Separators and objects are identified.\n    *   **Extraction/Isolation:** The objects are extracted from the input grid, removing the separator, background, and any surrounding white space that isn't part of the object itself (like the hole in the yellow 'C').\n    *   **Cropping (Conditional):** In `train_1` (vertical separator), the top row of each extracted object is removed. This doesn't happen in `train_2` (horizontal separator).\n    *   **Joining/Concatenation:** The processed objects are joined together. Horizontally if the separator was vertical (`train_1`), vertically if the separator was horizontal (`train_2`). The original relative order (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) is maintained.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
