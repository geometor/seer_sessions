task_description: Combine objects separated by a specific colored line, potentially cropping them based on separator orientation.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_separator: true
      - contains_objects: true

  - type: separator
    properties:
      - color: green (3) or magenta (6)
      - shape: line (vertical or horizontal)
      - function: divides the grid into distinct regions containing objects

  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: varies (blue, yellow, green, gray in examples)
      - shape: contiguous block of a single color (excluding background and separator colors)
      - location: positioned relative to the separator (e.g., left/right, above/below)

transformations:
  - action: identify_separator
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: separator_color, separator_orientation (vertical/horizontal)

  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid, separator_color
    outputs: list_of_objects (each object represented as a subgrid or bounding box)

  - action: filter_and_extract_objects
    inputs: list_of_objects
    description: Remove separator pixels and surrounding background pixels from the bounding box of each object.

  - action: conditional_crop
    inputs: extracted_objects, separator_orientation
    description: >
      If the separator_orientation is vertical, remove the top row from each extracted object's grid.
      If the separator_orientation is horizontal, do not crop.
    outputs: processed_objects

  - action: concatenate_objects
    inputs: processed_objects, separator_orientation
    description: >
      If the separator_orientation is vertical, join the processed objects horizontally in their original left-to-right order.
      If the separator_orientation is horizontal, join the processed objects vertically in their original top-to-bottom order.
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - The separator divides the grid and determines the relative positioning of objects.
  - The separator's color and orientation dictate the specific processing steps (cropping) and the final concatenation direction.
  - The output grid's dimensions depend on the dimensions of the processed objects and the concatenation direction.
