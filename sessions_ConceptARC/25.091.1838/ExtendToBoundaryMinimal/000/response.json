The transformation involves extending the single yellow pixel either horizontally across its entire row or vertically down its entire column.\n\nObserving the examples:\n- In `train_1`, the yellow pixel is at (row 2, col 0). The output fills row 2 with yellow.\n- In `train_2`, the yellow pixel is at (row 5, col 4). The output fills column 4 with yellow.\n- In `train_3`, the yellow pixel is at (row 0, col 2). The output fills column 2 with yellow.\n- In `train_4`, the yellow pixel is at (row 4, col 0). The output fills row 4 with yellow.\n\nThe pattern seems to be: if the single yellow pixel is located in the first column (column index 0), then the entire row containing that pixel is filled with yellow. Otherwise (if the yellow pixel is in any column other than the first), the entire column containing that pixel is filled with yellow.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
