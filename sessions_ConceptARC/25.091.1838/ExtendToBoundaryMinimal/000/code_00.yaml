  input_objects:
    - object_type: single_pixel
      color: yellow (4)
      quantity: 1
      location: Variable, one per input grid.
  output_objects:
    - object_type: line

      orientation: horizontal (row) or vertical (column)
      location: Determined by the input pixel's location.
transformation_rule:
  trigger_condition: Location of the single yellow pixel in the input grid.
  action_based_on_condition:
    - condition: The yellow pixel is in column 0.
      action: Fill the entire row containing the yellow pixel with yellow.
    - condition: The yellow pixel is NOT in column 0.
