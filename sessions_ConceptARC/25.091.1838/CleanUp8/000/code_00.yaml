Task: Preserve 2x2 blocks
Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Contains scattered pixels of various colors (1-9) on a white (0) background.
    - Dimensions observed: 10x10 (in examples)
Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Contains only the pixels that were part of a 2x2 block in the input.
    - All other pixels are white (0).
Objects:
  - Name: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color (integer 0-9)
      - Position (row, column)
  - Name: 2x2_Block
    Definition: A set of four pixels at positions (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)
    Properties:
      - All four pixels must have the same non-white color (1-9).
      - Identified by its top-left corner position (r, c).
Transformation:
  Action: Filter pixels based on 2x2 block membership.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all unique 2x2_Blocks in the input grid.
    2. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0).
    3. For each identified 2x2_Block in the input, copy its four pixels (color and position) to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - A pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid if and only if it was part of at least one 2x2_Block in the input grid.
  - Otherwise, the output pixel is set to white (0).
