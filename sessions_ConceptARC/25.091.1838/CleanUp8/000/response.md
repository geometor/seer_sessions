**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10.
2.  **Color Palette:** Various colors (red, magenta, blue, green, yellow, gray, orange, azure, maroon) are present on a white background in the input. The output retains some of these colors but removes others, replacing them with white.
3.  **Key Feature:** The transformation focuses on identifying and preserving `2x2` blocks of uniform non-white color.
4.  **Transformation:** Pixels that are part of a solid `2x2` block of a single color in the input are kept in the output. All other pixels, including those non-white pixels not part of such a `2x2` block, are turned white (0) in the output.
5.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects are contiguous `2x2` squares where all four pixels share the same non-white color.
6.  **Rule Consistency:** Both examples demonstrate the same rule: find all `2x2` blocks of a single color and keep only those pixels in the output, setting everything else to white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Preserve 2x2 blocks
Input_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Contains scattered pixels of various colors (1-9) on a white (0) background.
    - Dimensions observed: 10x10 (in examples)
Output_Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Contains only the pixels that were part of a 2x2 block in the input.
    - All other pixels are white (0).
Objects:
  - Name: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color (integer 0-9)
      - Position (row, column)
  - Name: 2x2_Block
    Definition: A set of four pixels at positions (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1)
    Properties:
      - All four pixels must have the same non-white color (1-9).
      - Identified by its top-left corner position (r, c).
Transformation:
  Action: Filter pixels based on 2x2 block membership.
  Rule:
    1. Identify all unique 2x2_Blocks in the input grid.
    2. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0).
    3. For each identified 2x2_Block in the input, copy its four pixels (color and position) to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
Relationship:
  - A pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid if and only if it was part of at least one 2x2_Block in the input grid.
  - Otherwise, the output pixel is set to white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the "output grid") with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner position `(row, col)` in the input grid, excluding the last row and last column (i.e., `row` from 0 to height-2, `col` from 0 to width-2).
3.  For each `(row, col)`, examine the 2x2 square of pixels starting at this position: `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)`.
4.  Check if all four pixels in this 2x2 square have the *same* color and if this color is *not* the background color (white, 0).
5.  If the condition in step 4 is true (it's a solid, non-white 2x2 block), then copy the color of these four pixels from the input grid to the corresponding positions `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)` in the output grid.
6.  After checking all possible top-left corners, the output grid contains the final result.
