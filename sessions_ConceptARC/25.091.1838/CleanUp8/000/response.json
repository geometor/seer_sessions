The output retains some of these colors but removes others, replacing them with white.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The transformation focuses on identifying and preserving `2x2` blocks of uniform non-white color.\n4.  **Transformation:** Pixels that are part of a solid `2x2` block of a single color in the input are kept in the output. All other pixels, including those non-white pixels not part of such a `2x2` block, are turned white (0) in the output.\n5.  **Object Identification:** The relevant objects are contiguous `2x2` squares where all four pixels share the same non-white color.\n6.  **Rule Consistency:** Both examples demonstrate the same rule: find all `2x2` blocks of a single color and keep only those pixels in the output, setting everything else to white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all unique 2x2_Blocks in the input grid.\n    2. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with white (0).\n    3. For each identified 2x2_Block in the input, copy its four pixels (color and position) to the corresponding positions in the output grid.\nRelationship:\n  - A pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid if and only if it was part of at least one 2x2_Block in the input grid.\n  - Otherwise, the output pixel is set to white (0).\n```"

Create a new grid (the \"output grid\") with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner position `(row, col)` in the input grid, excluding the last row and last column (i.e., `row` from 0 to height-2, `col` from 0 to width-2).\n3.  For each `(row, col)`, examine the 2x2 square of pixels starting at this position: `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)`.\n4.  Check if all four pixels in this 2x2 square have the *same* color and if this color is *not* the background color (white, 0).\n5.  If the condition in step 4 is true (it's a solid, non-white 2x2 block), then copy the color of these four pixels from the input grid to the corresponding positions `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)` in the output grid.\n6.  After checking all possible top-left corners, the output grid contains the final result."
