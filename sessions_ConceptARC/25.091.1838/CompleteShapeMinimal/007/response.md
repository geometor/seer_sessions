```python
"""
Identifies connected components of white pixels (color 0).
If a white component is fully enclosed (does not touch the grid border) 
and has a size of 1 or 2 pixels, it fills the pixels of that component 
with the single non-white color found in the input grid's shape.
Connectivity is determined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
Assumes there is only one non-white color used in the main shape.
