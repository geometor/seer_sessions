            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, based on the rule \"fill white pixels with 3 or 4 neighbors of the dominant color,\" successfully transformed examples 1 and 3 but failed on example 2. In example 2, the white pixels `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)` needed to be filled with magenta (6), but they only had 1 magenta neighbor each, causing the rule to fail.\n\nThe successful examples (1 and 3) involved filling white pixels that *did* satisfy the >= 3 neighbor condition. Example 1 also involved filling a 1x2 horizontal white block, similar to example 2.\n\nThis suggests the transformation rule needs to account for at least two conditions:\n1.  Filling white pixels that are sufficiently surrounded by the dominant color (like in Ex 1 and 3).\n2.  Filling small (1x2 or 2x1) white blocks that bridge between two pixels of the dominant color, even if the white pixels themselves aren't heavily surrounded (as seen in Ex 2 and potentially applicable to Ex 1 as well).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program to incorporate both these conditions. We need a rule that fills white pixels based on either having many neighbors of the dominant color OR being part of a small white \"bridge\" between dominant color pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the specific white pixels that are filled in each example:\n\n"
