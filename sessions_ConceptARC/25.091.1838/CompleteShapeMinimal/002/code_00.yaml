task_description: Fill small gaps (color 0) within a larger shape defined by a single dominant non-white color.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8)
  - object: shape
    properties:
      - comprised_of: pixels of a single dominant non-white color (C)
      - location: forms a contiguous or near-contiguous pattern within the grid
  - object: background
    properties:
      - comprised_of: pixels of white color (0)
      - location: surrounds the shape and may exist as holes within the shape
  - object: hole
    properties:
      - comprised_of: one or more connected white pixels (0)
      - location: inside the general area of the shape
      - criteria_for_filling: seems related to local neighborhood (number of neighbors of color C)

actions:
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: color C (the single non-white color present in the shape)
    description: Scan the grid to find the value C used by the main shape.
  - action: identify_candidate_pixels
    input: input_grid, color C
    output: list of coordinates (r, c) of white pixels
    description: Find all pixels with value 0.
  - action: check_neighbors
    input: coordinate (r, c), input_grid, color C
    output: count of neighbors (4-way adjacency) with color C
    description: For a given white pixel, count how many of its direct neighbors match the dominant color C.
  - action: fill_pixel
    input: output_grid, coordinate (r, c), color C
    output: modified output_grid
    description: Change the color of the pixel at (r, c) to C.

transformation_rule:
  - step: Determine the dominant non-white color (C) from the input grid.
  - step: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - step: Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - step: If the pixel at (r, c) is white (0):
    - sub_step: Count how many of its 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have the color C.
    - sub_step: If the count is 3 or more, change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to C.
  - step: Return the modified output grid.
