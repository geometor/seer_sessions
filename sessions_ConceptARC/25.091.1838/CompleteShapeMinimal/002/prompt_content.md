"""
Identifies small connected components of white pixels (color 0) that do not 
touch the grid border and fills them with the surrounding non-white color. 
A component is considered 'small' if it contains 1 or 2 pixels.
The surrounding non-white color is assumed to be the single dominant 
non-white color present in the input grid's shape.
Connectivity is determined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
