task_description: Fill very small (1 or 2 pixel) internal holes within a larger shape defined by a single non-white color, leaving the main shape and larger holes unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - background_color: White (0) is the primary background.
  - shape_color: A single dominant non-white color (e.g., blue=1, magenta=6, green=3) defines the main object/pattern in each input grid.
objects:
  - object: Shape
    description: The contiguous or near-contiguous pattern formed by the dominant non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The single non-white color value defining the shape.
  - object: White Component
    description: A connected group of one or more white pixels (0), identified using 4-way adjacency.
    properties:
      - pixels: A list of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the component.
      - size: The total number of pixels in the component.
      - border_contact: A boolean flag indicating if any pixel in the component is located on the outermost rows or columns of the grid.
      - classification: Based on size and border_contact, components can be categorized as 'small internal hole' (size <= 2 AND border_contact=false), 'large internal hole' (size > 2 AND border_contact=false), or 'external/border-touching' (border_contact=true).
actions:
  - action: Identify Fill Color
    description: Find the single non-white color present in the input grid. Assume only one such color exists.
    input: Input grid.
    output: The non-white color value (fill_color).
  - action: Find White Components
    description: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or a similar algorithm to identify all connected components of white pixels (0), calculating size and border contact for each.
    input: Input grid.
    output: A list of white components, each described by its pixels, size, and border_contact status.
  - action: Filter for Fillable Holes
    description: Select only the white components that meet the specific filling criteria.
    input: List of all white components.
    criteria:
      - size is 1 or 2.
      - border_contact is false.
    output: List of components (specifically, their pixel coordinates) to be filled.
  - action: Apply Filling
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each pixel identified in the 'Fillable Holes' list, change its color in the copied grid from white (0) to the identified fill_color.
    input:
      - Input grid.
      - List of pixel coordinates to fill.
      - fill_color.
    output: Transformed output grid.
