## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code execution failed to produce the correct output for training examples 2 and 3. The reported "Transformed Output" in the failure cases was identical or nearly identical to the input grid, suggesting the transformation logic either wasn't applied correctly or wasn't triggered due to an implementation flaw.

However, a detailed manual analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern across all three examples: small "holes" (connected white areas of size 1 or 2 pixels) that are fully enclosed within the main colored shape (i.e., do not touch the grid border) are filled with the shape's color. Larger internal white areas or white areas connected to the border remain unchanged.

This leads to the hypothesis: **The transformation identifies connected components of white pixels (color 0). If a component does not touch the grid border AND has a size of 1 or 2 pixels, it is filled with the dominant non-white color from the input grid.**

This hypothesis successfully explains the transformations in all provided training examples. The previous code's failure is likely due to an error in its implementation of this logic (e.g., in the component finding, size check, border check, or filling step) rather than an incorrect understanding of the underlying rule.

The strategy is to refine the implementation based on this specific rule, ensuring the component identification, size calculation, border detection, and conditional filling are performed accurately.

## Metrics

The following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs based on the proposed transformation rule:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Dominant Color | Changed Pixels | Filled Component(s) Details                       | Rule Consistent? |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- |
| 1       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 1 (blue)       | 2              | 1 component: size=2, border=false, pixels={(5,4),(5,5)} | Yes              |
| 2       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 6 (magenta)    | 2              | 1 component: size=2, border=false, pixels={(1,2),(1,3)} | Yes              |
| 3       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 3 (green)      | 3              | 3 components: {size=1, border=false, pixels={(1,5)}}, {size=1, border=false, pixels={(2,6)}}, {size=1, border=false, pixels={(3,2)}} | Yes              |

*Rule Consistency Check:* In all examples, every white component that was filled met the criteria (size <= 2 AND touches_border == false). No white components meeting these criteria were left unfilled. No white components violating these criteria (size > 2 OR touches_border == true) were filled. The rule holds for all training data.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill very small (1 or 2 pixel) internal holes within a larger shape defined by a single non-white color, leaving the main shape and larger holes unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids share the same dimensions.
  - background_color: White (0) is the primary background.
  - shape_color: A single dominant non-white color (e.g., blue=1, magenta=6, green=3) defines the main object/pattern in each input grid.
objects:
  - object: Shape
    description: The contiguous or near-contiguous pattern formed by the dominant non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The single non-white color value defining the shape.
  - object: White Component
    description: A connected group of one or more white pixels (0), identified using 4-way adjacency.
    properties:
      - pixels: A list of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the component.
      - size: The total number of pixels in the component.
      - border_contact: A boolean flag indicating if any pixel in the component is located on the outermost rows or columns of the grid.
      - classification: Based on size and border_contact, components can be categorized as 'small internal hole' (size <= 2 AND border_contact=false), 'large internal hole' (size > 2 AND border_contact=false), or 'external/border-touching' (border_contact=true).

    input: List of all white components.
    criteria:
      - size is 1 or 2.

    output: List of components (specifically, their pixel coordinates) to be filled.
  - action: Apply Filling
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each pixel identified in the 'Fillable Holes' list, change its color in the copied grid from white (0) to the identified fill_color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this copy will become the output grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find the single non-white color value present; designate this as the `fill_color`. If the grid contains only white (0), return the copy unchanged.
3.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a boolean grid of the same dimensions) to keep track of visited white pixels.
4.  Iterate through each pixel (`r`, `c`) of the input grid.
5.  If the current pixel (`r`, `c`) is white (0) and has not been visited:
    a.  Start a search (e.g., BFS) from this pixel to find all connected white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
    b.  During the search, record all pixels belonging to this component. Mark them as visited.
    c.  Keep track of the component's `size` (total number of pixels found).
    d.  Maintain a flag `touches_border`, setting it to `true` if any pixel found during the search is located at row 0, the last row, column 0, or the last column.
    e.  Once the search for the current component is complete, check if `size` is 1 or 2 AND `touches_border` is `false`.
    f.  If both conditions are true, iterate through all the pixels recorded for this component and change their color in the output grid copy to the `fill_color`.
6.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid copy.
