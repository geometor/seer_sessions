            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code execution failed to produce the correct output for training examples 2 and 3. The reported \"Transformed Output\" in the failure cases was identical or nearly identical to the input grid, suggesting the transformation logic either wasn't applied correctly or wasn't triggered due to an implementation flaw.\n\nHowever, a detailed manual analysis of the input/output pairs reveals a consistent pattern across all three examples: small \"holes\" (connected white areas of size 1 or 2 pixels) that are fully enclosed within the main colored shape (i.e., do not touch the grid border) are filled with the shape's color. Larger internal white areas or white areas connected to the border remain unchanged.\n\nThis leads to the hypothesis: **The transformation identifies connected components of white pixels (color 0). If a component does not touch the grid border AND has a size of 1 or 2 pixels, it is filled with the dominant non-white color from the input grid.**\n\nThis hypothesis successfully explains the transformations in all provided training examples. The previous code's failure is likely due to an error in its implementation of this logic (e.g., in the component finding, size check, border check, or filling step) rather than an incorrect understanding of the underlying rule.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the implementation based on this specific rule, ensuring the component identification, size calculation, border detection, and conditional filling are performed accurately.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs based on the proposed transformation rule:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Dominant Color | Changed Pixels | Filled Component(s) Details                       | Rule Consistent? |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- |\n| 1       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 1 (blue)       | 2              | 1 component: size=2, border=false, pixels={(5,4),(5,5)} | Yes              |\n| 2       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 6 (magenta)    | 2              | 1 component: size=2, border=false, pixels={(1,2),(1,3)} | Yes              |\n| 3       | (8, 8)      | (8, 8)       | 3 (green)      | 3              | 3 components: {size=1, border=false, pixels={(1,5)}}, {size=1, border=false, pixels={(2,6)}}, {size=1, border=false, pixels={(3,2)}} | Yes              |\n\n*Rule Consistency Check:* In all examples, every white component that was filled met the criteria (size <= 2 AND touches_border == false). No white components meeting these criteria were left unfilled. No white components violating these criteria (size > 2 OR touches_border == true) were filled. The rule holds for all training data.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
