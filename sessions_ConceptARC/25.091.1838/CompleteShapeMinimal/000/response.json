            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid of the same dimensions (8x8 in all provided examples).\n2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color. Each input grid features a prominent shape or pattern made of a single non-white color (blue=1, magenta=6, green=3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels (0) within the input grid to the non-white color present in that grid. The surrounding non-white shape and the white pixels outside this shape remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern:** The white pixels that are changed appear to be \"holes\" or \"gaps\" within the main colored shape.\n    *   In `train_1`, a 1x2 horizontal gap `(0 0)` within a blue rectangle is filled with blue.\n    *   In `train_2`, a 1x2 horizontal gap `(0 0)` in the *topmost row* of a hollow magenta structure is filled with magenta. Other internal white pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_3`, two separate single-pixel gaps `(0)` within a green shape are filled with green.\n5.  **Key Insight:** The transformation doesn't fill *all* internal white pixels.
