*   **Perception:** The input grids contain a single right-angled triangle composed of a non-white color, positioned against a white background. The triangle's orientation and position vary (bottom-left, top-left, bottom-right). The output is always a single row (a vector) filled with the same color as the input triangle. The length of the output row appears related to the dimensions of the input grid.

*   **Facts YAML:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Create a horizontal vector based on the input grid's properties.
    
    elements:
      - element: input_grid
        description: A square grid (NxN) containing a single right-angled triangle object and a background.
        properties:
          - size_N: The height/width of the grid (e.g., 5 for train_1/2, 9 for train_3).
          - background_color: Always white (0).
          - object:
              type: right-angled triangle
              color: A single non-white color (C) (e.g., blue(1), red(2), yellow(4)).
              size: Fills a triangular area within the NxN grid, with sides of length N along the grid edges.
              diagonal_length: N pixels.
    
      - element: output_grid
        description: A horizontal vector (1xL grid).
        properties:
          - height: Always 1.
          - width_L: Determined by the input grid's size N. Specifically, L = (N + 1) / 2.
          - color: Filled entirely with the color C from the input object.
    
    relationships:
      - relation: Color Preservation
        description: The color of the object in the input grid determines the color of the output grid.
      - relation: Size Transformation
        description: The dimension (N) of the input grid determines the width (L) of the output grid using the formula L = (N + 1) / 2.
    
    transformation:
      - step: 1
        action: Identify the non-white color (C) in the input grid.
      - step: 2
        action: Determine the dimension (N) of the input grid (height or width).
      - step: 3
        action: Calculate the output width (L) using the formula L = (N + 1) / 2.
      - step: 4
        action: Construct a 1xL grid filled with color C.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `object_color`) present in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the dimension `N` of the square input grid (either its height or width).
    3.  Calculate the required length `L` for the output grid using the formula `L = (N + 1) / 2`.
    4.  Create a new grid with 1 row and `L` columns.
    5.  Fill all cells of this new grid with the `object_color`.
    6.  This new grid is the output.
