"""
Identify regions enclosed by green (3) pixels.
If an enclosed region consists entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid, change all pixels within that region to yellow (4) in the output grid.
If an enclosed region contains at least one yellow (4) pixel in the input grid, determine the checkerboard parity ((row + col) % 2) of the yellow pixel(s). Then, change any white (0) pixel within that same region to yellow (4) if its coordinates share the same parity.
Leave all other pixels (green boundary pixels, pixels in regions not matching the above criteria, and pixels outside any enclosed region) unchanged.
