            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code attempted a flood-fill (BFS) from the grid borders to identify white pixels (0) enclosed by green pixels (3), changing all such enclosed white pixels to yellow (4).\n\nHowever, the results show this logic is incorrect for examples 1, 2, 3, and the top part of 4. In these cases, the regions enclosed by green pixels initially contain a mix of white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The expected output for examples 1, 3, and the top of 4 shows *no change* within these mixed enclosed regions. The initial code incorrectly changed the white pixels within these mixed regions to yellow.\n\nExample 4 (bottom part) shows a region enclosed by green that contains *only* white pixels. In this case, the expected output correctly changes these white pixels to yellow, which aligns with the initial code's behavior *for that specific case*.\n\nExample 2 is problematic. It features a mixed white/yellow enclosed region, but unlike examples 1, 3, and 4 (top), the output shows *some* of the enclosed white pixels changing to yellow, specifically those adjacent to the green boundary. This contradicts the behavior seen in the other mixed-region examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Consistency:** Formulate a rule that consistently explains the majority of examples (1, 3, and 4). The simplest consistent rule is: *Only* regions enclosed by green that contain *exclusively* white pixels are transformed (filled with yellow). Mixed white/yellow enclosed regions are left unchanged.\n2.  **Acknowledge Anomaly:** Note that Example 2 does not fit this rule and requires a different logic (potentially related to adjacency to the boundary within mixed regions), but proceed with the rule covering the majority.\n3.  **Refine Implementation:** The core logic needs to check the content of an enclosed region *before* deciding whether to fill it.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nTo verify the contents of enclosed regions, we need to:\n1.  Identify pixels enclosed by green (3).\n2.  Group these enclosed pixels into connected components.\n3.  Analyze the colors within each component in the input grid.\n\nLet's use code execution to check the composition of enclosed regions for each example. We'll adapt the previous BFS approach: First, find all non-green cells reachable from the border. Then, identify connected components of unmarked cells (enclosed regions) and check their contents.\n\n"
