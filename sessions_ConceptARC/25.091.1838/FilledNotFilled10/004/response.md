## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully solved Examples 1 and 3 but failed on Examples 2 and 4.
- Example 1 & 3: The enclosed areas contained a mix of white (0) and yellow (4) pixels. The code correctly left these areas unchanged.
- Example 2: The enclosed area was purely white (0). The code failed to change it to yellow (4) as required by the expected output.
- Example 4: The enclosed area had a mix of white (0) and yellow (4) in the upper part, and a purely white row at the bottom. The code failed to modify the white pixels in the bottom row to match the checkerboard pattern implied by the yellow pixels above, as required by the expected output.

The failures indicate the initial rule ("fill purely white enclosed regions") was incomplete. The transformation depends on the *content* of the enclosed region:
1.  If the enclosed region is *purely white*, it should be filled entirely with yellow (4). (This explains Example 2).
2.  If the enclosed region contains yellow (4) pixels, any white (0) pixels within that *same region* should be changed to yellow (4) *only if* they complete an established checkerboard pattern defined by the existing yellow pixels. (This explains Example 4's partial fill and why Examples 1 & 3 remain unchanged, as their white pixels already fit the pattern).

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify regions enclosed by green (3) pixels.
2.  For each region, analyze its initial pixel composition.
3.  Apply the transformation:
    *   Fill completely if initially pure white.
    *   Complete checkerboard pattern if initially contains yellow.

## Metrics

No specific code execution is needed for metrics at this stage. The key observations are qualitative:
- **Enclosure:** Green (3) pixels define boundaries.
- **Target Pixels:** Only white (0) pixels *inside* enclosed regions are potential candidates for change.
- **Conditions for Change:**
    - Condition A: The enclosed region consists *only* of white (0) pixels.
    - Condition B: The enclosed region contains *at least one* yellow (4) pixel.
- **Result of Change:**
    - If Condition A: All white (0) pixels change to yellow (4).
    - If Condition B: White (0) pixels change to yellow (4) based on a checkerboard pattern derived from existing yellow pixels within the region. Specifically, determine the parity `(row + col) % 2` for existing yellow pixels. Change white pixels to yellow only if their `(row + col) % 2` matches that parity.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Type: Boundary
    Color: green (3)
    Role: Creates enclosed regions. Not modified.
  - Type: External Area
    Role: Pixels outside any green boundary, or reachable from the grid edge without crossing green.
    Colors: white (0), yellow (4), potentially others (though only 0 and 4 seen outside boundaries in examples).
    Transformation: Not modified.
  - Type: Enclosed Region
    Role: Area completely surrounded by green (3) pixels. Transformation target.
    Initial Content Variants:
      - Purely white (0) pixels (e.g., Example 2).
      - Mix of white (0) and yellow (4) pixels, often in a checkerboard pattern (e.g., Examples 1, 3, 4).
      - Potentially other compositions (not seen in examples).
    Transformation Rules: See Actions.
  - Type: Pixel
    Color: white (0)
    Location: Can be in External Area or Enclosed Region.
    Role: Subject to change *only if* inside an Enclosed Region and specific conditions are met.
  - Type: Pixel
    Color: yellow (4)
    Location: Can be in External Area or Enclosed Region.
    Role: Defines pattern within Enclosed Regions, or is the result color for transformed white pixels. Not modified itself.

Properties:
  - Enclosure: Defined by green (3) pixels.
  - Reachability: Pixels are reachable if a path exists to the grid edge without crossing green (3). Unreachable non-green pixels form enclosed regions.
  - Region Content: The set of pixel colors within an enclosed region (e.g., {0}, {0, 4}).
  - Checkerboard Parity: For regions containing yellow (4), the property `(row + col) % 2` associated with the yellow pixels determines the pattern.

Actions:
  - Identify Boundaries: Locate green (3) pixels.
  - Identify Reachable Pixels: Use BFS/Flood fill from the border, avoiding green (3) pixels.
  - Identify Enclosed Regions: Find connected components of non-green pixels that are not reachable.
  - Analyze Region Content: For each enclosed region, determine the set of colors present.
  - Conditional Fill/Pattern Completion:
    1. If an enclosed region contains *only* white (0): Change all pixels in the region to yellow (4).
    2. If an enclosed region contains *yellow (4)* (and possibly white(0)):
       a. Determine the parity `P = (row + col) % 2` of the existing yellow pixels. (Assume consistency within the region).
       b. Change any white (0) pixel `(r, c)` within that region to yellow (4) *if* `(r + c) % 2 == P`.
    3. Otherwise (region contains other colors, no white/yellow, etc.): Leave the region unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Green pixels surround Enclosed Regions. White and yellow pixels exist within Enclosed Regions or External Areas.
  - Conditional Transformation: The change applied to a white pixel depends entirely on whether it's in an enclosed region and the overall content (pure white vs. containing yellow) of that specific region.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:**
    a.  Find all non-green (not 3) pixels that are reachable from the border of the grid without crossing any green (3) pixels. Mark these as "external".
    b.  Identify all connected components (groups of adjacent pixels) consisting of non-green pixels that were *not* marked as "external". These are the "enclosed regions".
2.  **Process Each Enclosed Region:**
    a.  For each identified enclosed region:
        i.  Examine all pixels within the region in the *input* grid.
        ii. **Check for Pure White:** Determine if *all* pixels within this region are white (0).
        iii. **Check for Existing Yellow:** Determine if *any* pixel within this region is yellow (4).
    b.  **Apply Transformation Rule based on content:**
        i.  **If the region was purely white (0):** Change the color of *all* pixels within this region to yellow (4) in the output grid.
        ii. **If the region contained yellow (4) pixels:**
            1.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of one of the yellow (4) pixels within this region. Calculate its checkerboard parity: `target_parity = (r + c) % 2`.
            2.  Iterate through all *white (0)* pixels located at `(wr, wc)` within this *same* region.
            3.  Calculate the white pixel's parity: `white_parity = (wr + wc) % 2`.
            4.  If `white_parity == target_parity`, change the color of the pixel at `(wr, wc)` to yellow (4) in the output grid. Otherwise, leave it as white (0).
        iii. **Otherwise (e.g., the region contains neither white nor yellow, or only colors other than white/yellow/green):** Make no changes to the pixels within this region in the output grid.
3.  **Finalize Output:** Ensure all pixels not part of a modified enclosed region (i.e., green pixels and external pixels) retain their original colors from the input grid. The resulting grid is the final output.
