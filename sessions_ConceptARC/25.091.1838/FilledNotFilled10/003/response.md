"""
Identifies contiguous regions enclosed by green (3) pixels. 
If an enclosed region consists *entirely* of white (0) pixels in the input grid, 
all pixels within that region are changed to yellow (4) in the output grid. 
If an enclosed region contains any non-white pixels (e.g., yellow 4), 
the entire region remains unchanged. 
Pixels outside enclosed regions (green pixels and pixels reachable from the border) 
also remain unchanged.
