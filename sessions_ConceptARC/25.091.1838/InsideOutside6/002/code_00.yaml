background_color: 0 # white
elements:
  - role: container
    properties:
      - forms connected components that enclose regions.
      - color varies (e.g., green (3), yellow (4)).
      - identified as the most frequent color excluding the background.
      - acts as a barrier for defining the 'outside' region.
  - role: target
    properties:
      - appear as individual pixels or small groups.
      - color varies (e.g., magenta (6), blue (1)).
      - identified as the non-background, non-container color.
      - location relative to the 'outside' background region is critical.
  - role: outside_background
    properties:
      - consists of background-colored pixels (0).
      - connected (including diagonals) to the grid boundary.
      - cannot cross container-colored pixels.
transformation:
  - identifies the container color and target color based on frequency and exclusion.
  - determines the 'outside_background' region using a flood fill (BFS).
    - starts from all background pixels on the grid boundary.
    - explores only adjacent (8-way) background pixels.
    - marks visited background pixels belonging to the 'outside_background' region.
  - creates an output grid filled with the background color.
  - preserves target color pixels in the output grid *only if* they are adjacent (8-way) to at least one pixel belonging to the marked 'outside_background' region.
output:
  - contains only background color and preserved target color pixels.
  - dimensions match the input grid.
