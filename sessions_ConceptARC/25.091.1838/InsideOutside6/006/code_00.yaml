task_description: Remove the 'container' structure and any 'target' pixels that are considered 'inside' it. Keep only 'target' pixels considered 'outside'.
definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  container_color: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
  target_color: The non-background, non-container color present in the input grid. Assumes only three distinct colors exist (background, container, target).
  outside_background_region: The set of all background-colored cells that are reachable from any cell on the grid boundary by traversing only through adjacent (8-way connectivity) background-colored cells.
  outside_target_pixel: A pixel with the target_color is considered 'outside' if it is adjacent (8-way connectivity) to at least one cell belonging to the outside_background_region.
transformation:
  - Identify the background_color, container_color, and target_color based on frequency (container is most frequent non-background).
  - Determine the outside_background_region using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood-fill algorithm:
      - Start the search from all background_color cells located on the grid boundary.
      - Allow the search to propagate only to adjacent background_color cells.
      - Mark all visited cells during this search.
  - Initialize the output grid with the background_color.
  - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
  - If the input cell input[r, c] contains the target_color:
      - Check all 8 adjacent neighbour cells (nr, nc).
      - If any neighbour input[nr, nc] contains the background_color AND was marked as visited during the outside_background_region BFS:
          - Set the corresponding output cell output[r, c] to the target_color.
          - Stop checking neighbours for this target cell.
output:
  - A grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only the background_color and the outside_target_pixels.
  - All container_color pixels are replaced with the background_color.
  - All target_color pixels not meeting the 'outside' criteria are replaced with the background_color.
