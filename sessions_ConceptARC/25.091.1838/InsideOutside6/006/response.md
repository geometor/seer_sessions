## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed because the interpretation of the transformation rule was slightly incorrect. The code correctly identified cells reachable from the boundary without passing *through* the 'container' color, but this included target cells within the 'container' structure if there were paths of non-container colors leading to them.

The analysis of the failed examples reveals that the 'container' color isn't necessarily forming a solid wall. The actual rule seems to rely on proximity to the 'outer' background region. Target cells are kept only if they are adjacent to the background area that is directly connected to the grid boundaries.

The strategy is to redefine the 'outside' region as only the background cells reachable from the boundary via other background cells. Then, keep target cells if and only if they are adjacent (8-way) to this 'outside' background region.

## Metrics

Metrics will be gathered based on the revised understanding.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Size: 11x12
*   Colors: 0 (White), 3 (Green), 6 (Magenta)
*   Background Color: 0
*   Container Color (Most frequent non-bg): 3 (Count: 28)
*   Target Color (Other non-bg): 6 (Count: 6)
*   Outer Background BFS: Starts from boundary 0s, propagates through 0s. Marks the outer frame and connected 0s. Internal 0s (e.g., at (2,4), (3,4)) are *not* marked.
*   Target Pixels (6) Locations: (1,0), (2,0), (2,11), (3,5), (4,5), (4,7), (4,10), (6,0), (6,6)
*   Target Pixels Kept (Adjacent to Outer Background): (1,0), (2,0), (2,11), (4,10), (6,0) - Matches expected output.
*   Target Pixels Removed: (3,5), (4,5), (4,7), (6,6) - Matches expected output.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Size: 15x15
*   Colors: 0 (White), 1 (Blue), 4 (Yellow)
*   Background Color: 0
*   Container Color (Most frequent non-bg): 4 (Count: 45)
*   Target Color (Other non-bg): 1 (Count: 8)
*   Outer Background BFS: Starts from boundary 0s, propagates through 0s. Marks the outer frame and connected 0s. Internal 0s (e.g., at (5,2), (9,4)) are *not* marked.
*   Target Pixels (1) Locations: (1,6), (2,8), (3,6), (6,2), (9,5), (10,7), (12,13), (13,1), (13,11), (14,4)
*   Target Pixels Kept (Adjacent to Outer Background): (1,6), (2,8), (3,6), (12,13), (13,1), (13,11), (14,4) - Matches expected output.
*   Target Pixels Removed: (6,2), (9,5), (10,7) - Matches expected output.

The revised understanding aligns perfectly with the examples provided.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Remove the 'container' structure and any 'target' pixels that are considered 'inside' it. Keep only 'target' pixels considered 'outside'.
definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  container_color: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
  target_color: The non-background, non-container color present in the input grid. Assumes only three distinct colors exist (background, container, target).
  outside_background_region: The set of all background-colored cells that are reachable from any cell on the grid boundary by traversing only through adjacent (8-way connectivity) background-colored cells.
  outside_target_pixel: A pixel with the target_color is considered 'outside' if it is adjacent (8-way connectivity) to at least one cell belonging to the outside_background_region.
transformation:
  - Identify the background_color, container_color, and target_color based on frequency (container is most frequent non-background).
  - Determine the outside_background_region using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood-fill algorithm:
      - Start the search from all background_color cells located on the grid boundary.
      - Allow the search to propagate only to adjacent background_color cells.
      - Mark all visited cells during this search.
  - Initialize the output grid with the background_color.
  - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
  - If the input cell input[r, c] contains the target_color:
      - Check all 8 adjacent neighbour cells (nr, nc).
      - If any neighbour input[nr, nc] contains the background_color AND was marked as visited during the outside_background_region BFS:
          - Set the corresponding output cell output[r, c] to the target_color.
          - Stop checking neighbours for this target cell.
output:
  - A grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Contains only the background_color and the outside_target_pixels.
  - All container_color pixels are replaced with the background_color.
  - All target_color pixels not meeting the 'outside' criteria are replaced with the background_color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white - 0).
2.  Identify the `background_color` (assumed to be 0). Count the occurrences of all other colors.
3.  Identify the `container_color` as the most frequent color that is not the `background_color`.
4.  Identify the `target_color` as the color that is not the `background_color` and not the `container_color`. (Handle cases where there might be only background, or only background and one other color).
5.  If no `target_color` exists, return the background-filled output grid.
6.  If no `container_color` exists (only background and target), keep all `target_color` pixels in the output grid and return it.
7.  Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify the `outside_background_region`:
    *   Create a boolean grid `visited_background` of the same size as the input, initialized to `False`.
    *   Create a queue and add the coordinates `(r, c)` of all cells on the boundary of the input grid where `input[r, c]` is the `background_color`. Mark these boundary cells as `True` in `visited_background`.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a cell coordinate `(r, c)`.
        *   For each of its 8 neighbours `(nr, nc)`:
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.
            *   Check if `input[nr, nc]` is the `background_color`.
            *   Check if `visited_background[nr, nc]` is `False`.
            *   If all checks pass, mark `visited_background[nr, nc]` as `True` and enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
8.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the input grid.
9.  If `input[r, c]` is the `target_color`:
    *   Set a flag `is_outside` to `False`.
    *   For each of the 8 neighbours `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)`:
        *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds.
        *   Check if `input[nr, nc]` is the `background_color`.
        *   Check if `visited_background[nr, nc]` is `True`.
        *   If all checks pass, set `is_outside` to `True` and break the inner loop (checking neighbours).
    *   If `is_outside` is `True`, set `output[r, c]` to the `target_color`.
10. Return the final output grid.
