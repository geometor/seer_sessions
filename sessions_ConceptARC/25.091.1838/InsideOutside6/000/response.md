*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain a background color (white - 0), a primary structure color (green - 3 in example 1, yellow - 4 in example 2), and a target color (magenta - 6 in example 1, blue - 1 in example 2).
    *   The primary structure color forms connected shapes that act as boundaries or containers.
    *   The target color pixels appear both inside and outside these container structures.
    *   The output grids retain only the background color (white - 0) and the target color pixels that were originally located *outside* the container structures.
    *   All pixels of the container color and all target color pixels located *inside* the containers are replaced with the background color in the output.
    *   The core transformation involves identifying regions enclosed by the primary structure color and removing everything within those regions, including the structure itself, while preserving target color pixels located outside these regions. The "outside" region can be defined as the area reachable from the grid boundaries without crossing the container color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    background_color: 0 # white
    elements:
      - role: container
        properties:
          - forms connected components
          - color varies (e.g., green (3), yellow (4))
          - encloses areas within the grid
      - role: target
        properties:
          - often appear as individual pixels or small groups
          - color varies (e.g., magenta (6), blue (1))
          - location relative to container (inside or outside) is critical
    transformation:
      - identifies the container color and target color.
      - determines the 'outside' region: cells reachable from the grid boundary without crossing the container color.
      - removes container color pixels.
      - removes target color pixels not in the 'outside' region (i.e., 'inside' pixels).
      - preserves target color pixels located in the 'outside' region.
    output:
      - contains only background color and preserved target color pixels.
      - dimensions match the input grid.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white - 0).
    2.  Identify the 'container' color: the color that forms the largest connected component, excluding the background color.
    3.  Identify the 'target' color: the non-background, non-container color present in the input grid.
    4.  Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity analysis like Breadth-First Search) starting from all pixels on the boundary of the input grid.
    5.  During the flood fill:
        *   Mark visited cells.
        *   Do not enter cells containing the 'container' color.
        *   Only traverse into adjacent (including diagonals) cells that have not been visited and do not contain the 'container' color.
    6.  Iterate through all cells in the input grid.
    7.  If a cell contains the 'target' color AND was visited during the flood fill (meaning it's reachable from the boundary without crossing the container color), copy its 'target' color to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
    8.  All other cells in the output grid remain the background color (white - 0).
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
