The \"outside\" region can be defined as the area reachable from the grid boundaries without crossing the container color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the 'container' color: the color that forms the largest connected component, excluding the background color.\n    3.  Identify the 'target' color: the non-background, non-container color present in the input grid.\n    4.  Perform a flood fill (or similar connectivity analysis like Breadth-First Search) starting from all pixels on the boundary of the input grid.\n    5.  During the flood fill:\n        *   Mark visited cells.\n        *   Do not enter cells containing the 'container' color.\n        *   Only traverse into adjacent (including diagonals) cells that have not been visited and do not contain the 'container' color.\n    6.  Iterate through all cells in the input grid.\n    7.  If a cell contains the 'target' color AND was visited during the flood fill (meaning it's reachable from the boundary without crossing the container color), copy its 'target' color to the corresponding cell in the output grid.\n    8.  All other cells in the output grid remain the background color (white - 0).\n    9.  Return the modified output grid."
