            "text": "*   **Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed because its logic for determining whether a target pixel was \"outside\" was incorrect. It checked if a target pixel was *adjacent* to a background pixel belonging to the 'outside' region. This allowed target pixels *inside* the container, but adjacent to internal background pixels connected to the outside, to be incorrectly kept. The correct approach should be to determine the entire region reachable from the boundary without crossing the container color (the \"outside\" region), and then keep only those target pixels whose original coordinates fall within this \"outside\" region. The identification of background, container, and target colors based on frequency seems correct for these examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 11x12\n    *   Output Size: 11x12\n    *   Colors Input: white(0), green(3), magenta(6)\n    *   Colors Output: white(0), magenta(6)\n    *   Container Color: green(3)\n    *   Target Color: magenta(6)\n    *   Pixels Off (Previous Code): 4. Magenta pixels at (3,5), (4,5), (4,7), (6,6) were incorrectly kept. These are located inside the green boundary.\n\n    **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 15x15\n    *   Output Size: 15x15\n    *   Colors Input: white(0), blue(1), yellow(4)\n    *   Colors Output: white(0), blue(1)\n    *   Container Color: yellow(4)\n    *   Target Color: blue(1)\n    *   Pixels Off (Previous Code): 3. Blue pixels at (6,2), (9,5), (10,7) were incorrectly kept. These are located inside the yellow boundary.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
