            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: isolating points ('target color') inside a region defined by a 'boundary color'. The strategy involved identifying these colors and using a flood fill from the border, stopping at the boundary color, to determine the 'outside' region. Points not marked as 'outside' were considered 'inside' and kept.\n\nHowever, the implementation failed, producing blank outputs for both examples. The key failure point seems to be that the flood fill incorrectly marked all target points as 'outside'. This likely stems from the flood fill's starting condition: it currently starts from *any* non-boundary pixel on the border. If a target pixel exists on the border, the flood fill starts from there as well, potentially marking regions as 'outside' incorrectly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Flood Fill Initiation:** Modify the flood fill to start *only* from background (color 0) pixels located on the grid border. This aligns better with the concept of defining 'outside' as the area connected to the external background.\n2.  **Verify Color Identification:** Double-check the heuristic for identifying boundary vs. target colors (most frequent non-background color is boundary). While it worked for the examples given, ensure it's robust. Use code execution to confirm counts.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined flood fill initiation logic.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the color counts and border pixels for the training examples.\n\n"
