            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses three colors: white (0) as the background, one color forming a prominent shape or boundary (yellow/4 in train_1, magenta/6 in train_2), and another color representing points or small objects (green/3 in train_1, azure/8 in train_2).\n3.  **Boundary Shape:** In both examples, one color (yellow or magenta) forms a structure that seems to enclose or delineate a region within the grid. In train_1, it's a clear 'U' shape. In train_2, it's a more scattered but still somewhat containing shape.\n4.  **Target Points:** The other color (green or azure) appears as scattered individual pixels or very small clusters.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively keeping some of the 'target points' based on their relationship to the 'boundary shape'. Specifically, target points that appear to be *inside* the region defined by the boundary shape are retained in the output, while target points *outside* this region are removed (turned to white). The boundary shape itself is also removed in the output, replaced by the background color (white).\n6.  **Defining 'Inside':** The concept of 'inside' seems related to connectivity. Points are 'inside' if they are in an area that is separated from the grid's outer border by the boundary shape. A flood fill starting from the outside (grid edges) and stopping at the boundary color would likely fail to reach the 'inside' points.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the 'boundary color' (the color forming the main enclosing shape, e.g., yellow in train_1, magenta in train_2) and the 'target color(s)' (the color(s) of the scattered points, e.g., green in train_1, azure in train_2).\n3.  Determine the 'outside' region of the input grid:\n    a.  Create a boolean grid (or marker set) of the same size as the input, initialized to `false`.\n    b.  Initialize a queue with the coordinates of all background-colored (white, 0) pixels located on the outermost border (row 0, last row, column 0, last column) of the input grid. Mark these initial coordinates as `true` in the boolean grid.\n    c.  While the queue is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.\n        ii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` (adjacent horizontally or vertically) of `(r, c)`:\n            - If `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds, is *not* the 'boundary color' in the input grid, and is marked `false` in the boolean grid:\n                - Mark `(nr, nc)` as `true` in the boolean grid.\n                - Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n    d.  The pixels marked `true` in the boolean grid now represent the 'outside' region reachable from the border without crossing the boundary shape.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid:\n    a.  If the color of the input pixel `input[r][c]` is a 'target color' AND the corresponding location `(r, c)` is marked `false` in the boolean grid (meaning it's *not* 'outside', therefore it's 'inside'):\n        i.  Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[r][c]` to the 'target color' found in `input[r][c]`.\n5.  Return the completed output grid."
