task_description: Keep only the target-colored pixels that are located inside the region defined by the boundary-colored shape. Replace everything else, including the boundary shape itself, with the background color.

elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - pixels: contain color values (0-9)
      - dimensions: consistent between input and output

  - object: Background
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: fills most of the output grid and areas outside the boundary in the input

  - object: Boundary Shape
    properties:
      - color: distinct non-background color (e.g., yellow/4, magenta/6)
      - shape: forms a connected or semi-connected structure
      - role: defines an 'inside' and 'outside' region within the grid
      - persistence: removed in the output

  - object: Target Points
    properties:
      - color: distinct non-background color, different from boundary color (e.g., green/3, azure/8)
      - shape: typically individual pixels or small clusters
      - location: scattered across the grid
      - role: points to be selectively kept or removed
      - persistence: kept only if located 'inside' the boundary region, otherwise removed

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Target points are classified as either 'inside' or 'outside' the region defined by the Boundary Shape.
  - type: transformation_rule
    description: The output grid retains only the 'inside' Target Points at their original locations, set against the Background color. The Boundary Shape is removed.

determination_of_inside:
  - method: Flood Fill Inversion
    steps:
      - Identify Boundary Color pixels.
      - Perform a flood fill starting from all Background pixels on the grid's border.
      - The fill propagates to adjacent Background pixels but cannot cross Boundary Color pixels.
      - Mark all pixels reached by the flood fill as 'outside'.
      - Any non-Boundary, non-Background pixel *not* marked as 'outside' is considered 'inside'.
