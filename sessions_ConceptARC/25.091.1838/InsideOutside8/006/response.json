            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt incorrectly identified the target pixels to keep. It used a connected components approach, where components of non-boundary pixels were identified. If a component touched the border, all target pixels within it were discarded. This failed because the target pixels to be kept were often part of large connected components that also included border pixels, even though the target pixels themselves were visually 'inside' the boundary shape.\n\nThe core concept appears to be **containment**. We need to identify pixels that are 'outside' the region defined by the boundary color and keep only the target-colored pixels that are *not* outside (i.e., 'inside').\n\nThe revised strategy is to use a **flood fill** starting from the grid's border. This fill should propagate through any pixel *except* the boundary color. Any pixel reached by this flood fill is considered 'outside'. Target-colored pixels that are *not* reached by this fill are considered 'inside' and are preserved in the output. The boundary shape itself and any 'outside' pixels are replaced with the background color.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the colors and counts for each example to confirm the boundary/target identification.\n\n**Example 1:**\n"
