## General Assessment

The previous attempt incorrectly identified the target pixels to keep. It used a connected components approach, where components of non-boundary pixels were identified. If a component touched the border, all target pixels within it were discarded. This failed because the target pixels to be kept were often part of large connected components that also included border pixels, even though the target pixels themselves were visually 'inside' the boundary shape.

The core concept appears to be **containment**. We need to identify pixels that are 'outside' the region defined by the boundary color and keep only the target-colored pixels that are *not* outside (i.e., 'inside').

The revised strategy is to use a **flood fill** starting from the grid's border. This fill should propagate through any pixel *except* the boundary color. Any pixel reached by this flood fill is considered 'outside'. Target-colored pixels that are *not* reached by this fill are considered 'inside' and are preserved in the output. The boundary shape itself and any 'outside' pixels are replaced with the background color.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the colors and counts for each example to confirm the boundary/target identification.

**Example 1:**

``` python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

input_grid_1 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],
    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid_1, return_counts=True)
color_counts_1 = dict(zip(unique, counts))

background_color = 0
non_background_1 = {c: count for c, count in color_counts_1.items() if c != background_color}
boundary_color_1 = max(non_background_1, key=non_background_1.get) if non_background_1 else None
target_colors_1 = set(non_background_1.keys()) - {boundary_color_1} if boundary_color_1 is not None else set()


print(f"Example 1 Color Counts: {color_counts_1}")
print(f"Example 1 Non-Background: {non_background_1}")
print(f"Example 1 Boundary Color: {boundary_color_1} (Yellow)")
print(f"Example 1 Target Colors: {target_colors_1} (Green)")
```
```
Example 1 Color Counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(123), np.int64(3): np.int64(6), np.int64(4): np.int64(27)}
Example 1 Non-Background: {np.int64(3): np.int64(6), np.int64(4): np.int64(27)}
Example 1 Boundary Color: 4 (Yellow)
Example 1 Target Colors: {np.int64(3)} (Green)

```
**Example 2:**

``` python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

input_grid_2 = np.array([
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid_2, return_counts=True)
color_counts_2 = dict(zip(unique, counts))

background_color = 0
non_background_2 = {c: count for c, count in color_counts_2.items() if c != background_color}
boundary_color_2 = max(non_background_2, key=non_background_2.get) if non_background_2 else None
target_colors_2 = set(non_background_2.keys()) - {boundary_color_2} if boundary_color_2 is not None else set()


print(f"Example 2 Color Counts: {color_counts_2}")
print(f"Example 2 Non-Background: {non_background_2}")
print(f"Example 2 Boundary Color: {boundary_color_2} (Magenta)")
print(f"Example 2 Target Colors: {target_colors_2} (Azure)")
```
```
Example 2 Color Counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(104), np.int64(6): np.int64(11), np.int64(8): np.int64(6)}
Example 2 Non-Background: {np.int64(6): np.int64(11), np.int64(8): np.int64(6)}
Example 2 Boundary Color: 6 (Magenta)
Example 2 Target Colors: {np.int64(8)} (Azure)

```
The metric gathering confirms the heuristic: the boundary color is the non-background color with the highest pixel count, and target colors are any other non-background colors. This holds for both examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Colors:**
    a.  Count the occurrences of each color in the input grid.
    b.  Identify the background color (assumed to be 0, white).
    c.  Identify the `boundary_color` as the non-background color with the highest count.
    d.  Identify the `target_colors` as the set of all non-background colors that are *not* the `boundary_color`.
    e.  If no non-background colors exist, or only one exists (the boundary color), return an output grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with the background color.
2.  **Initialize:**
    a.  Create an `output_grid` of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the `background_color`.
    b.  Create a boolean grid `is_outside` of the same dimensions, initialized to all `false`.
    c.  Create an empty queue for the flood fill algorithm.
3.  **Seed Flood Fill:**
    a.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` on the border of the input grid (row 0, last row, column 0, last column).
    b.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is *not* equal to the `boundary_color` and `is_outside[r][c]` is `false`:
        i.  Set `is_outside[r][c]` to `true`.
        ii. Add the coordinates `(r, c)` to the queue.
4.  **Execute Flood Fill (BFS):**
    a.  While the queue is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
        ii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` (adjacent horizontally or vertically) of `(r, c)`:
            - If `(nr, nc)` is within the grid bounds AND `input_grid[nr][nc]` is *not* the `boundary_color` AND `is_outside[nr][nc]` is `false`:
                - Set `is_outside[nr][nc]` to `true`.
                - Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
5.  **Populate Output:**
    a.  Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    b.  Let `pixel_color = input_grid[r][c]`.
    c.  If `pixel_color` is in the set of `target_colors` AND `is_outside[r][c]` is `false`:
        i.  Set `output_grid[r][c]` to `pixel_color`.
6.  **Return:** Return the `output_grid`.
