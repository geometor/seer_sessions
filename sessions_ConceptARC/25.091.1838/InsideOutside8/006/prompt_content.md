"""
Keep only the target-colored pixels that belong to connected regions of 
non-boundary-colored pixels which do not touch the grid border. All other 
pixels, including the boundary color itself and target pixels in regions 
connected to the border, become background color (0).

The boundary color is identified as the non-background color (non-0) with the highest 
pixel count in the input grid. Target colors are all other non-background colors.

A connected component search (e.g., Breadth-First Search) is performed starting 
from each unvisited, non-boundary pixel. For each component identified, it's checked 
if any pixel within the component touches the grid border (row 0, last row, 
column 0, or last column). If a component does not touch the border, any 
target-colored pixels originally found within that component are placed onto 
the output grid at their corresponding positions. The rest of the output grid 
remains the background color.
