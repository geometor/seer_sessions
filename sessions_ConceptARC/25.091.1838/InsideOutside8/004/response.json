            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the flood fill logic used to determine the 'outside' region incorrectly included the 'inside' target pixels. The flood fill propagated through any non-boundary pixel, allowing it to \"leak\" into the intended inner region via background or target pixels connected to the border region.\n\nThe core idea is to keep target-colored pixels that are *not* connected to the grid's border if we are only allowed to move through non-boundary-colored pixels.\n\nThe strategy is to use a connected components approach. For each target pixel encountered that hasn't been visited yet, perform a search (like BFS or DFS) to find all connected non-boundary pixels. During the search, check if any pixel in the component touches the grid border. If the component does not touch the border, then all target pixels found within that component are considered 'inside' and should be kept in the output.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Train Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 13 rows x 12 columns = 156 pixels\n*   Output Grid Size: 13 rows x 12 columns = 156 pixels\n*   Colors Present (Input):\n    *   0 (white): 123 pixels (Background)\n    *   3 (green): 6 pixels (Target)\n    *   4 (yellow): 27 pixels (Boundary - most frequent non-background)\n*   Colors Present (Output):\n    *   0 (white): 154 pixels\n    *   3 (green): 2 pixels\n*   Target Pixels Kept: `(4, 4)`, `(9, 8)`\n*   Target Pixels Removed: `(0, 5)`, `(0, 8)`, `(7, 11)`, `(12, 0)`\n*   Boundary Pixels: Removed (turned to white).\n*   Previous Code Output: All 0s. Failed.\n\n**Train Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 11 rows x 11 columns = 121 pixels\n*   Output Grid Size: 11 rows x 11 columns = 121 pixels\n*   Colors Present (Input):\n    *   0 (white): 104 pixels (Background)\n    *   6 (magenta): 11 pixels (Boundary - most frequent non-background)\n    *   8 (azure): 6 pixels (Target)\n*   Colors Present (Output):\n    *   0 (white): 119 pixels\n    *   8 (azure): 2 pixels\n*   Target Pixels Kept: `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`\n*   Target Pixels Removed: `(0, 1)`, `(1, 8)`, `(9, 7)`, `(10, 3)`\n*   Boundary Pixels: Removed (turned to white).\n*   Previous Code Output: All 0s.
