**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use a limited palette of colors. White (0) acts as a background color. Each input grid features exactly two non-background colors.
3.  **Objects/Shapes:** The non-background colors form distinct regions or objects within the grid. Often, one shape appears to be contained within or adjacent to the other.
    *   Example 1: A blue rectangle inside a green region.
    *   Example 2: A red L-shape inside a yellow region.
    *   Example 3: An azure shape adjacent to a magenta region.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of the non-background pixels. Specifically, *both* of the original non-background colors are replaced by a *single* target color in the output. The background pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Target Color Selection:** The crucial part of the logic is determining which color becomes the target color for the output. This target color is always one of the two non-background colors present in the input. The rule for selecting the target color appears to depend specifically on the *pair* of non-background colors present in the input:
    *   If the input colors are Green (3) and Blue (1), the output color is Blue (1).
    *   If the input colors are Yellow (4) and Red (2), the output color is Yellow (4).
    *   If the input colors are Magenta (6) and Azure (8), the output color is Azure (8).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Flood-fill or unify two non-background colors into a single target color based on a rule applied to the specific pair of colors present.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors. White (0) is the background.
  - element: non_background_colors
    description: Each input grid contains exactly two distinct colors other than white (0).
    properties:
      - pair: In example 1, the pair is {Green (3), Blue (1)}.
      - pair: In example 2, the pair is {Yellow (4), Red (2)}.
      - pair: In example 3, the pair is {Magenta (6), Azure (8)}.
  - element: target_color
    description: A single color used to replace both non-background colors in the output. It is always one of the two non-background colors from the input.
    properties:
      - selection_rule: The target color selection depends on the specific pair of non-background colors present.
        - rule: If {Green (3), Blue (1)} are present, the target is Blue (1).
        - rule: If {Yellow (4), Red (2)} are present, the target is Yellow (4).
        - rule: If {Magenta (6), Azure (8)} are present, the target is Azure (8).

transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: color_pair {C1, C2} (non-background colors)
  - action: select_target
    inputs: color_pair {C1, C2}
    outputs: target_color (C_target)
    logic: Apply the specific rule based on the pair (e.g., {1,3} -> 1; {2,4} -> 4; {6,8} -> 8).
  - action: replace_colors
    inputs: input_grid, color_pair {C1, C2}, target_color (C_target)
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid where pixels with color C1 or C2 in the input are replaced by C_target, and background (0) pixels remain 0.

relationships:
  - type: color_unification
    description: All pixels belonging to either of the two initial non-background colors are unified into the single target color in the output.
  - type: background_preservation
    description: The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the set of unique colors present.
2.  From this set, identify the two colors that are not the background color (white, 0). Let these be Color A and Color B.
3.  Determine the target color based on the specific pair {Color A, Color B}:
    *   If the pair is {Green (3), Blue (1)}, the target color is Blue (1).
    *   If the pair is {Yellow (4), Red (2)}, the target color is Yellow (4).
    *   If the pair is {Magenta (6), Azure (8)}, the target color is Azure (8).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    *   If the input pixel's color is either Color A or Color B, set the corresponding output pixel's color to the determined target color.
    *   If the input pixel's color is the background color (white, 0), set the corresponding output pixel's color to white (0).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
