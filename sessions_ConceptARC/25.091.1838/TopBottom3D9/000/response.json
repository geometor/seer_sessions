White (0) acts as a background color. Each input grid features exactly two non-background colors.\n3.  **Objects/Shapes:** The non-background colors form distinct regions or objects within the grid. Often, one shape appears to be contained within or adjacent to the other.\n    *   Example 1: A blue rectangle inside a green region.\n    *   Example 2: A red L-shape inside a yellow region.\n    *   Example 3: An azure shape adjacent to a magenta region.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of the non-background pixels. Specifically, *both* of the original non-background colors are replaced by a *single* target color in the output. The background pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Target Color Selection:** The crucial part of the logic is determining which color becomes the target color for the output. This target color is always one of the two non-background colors present in the input. The rule for selecting the target color appears to depend specifically on the *pair* of non-background colors present in the input:\n    *   If the input colors are Green (3) and Blue (1), the output color is Blue (1).\n    *   If the input colors are Yellow (4) and Red (2), the output color is Yellow (4).\n    *   If the input colors are Magenta (6) and Azure (8), the output color is Azure (8).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
