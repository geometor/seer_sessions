task_description: Flood-fill or unify two non-background colors into a single target color based on a rule applied to the specific pair of colors present.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors. White (0) is the background.
  - element: non_background_colors
    description: Each input grid contains exactly two distinct colors other than white (0).
    properties:
      - pair: In example 1, the pair is {Green (3), Blue (1)}.
      - pair: In example 2, the pair is {Yellow (4), Red (2)}.
      - pair: In example 3, the pair is {Magenta (6), Azure (8)}.
  - element: target_color
    description: A single color used to replace both non-background colors in the output. It is always one of the two non-background colors from the input.
    properties:
      - selection_rule: The target color selection depends on the specific pair of non-background colors present.
        - rule: If {Green (3), Blue (1)} are present, the target is Blue (1).
        - rule: If {Yellow (4), Red (2)} are present, the target is Yellow (4).
        - rule: If {Magenta (6), Azure (8)} are present, the target is Azure (8).

transformation:
  - action: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: color_pair {C1, C2} (non-background colors)
  - action: select_target
    inputs: color_pair {C1, C2}
    outputs: target_color (C_target)
    logic: Apply the specific rule based on the pair (e.g., {1,3} -> 1; {2,4} -> 4; {6,8} -> 8).
  - action: replace_colors
    inputs: input_grid, color_pair {C1, C2}, target_color (C_target)
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid where pixels with color C1 or C2 in the input are replaced by C_target, and background (0) pixels remain 0.

relationships:
  - type: color_unification
    description: All pixels belonging to either of the two initial non-background colors are unified into the single target color in the output.
  - type: background_preservation
    description: The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged.
