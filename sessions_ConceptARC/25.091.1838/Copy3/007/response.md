"""
Transforms an input grid based on its width parity:

1. If the grid width is even:
   - The output grid is created by taking the input grid, keeping the left half as is, and overwriting the right half with an exact copy of the left half.

2. If the grid width is odd:
   - The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
   - A marker object (horizontal 1x2 block of magenta pixels [[6, 6]]) is searched for.
   - The instance of this marker closest to the geometric grid center determines an offset vector (dr, dc) equal to its top-left coordinates (r_marker, c_marker).
   - If no marker is found, the initial copy of the input is returned.
   - All distinct connected non-white objects in the input grid are identified (using 4-connectivity).
   - Each object, *except* the specific marker object instance used to determine the offset, is copied.
   - The copy is performed by adding the offset (dr, dc) to each pixel coordinate of the object.
   - Copied pixels are placed onto the output grid, overwriting existing content, only if the target coordinates are within the grid bounds.
