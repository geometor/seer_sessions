**General Assessment**

The previous analysis correctly identified the transformation rule for the odd-width case (Example 2), involving finding a central marker (`[[6, 6]]`), calculating an offset based on its position, and copying all other objects using that offset. The code successfully implemented this logic.

However, the analysis for the even-width case (Example 1) was incorrect. The initial hypothesis was that the left half was mirrored onto the right half. The execution results show this is wrong. Comparing the input and expected output for Example 1 reveals that the transformation copies objects from the *left half* to the *right half* using a specific offset, rather than a simple mirror. The offset appears to be `(0, width / 2)`. The original content of the grid remains unless overwritten by the copied objects.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the grid dimensions and marker location for the odd case using code execution.
2.  Correct the rule for the even-width case based on the object copying observation.
3.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program accordingly.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Create the initial output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
3.  Determine the width (`W`) and height (`H`) of the input grid.
4.  Check if the width `W` is even or odd.

5.  **If `W` is even:**
    a. Calculate the midpoint column index `Mid = W / 2`.
    b. Define the left half region as columns 0 to `Mid - 1`.
    c. Find all distinct connected objects (non-white pixels, 4-connectivity) that exist entirely or partially within the left half region. *Correction: Find objects based on the entire grid first, then filter those whose pixels are *only* in the left half.* *Second correction: Examine Example 1 Output again. Objects straddling the midpoint aren't copied. The rule should be: Find all distinct non-white objects in the *entire* input grid. Then, for each object, if *all* its pixels lie within the left half (columns 0 to `Mid-1`), copy it.*
    d. Define the copy offset as `(dr, dc) = (0, Mid)`.
    e. For each object identified in step 5c (whose pixels are *entirely* in the left half):
        i. For every pixel `(r_p, c_p)` belonging to this object:
        ii. Calculate the target coordinates: `target_r = r_p + dr`, `target_c = c_p + dc`.
        iii. Check if the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c)` are within the grid boundaries (`0 <= target_r < H` and `0 <= target_c < W`).
        iv. If within bounds, set the pixel value in the output grid: `output_grid[target_r][target_c] = object_color`. Copied pixels overwrite previous content.

6.  **If `W` is odd:**
    a. Define the marker object as a horizontal 1x2 block of magenta pixels (`[[6, 6]]`).
    b. Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the top-left pixel of all instances of the marker object in the input grid. Store these as a list of potential marker locations.
    c. If no marker objects are found, stop and return the initial output grid (which is a copy of the input).
    d. Calculate the geometric center of the grid: `center_r = (H - 1) / 2`, `center_c = (W - 1) / 2`.
    e. Find the marker location `(r_marker, c_marker)` from the list found in step 6b that has the minimum Euclidean distance to `(center_r, center_c)`. This `(r_marker, c_marker)` defines the copy offset `(dr, dc)`.
    f. Find all distinct connected objects (non-white pixels, 4-connectivity) in the entire input grid. For each object, determine its color and the set of coordinates `{(r_p, c_p), ...}` it occupies. Also note its top-left coordinate `(r_obj_tl, c_obj_tl)`.
    g. Identify the specific marker object instance used for the offset (the one whose top-left is `(r_marker, c_marker)` and matches the marker shape/color).
    h. For each object found in step 6f:
        i. **If it is *not* the specific marker object instance identified in step 6g:**
            i. For each pixel coordinate `(r_p, c_p)` belonging to this object:
            ii. Calculate the target coordinates: `target_r = r_p + dr`, `target_c = c_p + dc`.
            iii. Check if the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c)` are within the grid boundaries (`0 <= target_r < H` and `0 <= target_c < W`).
            iv. If within bounds, set the pixel value in the output grid: `output_grid[target_r][target_c] = object_color`. Copied pixels overwrite previous content.

7.  Return the final output grid.
