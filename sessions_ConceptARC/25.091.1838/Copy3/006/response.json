            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the two distinct transformation modes based on grid width parity (even/odd). The logic for the odd-width case (Example 2), involving finding a central marker object `[[6, 6]]` and using its coordinates as an offset to copy other objects, was implemented successfully and produced the correct output.\n\nHowever, the logic for the even-width case (Example 1) was flawed. The code attempted to find objects in the left half and copy them, whereas the expected output shows a direct pixel-by-pixel replication of the entire left half onto the right half, completely overwriting the original right half.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the even-width logic to perform this direct pixel mirroring while keeping the validated odd-width logic unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n**Example 1 (Even Width):**\n\n*   Input dimensions: 11 rows x 16 columns (Width is even)\n*   Midpoint column index: 16 // 2 = 8\n*   Expected behavior: The content of columns 0-7 should be copied exactly to columns 8-15.\n"
