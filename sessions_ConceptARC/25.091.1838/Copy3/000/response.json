            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on grids of pixels with different colors. The dimensions of the grids can vary.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to involve copying parts of the input grid to other locations within the grid to produce the output. The specific method of copying appears to depend on the width of the input grid.\n3.  **Even Width Case (Example 1):**\n    *   Input grid width is 16 (even).\n    *   The output grid is formed by taking the input grid and overwriting its right half with a copy of its left half.\n    *   The vertical line dividing the halves is exactly down the middle (between columns 7 and 8).\n    *   Pixels from `(r, c)` where `c < width/2` are copied to `(r, c + width/2)`.\n4.  **Odd Width Case (Example 2):**\n    *   Input grid width is 13 (odd).\n    *   The transformation involves identifying a specific \"marker\" object: a horizontal 1x2 block of magenta pixels (`[[6, 6]]`).\n    *   The instance of this marker object closest to the geometric center of the grid determines a displacement vector (offset). The offset is simply the row and column index of the top-left pixel of this central marker.\n    *   All other distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color) in the input grid are copied.\n    *   The copy destination for an object originally at `(r_obj, c_obj)` is `(r_obj + r_marker, c_obj + c_marker)`.\n    *   Copies that would fall partially or fully outside the grid boundaries are clipped or ignored (only pixels landing within the grid are placed).\n    *   The original content of the grid remains, and the copied objects are overlaid onto it. The marker object itself is *not* copied using the offset.\n5.  **Object Definition:** An \"object\" seems to be a connected component of pixels sharing the same non-white color. Connectivity includes adjacent (horizontal/vertical) pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
