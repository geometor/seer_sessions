Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on grids of pixels with different colors. The dimensions of the grids can vary.
2.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to involve copying parts of the input grid to other locations within the grid to produce the output. The specific method of copying appears to depend on the width of the input grid.
3.  **Even Width Case (Example 1):**
    *   Input grid width is 16 (even).
    *   The output grid is formed by taking the input grid and overwriting its right half with a copy of its left half.
    *   The vertical line dividing the halves is exactly down the middle (between columns 7 and 8).
    *   Pixels from `(r, c)` where `c < width/2` are copied to `(r, c + width/2)`.
4.  **Odd Width Case (Example 2):**
    *   Input grid width is 13 (odd).
    *   The transformation involves identifying a specific "marker" object: a horizontal 1x2 block of magenta pixels (`[[6, 6]]`).
    *   The instance of this marker object closest to the geometric center of the grid determines a displacement vector (offset). The offset is simply the row and column index of the top-left pixel of this central marker.
    *   All other distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color) in the input grid are copied.
    *   The copy destination for an object originally at `(r_obj, c_obj)` is `(r_obj + r_marker, c_obj + c_marker)`.
    *   Copies that would fall partially or fully outside the grid boundaries are clipped or ignored (only pixels landing within the grid are placed).
    *   The original content of the grid remains, and the copied objects are overlaid onto it. The marker object itself is *not* copied using the offset.
5.  **Object Definition:** An "object" seems to be a connected component of pixels sharing the same non-white color. Connectivity includes adjacent (horizontal/vertical) pixels.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: object_copying
grid_properties:
  width_parity_dependent: true

rules:
  - condition: grid_width is even
    action: mirror_left_half_to_right
    details:
      - split_column: width / 2
      - source_columns: 0 to (width / 2) - 1
      - target_columns: (width / 2) to width - 1
      - transformation: output[r][c + width/2] = input[r][c]
      - overwrite: true (right half is completely replaced)

  - condition: grid_width is odd
    action: offset_copy_based_on_marker

      color: 6 (magenta)
      pixels: [[6, 6]]
    offset_determination:
      - find_all_instances: marker_object
      - calculate_grid_center: ( (height-1)/2, (width-1)/2 )
      - find_closest_marker: instance whose top-left (r_marker, c_marker) has minimum Euclidean distance to grid_center
      - offset_vector: (dr, dc) = (r_marker, c_marker)
    copy_process:
      - identify_all_source_objects: contiguous non-white pixel groups
      - exclude_object: the marker object used for offset determination
      - for_each_included_object:
        - source_location: top-left (r_obj, c_obj)
        - target_location: top-left (r_obj + dr, c_obj + dc)
        - copy_pixels: for each pixel (r_p, c_p) in the object, place its color at (r_p + dr, c_p + dc) in the output
        - boundary_check: only place pixels if target coordinates are within grid bounds (0 <= row < height, 0 <= col < width)
        - overwrite: true (copied pixels replace existing content at target locations)
    initial_state: output grid starts as a copy of the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Create the initial output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
3.  Determine the width (`W`) and height (`H`) of the input grid.
4.  Check if the width `W` is even or odd.
5.  **If `W` is even:**
    a. Calculate the midpoint column index `Mid = W / 2`.
    b. For each row `r` from 0 to `H-1`:
    c. For each column `c` from 0 to `Mid-1`:
    d. Get the pixel value `P = input_grid[r][c]`.
    e. Set the pixel value in the output grid at `output_grid[r][c + Mid] = P`.
6.  **If `W` is odd:**
    a. Define the marker object as a horizontal 1x2 block of magenta pixels (`[[6, 6]]`).
    b. Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the top-left pixel of all instances of the marker object in the input grid. Store these as a list of potential marker locations.
    c. If no marker objects are found, stop and return the initial output grid (which is a copy of the input).
    d. Calculate the geometric center of the grid: `center_r = (H - 1) / 2`, `center_c = (W - 1) / 2`.
    e. Find the marker location `(r_marker, c_marker)` from the list found in step 6b that has the minimum Euclidean distance to `(center_r, center_c)`. This `(r_marker, c_marker)` defines the copy offset `(dr, dc)`.
    f. Find all distinct connected objects of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each object, determine its color and the set of coordinates `{(r_p, c_p), ...}` it occupies. Also note its top-left coordinate `(r_obj, c_obj)`.
    g. For each object found in step 6f:
    h. Check if its top-left coordinate `(r_obj, c_obj)` is the same as the chosen marker's coordinate `(r_marker, c_marker)`.
    i. **If it is *not* the marker object:**
        i. For each pixel coordinate `(r_p, c_p)` belonging to this object:
