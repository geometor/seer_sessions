These lines are identical in both the input and output grids.\n    *   There is exactly one pixel of a unique color (different from the background and the lines) located somewhere strictly *between* the two parallel lines in the input grid.\n    *   In the output grid, this unique pixel has moved from its original position. The background and the parallel lines remain unchanged.\n    *   The movement of the unique pixel is always along the axis perpendicular to the parallel lines (i.e., horizontal movement for vertical lines, vertical movement for horizontal lines).\n    *   The destination position of the unique pixel is the central row (if lines are horizontal) or central column (if lines are vertical) within the space *strictly between* the two parallel lines. The pixel's coordinate along the axis parallel to the lines remains unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
