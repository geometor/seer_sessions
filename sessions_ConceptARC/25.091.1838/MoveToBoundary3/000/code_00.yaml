Context:
  - Grid dimensions are constant (10x10).
  - Background color is white (0).
Input:
  - Contains a single contiguous object.
    - Object color: red (2).
    - Object shape: Varies between examples.
    - Object location: Varies between examples.
Output:
  - Contains the same single red object as the input.
Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal translation (movement) of the object to the right.
  - Rule: The object is moved horizontally such that its rightmost pixel aligns with the rightmost column of the grid.
  - Calculation:
      - Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the object in the input.
      - Determine the grid width (`grid_width`).
      - Calculate the shift amount: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col`.
      - Translate every pixel of the object by `shift` columns to the right.
  - Invariance: Object shape, color, and orientation remain unchanged. The background remains white.
