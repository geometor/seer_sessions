Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous object composed of red (2) pixels. The shape of the red object differs between examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement (translation) of the red object within the grid. The object's shape, color, and orientation remain unchanged.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** The object always moves horizontally to the right. The distance it moves varies between examples.
6.  **Determining Movement Distance:**
    *   In `train_1`, the object's rightmost edge is at column index 6. The grid width is 10. The object moves 3 columns to the right (column 7 becomes the new column 4, column 8 the new 5, column 9 the new 6). The space between the object's rightmost edge and the grid's right edge (exclusive of the edge itself) is 3 columns (columns 7, 8, 9). The shift distance equals this available space. The object effectively moves until its rightmost edge touches the right boundary of the grid.
    *   In `train_2`, the object's rightmost edge is at column index 7. The grid width is 10. The object moves 2 columns to the right. The space between the object's rightmost edge and the grid's right edge is 2 columns (columns 8, 9). Again, the shift distance equals the available space, moving the object to align its rightmost edge with the grid's right edge.

**Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  - Grid dimensions are constant (10x10).
  - Background color is white (0).
Input:
  - Contains a single contiguous object.
    - Object color: red (2).
    - Object shape: Varies between examples.
    - Object location: Varies between examples.
Output:
  - Contains the same single red object as the input.
Transformation:
  - Action: Horizontal translation (movement) of the object to the right.
  - Rule: The object is moved horizontally such that its rightmost pixel aligns with the rightmost column of the grid.
  - Calculation:
      - Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by the object in the input.
      - Determine the grid width (`grid_width`).
      - Calculate the shift amount: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col`.
      - Translate every pixel of the object by `shift` columns to the right.
  - Invariance: Object shape, color, and orientation remain unchanged. The background remains white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the grid representing the input. Note its dimensions (height and width).
2.  Locate all pixels that are not the background color (white, 0). These constitute the single object.
3.  Determine the maximum column index occupied by any pixel of this object. Let this be `max_col`.
4.  Calculate the horizontal shift distance required to move the object's rightmost edge to the rightmost column of the grid. This distance is `shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col`.
5.  Create a new grid for the output, initialized with the background color (white, 0) and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  For each pixel belonging to the object identified in step 2, located at `(row, col)` in the input grid:
    a. Calculate its new position in the output grid: `(new_row, new_col) = (row, col + shift)`.
    b. Set the pixel at `(new_row, new_col)` in the output grid to the object's color (red, 2).
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
