# Rule 1: Activated if Azure (8) is present
rule_1:
  name: remove_azure_pixels
  trigger:
    property: color
    value: 8 # Azure
  action:
    type: replace_pixels
    source_color: 8 # Azure
    target_color: 0 # white

# Rule 2: Activated if Azure (8) is NOT present
rule_2:
  name: fill_dense_3x3_squares
  trigger:
    condition: color 8 (Azure) is absent in input
  target: 3x3 pixel squares within the grid
  condition_for_action:
    - structure: 3x3 square
    - property: color_density
    - check: unique_dominant_non_white_color
    - dominant_color_name: C
    - dominant_color_count_threshold: >= 6
  action:
    type: replace_pixels_in_subgrid
    subgrid: 3x3 square matching the condition
    source_color: 0 # white
    target_color: C # the unique dominant non-white color
    scope: apply changes to a copy of the grid, using original input for conditions

# General Observations
grid_properties:
  size: variable height and width
  colors: 0-9 used, representing different categories/objects
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shapes (e.g., Orange, Yellow, Magenta, Green, Red shapes)
  - type: scattered_pixels (e.g., Azure pixels in example 1, Green/Red pixels in example 2 before filling)
relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels within shapes, pixels within 3x3 squares
  - density: count of colors within a local area (3x3 square)
