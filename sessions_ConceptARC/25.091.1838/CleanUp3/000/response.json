            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n*   **Note:** The prompt provided data for `train_2` but labeled the section `train_1`. It then provided data labeled `train_1`. I will assume these are two distinct examples, `example_1` (Azure removal) and `example_2` (3x3 fill), illustrating the task's logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Example 1 (Azure Removal):**\n    *   The input grid contains several distinct objects composed of Orange (7), Yellow (4), and Magenta (6) pixels, along with numerous scattered single pixels of Azure (8).\n    *   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except all Azure (8) pixels have been replaced by white (0) pixels.\n    *   The transformation appears to be a targeted removal of all pixels of a specific color (Azure).\n\n2.  **Example 2 (3x3 Fill):**\n    *   The input grid contains large shapes made of Green (3) and Red (2), along with some smaller, less dense groupings of these colors, interspersed with white (0). Notably, Azure (8) is absent.\n    *   The output grid shows that the large shapes remain mostly unchanged. However, in two specific 3x3 regions, white pixels have been filled in.\n        *   A 3x3 area in the top-right (rows 0-2, cols 12-14) originally contained 8 Green pixels and 1 white pixel. In the output, the white pixel is filled with Green.\n        *   A 3x3 area in the middle-right (rows 4-6, cols 11-13) originally contained 7 Red pixels and 2 white pixels. In the output, the white pixels are filled with Red.\n    *   The transformation identifies 3x3 areas that are densely populated by a single non-white color (at least 6 out of 9 pixels) and fills any white pixels within that 3x3 area with the dominant color.\n\n3.  **Overall Logic:** The task seems to have two distinct modes of operation, determined by the presence of Azure (8) pixels in the input:\n    *   If Azure (8) is present, remove all Azure pixels.\n    *   If Azure (8) is *not* present, apply the 3x3 density fill rule.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
