            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: remove non-background objects touching the grid borders. The provided Python code implements this logic using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find connected objects and check their border proximity. However, the execution results show failures on examples `train_1` and `train_3`, where objects touching the border were incorrectly kept in the output. Example `train_2` passed, indicating the fundamental approach is likely sound, but there's a subtle implementation bug.\n\nThe bug likely lies in how objects are identified or how the 'touches border' status is determined or applied. Specifically, the objects that failed (Gray in Ex1, Orange in Ex3) appear later in the grid scan order than other objects. This might suggest an issue with the `visited` array preventing these objects from being processed correctly or their border status being accurately flagged and acted upon. The `elif input_grid[r, c] == 0: visited[r,c] = True` line in the main loop seems unnecessary, as `find_object` handles visiting relevant pixels during its search and is never called *on* a background pixel; this line could potentially interfere with the discovery process for objects adjacent to already-scanned background areas.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-examine the interaction between the main loop's iteration, the `visited` array updates (both in the loop and in `find_object`), and the `find_object` function's border detection.\n2.  Simplify the code by removing potentially problematic or redundant logic, specifically the `elif` block that marks background pixels as visited in the main loop.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to ensure they accurately reflect the consistent rule observed across all examples, assuming the code implementation needs correction rather than the rule itself.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the differences programmatically.\n\n"
