```python
"""
Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.
For each object, check if any of its constituent pixels lie on the border (first/last row or first/last column) of the grid.
If an object touches any border, replace all pixels belonging to that object with the background color (white, 0) in the output grid.
Objects that do not touch any border remain unchanged.
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
