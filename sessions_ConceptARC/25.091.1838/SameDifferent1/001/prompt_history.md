Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example provides a pair of grids, an input and an output, of the same dimensions.
2.  **Content:** The grids contain colored pixels, forming distinct shapes (objects) against a white (0) background.
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs reveals that some colored objects present in the input are entirely absent in the output (replaced by the white background color), while others remain unchanged.
4.  **Key Feature:** The determining factor for whether an object is kept or removed seems to be its position relative to the grid's borders. Objects touching any edge (top, bottom, left, or right) in the input grid are removed in the output grid. Objects entirely contained within the grid, not touching any edge, are preserved.

Grid_Properties:
  - border_rows: [0, max_row_index]
  - border_cols: [0, max_col_index]

Object_Properties:
  - is_contiguous_block: true
  - color: non-white (1-9)
  - location: set of (row, col) coordinates
  - touches_border: boolean (true if any coordinate has row=0, col=0, row=max_row, or col=max_col)

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify all distinct, contiguous non-white objects.
  - Check if any pixel of an object lies on any of the four grid borders.
  - If an object touches a border, remove it (replace all its pixels with white).
  - If an object does not touch any border, keep it unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Check if any pixel belonging to this object is located in the first row, last row, first column, or last column of the grid.
    b.  If the object touches any border (i.e., the check in step 3a is true), then iterate through all the pixel coordinates belonging to this object and set the corresponding pixel values in the output grid to white (0).
4.  Return the modified output grid. Objects that did not touch any border remain unchanged from the initial copy.
