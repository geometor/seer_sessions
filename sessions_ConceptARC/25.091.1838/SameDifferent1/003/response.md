"""
Transforms the input grid by removing non-background objects that touch the border.
An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-zero color (non-white).
A pixel touches the border if its row index is 0 or the maximum row index, or its column 
index is 0 or the maximum column index. If any pixel of an object touches the border, the 
entire object is removed (replaced with the background color 0 - white). Objects that
do not touch any border remain unchanged.
