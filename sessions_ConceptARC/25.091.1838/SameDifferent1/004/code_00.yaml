Input_Output_Mapping:
  Description: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
  Background_Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous areas of pixels with the same non-background color (1-9).
  Connectivity: Assumed to be 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).

Border_Definition:
  Type: Absolute edge of the grid.
  Coordinates: Pixels where row index is 0, row index is max_row_index (grid_height - 1), column index is 0, or column index is max_col_index (grid_width - 1).

Transformation_Rule:
  Action: Selectively remove objects from the input grid.
  Condition: An object is removed if *any* of its constituent pixels match the Border_Definition coordinates.
  Result: Removed objects are replaced entirely with the Background_Color (0). Objects not meeting the removal condition remain unchanged.

Example_Analysis:
  - id: train_1
    input_grid_size: [10, 10]
    max_row_idx: 9
    max_col_idx: 9
    objects_touching_border: # (row=0/9 or col=0/9)
      - color: azure(8), touches row 0 -> Removed by Rule
    objects_not_touching_border:
      - color: red(2) -> Kept by Rule
      - color: blue(1) -> Kept by Rule
      - color: gray(5) -> Kept by Rule
    discrepancy_with_provided_output: Provided output removes gray(5), violating the observed rule. Code output keeps gray(5). Mismatch: 8 pixels.
  - id: train_2
    input_grid_size: [8, 8]
    max_row_idx: 7
    max_col_idx: 7
    objects_touching_border:
      - color: magenta(6), touches row 0 -> Removed by Rule
      - color: yellow(4) [top-right], touches row 0 & col 7 -> Removed by Rule
      - color: orange(7), touches col 0 -> Removed by Rule
    objects_not_touching_border:
      - color: yellow(4) [center] -> Kept by Rule
      - color: red(2) -> Kept by Rule
    discrepancy_with_provided_output: None. Rule consistently applied. Code output matches.
  - id: train_3
    input_grid_size: [9, 9]
    max_row_idx: 8
    max_col_idx: 8
    objects_touching_border: None
    objects_not_touching_border:
      - color: orange(7) [top-left] -> Kept by Rule
      - color: green(3) [top-right] -> Kept by Rule
      - color: orange(7) [bottom-right] -> Kept by Rule
      - color: green(3) [bottom-left] -> Kept by Rule
    discrepancy_with_provided_output: Provided output removes orange(7) [bottom-right], violating the observed rule. Code output keeps orange(7). Mismatch: 9 pixels.
