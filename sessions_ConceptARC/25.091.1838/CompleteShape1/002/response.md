Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the symmetric case (`X Y C 0 0 C Y X`) and applied the `Y Y` fill rule, as seen in the top/bottom sections of Example 1. However, it incorrectly applied the asymmetric fill rule (`C C`) in situations where the expected output showed no change (middle rows of Example 1, top rows of Example 2).

The key insight seems to be the condition under which *any* change is made. The original code assumed any `0 0` pair with a non-white left neighbor (`C > 0`) should be filled if the symmetric rule didn't apply. The failed examples suggest a stricter condition is needed.

Comparing the cases where changes *did* happen versus where they *didn't*:
*   **Change occurred (Symmetric):** Example 1, rows 2 & 3. Pattern `1 1 2 0 0 2 1 1`. `C=2`, `D=2`. Fill `1 1`.
*   **Change occurred (Asymmetric):** Example 2, row 5. Pattern `6 6 0 0 2 0`. `C=6`, `D=2`. Fill `6 6`.
*   **No change occurred:** Example 1, rows 4-7. Patterns like `2 2 0 0 0 0` or `1 1 0 0 0 0`. `C>0`, but `D=0`.
*   **No change occurred:** Example 2, rows 1-4. Pattern `6 0 0 0 0 6`. `C=6`, `D=0`.

**Revised Strategy:** The transformation should only modify a `0 0` pair if *both* its immediate horizontal neighbors (`C` and `D`) are non-white (`C > 0` and `D > 0`). If this condition is met, then evaluate the symmetry:
1.  If the full `X Y C 0 0 C Y X` symmetry holds (with `Y > 0`), fill with `Y Y`.
2.  Otherwise (if `C > 0` and `D > 0` but full symmetry fails or `Y=0`), fill with `C C`.
3.  If the initial condition (`C > 0` and `D > 0`) is not met, make no changes to the `0 0` pair.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's re-examine the specific `C 0 0 D` contexts based on the revised strategy. We look for `input[r, c+1] == 0` and `input[r, c+2] == 0`.

**Example 1:**
*   `r=2, c=3`: `C=2`, `D=2`. Both `> 0`. Check symmetry: `X=1, Y=1, Z=1, W=1`. Symmetric, `Y=1>0`. Action: Fill `Y Y` -> `1 1`. (Matches expected)
*   `r=3, c=3`: `C=2`, `D=2`. Both `> 0`. Check symmetry: `X=1, Y=1, Z=1, W=1`. Symmetric, `Y=1>0`. Action: Fill `Y Y` -> `1 1`. (Matches expected)
*   `r=4, c=2`: `C=2`, `D=0`. `D=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=4, c=3`: `C=0`, `D=0`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=4, c=4`: `C=0`, `D=2`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=5, c=2`: `C=1`, `D=0`. `D=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=5, c=3`: `C=0`, `D=0`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=5, c=4`: `C=0`, `D=1`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=6`: Same as `r=5`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=7`: Same as `r=4`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)

**Example 2:**
*   `r=1, c=1`: `C=6`, `D=0`. `D=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=1, c=2`: `C=0`, `D=0`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=1, c=3`: `C=0`, `D=6`. `C=0`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=2`: Same as `r=1`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=3`: Same as `r=1`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=4`: Same as `r=1`. Action: No change. (Matches expected)
*   `r=5, c=3`: `C=6`, `D=2`. Both `> 0`. Check symmetry: `Y=6, Z=0`. Not symmetric. Action: Fill `C C` -> `6 6`. (Matches expected)

This revised logic correctly predicts the outcome for all identified `0 0` pairs in the training examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) of the input grid.
3.  Within each row, iterate through column indices `c` from 0 up to `width - 4`.
4.  At each position, check if the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` in the *input* grid are both white (0).
5.  If they are, identify the left flanking pixel `C = input_grid[r, c]` and the right flanking pixel `D = input_grid[r, c+3]`.
6.  Check the **fill condition**: Are both `C` and `D` non-white (`C > 0` and `D > 0`)?
7.  **If the fill condition is TRUE:**
    a.  Attempt to identify the extended context pixels: `Y = input_grid[r, c-1]` (if `c > 0`), `X = input_grid[r, c-2]` (if `c > 1`), `Z = input_grid[r, c+4]` (if `c+4 < width`), `W = input_grid[r, c+5]` (if `c+5 < width`).
    b.  Evaluate the **symmetric condition**: Check if `Y`, `X`, `Z`, `W` were all within bounds, `C == D`, `Y == Z`, `X == W`, and `Y > 0`.
    c.  If the **symmetric condition** is TRUE: Modify the *output* grid by setting the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` to the color `Y`.
    d.  If the **symmetric condition** is FALSE: Modify the *output* grid by setting the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` to the color `C`.
8.  **If the fill condition is FALSE** (i.e., `C=0` or `D=0`): Make no changes to the output grid for the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)`.
9.  After checking all possible `c` values in all rows `r`, return the modified output grid.
