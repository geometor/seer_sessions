If this condition is met, the transformation proceeds:\n\n1.  Symmetric Case Check: It checks for a fully symmetric pattern of the form 'X Y C 0 0 C Y X', where C and Y must be non-white colors (C > 0, Y > 0).\n    - Y is the pixel two positions to the left (input_grid[r, c-1]).\n    - X is the pixel three positions to the left (input_grid[r, c-2]).\n    - The symmetry requires the pixels to the right of '0 0' to mirror this: D=C, Z=Y (input_grid[r, c+4]), W=X (input_grid[r, c+5]).\n    - Boundary conditions apply: if any required context pixel (X, Y, Z, W) is out of bounds, the pattern is not considered symmetric.\n    - If the symmetric condition holds (C>0, D>0, C==D, Y>0, Y==Z, X==W, and all context pixels in bounds), the '0 0' pair in the output grid is replaced with 'Y Y'.\n\n2.  Asymmetric/Default Fill Case: If the initial condition (C > 0 and D > 0) is met, but the full symmetric condition is *not* met (either due to asymmetry, Y=0, or boundary issues for X,Y,Z,W), the '0 0' pair in the output grid is replaced with 'C C'.\n\n3.  No Change Case: If the initial condition (C > 0 and D > 0) is not met, the '0 0' pair remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThe process iterates through all possible '0 0' pair locations in each row, applying changes to a copy of the input grid based on the original input's context.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the described transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier slicing\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_arr = np.copy(input_arr)\n    height, width = input_arr.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for r in range(height):\n        # Iterate through columns, stopping early enough to check for the pattern 'C 0 0 D'\n        # We need at least index c+3, so loop up to width - 4\n        for c in range(width - 3):\n            \n            # Check if the target pixels are white ('0 0')\n            if input_arr[r, c+1] == 0 and input_arr[r, c+2] == 0:\n                \n                # Identify immediate context C and D\n                pixel_c = input_arr[r, c]\n                pixel_d = input_arr[r, c+3]\n\n                # Check the primary fill condition: Both C and D must be non-white\n                if pixel_c > 0 and pixel_d > 0:\n                    \n                    # Attempt to identify extended context X, Y, Z, W for symmetry check\n                    # Use a flag to track if all necessary context pixels are within bounds\n                    bounds_ok = True\n                    pixel_y = None\n                    pixel_x = None\n                    pixel_z = None\n                    pixel_w = None\n\n                    if c > 0:\n                        pixel_y = input_arr[r, c-1]\n                    else:\n                        bounds_ok = False\n                        \n                    if c > 1:\n                         pixel_x = input_arr[r, c-2]\n                    else:\n                        bounds_ok = False\n\n                    if c + 4 < width:\n                        pixel_z = input_arr[r, c+4]\n                    else:\n                        bounds_ok = False\n                        \n                    if c + 5 < width:\n                        pixel_w = input_arr[r, c+5]\n                    else:\n                        bounds_ok = False\n\n                    # Check symmetric condition: X Y C 0 0 C Y X\n                    # Requires C==D, Y==Z, X==W, C>0 (already checked), Y>0, and bounds_ok\n                    is_symmetric = (\n                        bounds_ok and\n                        pixel_y is not None and pixel_y > 0 and # Y must exist and be non-white\n                        pixel_c == pixel_d and    # C == D\n                        pixel_y == pixel_z and    # Y == Z\n                        pixel_x == pixel_w        # X == W\n                    )\n\n                    if is_symmetric:\n                        # Symmetric case: fill with Y Y\n                        output_arr[r, c+1] = pixel_y\n                        output_arr[r, c+2] = pixel_y\n                    else:\n                        # Asymmetric/Default case (given C>0 and D>0): fill with C C\n                        output_arr[r, c+1] = pixel_c\n                        output_arr[r, c+2] = pixel_c\n                \n                # If the primary condition (pixel_c > 0 and pixel_d > 0) is not met,\n                # do nothing, the output_arr already holds the original '0 0'.\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    return output_arr.tolist()\n\n```"
