The transformation identifies horizontally adjacent pairs of white pixels ('0 0') within each row of the input grid. 
For each '0 0' pair found at position (r, c+1) and (r, c+2), it examines the immediate horizontal neighbors: C (at r, c) and D (at r, c+3).

A change is only considered if *both* C and D are non-white (C > 0 and D > 0). If this condition is met, the transformation proceeds:

1.  Symmetric Case Check: It checks for a fully symmetric pattern of the form 'X Y C 0 0 C Y X', where C and Y must be non-white colors (C > 0, Y > 0).
    - Y is the pixel two positions to the left (input_grid[r, c-1]).
    - X is the pixel three positions to the left (input_grid[r, c-2]).
    - The symmetry requires the pixels to the right of '0 0' to mirror this: D=C, Z=Y (input_grid[r, c+4]), W=X (input_grid[r, c+5]).
    - Boundary conditions apply: if any required context pixel (X, Y, Z, W) is out of bounds, the pattern is not considered symmetric.
    - If the symmetric condition holds (C>0, D>0, C==D, Y>0, Y==Z, X==W, and all context pixels in bounds), the '0 0' pair in the output grid is replaced with 'Y Y'.

2.  Asymmetric/Default Fill Case: If the initial condition (C > 0 and D > 0) is met, but the full symmetric condition is *not* met (either due to asymmetry, Y=0, or boundary issues for X,Y,Z,W), the '0 0' pair in the output grid is replaced with 'C C'.

3.  No Change Case: If the initial condition (C > 0 and D > 0) is not met, the '0 0' pair remains unchanged in the output grid.

The process iterates through all possible '0 0' pair locations in each row, applying changes to a copy of the input grid based on the original input's context.
