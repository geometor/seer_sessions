*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs are grids containing a background color (white - 0) and several objects or patterns composed of other colors (blue - 1, red - 2, magenta - 6).
    *   The core feature seems to be pairs of adjacent white pixels (`0 0`) occurring horizontally within rows.
    *   The transformation specifically targets these `0 0` pairs based on their horizontal context (neighboring pixels).
    *   Two distinct transformation rules seem to apply depending on the symmetry of the pattern surrounding the `0 0` pair.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: pattern_completion
    focus: local_horizontal_patterns
    elements:
      - element: pixel_pair
        property: horizontal_adjacency
        value: white (0)
        notation: '0 0'
      - element: context
        property: flanking_pixels
        description: Pixels immediately to the left (C) and right (D) of the '0 0' pair.
        notation: 'C 0 0 D'
      - element: context
        property: extended_context
        description: Pixels further left (X, Y) and right (Z, W) of the C and D pixels.
        notation: 'X Y C 0 0 D Z W'
      - element: symmetry
        property: pattern_reflection
        description: Checks if the pattern reflects around the central '0 0' pair (C==D, Y==Z, X==W).
      - element: fill_color
        property: determined_by_context
        description: The color used to replace the '0 0' pair depends on symmetry and flanking/context pixels.
    actions:
      - action: find_pattern
        target: horizontal sequence 'C 0 0 D' where C and D are any color, and the middle pixels are white (0).
      - action: evaluate_symmetry
        target: the pattern 'X Y C 0 0 D Z W' surrounding the '0 0' pair.
      - action: replace_pixels
        target: the '0 0' pair.
        condition: based on symmetry evaluation.
        details:
          - if symmetric ('X Y C 0 0 C Y X', C>0, Y>0): replace '0 0' with 'Y Y'.
          - if asymmetric or bounds/color conditions fail: replace '0 0' with 'C C' (if C>0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) of the input grid.
    3.  Within each row, iterate through each possible starting column index `c` such that the pattern `C 0 0 D` can be evaluated (i.e., from index 0 up to `width - 4`).
    4.  Check if the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` are both white (0).
    5.  If they are, identify the left flanking pixel `C = input_grid[r, c]` and the right flanking pixel `D = input_grid[r, c+3]`.
    6.  Attempt to identify the extended context pixels: `Y = input_grid[r, c-1]`, `X = input_grid[r, c-2]`, `Z = input_grid[r, c+4]`, `W = input_grid[r, c+5]`, handling out-of-bounds errors (treat out-of-bounds as non-matching for symmetry).
    7.  Evaluate the symmetric condition: Check if `C > 0`, `Y > 0`, `C == D`, `Y == Z`, and `X == W` (considering bounds).
    8.  If the symmetric condition is true: Modify the output grid by setting the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` to the color `Y`.
    9.  If the symmetric condition is false: Check if the left flanking pixel `C` is non-white (`C > 0`). If it is, modify the output grid by setting the pixels at `(r, c+1)` and `(r, c+2)` to the color `C`.
    10. After checking all possible positions in all rows, return the modified output grid. (Note: Modifications should be based on the original input grid's context to avoid cascading effects within a single pass).
