"""
Identifies two non-background objects in the input grid. Determines the smaller object (by pixel count, then bounding box area) as 'mobile' and the larger as 'stationary'. Calculates the horizontal and vertical separation between their bounding boxes. The mobile object is then translated along the axis of greater separation towards the stationary object, moving a distance equal to the separation, so they become adjacent (1 pixel apart) along that axis in the output grid. The stationary object remains in place.
