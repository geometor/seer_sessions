task_description: Translate one object towards another until they are adjacent.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Fills the grid where objects are not present. Remains unchanged.
  - role: object
    count: 2 per example
    properties:
      - Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - Can be the same or different colors.
      - One object is designated 'mobile', the other 'stationary'.
  - role: mobile_object
    source: The smaller of the two objects (by area or pixel count).
    action: Translated towards the stationary object.
    properties: Retains its shape and color.
  - role: stationary_object
    source: The larger of the two objects.
    action: Remains in its original position.
    properties: Retains its shape and color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are initially separated by some distance horizontally and/or vertically.
  - type: interaction
    description: The mobile object moves towards the stationary object along the primary axis of separation (the axis with the greater distance between their bounding boxes).
    termination_condition: The movement stops when the mobile object's edge is exactly one pixel away from the stationary object's edge along the axis of movement. No overlap occurs.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, list_of_objects
  - action: determine_roles
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: mobile_object, stationary_object
    logic: The object with the smaller bounding box area (or fewer pixels) is mobile.
  - action: determine_movement_axis_and_direction
    inputs: mobile_object, stationary_object
    outputs: axis (horizontal/vertical), direction (+1 or -1)
    logic: >
      Calculate horizontal distance (min_col_stationary - max_col_mobile - 1 or min_col_mobile - max_col_stationary - 1)
      and vertical distance (min_row_stationary - max_row_mobile - 1 or min_row_mobile - max_row_stationary - 1).
      The axis with the larger positive distance is the movement axis.
      The direction is towards the stationary object along that axis.
  - action: calculate_translation_distance
    inputs: mobile_object, stationary_object, axis, direction
    outputs: translation_distance
    logic: The distance is the separation along the movement axis minus 1 (to ensure adjacency).
  - action: apply_translation
    inputs: input_grid, mobile_object, stationary_object, axis, direction, translation_distance
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create the output grid by placing the stationary object in its original location and the mobile object translated by the calculated distance along the determined axis and direction. The background remains the same.
