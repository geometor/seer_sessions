Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

In both examples, the input grid contains two distinct objects against a white background. One object remains fixed in its position from input to output, while the other object is translated (moved) to a new position.

*   In `train_1`, there's a green 'G' shape and a red 'L' shape. The green 'G' moves horizontally to the right until it is immediately adjacent to the red 'L'. The red 'L' does not move.
*   In `train_2`, there's a small yellow 2x2 square and a larger yellow 'U' shape. The small square moves vertically downwards until it is immediately adjacent to the top of the 'U' shape. The 'U' shape does not move.

The common pattern appears to be:
1.  Identify the two non-background objects.
2.  Determine which object is "mobile" and which is "stationary". It seems the smaller object (in terms of bounding box or pixel count) is the mobile one.
3.  Determine the direction of movement: The mobile object moves towards the stationary object along the axis (horizontal or vertical) where they are most separated.
4.  Calculate the distance: The mobile object moves just enough steps so that its edge becomes adjacent (1 pixel away) to the stationary object's edge along the axis of movement, without overlapping.
5.  The final output grid shows the mobile object in its new position and the stationary object in its original position, with the background unchanged.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Translate one object towards another until they are adjacent.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Fills the grid where objects are not present. Remains unchanged.
  - role: object
    count: 2 per example
    properties:
      - Contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      - Can be the same or different colors.
      - One object is designated 'mobile', the other 'stationary'.
  - role: mobile_object
    source: The smaller of the two objects (by area or pixel count).
    action: Translated towards the stationary object.
    properties: Retains its shape and color.
  - role: stationary_object
    source: The larger of the two objects.
    action: Remains in its original position.
    properties: Retains its shape and color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are initially separated by some distance horizontally and/or vertically.
  - type: interaction
    description: The mobile object moves towards the stationary object along the primary axis of separation (the axis with the greater distance between their bounding boxes).
    termination_condition: The movement stops when the mobile object's edge is exactly one pixel away from the stationary object's edge along the axis of movement. No overlap occurs.

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color, list_of_objects
  - action: determine_roles
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: mobile_object, stationary_object
    logic: The object with the smaller bounding box area (or fewer pixels) is mobile.
  - action: determine_movement_axis_and_direction
    inputs: mobile_object, stationary_object
    outputs: axis (horizontal/vertical), direction (+1 or -1)
    logic: >
      Calculate horizontal distance (min_col_stationary - max_col_mobile - 1 or min_col_mobile - max_col_stationary - 1)
      and vertical distance (min_row_stationary - max_row_mobile - 1 or min_row_mobile - max_row_stationary - 1).
      The axis with the larger positive distance is the movement axis.
      The direction is towards the stationary object along that axis.
  - action: calculate_translation_distance
    inputs: mobile_object, stationary_object, axis, direction
    outputs: translation_distance
    logic: The distance is the separation along the movement axis minus 1 (to ensure adjacency).
  - action: apply_translation
    inputs: input_grid, mobile_object, stationary_object, axis, direction, translation_distance
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create the output grid by placing the stationary object in its original location and the mobile object translated by the calculated distance along the determined axis and direction. The background remains the same.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the objects. Expect exactly two objects.
2.  Determine the bounding box for each object.
3.  Identify the smaller object (based on bounding box area or pixel count) as the `mobile_object` and the larger one as the `stationary_object`.
4.  Calculate the horizontal separation between the bounding boxes of the two objects (distance between the closest vertical edges).
5.  Calculate the vertical separation between the bounding boxes of the two objects (distance between the closest horizontal edges).
6.  Determine the primary axis of movement: If the horizontal separation is greater than the vertical separation, the movement is horizontal. Otherwise, the movement is vertical.
7.  Determine the direction of movement along the primary axis: The `mobile_object` moves towards the `stationary_object`.
8.  Calculate the translation distance: This is equal to the separation distance along the primary axis. (Moving the object by this distance will make the edges adjacent).
9.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
10. Erase the `mobile_object` from its original position in the output grid (fill its area with the background color, white).
11. Draw the `mobile_object` in its new position in the output grid, translated by the calculated distance in the determined direction along the primary axis. The `stationary_object` and the background remain unchanged from the input grid (except where the mobile object was originally located).
