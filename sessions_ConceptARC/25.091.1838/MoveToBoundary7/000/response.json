            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nIn both examples, the input grid contains two distinct objects against a white background. One object remains fixed in its position from input to output, while the other object is translated (moved) to a new position.\n\n*   In `train_1`, there's a green 'G' shape and a red 'L' shape. The green 'G' moves horizontally to the right until it is immediately adjacent to the red 'L'. The red 'L' does not move.\n*   In `train_2`, there's a small yellow 2x2 square and a larger yellow 'U' shape. The small square moves vertically downwards until it is immediately adjacent to the top of the 'U' shape. The 'U' shape does not move.\n\nThe common pattern appears to be:\n1.  Identify the two non-background objects.\n2.  Determine which object is \"mobile\" and which is \"stationary\". It seems the smaller object (in terms of bounding box or pixel count) is the mobile one.\n3.  Determine the direction of movement: The mobile object moves towards the stationary object along the axis (horizontal or vertical) where they are most separated.\n4.  Calculate the distance: The mobile object moves just enough steps so that its edge becomes adjacent (1 pixel away) to the stationary object's edge along the axis of movement, without overlapping.\n5.  The final output grid shows the mobile object in its new position and the stationary object in its original position, with the background unchanged.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
