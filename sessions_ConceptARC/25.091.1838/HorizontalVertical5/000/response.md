Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white pixels (0) and one or more connected components (objects) made of yellow pixels (4).
2.  **Output Grid:** Is largely identical to the input grid, but with one modification: a single line (either a full row or a full column) consisting entirely of green pixels (3) is added along one of the four edges of the grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the yellow object(s), determining their overall shape and position relative to the grid boundaries, and then deciding *which* edge (top, bottom, left, or right) should receive the line of green pixels based on these properties.
4.  **Key Properties:** The crucial factors seem to be:
    *   The bounding box of the yellow pixels.
    *   Whether the bounding box touches any of the four edges of the grid.
    *   The height and width of the bounding box if it *doesn't* touch an edge.
5.  **Color Change:** A new color, green (3), is introduced in the output, forming a line along one edge. The original yellow (4) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their relative positions.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Add a single line (row or column) of green pixels to one edge of the input grid, based on the properties of the yellow object(s).

elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills the space not occupied by the main object.
  - object: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    role: primary element whose properties determine the transformation.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing yellow pixels.
      - touches_edge: boolean flag indicating if the bounding_box touches row 0, row H-1, col 0, or col W-1.
      - height: number of rows spanned by the bounding_box.
      - width: number of columns spanned by the bounding_box.
  - object: added_line
    color: green (3)
    role: the element added to the output grid.
    properties:
      - type: row or column
      - location: top edge (row 0), bottom edge (row H-1), left edge (col 0), or right edge (col W-1).

relationships:
  - determines:
      - source: properties of the yellow shape (bounding_box, touches_edge, height, width)
      - target: location and type of the added_line (green)

transformation_logic:
  - condition: yellow shape's bounding box touches any grid edge
    action: add a green row at the top edge (row 0).
  - condition: yellow shape's bounding box does not touch any grid edge
    sub_conditions:
      - condition: bounding box height equals width
        action: add a green row at the top edge (row 0).
      - condition: bounding box width is greater than height
        action: add a green column at the right edge (col W-1).
      - condition: bounding box height is greater than width (inferred, not in examples)
        action: (potential action needed, e.g., add green column at left edge or green row at bottom edge - sticking to observed patterns for now) The observed examples only cover touching, square, and wider-than-tall cases when not touching.
  - final_step: Copy the original input grid onto the output grid, overwriting the added green line's location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels with the color yellow (4). If no yellow pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged (assumption based on task structure).
3.  Determine the bounding box of the yellow pixels: find the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`).
4.  Calculate the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
5.  Check if the bounding box touches any edge of the grid: set `touches_edge` to true if `min_r == 0` or `max_r == H-1` or `min_c == 0` or `max_c == W-1`. Otherwise, set `touches_edge` to false.
6.  Calculate the height of the bounding box: `H_obj = max_r - min_r + 1`.
7.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `W_obj = max_c - min_c + 1`.
8.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
9.  Determine where to add the green line:
    a.  If `touches_edge` is true, fill the entire first row (row 0) of the output grid with green (3).
    b.  If `touches_edge` is false:
        i.  If `H_obj == W_obj`, fill the entire first row (row 0) of the output grid with green (3).
        ii. If `W_obj > H_obj`, fill the entire last column (column `W-1`) of the output grid with green (3).
        iii. If `H_obj > W_obj`, (this case is not covered by the training examples; based on observed patterns, no action is explicitly defined, but following the logic suggests potentially filling the last row or first column. For now, stick to observed cases).
10. Return the modified output grid.
