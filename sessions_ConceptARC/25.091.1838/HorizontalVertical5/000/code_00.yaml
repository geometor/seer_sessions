task_description: Add a single line (row or column) of green pixels to one edge of the input grid, based on the properties of the yellow object(s).

elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills the space not occupied by the main object.
  - object: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    role: primary element whose properties determine the transformation.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing yellow pixels.
      - touches_edge: boolean flag indicating if the bounding_box touches row 0, row H-1, col 0, or col W-1.
      - height: number of rows spanned by the bounding_box.
      - width: number of columns spanned by the bounding_box.
  - object: added_line
    color: green (3)
    role: the element added to the output grid.
    properties:
      - type: row or column
      - location: top edge (row 0), bottom edge (row H-1), left edge (col 0), or right edge (col W-1).

relationships:
  - determines:
      - source: properties of the yellow shape (bounding_box, touches_edge, height, width)
      - target: location and type of the added_line (green)

transformation_logic:
  - condition: yellow shape's bounding box touches any grid edge
    action: add a green row at the top edge (row 0).
  - condition: yellow shape's bounding box does not touch any grid edge
    sub_conditions:
      - condition: bounding box height equals width
        action: add a green row at the top edge (row 0).
      - condition: bounding box width is greater than height
        action: add a green column at the right edge (col W-1).
      - condition: bounding box height is greater than width (inferred, not in examples)
        action: (potential action needed, e.g., add green column at left edge or green row at bottom edge - sticking to observed patterns for now) The observed examples only cover touching, square, and wider-than-tall cases when not touching.
  - final_step: Copy the original input grid onto the output grid, overwriting the added green line's location.
