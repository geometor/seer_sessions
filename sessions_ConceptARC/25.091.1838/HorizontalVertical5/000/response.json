The original yellow (4) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If no yellow pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged (assumption based on task structure).\n3.  Determine the bounding box of the yellow pixels: find the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`).\n4.  Calculate the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.\n5.  Check if the bounding box touches any edge of the grid: set `touches_edge` to true if `min_r == 0` or `max_r == H-1` or `min_c == 0` or `max_c == W-1`. Otherwise, set `touches_edge` to false.\n6.  Calculate the height of the bounding box: `H_obj = max_r - min_r + 1`.\n7.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `W_obj = max_c - min_c + 1`.\n8.
