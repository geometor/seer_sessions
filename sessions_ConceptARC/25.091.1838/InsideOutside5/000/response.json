Many of these objects are hollow rectangular shapes acting as borders or containers, typically with a single color outlining an area of white pixels. Inside some of these container objects, there are other distinct objects of different colors.\n\nThe transformation involves identifying objects that are fully enclosed *within* another object. The outer object often acts as a frame or container. Only the objects found *inside* these containers are preserved in the output grid. All other pixels, including the container objects themselves and any objects not enclosed, are turned white (0). The position and color of the preserved inner objects remain unchanged relative to the grid dimensions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each object (`object_A`), determine if it acts as a container. A container is typically a hollow shape, often rectangular, made of a single color.\n3.  For each potential container object (`object_A`), identify all other distinct objects (`object_B`) located within the geometric boundaries defined by `object_A`.\n4.  Check if `object_B` is *fully* contained within `object_A`. This means all pixels of `object_B` must reside within the area enclosed by `object_A`, not touching or overlapping `object_A` itself.\n5.  Create a new output grid initialized with white pixels (0) and having the same dimensions as the input grid.\n6.  Copy only those objects (`object_B`) that were identified as being fully contained within a container object (`object_A`) from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original colors and positions.\n7.
