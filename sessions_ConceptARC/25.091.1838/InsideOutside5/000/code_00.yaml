observations:
  - task_type: object_extraction
  - description: Identify and extract objects that are fully contained within other hollow objects (containers).
  - components:
      - input_grid:
          - contains: multiple distinct objects of various colors (non-white).
          - background: white (0).
          - features:
              - some objects are hollow rectangular shapes (containers/borders) of a single color.
              - some objects are solid shapes.
              - some solid objects are located geographically inside the area defined by the hollow objects.
      - output_grid:
          - background: entirely white (0).
          - contents: only the objects that were located inside a container object in the input grid.
          - properties:
              - preserved_objects: maintain their original color and relative position from the input.
              - removed_objects: container objects and any objects not enclosed within another are removed (turned white).
  - rule: An object is preserved if and only if it is fully enclosed within the boundaries of another hollow, single-color object.
  - examples:
      - example_1:
          - input: Contains red, green, and magenta hollow containers. A yellow object is inside the red container.
          - output: Only the yellow object remains.
      - example_2:
          - input: Contains yellow, gray, magenta, and orange objects. A green object is inside the gray container.
          - output: Only the green object remains.
      - example_3:
          - input: Contains orange, maroon, and green containers. An azure object (containing a green object) is inside the orange container. A small azure object is inside the green container.
          - output: Only the azure object (with its internal green object) from inside the orange container and the small azure object from inside the green container remain.
