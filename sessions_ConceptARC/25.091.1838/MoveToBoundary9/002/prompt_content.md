"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-white pixels in the input grid.
For each object, determine its horizontal center based on its leftmost and rightmost columns.
Compare the object's horizontal center to the grid's horizontal midpoint.
If the object's center is to the left of the grid's midpoint, calculate the horizontal shift needed to move the object's leftmost column to column 0.
If the object's center is at or to the right of the grid's midpoint, calculate the horizontal shift needed to move the object's rightmost column to the last column of the grid.
Create an output grid initialized with the background color (white, 0).
For each object, copy its pixels to the output grid at their original row and shifted column.
