task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - variable_size: true
  objects: # Redefined: Now represents groups of pixels by color
    - type: color_group
    - description: All pixels of the same non-background color are treated as a single group.
    - properties:
        - color
        - pixel_coordinates: list of (row, column) tuples for all pixels of this color.
        - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) encompassing all pixels of this color.
        - horizontal_extent: (min_col, max_col) derived from the bounding box.
        - horizontal_center: (min_col + max_col) / 2
  actions:
    - action: identify_color_groups
      description: Find all unique non-background colors present and list the coordinates of all pixels for each color.
    - action: calculate_group_properties
      description: For each color group, determine its horizontal extent (min_col, max_col) and horizontal center.
    - action: determine_movement_direction
      description: Compare the group's horizontal center to the grid's horizontal midpoint.
      details: Groups centered left of the midpoint move left; groups centered at or right of the midpoint move right.
    - action: calculate_horizontal_shift
      description: Determine the column offset needed to move the entire group to the corresponding edge based on its overall horizontal extent.
      details:
        - For leftward movement, shift = 0 - group's overall min_col.
        - For rightward movement, shift = (grid_width - 1) - group's overall max_col.
    - action: apply_group_shift
      description: Apply the calculated horizontal shift uniformly to all pixels belonging to the color group.
    - action: render_output
      description: Create a new grid of the same size, initially white, and draw the shifted pixels of all color groups onto it.
  relationships:
    - relationship: group_center_vs_grid_center
      description: A color group's overall horizontal center determines its movement direction (left or right).
    - relationship: group_extent_vs_grid_boundary
      description: A color group's overall min_col or max_col determines the magnitude of the shift required to reach the edge.
    - relationship: intra_group_position
      description: The relative positions of pixels within a color group are preserved during the shift.
