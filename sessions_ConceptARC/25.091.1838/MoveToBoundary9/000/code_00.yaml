task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - variable_size: true
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_pixels_same_color
    - exclude_color: white (0)
    - properties:
        - color
        - shape
        - position (row, column)
        - bounding_box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
        - horizontal_center
  actions:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    - action: determine_movement_direction
      description: Based on the object's horizontal position relative to the grid's horizontal center.
      details: Objects centered to the left of the grid's midpoint move left; objects centered at or to the right of the midpoint move right.
    - action: calculate_horizontal_shift
      description: Determine the column offset needed to move the object to the corresponding edge.
      details:
        - For leftward movement, shift = 0 - object's leftmost column.
        - For rightward movement, shift = (grid_width - 1) - object's rightmost column.
    - action: apply_shift
      description: Move all pixels of an object by the calculated horizontal shift.
    - action: render_output
      description: Create a new grid of the same size, initially white, and draw the shifted objects onto it.
  relationships:
    - relationship: object_position_vs_grid_center
      description: An object's horizontal center determines its movement direction (left or right).
    - relationship: object_extent_vs_grid_boundary
      description: An object's leftmost or rightmost column determines the magnitude of the shift required to reach the edge.
