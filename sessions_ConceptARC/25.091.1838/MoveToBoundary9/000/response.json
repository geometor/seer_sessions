            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (`train_1` and `train_2`).\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both examples involve rectangular grids of varying sizes containing pixels of different colors. The background is predominantly white (0).\n*   **Objects:** In both inputs, there are distinct groups of non-white pixels.\n    *   `train_1`: A 3x3 red (2) square and a 3x3 blue (1) square.\n    *   `train_2`: Several green (3) pixels forming disconnected shapes and several yellow (4) pixels forming disconnected shapes. These can be conceptually grouped by color.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal movement of the non-white objects or pixel groups.\n    *   In `train_1`, the red square moves to the leftmost edge, and the blue square moves to the rightmost edge.\n    *   In `train_2`, all green pixels collectively shift to the leftmost edge, and all yellow pixels collectively shift to the rightmost edge.\n*   **Movement Logic:** The direction of movement seems related to the initial horizontal position of the object/group relative to the grid's center. Objects starting on the left side move left, and objects starting on the right side move right. The movement continues until the object hits the respective grid boundary (left or right edge). The objects maintain their original shape and color during the move.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If `obj_center < mid_col`, the object moves left. Set `delta_col = 0 - obj_min_col`.\n        ii. If `obj_center >= mid_col`, the object moves right.
