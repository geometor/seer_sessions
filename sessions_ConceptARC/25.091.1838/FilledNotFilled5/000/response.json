The outermost layer of red pixels from the input remains, but the interior red pixels have been changed to the background color (white, 0).\n    *   The transformation involves identifying the interior pixels of the solid red shape and changing them to the background color, effectively hollowing out the shape.\n\n**General Observation:**\n\nThe task seems to involve identifying a single, primary colored object on a background. The transformation depends on whether this object is initially \"hollow\" (contains an enclosed background area) or \"solid\" (does not contain an enclosed background area). If the object is hollow, it gets filled with its own color. If the object is solid, its interior is removed (changed to the background color), making it hollow. The \"background\" color is consistently white (0) in the examples. The \"object\" color varies (green or red).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine if the primary object in the input grid is \"hollow\" or \"solid\":\n    *   Check if there are any background-colored pixels completely surrounded by object-colored pixels (using 4-way adjacency/flood fill from the border is a good way to test: any background pixel *not* reached by a flood fill starting from the border background pixels is enclosed).\n    *   If such enclosed background pixels exist, the object is \"hollow\".\n    *   Otherwise, the object is \"solid\".\n3.
