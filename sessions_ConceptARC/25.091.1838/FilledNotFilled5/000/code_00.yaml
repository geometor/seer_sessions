task_type: object_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: dominant color, typically white (0)
  - primary_object: contiguous shape of a single non-background color
properties:
  - object_color: color of the primary object
  - object_state:
      type: categorical
      values: [hollow, solid]
      definition:
        hollow: contains one or more regions of background_color fully enclosed by object_color pixels.
        solid: does not contain any background_color regions fully enclosed by object_color pixels.
transformation: conditional_fill_or_hollow
conditions:
  - if: object_state == hollow
    action: fill_hollow_region
    parameters:
      fill_color: object_color
      target_pixels: enclosed background_color pixels
  - if: object_state == solid
    action: hollow_solid_object
    parameters:
      hollow_color: background_color
      target_pixels: interior object_color pixels (pixels whose 8 neighbors are all object_color)
output_features:
  - grid: transformed 2D array
relationship: the output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions. The transformation modifies pixels based on the object's state (hollow/solid) and geometry.
