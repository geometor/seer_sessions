task_type: object_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - background_color: dominant color, identified as white (0) in examples.
  - primary_object: single contiguous shape of a non-background color.
properties:
  - object_color: color of the primary object.
  - object_state:
      type: categorical
      values: [hollow, solid]
      definition:
        hollow: determined by checking if any background_color pixels are unreachable by a 4-way flood fill starting from background_color pixels on the grid border.
        solid: not hollow.
transformation: conditional_fill_or_hollow
conditions:
  - if: object_state == hollow
    action: fill_hollow_region
    parameters:
      fill_color: object_color
      target_pixels: background_color pixels not reachable by 4-way flood fill from border background_color pixels.
  - if: object_state == solid
    action: hollow_solid_object
    parameters:
      hollow_color: background_color
      target_pixels: object_color pixels that are *not* 4-way adjacent (N, S, E, W) to any background_color pixel.
      kept_pixels: object_color pixels that *are* 4-way adjacent to at least one background_color pixel (these form the resulting shell).
output_features:
  - grid: transformed 2D array
relationship: the output grid dimensions are the same as the input grid dimensions. The transformation modifies pixels based on the object's state (hollow/solid) and adjacency relationships.
