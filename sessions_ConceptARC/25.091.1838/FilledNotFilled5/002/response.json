            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the two core transformation types: filling a hollow object and hollowing a solid object. The code successfully implemented the \"fill hollow\" logic for Example 1. However, the \"hollow solid\" logic failed for Example 2. The definition of an \"interior\" pixel (one whose 8 neighbors are the same color) was too restrictive and did not correctly capture the pixels that should be removed to create the hollow shape seen in the expected output.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to redefine the criteria for hollowing a solid object. Instead of identifying pixels surrounded by 8 identical neighbors, we should identify object pixels that form the \"outer shell\" or \"boundary\" and keep only those, changing the rest of the object pixels to the background color. The boundary pixels appear to be those object pixels that are adjacent (using 4-way adjacency: North, South, East, West) to at least one background pixel.\n\n## Metrics and Evidence Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the specific failure in Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Input:**\n"
