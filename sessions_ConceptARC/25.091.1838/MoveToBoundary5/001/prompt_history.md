Okay, I will analyze the provided task examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

*   Each input grid contains a single, contiguous object of a non-white color (gray or orange in the examples) set against a white background.
*   The corresponding output grid is the same size as the input grid and also contains only a white background and the same single object.
*   The object in the output grid has the exact same shape and color as the object in the input grid.
*   The key difference between the input and output is the position of the object. The object appears to be translated (shifted) within the grid.
*   In the first example (gray object), the object moves purely horizontally to the right.
*   In the second example (orange object), the object moves purely vertically downwards.
*   The distance of the shift appears constant in both examples (3 cells).
*   Comparing the dimensions of the object's bounding box seems relevant:
    *   Example 1: The gray object's bounding box is 5x5. It moves right.
    *   Example 2: The orange object's bounding box is 6 (height) x 5 (width). It moves down.
*   This suggests a rule: If the bounding box height is greater than its width, move down by 3. Otherwise (if width is greater than or equal to height), move right by 3.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  size: constant between input and output
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - count: 1 per grid
    description: A single contiguous block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      color: preserved between input and output
      shape: preserved between input and output
      position: changes between input and output
transformation:
  type: translation
  details:
    - The single object identified in the input is translated to a new position in the output.
    - The translation distance is constant: 3 cells.
    - The translation direction depends on the object's bounding box dimensions:
        - If bounding_box_height > bounding_box_width:
            direction: down (positive row shift)
        - If bounding_box_width >= bounding_box_height:
            direction: right (positive column shift)
output_generation:
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Draw the translated object at its new location using its original color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the grid dimensions and the background color (which is white, 0).
2.  Locate the single contiguous object composed of non-background colored pixels in the input grid. Note its color and the coordinates of all its pixels.
3.  Determine the bounding box of this object (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
4.  Calculate the height and width of the bounding box.
5.  Compare the height and width:
    *   If the height is strictly greater than the width, determine the translation vector as (3 rows down, 0 columns across).
    *   Otherwise (if the width is greater than or equal to the height), determine the translation vector as (0 rows down, 3 columns across).
6.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
7.  For each pixel belonging to the original object, calculate its new coordinates by adding the determined translation vector (row shift, column shift).
8.  Place the object's original color at these new coordinates in the output grid.
