The object appears to be translated (shifted) within the grid.\n*   In the first example (gray object), the object moves purely horizontally to the right.\n*   In the second example (orange object), the object moves purely vertically downwards.\n*   The distance of the shift appears constant in both examples (3 cells).\n*   Comparing the dimensions of the object's bounding box seems relevant:\n    *   Example 1: The gray object's bounding box is 5x5. It moves right.\n    *   Example 2: The orange object's bounding box is 6 (height) x 5 (width). It moves down.\n*   This suggests a rule: If the bounding box height is greater than its width, move down by 3. Otherwise (if width is greater than or equal to height), move right by 3.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
