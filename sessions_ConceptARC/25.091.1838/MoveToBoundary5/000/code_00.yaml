task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  size: constant between input and output
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - count: 1 per grid
    description: A single contiguous block of a non-white color.
    properties:
      color: preserved between input and output
      shape: preserved between input and output
      position: changes between input and output
transformation:
  type: translation
  details:
    - The single object identified in the input is translated to a new position in the output.
    - The translation distance is constant: 3 cells.
    - The translation direction depends on the object's bounding box dimensions:
        - If bounding_box_height > bounding_box_width:
            direction: down (positive row shift)
        - If bounding_box_width >= bounding_box_height:
            direction: right (positive column shift)
output_generation:
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - Draw the translated object at its new location using its original color.
