task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white), identified as the most frequent color in the grid.
    - grid_size_varies: true (13x13, 12x12, 15x15)
  objects:
    - role: main_shape
      identification: The set of all connected pixels corresponding to the most frequent non-background color.
      properties:
        - color: Varies (red, green, yellow).
        - structure: Can be solid (ex3), hollow (ex2), or complex (ex1, 'X'). Forms the largest visual element.
      attributes:
        - bounding_box: Defined by the minimum and maximum row/column indices occupied by any pixel of the main_shape color.
          - Example 1 bounds: (0, 0, 12, 12) for red(2) pixels.
          - Example 2 bounds: (0, 0, 10, 10) for green(3) pixels.
          - Example 3 bounds: (4, 3, 10, 9) for yellow(4) pixels.
        - center: Calculated as the geometric center of the bounding_box using integer division: (floor((min_row + max_row) / 2), floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)).
          - Example 1 center: (6, 6)
          - Example 2 center: (5, 5)
          - Example 3 center: (7, 6)
    - role: marker_pixel
      identification: The single pixel whose color appears exactly once in the input grid and is not the background color.
      properties:
        - color: Varies (yellow, orange, azure).
        - count: Exactly 1.
      attributes:
        - source_location: Its (row, column) coordinates in the input grid.
          - Example 1 source: (1, 10)
          - Example 2 source: (11, 11)
          - Example 3 source: (3, 13)
transformation:
  action: Relocate the marker_pixel to the center of the main_shape.
  steps:
    - Identify the background color (most frequent).
    - Identify the main_shape color (most frequent non-background).
    - Identify the marker_pixel (unique non-background color) and its source_location.
    - Find all pixels of the main_shape color.
    - Calculate the bounding_box of the main_shape pixels.
    - Calculate the target_location (center of the bounding_box).
    - Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - Update the output grid: Set pixel at source_location to the background color.
    - Update the output grid: Set pixel at target_location to the marker_pixel's color.
