Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and derive the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Background:** All examples use white (0) as the primary background color.
2.  **Main Shape:** Each input grid features a prominent, large geometric shape composed of a single color (red 'X' in train_1, green hollow rectangle in train_2, yellow solid rectangle in train_3). This shape remains static between input and output.
3.  **Unique Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one pixel whose color is distinct from both the background and the main shape's color (yellow in train_1, orange in train_2, azure in train_3). I'll refer to this as the "marker pixel".
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the "marker pixel". In the output grid, the marker pixel appears at the geometric center of the main shape (or the grid itself, which coincides with the shape's center in train_1). The original location of the marker pixel is changed to the background color (white). The pixel color originally at the center location is overwritten by the marker pixel's color.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - grid_size_varies: true
  main_object:
    - description: A large, contiguous shape of a single color, distinct from the background.
    - properties:
        - color: Varies (red, green, yellow in examples)
        - structure: Can be solid, hollow, or complex (X-shape)
    - role: Defines the target location for the transformation. Remains static otherwise.
    - identification: Typically the largest non-background object.
  secondary_object:
    - description: A single, unique pixel with a color different from the background and the main object.
    - properties:
        - color: Varies (yellow, orange, azure in examples)
        - count: Exactly one per grid.
    - role: The object to be moved.
    - identification: The pixel whose color is unique compared to the background and the main object.
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  source_pixel:
    - description: The unique secondary object (marker pixel).
    - location: Its original coordinates in the input grid.
    - color: Its original color.
  target_location:
    - description: The geometric center of the bounding box of the main object.
    - calculation:
        - Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the main object (bounding box).
        - Target row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2)
        - Target column = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)
  output_grid_changes:
    - The pixel at the source_pixel's original location is set to the background color (white, 0).
    - The pixel at the target_location is set to the source_pixel's color.
    - All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (which is consistently white, 0).
2.  Identify all contiguous objects (pixels of the same color connected horizontally or vertically) that are not the background color.
3.  Determine the largest object among these; this is the "main shape".
4.  Find the single pixel in the grid whose color is neither the background color nor the color of the "main shape". Record this pixel's color (the "marker color") and its original coordinates (the "source location").
5.  Determine the bounding box of the "main shape" by finding its minimum and maximum row and column indices.
6.  Calculate the geometric center coordinates (the "target location") of this bounding box:
    *   `target_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2)`
    *   `target_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)`
7.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
8.  Modify the output grid:
    *   Set the pixel at the "source location" to the background color (white, 0).
    *   Set the pixel at the "target location" to the "marker color".
