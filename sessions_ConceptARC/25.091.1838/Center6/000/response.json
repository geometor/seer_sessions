            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and derive the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** All examples use white (0) as the primary background color.\n2.  **Main Shape:** Each input grid features a prominent, large geometric shape composed of a single color (red 'X' in train_1, green hollow rectangle in train_2, yellow solid rectangle in train_3). This shape remains static between input and output.\n3.  **Unique Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one pixel whose color is distinct from both the background and the main shape's color (yellow in train_1, orange in train_2, azure in train_3). I'll refer to this as the \"marker pixel\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the \"marker pixel\". In the output grid, the marker pixel appears at the geometric center of the main shape (or the grid itself, which coincides with the shape's center in train_1). The original location of the marker pixel is changed to the background color (white). The pixel color originally at the center location is overwritten by the marker pixel's color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
