task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - grid_size_varies: true
  main_object:
    - description: A large, contiguous shape of a single color, distinct from the background.
    - properties:
        - color: Varies (red, green, yellow in examples)
        - structure: Can be solid, hollow, or complex (X-shape)
    - role: Defines the target location for the transformation. Remains static otherwise.
    - identification: Typically the largest non-background object.
  secondary_object:
    - description: A single, unique pixel with a color different from the background and the main object.
    - properties:
        - color: Varies (yellow, orange, azure in examples)
        - count: Exactly one per grid.
    - role: The object to be moved.
    - identification: The pixel whose color is unique compared to the background and the main object.
transformation:
  action: move_pixel
  source_pixel:
    - description: The unique secondary object (marker pixel).
    - location: Its original coordinates in the input grid.
    - color: Its original color.
  target_location:
    - description: The geometric center of the bounding box of the main object.
    - calculation:
        - Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the main object (bounding box).
        - Target row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2)
        - Target column = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2)
  output_grid_changes:
    - The pixel at the source_pixel's original location is set to the background color (white, 0).
    - The pixel at the target_location is set to the source_pixel's color.
    - All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
