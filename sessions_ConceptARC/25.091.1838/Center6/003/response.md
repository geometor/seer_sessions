Transformation Rule:
1. Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2. Identify the 'main shape' by finding all pixels belonging to the most frequent color that is *not* the background color.
3. Locate the unique 'marker pixel' by finding the single pixel whose color differs from both the background color and the main shape's color. Note its color ('marker color') and original coordinates ('source location').
4. Calculate the bounding box of the main shape by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by its pixels.
5. Calculate the 'target location' coordinates, which are the geometric center of the bounding box (using integer division: `row = (min_row + max_row) // 2`, `col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`).
6. Generate the output grid by first copying the input grid.
7. Modify the copied grid: set the pixel at the 'source location' to the background color.
8. Modify the copied grid: set the pixel at the 'target location' to the 'marker color'.
