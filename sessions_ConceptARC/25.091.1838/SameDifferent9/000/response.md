Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background and one or more distinct objects. In all examples, there are exactly two objects.
2.  **Object Shape:** The objects appear to be hollow rectangles or frames.
3.  **Object Colors (Input):** The objects in the input grids consistently use yellow (4) and orange (7). Each example contains at least one yellow pixel and at least one orange pixel, typically forming separate objects.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the white background and the exact shapes and positions of the objects from the input grid.
5.  **Object Colors (Output):** The key change is the color of the objects. All pixels that were yellow (4) or orange (7) in the input are changed to a *single* new color in the output. This new color is either azure (8) or gray (5).
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The choice between azure (8) and gray (5) as the output color seems to depend on a global property of the input grid related to the yellow and orange pixels. Comparing the examples:
    *   Examples 1 & 4 result in azure (8). In these examples, the count of yellow pixels equals the count of orange pixels.
    *   Examples 2 & 3 result in gray (5). In these examples, the count of yellow pixels is *not* equal to the count of orange pixels.
7.  **Hypothesis:** The rule is: Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels and orange (7) pixels in the input grid. If these counts are equal, replace all yellow and orange pixels with azure (8). If the counts are unequal, replace all yellow and orange pixels with gray (5).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  Count the total number of pixels with the color yellow (4). Let this be `count_yellow`.
3.  Count the total number of pixels with the color orange (7). Let this be `count_orange`.
4.  Compare `count_yellow` and `count_orange`.
5.  If `count_yellow` is equal to `count_orange`, set the `target_color` to azure (8).
6.  If `count_yellow` is not equal to `count_orange`, set the `target_color` to gray (5).
7.  Create the output grid by iterating through each pixel of the input grid:
    *   If the input pixel color is yellow (4) or orange (7), set the corresponding output pixel color to the determined `target_color`.
    *   Otherwise (if the input pixel color is white (0)), keep the output pixel color the same as the input (white (0)).
8.  Return the resulting output grid.
