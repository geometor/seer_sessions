This frame has a different color in each example (green, red, orange).\n    *   Other, smaller objects exist, some located spatially within the boundaries of the frame, and others outside the frame. These smaller objects have a distinct color from the frame (yellow, blue, azure).\n    *   Comparing input and output grids reveals that the frame object and any objects located entirely outside the frame remain unchanged.\n    *   The key transformation is the removal (replacement with the white background color) of all objects that are entirely contained *within* the hollow space of the frame object.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
