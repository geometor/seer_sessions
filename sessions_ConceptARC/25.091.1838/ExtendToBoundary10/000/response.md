Okay, I will analyze the provided example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input grids feature a prominent, hollow rectangular structure made of yellow (4) pixels. The interior of this rectangle is initially filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  **Trigger Pixels:** In addition to the yellow structure, there are one or more orange (7) pixels located *outside* the yellow rectangle.
3.  **Output Grid Changes:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except for specific white pixels *inside* the yellow rectangle. These interior white pixels have been changed to orange (7).
4.  **Relationship between Trigger and Change:**
    *   In the first example, the orange trigger pixel is at `(5, 0)`, to the left of the yellow rectangle. The change occurs along row 5, inside the horizontal span of the rectangle.
    *   In the second example, there are two orange trigger pixels, one at `(10, 3)` and another at `(11, 9)`, both below the yellow rectangle. The changes occur along column 3 and column 9, respectively, inside the vertical span of the rectangle.
5.  **Rule Inference:** The location of an orange pixel outside the yellow rectangle determines an axis (row or column). The transformation involves "filling" the white pixels *inside* the yellow rectangle along that specific axis with the orange color. If the trigger is horizontal relative to the rectangle (left/right), the fill is horizontal (row). If the trigger is vertical relative to the rectangle (above/below), the fill is vertical (column).

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: boundary
    attributes:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: hollow rectangle (potentially complex border)
      role: defines an interior region
  - object: trigger_pixel
    attributes:
      color: orange (7)
      location: outside the boundary object
      role: determines axis and color for modification
  - object: interior_pixel
    attributes:
      initial_color: white (0)
      location: inside the boundary object
      role: potentially modified based on trigger pixels
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: boundary
    details: The trigger pixel's position relative to the boundary (left/right vs. above/below) determines the axis (row vs. column) of modification.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates defining the boundary object and its interior
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates and color (orange) of trigger pixels outside the boundary
  - name: determine_modification_axis
    input: trigger_pixel_coordinate, boundary_coordinates
    output: axis (row index or column index) to be modified
  - name: modify_interior
    input: input_grid, boundary_interior_coordinates, modification_axis, trigger_pixel_color
    output: modified_grid
    details: Change the color of white (0) pixels within the boundary interior that lie on the modification axis to the trigger pixel's color (orange, 7).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the primary structure, which is a hollow shape made of yellow (4) pixels. Determine the coordinates that define the interior region of this yellow structure.
3.  Scan the input grid for any orange (7) pixels located *outside* the yellow structure. These are the "trigger pixels".
4.  For each trigger pixel found:
    a.  Determine its row index (`trigger_row`) and column index (`trigger_col`).
    b.  Determine if the trigger pixel is primarily positioned horizontally (left or right) or vertically (above or below) relative to the main body of the yellow structure.
    c.  If the trigger pixel is positioned horizontally (e.g., its column index is less than the minimum column index or greater than the maximum column index of the yellow structure), the modification axis is the *row* corresponding to `trigger_row`. Iterate through all columns within the horizontal span of the yellow structure's interior. For each cell `(trigger_row, col)` that is inside the yellow structure's interior and is currently white (0) in the output grid, change its color to orange (7).
    d.  If the trigger pixel is positioned vertically (e.g., its row index is less than the minimum row index or greater than the maximum row index of the yellow structure), the modification axis is the *column* corresponding to `trigger_col`. Iterate through all rows within the vertical span of the yellow structure's interior. For each cell `(row, trigger_col)` that is inside the yellow structure's interior and is currently white (0) in the output grid, change its color to orange (7).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
