elements:
  - object: boundary
    attributes:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: hollow rectangle (potentially complex border)
      role: defines an interior region
  - object: trigger_pixel
    attributes:
      color: orange (7)
      location: outside the boundary object
      role: determines axis and color for modification
  - object: interior_pixel
    attributes:
      initial_color: white (0)
      location: inside the boundary object
      role: potentially modified based on trigger pixels
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: boundary
    details: The trigger pixel's position relative to the boundary (left/right vs. above/below) determines the axis (row vs. column) of modification.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates defining the boundary object and its interior
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates and color (orange) of trigger pixels outside the boundary
  - name: determine_modification_axis
    input: trigger_pixel_coordinate, boundary_coordinates
    output: axis (row index or column index) to be modified
  - name: modify_interior
    input: input_grid, boundary_interior_coordinates, modification_axis, trigger_pixel_color
    output: modified_grid
    details: Change the color of white (0) pixels within the boundary interior that lie on the modification axis to the trigger pixel's color (orange, 7).
