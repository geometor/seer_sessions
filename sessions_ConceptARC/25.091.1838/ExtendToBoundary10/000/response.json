The interior of this rectangle is initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Trigger Pixels:** In addition to the yellow structure, there are one or more orange (7) pixels located *outside* the yellow rectangle.\n3.  **Output Grid Changes:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, except for specific white pixels *inside* the yellow rectangle. These interior white pixels have been changed to orange (7).\n4.  **Relationship between Trigger and Change:**\n    *   In the first example, the orange trigger pixel is at `(5, 0)`, to the left of the yellow rectangle. The change occurs along row 5, inside the horizontal span of the rectangle.\n    *   In the second example, there are two orange trigger pixels, one at `(10, 3)` and another at `(11, 9)`, both below the yellow rectangle. The changes occur along column 3 and column 9, respectively, inside the vertical span of the rectangle.\n5.  **Rule Inference:** The location of an orange pixel outside the yellow rectangle determines an axis (row or column). The transformation involves \"filling\" the white pixels *inside* the yellow rectangle along that specific axis with the orange color. If the trigger is horizontal relative to the rectangle (left/right), the fill is horizontal (row). If the trigger is vertical relative to the rectangle (above/below), the fill is vertical (column).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If the trigger pixel is positioned horizontally (e.g., its column index is less than the minimum column index or greater than the maximum column index of the yellow structure), the modification axis is the *row* corresponding to `trigger_row`. Iterate through all columns within the horizontal span of the yellow structure's interior.
