elements:
  - object: boundary
    attributes:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: typically a hollow rectangle, defines bounding box
      role: defines an area and acts as a barrier for color filling
  - object: bounding_box
    attributes:
      derived_from: boundary coordinates
      properties: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col (inclusive)
      role: defines spatial regions (inside, outside, span)
  - object: trigger_pixel
    attributes:
      color: orange (7)
      location: outside the bounding_box of the boundary
      role: initiates color filling along its row or column
  - object: target_pixel
    attributes:
      location: along the axis defined by a trigger_pixel
      initial_color: any color except yellow (4)
      role: potentially modified to orange (7)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: bounding_box
    details: The trigger pixel's position relative to the bounding box (within row span vs. within column span) determines the axis (row vs. column) of modification. Its position outside the box (above/below vs. left/right) determines the directionality of any extended filling.
actions:
  - name: identify_boundary_and_box
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of boundary pixels (yellow, 4), bounding box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid, bounding_box
    output: list of coordinates of trigger pixels (orange, 7) located outside the bounding_box
  - name: determine_modification_axis_and_range
    input: trigger_pixel_coordinate, bounding_box
    output: axis (row index or column index), range(s) of coordinates along the axis to potentially modify
  - name: modify_pixels
    input: input_grid, output_grid, modification_axis, modification_range(s), trigger_color, boundary_color
    output: modified_output_grid
    details: For each coordinate in the modification range(s), if the pixel in the *input_grid* at that coordinate is NOT the boundary_color, change the corresponding pixel in the *output_grid* to the trigger_color.
