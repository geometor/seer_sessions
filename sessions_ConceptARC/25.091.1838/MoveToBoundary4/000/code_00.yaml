task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_color: magenta (6)
      - dimensions: constant between input and output
transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    scope: row-wise
    target: magenta pixels
    action: horizontal shift to the left
    constraints:
      - preserve relative horizontal order within the row
      - preserve row index (vertical position)
      - preserve count of magenta pixels per row
  - effect: All magenta pixels in a row are consolidated at the leftmost columns of that row.
input_output_relationship:
  - Each row in the output is derived solely from the corresponding row in the input.
  - The number of magenta pixels in any given row of the output grid is equal to the number of magenta pixels in the corresponding row of the input grid.
