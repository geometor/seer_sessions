Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use white (0) as the background color and magenta (6) as the foreground or active color.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to operate on the magenta pixels within each row independently. The vertical position (row index) of magenta pixels does not change.
4.  **Core Action:** Magenta pixels within each row are shifted horizontally towards the left edge of the grid.
5.  **Rule Identification:** By comparing the input and output rows containing magenta pixels, it appears that all magenta pixels from a specific row in the input are collected and then placed at the beginning (leftmost columns) of the same row in the output. The relative horizontal order of these magenta pixels within the row is preserved. For example, if a row had magenta pixels at columns 2, 5, and 6, the output row would have magenta pixels at columns 0, 1, and 2.
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2`. Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_color: magenta (6)
      - dimensions: constant between input and output
transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    scope: row-wise
    target: magenta pixels
    action: horizontal shift to the left
    constraints:
      - preserve relative horizontal order within the row
      - preserve row index (vertical position)
      - preserve count of magenta pixels per row
  - effect: All magenta pixels in a row are consolidated at the leftmost columns of that row.
input_output_relationship:
  - Each row in the output is derived solely from the corresponding row in the input.
  - The number of magenta pixels in any given row of the output grid is equal to the number of magenta pixels in the corresponding row of the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Process the input grid row by row.
3.  For each row:
    a.  Initialize an empty list to store the magenta pixels found in this row.
    b.  Iterate through the columns of the current row in the input grid.
    c.  If a cell contains a magenta pixel (6), add it to the list of magenta pixels for this row.
    d.  Iterate through the collected list of magenta pixels for this row.
    e.  Place each magenta pixel from the list into the corresponding row of the output grid, starting at column 0 and incrementing the column index for each placed pixel.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
