The vertical position (row index) of magenta pixels does not change.\n4.  **Core Action:** Magenta pixels within each row are shifted horizontally towards the left edge of the grid.\n5.  **Rule Identification:** By comparing the input and output rows containing magenta pixels, it appears that all magenta pixels from a specific row in the input are collected and then placed at the beginning (leftmost columns) of the same row in the output. The relative horizontal order of these magenta pixels within the row is preserved. For example, if a row had magenta pixels at columns 2, 5, and 6, the output row would have magenta pixels at columns 0, 1, and 2.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2`. Rows that are entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
