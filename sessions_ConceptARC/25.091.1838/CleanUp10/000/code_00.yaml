task_context:
  grid_size_preservation: True
  colors_used:
    - red (2)
    - white (0)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: line
    subtype: horizontal
    color: red (2)
    property: complete_fill # spans the entire width of the grid
    location_train_1: row 2
    location_train_2: row 4
  - type: line
    subtype: vertical
    color: red (2)
    property: complete_fill # spans the entire height of the grid
    location_train_1: column 3
    location_train_2: column 4
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    property: scattered # not part of a complete horizontal or vertical line
    location_train_1: multiple locations excluding row 2 and column 3
    location_train_2: multiple locations excluding row 4 and column 4

actions:
  - identify: rows composed entirely of red pixels in the input.
  - identify: columns composed entirely of red pixels in the input.
  - create: a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white).
  - transfer: copy the identified complete red rows from the input to the corresponding rows in the output grid.
  - transfer: copy the identified complete red columns from the input to the corresponding columns in the output grid.
  - result: Pixels in the output grid are red (2) if their position corresponds to a pixel within a complete red row OR a complete red column in the input grid. Otherwise, pixels are white (0).

relationships:
  - superposition: The complete horizontal and vertical red lines identified in the input are superimposed onto the output grid.
  - filtering: Red pixels in the input that are *not* part of a complete row or column are filtered out (set to white) in the output.
