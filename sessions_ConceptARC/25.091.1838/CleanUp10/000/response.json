The grid size remains constant.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0). White appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Key Features:**\n    *   Both input grids contain scattered red pixels and at least one solid horizontal line composed entirely of red pixels.\n    *   Both input grids also contain at least one solid vertical line composed entirely of red pixels.\n    *   The output grids seem to retain *only* these solid red lines (both horizontal and vertical) from the input.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the input has a solid red horizontal line at row 2 and a solid red vertical line at column 3. The output consists *only* of these two lines superimposed. All other red pixels from the input are changed to white (0) in the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input has a solid red horizontal line at row 4 and a solid red vertical line at column 4. Again, the output consists *only* of these two lines superimposed. All other input red pixels are changed to white (0).\n5.  **Inference:** The transformation appears to identify all rows and columns in the input grid that are composed entirely of red (2) pixels. The output grid is constructed by drawing these identified full rows and full columns onto a white background. Pixels retain their red color only if they belong to at least one such complete line (either horizontal or vertical) in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
