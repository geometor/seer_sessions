```python
"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white (0) pixels in the input grid. 
Determine the object with the largest area (pixel count). Note the color of this largest object (the "target color").
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
Iterate through all identified non-white objects from the input grid. If an object's color matches the target color, 
copy all pixels belonging to that object (preserving their color, which is the target color) to the output grid. 
Discard all objects whose color does not match the target color by leaving their corresponding pixels as the background color in the output grid.
