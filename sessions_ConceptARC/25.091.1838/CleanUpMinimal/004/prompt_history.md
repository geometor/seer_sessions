Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids contain multiple colors. There appears to be one large, contiguous object of a primary color (red in example 1, green in example 2) and several scattered pixels of a secondary color (yellow in example 1, magenta in example 2), along with the background color (white).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids primarily consist of the large object from the input, possibly slightly modified, and the background color (white). The scattered secondary pixels from the input are either removed (turned white) or changed to the color of the main object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems centered around the largest contiguous non-white object in the input grid. This object is preserved in the output. The key difference lies in how the secondary colored pixels are handled. Those secondary pixels that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge, i.e., cardinally adjacent) to the main object are recolored to match the main object's color. All other secondary pixels (those not cardinally adjacent to the main object) are removed (replaced with the white background color). The original white background pixels remain white.
4.  **Object Identification:** The crucial first step is identifying all contiguous non-white objects and determining which one is the largest based on pixel count.
5.  **Adjacency:** Cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right) is the determining factor for whether a secondary pixel is preserved (and recolored) or removed. Diagonal adjacency does not seem sufficient.

**Facts**


```yaml
Initial_State:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - BackgroundColor: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Multiple contiguous blocks of non-background colors exist.
      - One object is significantly larger (in pixel count) than others; this is the 'MainObject'.
      - Other non-background pixels/objects exist, possibly scattered; these are 'SecondaryPixels'. SecondaryPixels have a different color than the MainObject.

Transformations:
  - Identification:
      - Identify all contiguous non-background objects.
      - Determine the 'MainObject' by selecting the one with the maximum pixel count. Record its color ('MainColor').
  - Filtering_and_Recoloring:
      - Create a new grid ('OutputGrid') of the same dimensions, initialized with BackgroundColor.
      - Copy the MainObject to the OutputGrid, preserving its MainColor.
      - Iterate through each SecondaryPixel in the InputGrid.
      - Check for Cardinal Adjacency: Determine if the SecondaryPixel shares an edge (up, down, left, or right) with any pixel belonging to the MainObject.
      - If a SecondaryPixel is cardinally adjacent to the MainObject:
          - Action: Set the corresponding pixel location in the OutputGrid to the MainColor.
      - If a SecondaryPixel is NOT cardinally adjacent to the MainObject:
          - Action: Ensure the corresponding pixel location in the OutputGrid remains BackgroundColor (effectively removing the pixel).
  - Finalization:
      - Pixels originally part of the MainObject retain their MainColor.
      - Pixels originally identified as SecondaryPixels are either recolored to MainColor (if cardinally adjacent) or become BackgroundColor (if not).
      - Pixels originally BackgroundColor remain BackgroundColor.

Final_State:
  - Grid: Output grid.
  - Content: Contains the MainObject, potentially expanded by including adjacent SecondaryPixels now recolored to MainColor. All other areas are BackgroundColor.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine the largest object by comparing the number of pixels in each identified object. Call this the "main object" and note its color ("main color").
3.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with the white background color (0).
4.  Copy all pixels belonging to the "main object" from the input grid to their corresponding locations in the output grid, keeping their "main color".
5.  Examine every non-white pixel in the input grid that is *not* part of the "main object".
6.  For each such pixel, check if it is cardinally adjacent (shares a side, not just a corner) to any pixel that *is* part of the "main object".
7.  If a non-main-object pixel *is* cardinally adjacent to the main object, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the "main color".
8.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid as the white background color. The final output grid represents the transformed result.
