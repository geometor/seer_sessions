            "text": "**Revised Analysis based on Metrics:**\n\nThe metrics calculation reveals an inconsistency with the pure bounding box rule in **Example 2**.\n\n*   **Mismatch 1:** Pixel at `(4, 7)` has input color Magenta (6). This location is *outside* the calculated bounding box `(rows 1-6, cols 1-6)`. According to the bounding box rule, it should become background (0) in the output. However, the actual output shows it becomes Green (3), the color of the largest object.\n*   **Mismatch 2:** Pixel at `(7, 4)` has input color Green (3). This location is *outside* the bounding box. According to the bounding box rule, it should become background (0). However, the actual output shows it remains Green (3).\n\nLooking back at the visual output for Example 2, the green shape is preserved, and the magenta pixels *touching* the green shape become green. This looks like the *very first hypothesis* might have been closer, but needs refinement.\n\nLet's reconsider:\n1.  Find the largest object (main object) and its color (main color).\n2.  Keep the main object as is in the output.\n3.  Identify all *other* non-background pixels (secondary pixels).\n4.  For each secondary pixel:\n    *   If it is cardinally adjacent (shares an edge) to *any* pixel belonging to the main object, change its color to the main color in the output.\n    *   Otherwise, change its color to background (0).\n5.  Keep all original background pixels as background.\n\nLet's re-verify this refined hypothesis against the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Main Object: Red (2) rectangle. Main Color: Red (2).\n    *   Secondary Pixels: Yellow (4) at (0,1), (3,6), (7,0), (8,5), (8,8).\n    *   Adjacency check:\n        *   Yellow (4) at (3,6) is adjacent to Red (2) at (3,5), (4,6), (2,6). -> Becomes Red (2).\n        *   Yellow (4) at (0,1) is not adjacent to any Red (2). -> Becomes White (0).\n        *   Yellow (4) at (7,0) is not adjacent to any Red (2). -> Becomes White (0).\n        *   Yellow (4) at (8,5) is not adjacent to any Red (2). -> Becomes White (0).\n        *   Yellow (4) at (8,8) is not adjacent to any Red (2). -> Becomes White (0).\n    *   Result: Matches expected output_1.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Main Object: Green (3) shape. Main Color: Green (3).\n    *   Secondary Pixels: All Magenta (6) pixels.\n    *   Adjacency check:\n        *   Magenta (6) at (3,4) is adjacent to Green (3) at (3,3), (4,4), (3,5). -> Becomes Green (3).\n        *   Magenta (6) at (4,5) is adjacent to Green (3) at (4,4), (5,5), (3,5), (4,6). -> Becomes Green (3).\n        *   Magenta (6) at (4,7) is adjacent to Green (3) at (4,6). -> Becomes Green (3). (This resolves mismatch 1 from the bounding box test!)\n        *   Magenta (6) at (6,4) is adjacent to Green (3) at (6,3), (5,4), (6,5). -> Becomes Green (3).\n        *   Other Magenta (6) pixels (at (0,0), (0,3), (0,8), (1,7), (5,0), (7,1), (7,6), (8,2)) are not adjacent to any Green (3). -> Become White (0).\n    *   What about the Green (3) pixel at (7,4) mentioned in mismatch 2? According to this rule, since it's *part of the main object's color group* (even if disconnected initially), it should be preserved. However, the `find_objects` function used identifies *contiguous* objects. The Green(3) at (7,4) is a separate object from the largest Green(3) object. Therefore, it *would* be treated as a secondary pixel. It is *not* adjacent to the main Green (3) object. -> Should become White (0).\n    *   Let's re-examine the output grid for Example 2. Pixel (7,4) *is* Green(3) in the output. This contradicts the adjacency rule for secondary pixels *if* we strictly define the \"main object\" as only the single largest contiguous block.\n\n**Final Refinement:**\n\nIt seems the rule is:\n1.  Identify all contiguous non-background objects.\n2.  Find the object with the maximum size. Note its color (target color).\n3.  Create an output grid initialized to background (0).\n4.  Iterate through *all* identified non-background objects from the input.\n5.  If an object's color *matches* the target color, copy all its pixels to the output grid.\n6.  If an object's color *does not* match the target color, check if *any* pixel in this object is cardinally adjacent to *any* pixel belonging to *any* object *with the target color*.\n7.  If such adjacency exists, color *all* pixels of this non-target-color object with the *target color* in the output grid.\n8.  If no such adjacency exists, leave the pixels corresponding to this non-target-color object as background (0) in the output grid.\n\nLet's test this latest hypothesis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Target Color: Red (2).\n    *   Red (2) object is copied to output.\n    *   Yellow (4) object at (3,6): Adjacent to Red (2) object. -> All its pixels (just one) become Red (2).\n    *   Other Yellow (4) objects (at (0,1), (7,0), (8,5), (8,8)): Not adjacent to any Red (2) object. -> Become White (0).\n    *   Result: Matches output_1.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Target Color: Green (3).\n    *   All Green (3) objects (including the large one and the single pixel at (7,4)) are copied to the output.\n    *   Magenta (6) object at (3,4): Adjacent to the large Green (3) object. -> Becomes Green (3).\n    *   Magenta (6) object at (4,5): Adjacent to the large Green (3) object. -> Becomes Green (3).\n    *   Magenta (6) object at (4,7): Adjacent to the large Green (3) object. -> Becomes Green (3).\n    *   Magenta (6) object at (6,4): Adjacent to the large Green (3) object. -> Becomes Green (3).\n    *   Other Magenta (6) objects: Not adjacent to *any* Green (3) object. -> Become White (0).\n    *   Result: Matches output_2. This rule seems correct.\n\n"
