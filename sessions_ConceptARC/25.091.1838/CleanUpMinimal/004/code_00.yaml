Facts:
  - BackgroundColor: white (0).
  - InputGrid: Contains multiple contiguous objects of different non-background colors.
  - ObjectIdentification:
      - Action: Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-background colors.
      - Properties: Record each object's coordinates (set of (row, col)), color, and size (pixel count).
  - TargetObjectDetermination:
      - Action: Find the object with the maximum size among all identified objects.
      - TieBreaking: (Assumed based on examples) If multiple objects share the maximum size, the choice doesn't affect the outcome because the rule depends only on the *color* associated with the maximum size.
      - Properties: Record the color of the largest object ('TargetColor').
  - OutputGridInitialization:
      - Action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
      - InitialState: Fill the output grid entirely with the BackgroundColor.
  - TransformationRuleApplication:
      - Action: Iterate through *each* non-background object identified in the input grid.
      - Condition 1: If the object's color matches the 'TargetColor'.
          - Action: Copy all pixels of this object (using the 'TargetColor') to their corresponding locations in the output grid.
      - Condition 2: If the object's color *does not* match the 'TargetColor'.
          - Action: Check for cardinal adjacency. Determine if *any* pixel within this object shares an edge (up, down, left, right) with *any* pixel belonging to *any* object whose color *is* the 'TargetColor'.
          - If Adjacency Exists:
              - Action: Color *all* pixels corresponding to this non-target-color object with the 'TargetColor' in the output grid.
          - If Adjacency Does Not Exist:
              - Action: Leave the pixels corresponding to this object as BackgroundColor in the output grid (effectively removing the object).
  - FinalState: The output grid contains objects colored with the 'TargetColor' (either original or transformed) and BackgroundColor elsewhere.
