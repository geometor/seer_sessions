            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Both input grids contain multiple colors. There appears to be one large, contiguous object of a primary color (red in example 1, green in example 2) and several scattered pixels of a secondary color (yellow in example 1, magenta in example 2), along with the background color (white).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids primarily consist of the large object from the input, possibly slightly modified, and the background color (white). The scattered secondary pixels from the input are either removed (turned white) or changed to the color of the main object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems centered around the largest contiguous non-white object in the input grid. This object is preserved in the output. The key difference lies in how the secondary colored pixels are handled. Those secondary pixels that are directly adjacent (sharing an edge, i.e., cardinally adjacent) to the main object are recolored to match the main object's color. All other secondary pixels (those not cardinally adjacent to the main object) are removed (replaced with the white background color). The original white background pixels remain white.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The crucial first step is identifying all contiguous non-white objects and determining which one is the largest based on pixel count.\n5.  **Adjacency:** Cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right) is the determining factor for whether a secondary pixel is preserved (and recolored) or removed. Diagonal adjacency does not seem sufficient.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
