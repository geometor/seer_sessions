Initial_State:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - BackgroundColor: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Multiple contiguous blocks of non-background colors exist.
      - One object is significantly larger (in pixel count) than others; this is the 'MainObject'.
      - Other non-background pixels/objects exist, possibly scattered; these are 'SecondaryPixels'. SecondaryPixels have a different color than the MainObject.

Transformations:
  - Identification:
      - Identify all contiguous non-background objects.
      - Determine the 'MainObject' by selecting the one with the maximum pixel count. Record its color ('MainColor').
  - Filtering_and_Recoloring:
      - Create a new grid ('OutputGrid') of the same dimensions, initialized with BackgroundColor.
      - Copy the MainObject to the OutputGrid, preserving its MainColor.
      - Iterate through each SecondaryPixel in the InputGrid.
      - Check for Cardinal Adjacency: Determine if the SecondaryPixel shares an edge (up, down, left, or right) with any pixel belonging to the MainObject.
      - If a SecondaryPixel is cardinally adjacent to the MainObject:
          - Action: Set the corresponding pixel location in the OutputGrid to the MainColor.
      - If a SecondaryPixel is NOT cardinally adjacent to the MainObject:
          - Action: Ensure the corresponding pixel location in the OutputGrid remains BackgroundColor (effectively removing the pixel).
  - Finalization:
      - Pixels originally part of the MainObject retain their MainColor.
      - Pixels originally identified as SecondaryPixels are either recolored to MainColor (if cardinally adjacent) or become BackgroundColor (if not).
      - Pixels originally BackgroundColor remain BackgroundColor.

Final_State:
  - Grid: Output grid.
  - Content: Contains the MainObject, potentially expanded by including adjacent SecondaryPixels now recolored to MainColor. All other areas are BackgroundColor.
