"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine the largest object by pixel count (the "main object") and note its color ("main color"). Create an output grid initialized with the white background color (0). Copy the main object to the output grid using its main color. Iterate through all other non-white pixels in the input grid ("secondary pixels"). If a secondary pixel is cardinally adjacent (shares an edge) to any pixel of the main object, color the corresponding pixel in the output grid with the main color. Leave all other output grid pixels as white.
