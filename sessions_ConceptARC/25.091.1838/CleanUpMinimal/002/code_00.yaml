Initial_State:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - BackgroundColor: white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Multiple contiguous blocks (Objects) of non-background colors exist.
      - Objects have properties: color, size (pixel count), coordinates.

Identification:
  - Process: Identify all distinct contiguous Objects of non-background colors.
  - MainObjectDetermination: Find the Object with the maximum size.
  - MainColor: Record the color of this largest Object.

Filtering_Rule:
  - Criterion: An Object is kept if its color matches the MainColor.
  - Action_Keep: If an Object's color matches the MainColor, all its pixels are retained in the output grid with their original color.
  - Action_Discard: If an Object's color does not match the MainColor, all its pixels are replaced by the BackgroundColor in the output grid.

Transformations:
  - Create OutputGrid: Initialize a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with BackgroundColor.
  - Apply Filtering: Iterate through all identified Objects from the input grid.
  - Copy_Matching_Objects: For each Object whose color matches the MainColor, copy its pixels (coordinates and color) to the corresponding locations in the OutputGrid.

Final_State:
  - Grid: Output grid.
  - Content: Contains only the pixels belonging to Objects from the input grid whose color matched the MainColor. All other pixels are set to BackgroundColor.
