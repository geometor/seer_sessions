            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. The comparison revealed that the initial hypothesis about incorporating adjacent secondary pixels was incorrect based on Example 1's output. A subsequent hypothesis, keeping only the single largest object, explained Example 1 but failed to reproduce Example 2's output, specifically missing a pixel ((7,4) which was green) that was present in the expected output but not part of the largest contiguous green object.\n\nThe failure in Example 2 suggests the core identifying feature isn't the *largest single object* itself, but rather the *color* associated with that largest object. The correct rule appears to be: identify the color of the largest contiguous non-background object, and then keep *all* objects (contiguous groups of pixels) of that specific color, discarding objects of any other color.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the object identification and sizing for both examples using code execution.\n2.  Confirm that in Example 2, the pixel at (7,4) is indeed green but isolated from the main green mass.\n3.  Update the facts and natural language program to reflect the rule: \"Filter by the color of the largest object\".\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
