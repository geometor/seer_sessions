task_description: Modify the input grid by adding a single line of azure (8) color along one edge. The edge and orientation of the line depend on the orientation of the shapes present in the input grid.

definitions:
  background_color: white (0)
  object: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same non-background color. Adjacent pixels are defined by sharing an edge (4-connectivity).
  object_bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  object_height (h): The height of the object's bounding box.
  object_width (w): The width of the object's bounding box.
  horizontal_object: An object where width > height.
  vertical_object: An object where height > width.
  square_object: An object where height == width.
  added_line_color: azure (8)

examples:
  train_1:
    input:
      grid_size: [10, 10]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: yellow (4), location: rows=[4], cols=[3, 4, 5], bounding_box: [h=1, w=3], orientation: horizontal
        - color: red (2), location: rows=[5], cols=[3, 4, 5], bounding_box: [h=1, w=3], orientation: horizontal
        - color: green (3), location: rows=[6], cols=[3, 4, 5], bounding_box: [h=1, w=3], orientation: horizontal
      presence: Contains horizontal objects? Yes. Contains vertical objects? No.
    output:
      base_grid: same as input
      added_feature: Vertical line, color=azure (8), location=rightmost column (cols=[9]).
      reasoning: Only horizontal objects were present.

  train_2:
    input:
      grid_size: [10, 10]
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - color: orange (7), location: rows=[3-6], cols=[2], bounding_box: [h=4, w=1], orientation: vertical
        - color: azure (8), location: rows=[3-6], cols=[3], bounding_box: [h=4, w=1], orientation: vertical
        - color: maroon (9), location: rows=[3-6], cols=[4], bounding_box: [h=4, w=1], orientation: vertical
        - color: blue (1), location: rows=[3-6], cols=[5], bounding_box: [h=4, w=1], orientation: vertical
      presence: Contains horizontal objects? No. Contains vertical objects? Yes.
    output:
      base_grid: same as input
      added_feature: Horizontal line, color=azure (8), location=topmost row (rows=[0]).
      reasoning: Only vertical objects were present (falls under the 'otherwise' condition).

derived_rules:
  - rule: Identify all distinct objects (contiguous same-colored non-background pixels) in the input grid.
  - rule: Determine the bounding box dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) for each object.
  - rule: Check if at least one object has `w > h` (presence of horizontal objects).
  - rule: Check if at least one object has `h > w` (presence of vertical objects).
  - rule: If horizontal objects are present AND vertical objects are NOT present, then add a vertical line of azure (8) to the rightmost column of the grid.
  - rule: Otherwise (if only vertical objects are present, if both horizontal and vertical objects are present, if only square objects are present, or if no objects are present), add a horizontal line of azure (8) to the topmost row of the grid.
