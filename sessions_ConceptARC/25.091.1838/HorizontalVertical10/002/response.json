The code generated the top horizontal azure line for `train_1`, whereas the expected output has a right vertical azure line.\n\nThe core logic involved identifying non-background objects and checking their dimensions (height `h`, width `w`). The transformation rule was intended to be: if all objects are strictly wider than tall (`w > h`), add a right vertical line; otherwise, add a top horizontal line.\n\nAnalysis of `train_1` shows three distinct horizontal line objects (yellow, red, green), each with dimensions h=1, w=3. Since `w > h` for all objects, the condition \"all objects are strictly wider than tall\" should have been met, triggering the addition of the right vertical line. The fact that the top horizontal line was added instead suggests either a flaw in the implementation of the conditional logic or an issue with how objects/dimensions were identified in the failed execution.\n\nAnalysis of `train_2` shows four distinct vertical line objects (orange, azure, maroon, blue), each with h=4, w=1. Since `w <= h` for these objects, the condition \"all objects are strictly wider than tall\" is *not* met. Therefore, the code correctly fell into the \"otherwise\" case and added the top horizontal line.\n\nThe revised strategy will refine the logic based on the *presence* of specific orientations rather than a universal condition (\"all objects must be...\").\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Identify distinct objects based on contiguous pixels of the *same* non-background color (aligning with ARC priors).\n2.  For each object, determine its bounding box height (`h`) and width (`w`).\n3.  Check if *any* object exists where `w > h` (a horizontal object is present).\n4.  Check if *any* object exists where `h > w` (a vertical object is present).\n5.  Apply the transformation:\n    *   If horizontal objects are present AND vertical objects are *not* present, add a vertical azure line to the rightmost column.\n    *   In all other cases (only vertical objects present, both vertical and horizontal objects present, only square objects present, or mixtures including squares), add a horizontal azure line to the topmost row.\n6.  Update the documentation (facts, natural language program) to reflect this refined logic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered using the helper functions `find_objects_same_color` (finds contiguous objects of the same color) and `get_bounding_box`.\n<ctrl97>tool_code\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\n\n# Helper functions\ndef find_objects_same_color(grid: np.ndarray, background_color: int = 0) -> List[Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            pixel_color = grid[r, c]\n            if pixel_color != background_color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                obj_coords = set()\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)\n                    obj_coords.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        # Check bounds AND same color AND not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == pixel_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                            visited.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                if obj_coords:\n                    objects.append(obj_coords)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(coords: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    if not coords: return 0, 0\n    min_r = min(r for r, c in coords)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in coords)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in coords)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in coords)\n    height = max_r - min_r + 1\n    width = max_c - min_c + 1\n    return height, width\n\n# Example inputs\ntrain_1_input = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\ntrain_2_input = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# Analyze train_1\nobjects_1 = find_objects_same_color(train_1_input)\ndims_1 = [get_bounding_box(obj) for obj in objects_1]\nhas_vertical_1 = any(h > w for h, w in dims_1)\nhas_horizontal_1 = any(w > h for h, w in dims_1)\n\n# Analyze train_2\nobjects_2 = find_objects_same_color(train_2_input)\ndims_2 = [get_bounding_box(obj) for obj in objects_2]\nhas_vertical_2 = any(h > w for h, w in dims_2)\nhas_horizontal_2 = any(w > h for h, w in dims_2)\n\nprint(f\"Train 1 Objects: {len(objects_1)}, Dimensions (H, W): {dims_1}\")\nprint(f\"Train 1 Presence: Vertical? {has_vertical_1}, Horizontal? {has_horizontal_1}\")\nprint(f\"Train 2 Objects: {len(objects_2)}, Dimensions (H, W): {dims_2}\")\nprint(f\"Train 2 Presence: Vertical? {has_vertical_2}, Horizontal? {has_horizontal_2}\")"
