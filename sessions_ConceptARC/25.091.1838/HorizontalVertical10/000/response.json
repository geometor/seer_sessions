            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n*   **`train_1` Example:**\n    *   The input grid contains three horizontal lines (yellow, red, green), each 3 pixels wide, stacked vertically near the center. The background is white.\n    *   The output grid is identical to the input, but with the addition of a solid azure vertical line filling the entire rightmost column.\n    *   The primary input shapes are horizontal. The added feature is a vertical line on the right border. The color added (azure/8) is not present in the input colors (yellow/4, red/2, green/3).\n\n*   **`train_2` Example:**\n    *   The input grid contains a 4x4 block of colors (orange, azure, maroon, blue columns) roughly centered. The background is white.\n    *   The output grid is identical to the input, but with the addition of a solid azure horizontal line filling the entire topmost row.\n    *   The primary input shapes can be seen as vertical lines of distinct colors adjacent to each other. The added feature is a horizontal line on the top border. The color added (azure/8) *is* present in the input colors.\n\n*   **Comparison & Pattern:**\n    *   Both examples involve adding a single, solid-colored line to one of the grid's borders.\n    *   The orientation of the added line seems opposite to the orientation of the primary shapes in the input (horizontal input shapes -> vertical output line; vertical input shapes -> horizontal output line).\n    *   The position of the added line seems consistent based on the orientation: vertical lines are added to the rightmost column, and horizontal lines are added to the topmost row.\n    *   The color of the added line is azure (8) in both cases. In `train_2`, azure is present in the input; in `train_1`, it is not. This suggests the added color might be consistently azure (8), regardless of input colors, but determined by the input shape orientation rule.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
