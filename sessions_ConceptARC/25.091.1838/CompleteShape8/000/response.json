The output grids also contain colored objects on a white background, but the objects have changed.\n\nObserving the transformation:\n1.  The gray objects (color 5) present in the input are completely removed in the output; they don't seem to influence the final result.\n2.  The other colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange) seem to expand.\n3.  The expansion isn't arbitrary; it appears to fill the rectangular bounding box encompassing all pixels of that specific color in the input grid.\n4.  For each color (excluding white and gray), all pixels of that color in the input are considered together to define a single bounding box. This bounding box is then filled solid with that color in the output.\n5.  The final output grid is constructed by layering these filled bounding boxes onto a white background. The examples don't show overlapping bounding boxes, but if they did, the order might matter (though it's unlikely given the task structure).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
