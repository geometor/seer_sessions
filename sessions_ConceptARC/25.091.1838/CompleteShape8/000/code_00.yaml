task_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: canvas
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: various (non-white, non-gray, e.g., yellow(4), magenta(6), orange(7))
      - shape: arbitrary, potentially scattered clusters of pixels
    role: source_shape
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: arbitrary
    role: noise / ignored_element

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct groups of pixels based on color, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: set of pixel coordinates for a single color (excluding white/gray)
    output: minimum and maximum row and column indices (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
    description: Determine the smallest rectangle enclosing all input pixels of a specific color.
  - action: fill_rectangle
    input: bounding box coordinates, color
    output: modified grid
    description: Fill the specified rectangular area in the output grid with the given color.
  - action: filter_remove
    input: object
    condition: color is gray (5)
    description: Gray objects are removed or ignored in the transformation process.

relationships:
  - relation: source_to_output_shape
    description: For each non-white, non-gray color present in the input, its corresponding shape in the output is a solid rectangle defined by the bounding box of all input pixels of that color.
  - relation: grid_initialization
    description: The output grid starts as a white grid of the same dimensions as the input.

flow:
  - step: Initialize an empty (white) output grid matching input dimensions.
  - step: Identify all unique colors in the input, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
  - step: For each identified unique color:
      - Find all pixels of this color in the input.
      - Calculate their bounding box.
      - Fill this bounding box area in the output grid with this color.
  - step: The final output grid is the result of these filling operations.

constraints:
  - Gray objects are ignored.
  - White is the background color.
