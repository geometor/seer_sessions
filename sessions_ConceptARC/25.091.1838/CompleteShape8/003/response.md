Transform the input grid according to the following rule:
1. Create a new output grid having the same height and width as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2. Identify all distinct colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
3. For each of these identified colors:
    a. Find the locations (row and column coordinates) of all pixels in the *input* grid that match this color.
    b. If one or more pixels of this color exist, determine the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index among these locations. These four values define the overall bounding box for this color based on the input.
    c. In the *output* grid, change the color of all pixels within this calculated bounding box (inclusive of the minimum and maximum rows and columns) to the current color being processed.
4. After processing all identified non-white, non-gray colors in this manner, return the final output grid.
Note: Gray pixels (color 5) in the input are ignored.
