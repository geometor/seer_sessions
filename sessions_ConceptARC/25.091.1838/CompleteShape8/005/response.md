"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2. Find all unique pixel colors present in the input grid, other than white (0) and gray (5).
3. For each of these unique colors (let's call it `C`):
    a. Locate all pixels `(r, c)` in the input grid that have color `C`. Let `S` be the set of these coordinates.
    b. If `S` is empty, skip to the next color.
    c. Check if the set `S` contains exactly two coordinates, `P1=(r1, c1)` and `P2=(r2, c2)`, such that the absolute difference between their row indices is 1 (`abs(r1 - r2) == 1`) AND the absolute difference between their column indices is 1 (`abs(c1 - c2) == 1`). This signifies a 2x2 diagonal arrangement.
    d. **If the 2x2 diagonal condition is TRUE:**
        i. Find the minimum row `R = min(r1, r2)` and minimum column `C = min(c1, c2)`.
        ii. In the output grid, attempt to set the color of the following six pixels relative to `(R, C)` to `C`, ensuring the coordinates are within the grid bounds:
            *   `(R, C)`
            *   `(R, C + 2)`
            *   `(R + 1, C + 1)`
            *   `(R + 2, C)`
            *   `(R + 2, C + 1)`
            *   `(R + 2, C + 2)`
    e. **If the 2x2 diagonal condition is FALSE:**
        i. Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) occupied by the pixels in set `S`. This defines the bounding box.
        ii. In the output grid, fill the rectangular area defined by this bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r` inclusive, and `min_c` to `max_c` inclusive) with color `C`.
4. Return the modified output grid.
