Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

The input grids contain several small, distinct objects composed of colored pixels (yellow, gray, magenta in the first example; orange, gray, magenta in the second) scattered on a white background. The output grids also contain colored objects on a white background, but the objects have changed.

Observing the transformation:
1.  The gray objects (color 5) present in the input are completely removed in the output; they don't seem to influence the final result.
2.  The other colored objects (yellow, magenta, orange) seem to expand.
3.  The expansion isn't arbitrary; it appears to fill the rectangular bounding box encompassing all pixels of that specific color in the input grid.
4.  For each color (excluding white and gray), all pixels of that color in the input are considered together to define a single bounding box. This bounding box is then filled solid with that color in the output.
5.  The final output grid is constructed by layering these filled bounding boxes onto a white background. The examples don't show overlapping bounding boxes, but if they did, the order might matter (though it's unlikely given the task structure).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: canvas
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: various (non-white, non-gray, e.g., yellow(4), magenta(6), orange(7))
      - shape: arbitrary, potentially scattered clusters of pixels
    role: source_shape
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: arbitrary
    role: noise / ignored_element

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct groups of pixels based on color, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: set of pixel coordinates for a single color (excluding white/gray)
    output: minimum and maximum row and column indices (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)
    description: Determine the smallest rectangle enclosing all input pixels of a specific color.
  - action: fill_rectangle
    input: bounding box coordinates, color
    output: modified grid
    description: Fill the specified rectangular area in the output grid with the given color.
  - action: filter_remove
    input: object
    condition: color is gray (5)
    description: Gray objects are removed or ignored in the transformation process.

relationships:
  - relation: source_to_output_shape
    description: For each non-white, non-gray color present in the input, its corresponding shape in the output is a solid rectangle defined by the bounding box of all input pixels of that color.
  - relation: grid_initialization
    description: The output grid starts as a white grid of the same dimensions as the input.

flow:
  - step: Initialize an empty (white) output grid matching input dimensions.
  - step: Identify all unique colors in the input, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
  - step: For each identified unique color:
      - Find all pixels of this color in the input.
      - Calculate their bounding box.
      - Fill this bounding box area in the output grid with this color.
  - step: The final output grid is the result of these filling operations.

constraints:
  - Gray objects are ignored.
  - White is the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find all unique pixel colors present in the input grid, other than white (0) and gray (5).
3.  For each of these unique colors:
    a.  Locate all pixels in the input grid that have this color.
    b.  Determine the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column occupied by these pixels. This defines the bounding box for this color.
    c.  In the new grid created in step 1, fill the rectangular area defined by this bounding box (from the minimum row/column to the maximum row/column, inclusive) with this color.
4.  Return the modified new grid as the output.
