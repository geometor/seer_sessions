Locate the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid; note its row (`row_in`) and column (`col_in`). Let the grid width be `grid_width`.\n3.  Count the number of yellow pixels (4) in the first row (row 0) of the input grid (`count_row0`).\n4.  Count the number of yellow pixels (4) in the first column (column 0) of the input grid (`count_col0`).\n5.  Determine the movement direction based on the counts:\n    *   If `count_row0 > 1` (indicating a dominant horizontal line), the direction is East.\n    *   Else if `count_col0 > 0` (indicating a vertical line or potentially a single yellow pixel at `(0,0)` if `count_row0 <= 1`), the direction is North.\n    *   Otherwise, if no yellow pixels are found in row 0 or column 0 (unlikely based on examples), the direction is considered undefined, and the blue pixel might not move (or default behaviour could be defined, but current logic implies North if col 0 has any yellow).\n6.  Calculate the final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) for the blue pixel in the output grid based on the determined direction:\n    *   If the direction is North, the final position is (`0`, `col_in`).\n    *   If the direction is East, the final position is (`row_in`, `grid_width - 1`).\n7.  Place a blue pixel (1) at the calculated final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) in the output grid.\n8.
