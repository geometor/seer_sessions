elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      height: 6
      width: 6
  - object: pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    role: background
  - object: pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    role: marker
    count: 1
    location_input: variable
    location_output: calculated
  - object: structure
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    role: direction_indicator
    shape: line (vertical or horizontal)
    location: adjacent to grid edge (top row or left column)

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: yellow_structure
    object: blue_pixel_movement_direction
    details:
      - if yellow_structure is vertical (in column 0): blue pixel moves North (up)
      - if yellow_structure is horizontal (in row 0): blue pixel moves East (right)
  - type: constraint
    subject: grid_boundary
    object: blue_pixel_movement
    details: Movement stops when the pixel reaches the corresponding edge (row 0 for North, column 5 for East).

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: blue_pixel
    attribute: location_input (row_in, col_in)
  - action: identify
    target: yellow_structure
    attribute: orientation (vertical or horizontal)
  - action: determine
    target: movement_direction
    based_on: yellow_structure_orientation
  - action: calculate
    target: blue_pixel_location_output (row_out, col_out)
    based_on:
      - blue_pixel_location_input
      - movement_direction
      - grid_boundaries
    logic:
      - if direction is North: row_out = 0, col_out = col_in
      - if direction is East: row_out = row_in, col_out = grid_width - 1
  - action: generate
    target: output_grid
    attributes:
      size: same as input grid
      background: white
    content: place blue pixel at location_output
