The output uses only white (0) and blue (1).\n3.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid contains:\n    *   A background of white pixels.\n    *   A single blue pixel.\n    *   A structure (line) made of yellow pixels, located either along the top row or the leftmost column.\n4.  **Output Composition:** Each output grid contains:\n    *   A background of white pixels.\n    *   A single blue pixel.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the single blue pixel from its input position to a new position in the output grid. The yellow structure seems to dictate the direction of this movement.\n6.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   If the yellow structure is a vertical line (in the first column), the blue pixel moves vertically upwards (North) within its original column until it reaches the top edge (row 0).\n    *   If the yellow structure is a horizontal line (in the first row), the blue pixel moves horizontally rightwards (East) within its original row until it reaches the right edge (column 5).\n7.  **Output Grid Generation:** The output grid is essentially an empty (all white) grid of the same size as the input, with the blue pixel placed at its calculated final destination. The original blue pixel location and the yellow structure are replaced by white pixels.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
