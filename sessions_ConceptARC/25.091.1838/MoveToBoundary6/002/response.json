            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components (blue pixel, yellow line, background) and the general idea of movement based on the yellow line's orientation. However, the execution results reveal a flaw in determining the orientation, specifically in Example 3. The code incorrectly identified a horizontal line as vertical because a yellow pixel existed at `(0, 0)`, which satisfied the check for the first column (`grid[:, 0]`).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the logic for determining the yellow line's orientation. Instead of simply checking for *any* yellow pixel in the first row or column, we need a more precise way to distinguish between a primarily vertical line in the first column and a primarily horizontal line in the first row.\n\n**Refined Orientation Logic:**\n*   A **vertical** line exists if there are yellow pixels in the first column (`grid[:, 0]`) AND there are *no* yellow pixels in the rest of the first row (`grid[0, 1:]`).\n*   A **horizontal** line exists if there are yellow pixels in the first row (`grid[0, :]`) AND there are *no* yellow pixels in the rest of the first column (`grid[1:, 0]`).\n\nThis disambiguates the case where `grid[0, 0]` is yellow.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the yellow pixel locations in each example to confirm the refined logic.\n\n"
