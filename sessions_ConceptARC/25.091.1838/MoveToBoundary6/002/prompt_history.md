## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 6x6.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The input uses white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4). The output uses only white (0) and blue (1).
3.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels.
    *   A single blue pixel.
    *   A structure (line) made of yellow pixels, located either along the top row or the leftmost column.
4.  **Output Composition:** Each output grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels.
    *   A single blue pixel.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the single blue pixel from its input position to a new position in the output grid. The yellow structure seems to dictate the direction of this movement.
6.  **Movement Rule:**
    *   If the yellow structure is a vertical line (in the first column), the blue pixel moves vertically upwards (North) within its original column until it reaches the top edge (row 0).
    *   If the yellow structure is a horizontal line (in the first row), the blue pixel moves horizontally rightwards (East) within its original row until it reaches the right edge (column 5).
7.  **Output Grid Generation:** The output grid is essentially an empty (all white) grid of the same size as the input, with the blue pixel placed at its calculated final destination. The original blue pixel location and the yellow structure are replaced by white pixels.

    location: adjacent to grid edge (top row or left column)

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: yellow_structure
    object: blue_pixel_movement_direction
    details:
      - if yellow_structure is vertical (in column 0): blue pixel moves North (up)
      - if yellow_structure is horizontal (in row 0): blue pixel moves East (right)
  - type: constraint
    subject: grid_boundary
    object: blue_pixel_movement
    details: Movement stops when the pixel reaches the corresponding edge (row 0 for North, column 5 for East).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 6x6 grid filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid; note its row (`row_in`) and column (`col_in`).
3.  Examine the yellow pixels (4) in the input grid to determine the orientation of the yellow structure:
    *   If the yellow pixels form a vertical line (primarily in column 0), the movement direction is North.
    *   If the yellow pixels form a horizontal line (primarily in row 0), the movement direction is East.
4.  Calculate the final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) for the blue pixel in the output grid based on the determined direction:
    *   If the direction is North, the final position is (`0`, `col_in`).
    *   If the direction is East, the final position is (`row_in`, `5`).
5.  Place a blue pixel (1) at the calculated final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid; note its row (`row_in`) and column (`col_in`).
3.  Examine the input grid to determine if there is a vertical yellow line (4) in the first column or a horizontal yellow line (4) in the first row.
4.  Calculate the final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) for the blue pixel in the output grid:
    *   If a vertical yellow line exists in the first column, the final position is (`0`, `col_in`).
    *   If a horizontal yellow line exists in the first row, the final position is (`row_in`, `grid_width - 1`).
5.  Place a blue pixel (1) at the calculated final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
