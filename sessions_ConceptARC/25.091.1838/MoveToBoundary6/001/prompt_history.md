## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 6x6.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The input uses white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4). The output uses only white (0) and blue (1).
3.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels.
    *   A single blue pixel.
    *   A structure (line) made of yellow pixels, located either along the top row or the leftmost column.
4.  **Output Composition:** Each output grid contains:
    *   A background of white pixels.
    *   A single blue pixel.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the single blue pixel from its input position to a new position in the output grid. The yellow structure seems to dictate the direction of this movement.
6.  **Movement Rule:**
    *   If the yellow structure is a vertical line (in the first column), the blue pixel moves vertically upwards (North) within its original column until it reaches the top edge (row 0).
    *   If the yellow structure is a horizontal line (in the first row), the blue pixel moves horizontally rightwards (East) within its original row until it reaches the right edge (column 5).
7.  **Output Grid Generation:** The output grid is essentially an empty (all white) grid of the same size as the input, with the blue pixel placed at its calculated final destination. The original blue pixel location and the yellow structure are replaced by white pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      height: 6
      width: 6
  - object: pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    role: background
  - object: pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    role: marker
    count: 1
    location_input: variable
    location_output: calculated
  - object: structure
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    role: direction_indicator
    shape: line (vertical or horizontal)
    location: adjacent to grid edge (top row or left column)

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: yellow_structure
    object: blue_pixel_movement_direction
    details:
      - if yellow_structure is vertical (in column 0): blue pixel moves North (up)
      - if yellow_structure is horizontal (in row 0): blue pixel moves East (right)
  - type: constraint
    subject: grid_boundary
    object: blue_pixel_movement
    details: Movement stops when the pixel reaches the corresponding edge (row 0 for North, column 5 for East).

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: blue_pixel
    attribute: location_input (row_in, col_in)
  - action: identify
    target: yellow_structure
    attribute: orientation (vertical or horizontal)
  - action: determine
    target: movement_direction
    based_on: yellow_structure_orientation
  - action: calculate
    target: blue_pixel_location_output (row_out, col_out)
    based_on:
      - blue_pixel_location_input
      - movement_direction
      - grid_boundaries
    logic:
      - if direction is North: row_out = 0, col_out = col_in
      - if direction is East: row_out = row_in, col_out = grid_width - 1
  - action: generate
    target: output_grid
    attributes:
      size: same as input grid
      background: white
    content: place blue pixel at location_output
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 6x6 grid filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid; note its row (`row_in`) and column (`col_in`).
3.  Examine the yellow pixels (4) in the input grid to determine the orientation of the yellow structure:
    *   If the yellow pixels form a vertical line (primarily in column 0), the movement direction is North.
    *   If the yellow pixels form a horizontal line (primarily in row 0), the movement direction is East.
4.  Calculate the final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) for the blue pixel in the output grid based on the determined direction:
    *   If the direction is North, the final position is (`0`, `col_in`).
    *   If the direction is East, the final position is (`row_in`, `5`).
5.  Place a blue pixel (1) at the calculated final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
