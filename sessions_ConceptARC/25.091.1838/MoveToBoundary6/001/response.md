Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Locate the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid; note its row (`row_in`) and column (`col_in`).
3.  Examine the input grid to determine if there is a vertical yellow line (4) in the first column or a horizontal yellow line (4) in the first row.
4.  Calculate the final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) for the blue pixel in the output grid:
    *   If a vertical yellow line exists in the first column, the final position is (`0`, `col_in`).
    *   If a horizontal yellow line exists in the first row, the final position is (`row_in`, `grid_width - 1`).
5.  Place a blue pixel (1) at the calculated final position (`row_out`, `col_out`) in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
