- task_description: Fill the center of enclosed white regions within colored shapes.
- elements:
    - background:
        - color: white (0)
        - role: Canvas for shapes.
    - shapes:
        - role: Primary objects defining enclosed regions.
        - properties:
            - composed_of: Single non-white color (e.g., green (3), yellow (4)).
            - contiguity: Pixels of the shape are connected.
            - can_enclose: Shapes can surround regions of the background color.
    - enclosed_regions:
        - role: Target areas for modification.
        - properties:
            - composed_of: white (0) pixels.
            - contiguity: Pixels form a connected region.
            - relationship: Fully surrounded orthogonally by pixels of a single shape object.
            - center: Has a geometric center pixel (or pixels).
- actions:
    - identify_shapes: Locate contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    - identify_enclosed_regions: Find contiguous regions of white pixels completely surrounded by pixels of a single identified shape.
    - calculate_center: Determine the geometric center coordinates of each enclosed white region.
    - fill_center: Change the color of the pixel(s) at the calculated center(s) from white to the color of the surrounding shape.
- relationships:
    - enclosure: A shape encloses a white region if all orthogonal neighbors of the white region's boundary pixels belong to that single shape.
    - center_of: A specific pixel location corresponds to the geometric center of an enclosed white region.
- transformation:
    - input: Grid with shapes potentially containing enclosed white areas.
    - output: Grid where the center pixel(s) of identified enclosed white areas are filled with the color of the enclosing shape.
