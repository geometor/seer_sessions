The modification specifically targets hollow areas or indentations within these shapes. By observing the input-output pairs:\n\n1.  **train_1:** A green hollow square has its central empty pixel filled with green.\n2.  **train_2:** A yellow 'C' shape is completed into a solid square by filling the central white pixel. A second, more complex yellow shape has a 1x1 internal white space filled with yellow.\n\nThe core operation appears to be identifying white (0) pixels that are \"inside\" a shape (completely enclosed or surrounded by a single non-white color) and changing the color of the central pixel(s) of these enclosed white regions to match the color of the enclosing shape. The shapes themselves and the background remain otherwise unchanged. The concept of \"center\" seems crucial, calculated based on the bounding box of the enclosed white region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
