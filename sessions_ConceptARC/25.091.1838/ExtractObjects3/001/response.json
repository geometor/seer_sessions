Parse the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels. Treat adjacent pixels (including diagonals) of the same non-white color as part of the same object.\n2. For each identified object:\n    a. Determine its color.\n    b. Calculate its bounding box.\n    c. Calculate the height and width of the bounding box.\n3. Search through the identified objects to find the single object whose bounding box dimensions are exactly 5 rows high and 5 columns wide.\n4. Record the color of this unique object.\n5. Create a new 5x5 output grid, initialized with white (0).\n6. Set the color of the pixels forming the outer border of the 5x5 output grid to the recorded color.\n7.
