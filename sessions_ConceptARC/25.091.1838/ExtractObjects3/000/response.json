These objects can have different colors and shapes. The output grid is always a 5x5 hollow square (a square with a 1-pixel thick border and a white interior). The color of the output square is determined by one specific object in the input.\n\nIn both examples provided:\n1.  **train_1**: The input has a green cross-shaped object and three red U-shaped objects. The green object's bounding box is 5x5. The red objects have smaller bounding boxes. The output is a 5x5 hollow green square.\n2.  **train_2**: The input has a magenta hollow square object and three green objects of varying shapes. The magenta object's bounding box is 5x5. The green objects have smaller bounding boxes. The output is a 5x5 hollow magenta square.\n\nThe core logic appears to involve:\n1.  Identifying all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input.\n2.  Calculating the bounding box for each object.\n3.  Finding the unique object whose bounding box dimensions are exactly 5x5.\n4.  Determining the color of this unique 5x5 object.\n5.
