task_description: Construct a 5x5 hollow square based on the color of a uniquely sized object in the input grid.

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - background_color: white (0).
  - objects: Multiple distinct contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
    - properties:
      - color: The single color composing the object.
      - shape: Variable.
      - size: Variable.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.

identification_rule:
  - Identify all distinct non-white objects.
  - Calculate the bounding box (height x width) for each object.
  - Filter objects to find the one with a bounding box size of exactly 5x5.
  - Assumption: There will be exactly one such object in the input.
  - Extract the color of this unique 5x5-bounded object.

output_features:
  - grid: A new 5x5 2D array.
  - structure: Hollow square.
    - border: 1-pixel thick border using the color identified from the input object.
    - interior: 3x3 center area filled with white (0).
