Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).
2.  **Objects:**
    *   Red pixels often form lines or elongated rectangular shapes. These shapes appear to be either predominantly vertical (`train_1`) or horizontal (`train_2`).
    *   Yellow pixels appear as individual, scattered points or occasionally small connected groups (`train_2`, row 9).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves removing *some* yellow pixels, turning them into white background pixels. The red pixels remain unchanged in the output. The key is determining *which* yellow pixels are kept and which are removed.
4.  **Pattern/Rule:** The decision to keep or remove a yellow pixel seems to depend on its position relative to the red structure.
    *   In `train_1`, the red structure is vertical (two lines). The single yellow pixel that remains is located horizontally *between* the columns containing the red lines. Yellow pixels outside this horizontal span are removed.
    *   In `train_2`, the red structure is horizontal (two lines). The single yellow pixel that remains is located vertically *between* the rows containing the red lines. Yellow pixels outside this vertical span are removed.
5.  **Orientation Dependency:** This suggests the rule adapts based on the orientation of the red structure. If the red structure is taller than wide (vertical), filter based on column position relative to the red columns. If the red structure is wider than tall (horizontal), filter based on row position relative to the red rows.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - element: colors
    description: Key colors involved are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).
  - element: red_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 2. They form structures that persist in the output.
    properties:
      - spatial_extent: The minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by red pixels define a bounding box.
      - orientation: The red structure can be primarily vertical (height > width) or horizontal (width > height), determined by comparing the number of unique rows vs unique columns occupied.
  - element: yellow_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 4. Some are kept, others are changed to white (0) in the output.
    properties:
      - position: Each yellow pixel has a row and column index.
  - element: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white). They generally remain unchanged unless a yellow pixel is removed.
actions:
  - action: identify_red_structure
    description: Locate all red pixels and determine their bounding box and overall orientation (vertical or horizontal).
  - action: filter_yellow_pixels
    description: Iterate through each yellow pixel and decide whether to keep it or change it to white based on its position relative to the red structure's bounds and orientation.
    conditions:
      - if red structure is vertical (more unique rows than columns): Keep yellow pixel if its column is strictly between the min and max red columns.
      - if red structure is horizontal (more unique columns than rows): Keep yellow pixel if its row is strictly between the min and max red rows.
  - action: generate_output
    description: Create the output grid by keeping all red pixels, background pixels, and the filtered set of yellow pixels. Change the removed yellow pixels to white.
relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The decision to keep a yellow pixel depends on whether its position falls strictly within the spatial bounds (rows or columns) defined by the red structure, conditional on the structure's orientation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
3.  If no red pixels are found, return the initial output grid unchanged.
4.  Determine the set of unique rows and unique columns occupied by the red pixels.
5.  Compare the number of unique red rows to the number of unique red columns to determine the orientation of the red structure:
    *   If `number_of_unique_red_rows > number_of_unique_red_columns`, the orientation is "vertical".
    *   Otherwise (including if equal), the orientation is "horizontal".
6.  Find the minimum and maximum row indices (`min_red_row`, `max_red_row`) and minimum and maximum column indices (`min_red_col`, `max_red_col`) occupied by the red pixels.
7.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
8.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is yellow (4):
    *   If the red structure orientation is "vertical":
        *   Check if the pixel's column `c` is strictly between `min_red_col` and `max_red_col` (i.e., `min_red_col < c < max_red_col`).
        *   If this condition is *not* met, change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    *   If the red structure orientation is "horizontal":
        *   Check if the pixel's row `r` is strictly between `min_red_row` and `max_red_row` (i.e., `min_red_row < r < max_red_row`).
        *   If this condition is *not* met, change the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
9.  Return the final output grid.
