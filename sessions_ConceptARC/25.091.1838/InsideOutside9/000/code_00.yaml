task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - element: colors
    description: Key colors involved are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).
  - element: red_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 2. They form structures that persist in the output.
    properties:
      - spatial_extent: The minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by red pixels define a bounding box.
      - orientation: The red structure can be primarily vertical (height > width) or horizontal (width > height), determined by comparing the number of unique rows vs unique columns occupied.
  - element: yellow_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 4. Some are kept, others are changed to white (0) in the output.
    properties:
      - position: Each yellow pixel has a row and column index.
  - element: background_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white). They generally remain unchanged unless a yellow pixel is removed.
actions:
  - action: identify_red_structure
    description: Locate all red pixels and determine their bounding box and overall orientation (vertical or horizontal).
  - action: filter_yellow_pixels
    description: Iterate through each yellow pixel and decide whether to keep it or change it to white based on its position relative to the red structure's bounds and orientation.
    conditions:
      - if red structure is vertical (more unique rows than columns): Keep yellow pixel if its column is strictly between the min and max red columns.
      - if red structure is horizontal (more unique columns than rows): Keep yellow pixel if its row is strictly between the min and max red rows.
  - action: generate_output
    description: Create the output grid by keeping all red pixels, background pixels, and the filtered set of yellow pixels. Change the removed yellow pixels to white.
relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The decision to keep a yellow pixel depends on whether its position falls strictly within the spatial bounds (rows or columns) defined by the red structure, conditional on the structure's orientation.
