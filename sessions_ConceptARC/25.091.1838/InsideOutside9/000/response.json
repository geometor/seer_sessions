            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   Red pixels often form lines or elongated rectangular shapes. These shapes appear to be either predominantly vertical (`train_1`) or horizontal (`train_2`).\n    *   Yellow pixels appear as individual, scattered points or occasionally small connected groups (`train_2`, row 9).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves removing *some* yellow pixels, turning them into white background pixels. The red pixels remain unchanged in the output. The key is determining *which* yellow pixels are kept and which are removed.\n4.  **Pattern/Rule:** The decision to keep or remove a yellow pixel seems to depend on its position relative to the red structure.\n    *   In `train_1`, the red structure is vertical (two lines). The single yellow pixel that remains is located horizontally *between* the columns containing the red lines. Yellow pixels outside this horizontal span are removed.\n    *   In `train_2`, the red structure is horizontal (two lines). The single yellow pixel that remains is located vertically *between* the rows containing the red lines. Yellow pixels outside this vertical span are removed.\n5.  **Orientation Dependency:** This suggests the rule adapts based on the orientation of the red structure. If the red structure is taller than wide (vertical), filter based on column position relative to the red columns. If the red structure is wider than tall (horizontal), filter based on row position relative to the red rows.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
