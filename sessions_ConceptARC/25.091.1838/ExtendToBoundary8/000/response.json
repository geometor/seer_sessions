An outer border of white pixels (0).\n2.  An inner rectangular frame made of a single color (green=3 in train_1, blue=1 in train_2).\n3.  An area inside the frame, mostly filled with white pixels (0).\n4.  A single, uniquely colored pixel located within the inner white area (yellow=4 in train_1, magenta=6 in train_2). This seems to be the 'seed' or 'source' pixel.\n\nThe output grid retains the outer border and the inner frame exactly as they were in the input.\nThe transformation happens within the area bounded by the inner frame.\nThe single 'seed' pixel from the input appears to \"project\" its color horizontally and vertically within the inner area.\nSpecifically, all the white pixels (0) along the same row and same column as the seed pixel, but only *within* the boundaries set by the inner frame, are changed to the color of the seed pixel. The original seed pixel retains its color, and the frame pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
