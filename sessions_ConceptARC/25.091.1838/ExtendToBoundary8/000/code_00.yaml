task_description: Draw horizontal and vertical lines from a seed pixel within a framed area.
elements:
  - object: Background
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
      location: Outermost border pixels.
      persists: Yes, unchanged in output.
  - object: Frame
    attributes:
      color: Varies (e.g., green, blue)
      shape: Rectangle
      location: Forms an inner border inside the background.
      pixels: Contiguous pixels of the frame color.
      persists: Yes, unchanged in output.
  - object: Inner Area
    attributes:
      location: Bounded by the Frame.
      initial_color: Mostly white (0).
      transformation: Some white pixels change color.
  - object: Seed Pixel
    attributes:
      color: Varies (e.g., yellow, magenta), different from Frame and Background.
      location: A single pixel within the Inner Area.
      role: Source of the transformation color and location.
      persists: Yes, unchanged in output.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    object1: Seed Pixel
    relation: is inside
    object2: Inner Area
  - type: containment
    object1: Inner Area
    relation: is bounded by
    object2: Frame
  - type: boundary
    object1: Frame
    relation: separates

    object3: Background
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: Frame, Seed Pixel, Inner Area
  - action: project_color
    source: Seed Pixel
    direction: Horizontal and Vertical
    target: White pixels within the Inner Area
    constraint: Projection stops at the Frame boundary.
    effect: Changes target white pixels to the Seed Pixel's color.
