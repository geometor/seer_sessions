task_description: Fill horizontal gaps within each row, bounded by the extent of the largest non-background object in that row.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0) # Typically the most frequent color
      objects:
        - type: main_object
          description: The largest contiguous region of a single non-background color in the grid.
          properties:
            color: Variable (e.g., green (3), blue (1))
            pixels: Set of (row, col) coordinates comprising the object.
        - type: row_segment
          description: The portion of the main object present in a single row.
          properties:
            row_index: Integer
            min_col: The minimum column index of the object's color in this row.
            max_col: The maximum column index of the object's color in this row.
        - type: horizontal_gap
          description: Background-colored pixels within a row located between the min_col and max_col of the main object for that row.
          properties:
            color: white (0)
            location: Within a specific row, between min_col and max_col (inclusive).

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    details: Determine the most frequent color, assume it's the background (white/0).
  - name: find_largest_object
    details: Identify the largest contiguous block of non-background pixels and determine its color (fill_color).
  - name: process_rows
    details: Iterate through each row of the grid.
  - name: find_row_extent
    details: For a given row, find the minimum and maximum column indices containing the fill_color. If the fill_color is not present, skip the row.
  - name: fill_horizontal_gap
    details: For a given row, change the color of all background pixels located between the minimum and maximum column indices (inclusive) found in the previous step to the fill_color.

relationships:
  - type: bounds
    subject: horizontal_gap
    object: row_segment
    details: A horizontal gap exists within the horizontal bounds (min_col to max_col) defined by the row_segment of the main object.
