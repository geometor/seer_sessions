            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of a main object and internal holes but misinterpreted the filling rule. The provided code, based on filling only fully enclosed \"internal holes\", failed because the actual transformation fills *horizontal gaps* within the row-wise extent of the main object. The failures occurred in rows where background pixels existed between the leftmost and rightmost pixel of the main object *in that specific row*, even if those background pixels weren't fully enclosed in 2D.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the understanding of the transformation: instead of a 2D flood fill or boundary check for holes, the process operates row by row. For each row, it determines the horizontal span (minimum to maximum column) covered by the largest object's color and fills any background pixels within that span in that row.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
