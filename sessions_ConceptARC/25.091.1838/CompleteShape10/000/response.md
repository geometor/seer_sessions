Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both examples show a large grid primarily composed of the background color, white (0). Within this background, there is a single, large, contiguous shape made of a non-background color (green (3) in example 1, blue (1) in example 2).
2.  **Internal Features:** Inside the main colored shape in both inputs, there are smaller regions (pixels or groups of pixels) that have the background color (white, 0). These appear as "holes" or "gaps" within the main shape.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are nearly identical to their corresponding input grids. The overall shape, its color, and the background remain unchanged.
4.  **Transformation:** The key difference between input and output is that the internal "holes" (background-colored regions completely surrounded by the shape's color) in the input have been filled with the color of the surrounding shape in the output. Regions of background color that touch the edge of the grid or are not fully enclosed by the shape remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill internal holes within the largest non-background object with the object's color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0) # Typically the most frequent color
      objects:
        - type: shape
          description: The largest contiguous region of a single non-background color.
          properties:
            color: Variable (e.g., green (3), blue (1))
            contains:
              - type: hole
                description: Regions of background color pixels completely enclosed within the shape.
                properties:
                  color: white (0) # Same as grid background_color

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    details: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, assume it's the background.
  - name: identify_main_object
    details: Find the largest contiguous object that is not the background color.
  - name: identify_internal_holes
    details: Locate regions of the background color that are completely surrounded by the main object's pixels.
  - name: fill_holes
    details: Change the color of the pixels identified as internal holes to match the color of the main object.

relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: main_object
    object: internal_holes
    details: The main object completely surrounds the internal holes. Pixels of the hole region do not touch the grid boundary or any other non-object pixel without crossing an object pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color of the input grid (this is usually white, 0, the most common color).
2.  Find the largest contiguous object in the grid that consists of a single color different from the background color. Let this object's color be the "fill color".
3.  Scan the grid to find all pixels that have the background color but are completely surrounded by pixels of the fill color. These are the "internal holes". A pixel is considered surrounded if any path from that pixel to the boundary of the grid must pass through a pixel of the fill color.
4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
5.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels identified as internal holes (in step 3) to the fill color (identified in step 2).
6.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from the input grid.
