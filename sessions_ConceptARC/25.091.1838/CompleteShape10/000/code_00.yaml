task_description: Fill internal holes within the largest non-background object with the object's color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0) # Typically the most frequent color
      objects:
        - type: shape
          description: The largest contiguous region of a single non-background color.
          properties:
            color: Variable (e.g., green (3), blue (1))
            contains:
              - type: hole
                description: Regions of background color pixels completely enclosed within the shape.
                properties:
                  color: white (0) # Same as grid background_color

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    details: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, assume it's the background.
  - name: identify_main_object
    details: Find the largest contiguous object that is not the background color.
  - name: identify_internal_holes
    details: Locate regions of the background color that are completely surrounded by the main object's pixels.
  - name: fill_holes
    details: Change the color of the pixels identified as internal holes to match the color of the main object.

relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: main_object
    object: internal_holes
    details: The main object completely surrounds the internal holes. Pixels of the hole region do not touch the grid boundary or any other non-object pixel without crossing an object pixel.
