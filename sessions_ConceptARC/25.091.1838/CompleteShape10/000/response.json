Within this background, there is a single, large, contiguous shape made of a non-background color (green (3) in example 1, blue (1) in example 2).\n2.  **Internal Features:** Inside the main colored shape in both inputs, there are smaller regions (pixels or groups of pixels) that have the background color (white, 0). These appear as \"holes\" or \"gaps\" within the main shape.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are nearly identical to their corresponding input grids. The overall shape, its color, and the background remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation:** The key difference between input and output is that the internal \"holes\" (background-colored regions completely surrounded by the shape's color) in the input have been filled with the color of the surrounding shape in the output. Regions of background color that touch the edge of the grid or are not fully enclosed by the shape remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Find the largest contiguous object in the grid that consists of a single color different from the background color. Let this object's color be the \"fill color\".\n3.  Scan the grid to find all pixels that have the background color but are completely surrounded by pixels of the fill color. These are the \"internal holes\". A pixel is considered surrounded if any path from that pixel to the boundary of the grid must pass through a pixel of the fill color.\n4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n5.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels identified as internal holes (in step 3) to the fill color (identified in step 2).\n6.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from the input grid."
