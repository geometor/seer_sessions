task_description: Fill horizontal gaps within contiguous horizontal segments of the largest non-background object, using the object's color.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      objects:
        - type: shape
          description: The largest contiguous region of a single non-background color. Let its color be 'fill_color'.
          properties:
            color: Variable (e.g., green (3), blue (1))
            contains:
              - type: horizontal_segment
                description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of 'fill_color' within a single row.
                properties:
                  row_index: integer
                  start_column: integer
                  end_column: integer
              - type: horizontal_gap
                description: One or more contiguous background pixels within a single row, located between the start_column and end_column of a 'horizontal_segment'.
                properties:
                  color: white (0)
                  location: Within a horizontal segment's column bounds.

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    details: Determine the background color (assumed to be 0).
  - name: identify_largest_object
    details: Find the largest contiguous object that is not the background color. Determine its color ('fill_color').
  - name: process_rows
    details: Iterate through each row of the grid.
  - name: find_horizontal_segments
    details: For the current row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments composed of the 'fill_color'. Record the start and end column for each segment.
  - name: fill_segment_gaps
    details: For each identified horizontal segment in the row, change the color of any background pixels located between the segment's start column and end column (inclusive) to the 'fill_color'.

relationships:
  - type: bounded_by
    subject: horizontal_gap
    object: horizontal_segment
    details: A horizontal gap to be filled must lie horizontally between the start and end columns of a single continuous horizontal segment of the fill_color within the same row. Gaps between separate segments on the same row are not filled.
