task_description: Fill horizontal gaps within the row-wise extent of the main non-background object.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0) # Most frequent color
      objects:
        - type: shape
          description: The single contiguous region of a single non-background color (or the largest one if multiple exist).
          properties:
            color: Variable (e.g., green (3), blue (1))
            row_extent: For each row containing the shape, the minimum and maximum column index occupied by the shape.
          contains:
            - type: horizontal_gap
              description: Regions of background color pixels located within a single row, horizontally between the minimum and maximum column extent of the shape in that row.
              properties:
                  color: white (0) # Same as grid background_color

actions:
  - name: identify_background_color
    details: Determine the most frequent color in the input grid, assume it's the background (white/0).
  - name: identify_main_object_and_color
    details: Find the largest contiguous object that is not the background color and identify its color (fill_color).
  - name: determine_row_extents
    details: For each row, find the minimum and maximum column index containing a pixel of the main object.
  - name: fill_horizontal_gaps
    details: For each row where the main object exists, change the color of all background pixels located between the minimum and maximum column extent (inclusive) for that row to the fill_color.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_containment
    subject: row_extent (min_col, max_col) for a specific row 'r'
    object: horizontal_gap pixels at (r, c)
    details: The column 'c' of a horizontal_gap pixel must satisfy min_col <= c <= max_col for the given row 'r'.
