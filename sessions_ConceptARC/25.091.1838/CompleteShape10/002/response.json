            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of a main object and internal \"holes\" of background color. The implemented strategy attempted to fill these holes by identifying background pixels not connected to the grid border. However, the comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals this strategy was incorrect.\n\n*   In `train_1`, the code filled holes in rows 10 and 11, which were *not* filled in the expected output. It *failed* to fill the holes in row 15, which *were* filled in the expected output.\n*   In `train_2`, the code filled holes in rows 7 and 8 based on the \"reachability\" logic, but failed to fill the holes in row 3 correctly. The expected output fills specific horizontal gaps within the object's extent on each relevant row.\n\nThe discrepancy indicates that the definition of \"hole\" or the condition for filling is not simply about being surrounded or unreachable from the border. The pattern in the *expected* outputs suggests a row-by-row filling mechanism based on the horizontal span of the object within that row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Identify the primary non-background object and its color.\n2.  For each row in the grid:\n    *   Find the column index of the leftmost pixel belonging to the object in that row.\n    *   Find the column index of the rightmost pixel belonging to the object in that row.\n    *   If the object exists in that row (i.e., leftmost and rightmost indices are found):\n        *   Iterate through all pixels between the leftmost and rightmost columns (inclusive) in that row.\n        *   If a pixel in this range is of the background color, change it to the object's color.\n3.  This approach focuses on completing the horizontal segments of the object on a per-row basis.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the row-wise min/max column strategy for the object pixels.\n\n"
