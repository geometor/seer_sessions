elements:
  - object: grid
    type: input
    properties:
      - contains a single, prominent, hollow rectangular frame
      - frame_color: variable (e.g., green, gray)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains inner_pixels enclosed by the frame
      - inner_pixel_color: variable (e.g., blue, orange), distinct from frame and background
  - object: grid
    type: output
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x1 (height 7, width 1)
      - content: sequence of pixels, starting with yellow (4), followed by white (0)
transformation:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Locate the largest hollow rectangular object not made of the background color.
  - action: identify_inner_pixels
    description: Find all pixels inside the identified frame that are neither the frame color nor the background color.
  - action: count_inner_pixels
    input: result of identify_inner_pixels
    output: integer N (the count)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    parameters:
      - height: 7
      - width: 1
    output: an empty 7x1 grid
  - action: populate_output_grid
    input_grid: result of construct_output_grid
    input_count: N (result of count_inner_pixels)
    output_value_primary: yellow (4)
    output_value_secondary: white (0)
    description: Fill the first N cells of the output grid (top-to-bottom) with the primary value (yellow). Fill the remaining 7-N cells with the secondary value (white).
relationship:
  - The number of yellow pixels (4) in the output grid is equal to the count (N) of inner_pixels found within the frame in the input grid.
