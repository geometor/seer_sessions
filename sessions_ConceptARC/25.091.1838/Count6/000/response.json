This frame encloses an inner area.\n2.  **Inner Elements:** Within the inner area defined by the frame, there are scattered pixels of another color (blue in example 1, orange in example 2). The rest of the inner area and the area outside the frame are typically white (background color 0).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are consistently 7x1 column vectors (grids of height 7 and width 1).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve counting the non-frame, non-background pixels located *inside* the main frame.\n5.  **Output Content:** The output column vector is populated based on this count. For each counted inner pixel, a yellow pixel (4) is placed in the output column, starting from the top. The remaining positions in the 7x1 output grid are filled with white (0). The number of yellow pixels in the output directly corresponds to the number of inner pixels found in the input. The specific colors of the frame and the inner pixels in the input do not seem to affect the output values (which are always yellow or white), only their roles (frame vs. inner content) matter.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This frame is defined by a single color that is not the background color (white, 0) and encloses an inner area.\n2.  **Identify Inner Pixels:** Examine the area strictly inside the boundaries of the identified frame. Locate all pixels within this inner area whose color is different from both the frame's color and the background color (white, 0).\n3.  **Count Inner Pixels:** Count the total number (`N`) of these identified inner pixels.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate a new grid with dimensions 7 rows and 1 column. Initialize all cells to white (0).\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the first `N` cells of the output grid (starting from row 0, column 0 and going down) with the color yellow (4). Leave the remaining cells (from row `N` to row 6) as white (0).\n6.  **Return:** The resulting 7x1 grid is the final output."
