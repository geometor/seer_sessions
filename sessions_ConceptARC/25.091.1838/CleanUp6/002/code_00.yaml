analysis:
  - task_type: object_filtering
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - connectivity: 4-way # horizontal/vertical adjacency for defining objects
  - processing_steps:
      - step: count_colors
        description: Count occurrences of each non-background color.
        example_1: { color_3: 22, color_1: 6 } # green, blue
        example_2: { color_6: 28, color_8: 10 } # magenta, azure
      - step: identify_primary_color
        description: Determine the most frequent non-background color. Ties are included (though none in examples).
        example_1: color_3 # green (22 occurrences)
        example_2: color_6 # magenta (28 occurrences)
      - step: find_objects
        description: Identify all contiguous objects for the primary color(s).
        example_1_color_3: # 6 objects total
          sizes: [9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        example_2_color_6: # 4 objects total
          sizes: [14, 9, 4, 1]
      - step: find_largest_objects_size
        description: Determine the maximum object size for the primary color(s).
        example_1_max_size: 9
        example_2_max_size: 14
      - step: filter_pixels
        description: Keep only the pixels belonging to *all* object(s) of the primary color(s) that match the maximum size. Set all other pixels to the background color (0).
        example_1_kept_pixels: Pixels belonging to the two size-9 green objects.
        example_2_kept_pixels: Pixels belonging to the single size-14 magenta object.
  - output_grid_content: Contains only the background color and the pixels from the largest object(s) of the most frequent input color, preserving their original color and position.
