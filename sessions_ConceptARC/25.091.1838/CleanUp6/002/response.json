              "code": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core logic for Example 1: find the most frequent color and keep only the largest contiguous object(s) of that color. Example 2 introduced a scenario where the most frequent color (magenta=6) had *two* distinct objects of the *same* maximum size. The expected output correctly includes *both* of these objects.\n\nThe provided failed output for Example 2 shows that only one of the two largest magenta objects was correctly rendered, while the other was either missing or incomplete. This suggests the error wasn't in identifying the objects or the rule itself, but potentially in the implementation step where pixels from the qualifying objects are written to the output grid. Specifically, processing the second largest object might have overwritten or missed some pixels if not handled carefully.\n\nThe strategy is to re-confirm the object identification and sizes using code execution, and refine the natural language program to explicitly state that *all* objects meeting the size criteria are kept. The code logic itself, as simulated in the thought process, seems capable of producing the correct output, suggesting the initial failure might have stemmed from a subtle bug or an issue in the execution environment.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n<ctrl97>tool_code\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter, deque\n\ndef find_connected_objects(grid, target_color):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_object_coords = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    current_object_coords.append((row, col))\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == target_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                if current_object_coords:\n                    objects.append(sorted(current_object_coords))\n    return objects\n\n# --- Example 1 Data ---\ninput_grid_ex1_list = [\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3],\n    [3,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3],\n    [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,1],\n    [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\ninput_grid_ex1_np = np.array(input_grid_ex1_list)\n\n# --- Example 2 Data ---\ninput_grid_ex2_list = [\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,8,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,8,6,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,6,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,6,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\ninput_grid_ex2_np = np.array(input_grid_ex2_list)\n\n# --- Analysis Function ---\ndef analyze_example(name, grid_np):\n    print(f\"--- Analysis for {name} ---\")\n    pixels = grid_np.flatten()\n    non_bg_pixels = pixels[pixels != 0]\n    if len(non_bg_pixels) == 0:\n        print(\"Grid contains only background color.\")\n        return\n\n    color_counts = Counter(non_bg_pixels)\n    print(f\"Color Counts (excluding background 0): {dict(color_counts)}\")\n\n    max_freq = 0\n    primary_colors = []\n    if color_counts:\n        max_freq = max(color_counts.values())\n        primary_colors = [color for color, count in color_counts.items() if count == max_freq]\n    print(f\"Most Frequent Color(s): {primary_colors} (Count: {max_freq})\")\n\n    if not primary_colors:\n        print(\"No primary color found.\")\n        return\n\n    all_primary_objects = []\n    max_object_size = 0\n    object_details = {}\n\n    for color in primary_colors:\n        objects_of_color = find_connected_objects(grid_np, color)\n        object_sizes = [len(obj) for obj in objects_of_color]\n        object_details[color] = {'objects': objects_of_color, 'sizes': object_sizes}\n        all_primary_objects.extend(objects_of_color)\n        if object_sizes:\n            max_object_size = max(max_object_size, max(object_sizes))\n\n    print(\"Objects of Primary Color(s):\")\n    for color, details in object_details.items():\n        print(f\"  Color {color}: Found {len(details['objects'])} object(s) with sizes: {details['sizes']}\")\n\n    print(f\"Maximum Object Size among Primary Color(s): {max_object_size}\")\n\n    largest_objects_count = sum(1 for obj in all_primary_objects if len(obj) == max_object_size)\n    print(f\"Number of Objects with Maximum Size ({max_object_size}): {largest_objects_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * (len(name) + 18))\n\n\n# --- Run Analysis ---\nanalyze_example(\"Example 1\", input_grid_ex1_np)\nanalyze_example(\"Example 2\", input_grid_ex2_np)"
