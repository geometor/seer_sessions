Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of pixels represented by numbers (colors). The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Colors & Objects:** The inputs contain multiple non-background colors (Example 1: blue=1, green=3; Example 2: magenta=6, azure=8). These colors often form contiguous objects (shapes) of varying sizes, but can also appear as isolated pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation selectively removes some colored pixels, turning them white (0), while keeping others.
    *   In Example 1, all blue pixels are removed. Some green pixels (those not part of the main large green shape) are also removed. Only the pixels forming the largest connected green object remain.
    *   In Example 2, all azure pixels are removed. All magenta pixels remain. The magenta pixels form two large, separate objects of equal size.
4.  **Pattern Identification:** The key pattern seems to involve:
    *   Identifying the non-background colors present.
    *   Counting the frequency of each non-background color.
    *   Focusing on the color that appears most frequently.
    *   Identifying contiguous objects formed by this most frequent color.
    *   Selecting the largest object(s) of this color.
    *   The output grid retains *only* the pixels belonging to these largest object(s) of the most frequent color. All other pixels become white (background).

  - task_type: object_filtering # Based on properties like color frequency and size/connectivity
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - non_background_colors_input_ex1: [1, 3] # blue, green
  - non_background_colors_input_ex2: [6, 8] # magenta, azure
  - processing_steps:
      - step: count_colors
        description: Count occurrences of each non-background color in the input grid.
        example_1: { color_1: 6, color_3: 21 }
        example_2: { color_6: 28, color_8: 10 }
      - step: identify_primary_color
        description: Determine the most frequent non-background color.
        example_1: color_3 # green (21 occurrences)
        example_2: color_6 # magenta (28 occurrences)
        tie_breaking: If multiple colors share the maximum frequency, all are considered primary (though not seen in examples).
      - step: find_objects
        description: Identify all contiguous objects (4-neighbor connectivity) for the primary color(s).
        example_1_color_3: [object_size_19, object_size_1, object_size_1]
        example_2_color_6: [object_size_15, object_size_15]
      - step: find_largest_objects
        description: Determine the maximum object size for the primary color(s).
        example_1_max_size: 19
        example_2_max_size: 15
      - step: filter_pixels
        description: Keep only the pixels belonging to the largest object(s) of the primary color(s). Set all other pixels to the background color (0).
        example_1_kept_pixels: Pixels belonging to the size 19 green object.
        example_2_kept_pixels: Pixels belonging to both size 15 magenta objects.
  - output_grid_content: Contains only the background color and the pixels from the largest object(s) of the most frequent input color.

### Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all unique pixel colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).
2.  Calculate the frequency (count) of each identified non-background color.
3.  Determine the color(s) that has the highest frequency count. This is the "primary" color (or colors, if tied).
4.  Find all separate, contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same color, using side-by-side adjacency) composed of the primary color(s).
5.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each of these objects.
6.  Identify the maximum size among these objects.
7.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
8.  Iterate through all the identified objects of the primary color(s). If an object's size is equal to the maximum size found in step 6, copy all pixels belonging to that object from their original positions in the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.
9.  The resulting grid is the final output.
