            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of pixels represented by numbers (colors). The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Colors & Objects:** The inputs contain multiple non-background colors (Example 1: blue=1, green=3; Example 2: magenta=6, azure=8). These colors often form contiguous objects (shapes) of varying sizes, but can also appear as isolated pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation selectively removes some colored pixels, turning them white (0), while keeping others.\n    *   In Example 1, all blue pixels are removed. Some green pixels (those not part of the main large green shape) are also removed. Only the pixels forming the largest connected green object remain.\n    *   In Example 2, all azure pixels are removed. All magenta pixels remain. The magenta pixels form two large, separate objects of equal size.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The key pattern seems to involve:\n    *   Identifying the non-background colors present.\n    *   Counting the frequency of each non-background color.\n    *   Focusing on the color that appears most frequently.\n    *   Identifying contiguous objects formed by this most frequent color.\n    *   Selecting the largest object(s) of this color.\n    *   The output grid retains *only* the pixels belonging to these largest object(s) of the most frequent color. All other pixels become white (background).\n\n### Facts\n\n"
