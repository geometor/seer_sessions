      - step: count_colors
        description: Count occurrences of each non-background color.
        example_1: { blue: 6, green: 22 } # Raw counts from input
        example_2: { magenta: 28, azure: 10 } # Raw counts from input
      - step: identify_primary_color
        description: Determine the most frequent non-background color.
        example_1: green (color 3)
        example_2: magenta (color 6)
      - step: find_objects_of_primary_color
        description: Identify all contiguous objects (using 4-way adjacency) of the primary color.

      - step: find_largest_size
        description: Determine the maximum size among all objects of the primary color.
        example_1_max_size: 19
        example_2_max_size: 15
      - step: filter_objects
        description: Keep only the object(s) of the primary color whose size equals the maximum size found. Discard all other pixels (set to background color 0).
        example_1_kept_objects: The single green object of size 19.
        example_2_kept_objects: The two magenta objects of size 15.
  - output_grid_content: Contains only the pixels from the largest object(s) of the most frequent input color, preserving their original color. All other pixels are background (0).
