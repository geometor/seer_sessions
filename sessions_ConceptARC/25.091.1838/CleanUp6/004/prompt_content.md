```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying the most frequent non-background color(s), finding all contiguous objects of that color(s), determining the maximum size among these objects, and returning a new grid containing only the pixels belonging to the object(s) that match this maximum size. All other pixels are set to the background color (0). Connectivity for objects is defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
