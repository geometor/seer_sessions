facts:
  - analysis_target: Identify transformation rule from input to output grid.
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - processing_steps:
      - step: 1. identify_non_background_pixels
        description: Find all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (0).
      - step: 2. count_color_frequency
        description: Count the occurrences of each unique non-background color.
        example_1: { green(3): 22, blue(1): 6 } # BFS tool output differs slightly from initial count
        example_2: { magenta(6): 28, azure(8): 10 }
      - step: 3. find_primary_color
        description: Determine the non-background color(s) with the highest frequency count.
        example_1: green(3)
        example_2: magenta(6)
        tie_breaking: If multiple colors have the same max frequency, all are considered primary.
      - step: 4. find_primary_objects
        description: Identify all separate, contiguous objects (using 4-way adjacency) composed of the primary color(s).
        example_1_green_objects: Found 6 objects. Sizes: [1, 1, 9, 9, 1, 1] (Based on BFS tool execution)
        example_2_magenta_objects: Found 4 objects. Sizes: [9, 1, 14, 4] (Based on BFS tool execution)
      - step: 5. find_max_primary_object_size
        description: Determine the maximum size among all objects found in step 4.
        example_1_max_size: 9
        example_2_max_size: 14
      - step: 6. filter_and_construct_output
        description: Create a new grid containing only the pixels from the primary object(s) whose size matches the maximum size found in step 5. All other pixels are set to the background color (0).
        example_1_output: Contains pixels from the two green objects of size 9.
        example_2_output: Contains pixels from the one magenta object of size 14. # Note: This matches code behavior but not expected output.
  - object_definition: A contiguous group of pixels of the same color, connected via 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - inferred_rule: Keep only the largest object(s) of the most frequent color.
