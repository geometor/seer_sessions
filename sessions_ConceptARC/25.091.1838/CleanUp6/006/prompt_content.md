"""
Transforms an input grid by performing the following steps:
1. Identify all unique non-background pixel colors (0 is background).
2. Count the frequency of each non-background color.
3. Determine the color(s) with the highest frequency ('primary' color(s)).
4. Find all contiguous objects composed of the primary color(s) using 4-way adjacency.
5. Identify the largest size among these primary color objects.
6. Create an output grid containing only the pixels belonging to the largest object(s)
   of the primary color(s), preserving their original color. All other pixels are
   set to the background color (0).
