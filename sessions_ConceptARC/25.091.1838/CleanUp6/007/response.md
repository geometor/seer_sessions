```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by identifying the most frequent non-background color(s), 
finding all contiguous objects of that color(s), determining the maximum size 
among these objects, and returning a new grid containing only the pixels 
belonging to the object(s) that match this maximum size. All other pixels 
are set to the background color (0). Connectivity for objects is defined by 
4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
