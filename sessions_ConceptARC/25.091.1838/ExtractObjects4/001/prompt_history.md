Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature horizontal stripes. There are typically two colors involved: white (0) acting as a separator, and one other dominant non-white color (e.g., red, magenta, yellow) forming the main stripes.
2.  **Stripe Variations:** Most stripes of the dominant color span the entire width of the grid ("complete stripes"). However, in each example, there are one or more stripes of the dominant color that are shorter and do not span the full width ("incomplete stripes"). These incomplete stripes appear to be caused by interruptions, often by white pixels replacing the dominant color at the edges or sometimes internally, although the examples primarily show edge interruptions creating shorter segments.
3.  **Dominant Color:** Each input grid uses only one non-white color. This color is the primary element forming the shapes and also determines the color of the output grid.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a solid rectangle filled entirely with the dominant non-white color found in the input.
5.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task seems to be identifying the pattern or region defined by the *incomplete* stripes in the input and using the dimensions of this region to determine the size of the solid-colored output grid.

**Analysis of Transformation:**

The key lies in the incomplete stripes. Let's analyze their bounding box:

*   **Example 1:** Dominant color Red (2). Incomplete stripes are `2 2 2 2 2` in row 6 (cols 1-5) and row 8 (cols 1-5). The bounding box enclosing *all* pixels of these incomplete stripes spans rows 6 to 8 (Height H=3) and columns 1 to 5 (Width W=5). The output is 5x5.
*   **Example 2:** Dominant color Magenta (6). Incomplete stripes are `6 6 6 6` in row 4 (cols 1-4) and row 6 (cols 1-4). The bounding box spans rows 4 to 6 (Height H=3) and columns 1 to 4 (Width W=4). The output is 5x4.
*   **Example 3:** Dominant color Yellow (4). The incomplete stripe is `4 4 4` in row 2 (cols 11-13). The bounding box spans row 2 (Height H=1) and columns 11 to 13 (Width W=3). The output is 3x3.

It appears the output dimensions (OutputH, OutputW) are derived from the bounding box dimensions (H, W) of the incomplete stripes as follows:
*   OutputW = W
*   OutputH = H + 2

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract the dimensions of a pattern formed by incomplete horizontal stripes of the dominant color and generate a solid block of that color with modified height.

elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: Primarily white (0) and one dominant non-white color (C).
      - structure: Contains horizontal stripes of color C, separated by white stripes.
      - features: Includes both 'complete' stripes (spanning full width) and 'incomplete' stripes (shorter than full width).
  - object: DominantColor
    properties:
      - value: The single non-white color (C) present in the InputGrid.
  - object: IncompleteStripes
    properties:
      - definition: Horizontal segments of DominantColor C whose length is less than the InputGrid's width.
      - role: Define the key pattern or region of interest.
  - object: BoundingBox
    properties:
      - definition: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to any IncompleteStripe.
      - attributes: height (H), width (W).
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - color: Uniformly filled with the DominantColor C.
      - dimensions: Height = H + 2, Width = W.

transformations:
  - action: IdentifyDominantColor
    input: InputGrid
    output: DominantColor C
  - action: FindStripes
    input: InputGrid, DominantColor C
    output: List of all horizontal segments of color C (with row, start_col, end_col).
  - action: FilterIncompleteStripes
    input: List of stripes, InputGrid width
    output: List of IncompleteStripes.
  - action: CalculateBoundingBox
    input: List of IncompleteStripes
    output: BoundingBox properties (H, W).
  - action: DetermineOutputDimensions
    input: BoundingBox properties (H, W)
    output: OutputGrid dimensions (OutputH = H + 2, OutputW = W).
  - action: CreateOutputGrid
    input: OutputGrid dimensions, DominantColor C
    output: OutputGrid.

relationships:
  - The OutputGrid's color is determined by the DominantColor of the InputGrid.
  - The OutputGrid's width (OutputW) is identical to the width (W) of the BoundingBox of IncompleteStripes.
  - The OutputGrid's height (OutputH) is derived from the height (H) of the BoundingBox by adding 2 (OutputH = H + 2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to identify the single dominant non-white color (let's call it 'C').
2.  Scan the grid row by row to find all contiguous horizontal segments composed solely of color 'C'.
3.  Identify which of these segments are "incomplete", meaning their length is less than the total width of the input grid.
4.  Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encompasses *all* pixels belonging to *any* of these incomplete segments. Record the height (H) and width (W) of this bounding box.
5.  Calculate the dimensions for the output grid: the output width will be W, and the output height will be H + 2.
6.  Construct the output grid with these calculated dimensions ( (H+2) x W ).
7.  Fill the entire output grid with the dominant color 'C'.
