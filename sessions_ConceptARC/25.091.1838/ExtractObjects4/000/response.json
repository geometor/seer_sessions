            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature horizontal stripes. There are typically two colors involved: white (0) acting as a separator, and one other dominant non-white color (e.g., red, magenta, yellow) forming the main stripes.\n2.  **Stripe Variations:** Most stripes of the dominant color span the entire width of the grid (\"complete stripes\"). However, in each example, there are one or more stripes of the dominant color that are shorter and do not span the full width (\"incomplete stripes\"). These incomplete stripes appear to be caused by interruptions, often by white pixels replacing the dominant color at the edges or sometimes internally, although the examples primarily show edge interruptions creating shorter segments.\n3.  **Dominant Color:** Each input grid uses only one non-white color. This color is the primary element forming the shapes and also determines the color of the output grid.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a solid rectangle filled entirely with the dominant non-white color found in the input.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task seems to be identifying the pattern or region defined by the *incomplete* stripes in the input and using the dimensions of this region to determine the size of the solid-colored output grid.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation:**\n\nThe key lies in the incomplete stripes. Let's analyze their bounding box:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Dominant color Red (2). Incomplete stripes are `2 2 2 2 2` in row 6 (cols 1-5) and row 8 (cols 1-5). The bounding box enclosing *all* pixels of these incomplete stripes spans rows 6 to 8 (Height H=3) and columns 1 to 5 (Width W=5). The output is 5x5.\n*   **Example 2:** Dominant color Magenta (6). Incomplete stripes are `6 6 6 6` in row 4 (cols 1-4) and row 6 (cols 1-4). The bounding box spans rows 4 to 6 (Height H=3) and columns 1 to 4 (Width W=4). The output is 5x4.\n*   **Example 3:** Dominant color Yellow (4). The incomplete stripe is `4 4 4` in row 2 (cols 11-13). The bounding box spans row 2 (Height H=1) and columns 11 to 13 (Width W=3). The output is 3x3.\n\nIt appears the output dimensions (OutputH, OutputW) are derived from the bounding box dimensions (H, W) of the incomplete stripes as follows:\n*   OutputW = W\n*   OutputH = H + 2\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
