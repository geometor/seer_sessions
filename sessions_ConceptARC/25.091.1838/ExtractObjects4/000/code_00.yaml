task_description: Extract the dimensions of a pattern formed by incomplete horizontal stripes of the dominant color and generate a solid block of that color with modified height.

elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: Primarily white (0) and one dominant non-white color (C).
      - structure: Contains horizontal stripes of color C, separated by white stripes.
      - features: Includes both 'complete' stripes (spanning full width) and 'incomplete' stripes (shorter than full width).
  - object: DominantColor
    properties:
      - value: The single non-white color (C) present in the InputGrid.
  - object: IncompleteStripes
    properties:
      - definition: Horizontal segments of DominantColor C whose length is less than the InputGrid's width.
      - role: Define the key pattern or region of interest.
  - object: BoundingBox
    properties:
      - definition: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to any IncompleteStripe.
      - attributes: height (H), width (W).
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - color: Uniformly filled with the DominantColor C.
      - dimensions: Height = H + 2, Width = W.

transformations:
  - action: IdentifyDominantColor
    input: InputGrid
    output: DominantColor C
  - action: FindStripes
    input: InputGrid, DominantColor C
    output: List of all horizontal segments of color C (with row, start_col, end_col).
  - action: FilterIncompleteStripes
    input: List of stripes, InputGrid width
    output: List of IncompleteStripes.
  - action: CalculateBoundingBox
    input: List of IncompleteStripes
    output: BoundingBox properties (H, W).
  - action: DetermineOutputDimensions
    input: BoundingBox properties (H, W)
    output: OutputGrid dimensions (OutputH = H + 2, OutputW = W).
  - action: CreateOutputGrid
    input: OutputGrid dimensions, DominantColor C
    output: OutputGrid.

relationships:
  - The OutputGrid's color is determined by the DominantColor of the InputGrid.
  - The OutputGrid's width (OutputW) is identical to the width (W) of the BoundingBox of IncompleteStripes.
  - The OutputGrid's height (OutputH) is derived from the height (H) of the BoundingBox by adding 2 (OutputH = H + 2).
