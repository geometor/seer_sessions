1.  Identify the locations of the two red (2) pixels and the one yellow (4) pixel in the input grid.
2.  Check if the two red pixels are horizontally aligned (i.e., they share the same row index).
3.  If the red pixels are horizontally aligned: Keep the red pixels and change the yellow pixel to white (0).
4.  If the red pixels are not horizontally aligned (they are in different rows): Keep the yellow pixel and change the red pixels to white (0).
5.  Return the modified grid.
