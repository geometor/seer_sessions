Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 10x10 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), red (2), and yellow (4).
3.  **Objects:** The colored elements are individual pixels (1x1 objects).
4.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid contains exactly two red pixels and one yellow pixel, scattered on a white background.
5.  **Output Composition:** Each output grid contains *either* the two red pixels *or* the one yellow pixel from the input, with the other color removed (changed to white). The positions of the kept pixels remain unchanged.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting which color (red or yellow) to keep based on some condition, and removing the pixels of the other color.

**Key Observation & Hypothesis:**

The decision of whether to keep red or yellow seems to depend on the relative arrangement of the *red* pixels (the color that appears more frequently in the input).

*   In `train_1` and `train_4`, the two red pixels are aligned horizontally (share the same row). In these cases, the red pixels are kept, and the yellow pixel is removed.
*   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the two red pixels are *not* aligned either horizontally or vertically. In these cases, the yellow pixel is kept, and the red pixels are removed.

This suggests a rule based on the alignment of the most frequent color.

transformation_summary:
  The transformation identifies the most frequent color (red) and checks if its pixels are aligned horizontally or vertically.
  If aligned, keep the red pixels and remove the yellow pixel.
  If not aligned, keep the yellow pixel and remove the red pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and group them by color (red and yellow).
2.  Count the number of pixels for each color. Determine the color with the highest count (Majority Color - which is red in all examples) and the color with the lowest count (Minority Color - which is yellow in all examples).
3.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels belonging to the Majority Color (red).
4.  Check if all pixels of the Majority Color (red) lie in the same row *or* if they all lie in the same column.
5.  **If** the Majority Color pixels (red) are aligned (all share the same row index OR all share the same column index):
    *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    *   Change all pixels of the Minority Color (yellow) to white (0). Keep the Majority Color pixels (red) as they are.
6.  **Else** (if the Majority Color pixels are *not* aligned):
    *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    *   Change all pixels of the Majority Color (red) to white (0). Keep the Minority Color pixels (yellow) as they are.
7.  Output the resulting grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code successfully predicted the output for examples 1, 3, and 4, but failed on example 2. The original hypothesis was that if the two red pixels (majority color) were aligned either horizontally *or* vertically, the red pixels would be kept. However, in example 2, the red pixels *are* vertically aligned (both in column 1), but the expected output keeps the yellow pixel and removes the red ones.

This discrepancy suggests the alignment rule needs refinement. Comparing the successful cases (1 and 4) with the failed case (2), we observe:
*   Examples 1 and 4: Red pixels are *horizontally* aligned (same row). Result: Keep Red.
*   Example 2: Red pixels are *vertically* aligned (same column). Result: Keep Yellow.
*   Example 3: Red pixels are neither horizontally nor vertically aligned. Result: Keep Yellow.

This leads to a revised hypothesis: **Keep the red pixels if and only if they are horizontally aligned (share the same row). Otherwise, keep the yellow pixel.**

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the locations and row/column alignment of the red pixels in each example.
2.  Confirm if the "horizontal alignment only" rule correctly predicts the outcome for all four examples.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect this refined rule.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the coordinates and alignment for each example.

transformation_summary:
  The transformation identifies the positions of the two red pixels and the one yellow pixel.
  It checks if the two red pixels lie in the same row.
  If the red pixels are in the same row, the output keeps the red pixels and removes the yellow pixel (changes it to white).
  If the red pixels are in different rows, the output keeps the yellow pixel and removes the red pixels (changes them to white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all red (2) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `red_coords`.
3.  Find the coordinates of all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `yellow_coords`.
4.  Check if the row indices of all coordinates in `red_coords` are the same.
5.  **If** the row indices are the same (the red pixels are horizontally aligned):
    *   Locate the yellow pixel(s) in the `output_grid` using `yellow_coords`.
    *   Change the color of these yellow pixel(s) to white (0).
6.  **Else** (the row indices are different; the red pixels are not horizontally aligned):
    *   Locate the red pixels in the `output_grid` using `red_coords`.
    *   Change the color of these red pixels to white (0).
7.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
