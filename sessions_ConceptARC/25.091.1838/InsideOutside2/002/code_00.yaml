task_context:
  grid_size: fixed (10x10 for all examples)
  colors_present:
    - white (0): background
    - red (2)
    - yellow (4)
  input_pattern: Contains exactly 2 red pixels and 1 yellow pixel.
  output_pattern: Contains either the 2 red pixels or the 1 yellow pixel from the input; the other color is removed (replaced by white).

objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    count_in_input: 2
    properties:
      - position (row, col)
  - type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    count_in_input: 1
    properties:
      - position (row, col)

relationships_and_conditions:
  - type: count_comparison # This seems consistent but less crucial than alignment for the core logic
    color_1: red
    color_2: yellow
    result: count(red) > count(yellow)
  - type: spatial_alignment_check
    description: Check horizontal alignment of the red pixels.
    condition: Do the two red pixels share the same row index?
    values: # Based on code execution results
      - train_1: Yes (Row 2) -> Keep Red
      - train_2: No (Rows 2 & 8) -> Keep Yellow
      - train_3: No (Rows 0 & 4) -> Keep Yellow
      - train_4: Yes (Row 0) -> Keep Red

actions:
  - name: select_color_to_keep
    based_on: horizontal alignment of the red pixels
    rule:
      - if red pixels are horizontally aligned (share the same row): keep red
      - if red pixels are not horizontally aligned: keep yellow
  - name: remove_other_color
    description: Change pixels of the non-selected color to white (0).
    target: pixels of the color not selected in the previous step.

transformation_summary:
  The transformation identifies the positions of the two red pixels and the one yellow pixel.
  It checks if the two red pixels lie in the same row.
  If the red pixels are in the same row, the output keeps the red pixels and removes the yellow pixel (changes it to white).
  If the red pixels are in different rows, the output keeps the yellow pixel and removes the red pixels (changes them to white).
