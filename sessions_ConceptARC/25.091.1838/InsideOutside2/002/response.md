**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code successfully predicted the output for examples 1, 3, and 4, but failed on example 2. The original hypothesis was that if the two red pixels (majority color) were aligned either horizontally *or* vertically, the red pixels would be kept. However, in example 2, the red pixels *are* vertically aligned (both in column 1), but the expected output keeps the yellow pixel and removes the red ones.

This discrepancy suggests the alignment rule needs refinement. Comparing the successful cases (1 and 4) with the failed case (2), we observe:
*   Examples 1 and 4: Red pixels are *horizontally* aligned (same row). Result: Keep Red.
*   Example 2: Red pixels are *vertically* aligned (same column). Result: Keep Yellow.
*   Example 3: Red pixels are neither horizontally nor vertically aligned. Result: Keep Yellow.

This leads to a revised hypothesis: **Keep the red pixels if and only if they are horizontally aligned (share the same row). Otherwise, keep the yellow pixel.**

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the locations and row/column alignment of the red pixels in each example.
2.  Confirm if the "horizontal alignment only" rule correctly predicts the outcome for all four examples.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect this refined rule.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the coordinates and alignment for each example.

transformation_summary:
  The transformation identifies the positions of the two red pixels and the one yellow pixel.
  It checks if the two red pixels lie in the same row.
  If the red pixels are in the same row, the output keeps the red pixels and removes the yellow pixel (changes it to white).
  If the red pixels are in different rows, the output keeps the yellow pixel and removes the red pixels (changes them to white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all red (2) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `red_coords`.
3.  Find the coordinates of all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Let these be `yellow_coords`.
4.  Check if the row indices of all coordinates in `red_coords` are the same.
5.  **If** the row indices are the same (the red pixels are horizontally aligned):
    *   Locate the yellow pixel(s) in the `output_grid` using `yellow_coords`.
    *   Change the color of these yellow pixel(s) to white (0).
6.  **Else** (the row indices are different; the red pixels are not horizontally aligned):
    *   Locate the red pixels in the `output_grid` using `red_coords`.
    *   Change the color of these red pixels to white (0).
7.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
