The positions of the kept pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting which color (red or yellow) to keep based on some condition, and removing the pixels of the other color.\n\n**Key Observation & Hypothesis:**\n\nThe decision of whether to keep red or yellow seems to depend on the relative arrangement of the *red* pixels (the color that appears more frequently in the input).\n\n*   In `train_1` and `train_4`, the two red pixels are aligned horizontally (share the same row). In these cases, the red pixels are kept, and the yellow pixel is removed.\n*   In `train_2` and `train_3`, the two red pixels are *not* aligned either horizontally or vertically. In these cases, the yellow pixel is kept, and the red pixels are removed.\n\nThis suggests a rule based on the alignment of the most frequent color.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
