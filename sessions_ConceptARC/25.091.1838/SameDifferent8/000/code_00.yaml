task_structure:
  - description: Input grid is split into two subgrids by a separator line.
    separator:
      type: line (row or column)
      color: white (0)
      thickness: 1 pixel
    subgrids:
      count: 2
      location: Determined by separator orientation (top/bottom or left/right)
      naming: [Subgrid_A (top/left), Subgrid_B (bottom/right)]

subgrid_properties:
  - description: Each subgrid contains objects/colors.
    elements:
      - background_color: The most frequent non-white color in the subgrid.
      - inner_pattern:
          description: A shape formed by a single color different from the background and white.
          color_property: In examples, the inner pattern color is the same in both Subgrid_A and Subgrid_B. Let this be 'inner_color'.
          shape_property: The geometric arrangement of 'inner_color' pixels relative to each other.

comparison_logic:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the 'inner_color' common to both subgrids.
  - step: 2
    action: Extract the shape formed by 'inner_color' in Subgrid_A (Shape_A) and Subgrid_B (Shape_B).
  - step: 3
    action: Compare Shape_A and Shape_B for identity (identical relative pixel arrangement).

output_rules:
  - condition: Shape_A is identical to Shape_B.
    result: Generate output pattern based on Shape_A.
      - source: Subgrid_A
      - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle containing Shape_A.
      - content:
          - Keep 'inner_color' pixels from Shape_A.
          - Replace Subgrid_A's background_color pixels within the bounding box with white (0).
  - condition: Shape_A is different from Shape_B.
    sub_condition: Check if Shape_B is a solid, filled rectangle.
    results:
      - if_true: Output is a 1x1 grid containing white (0).
      - if_false: Generate output pattern based on Shape_B.
          - source: Subgrid_B
          - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle containing Shape_B.
          - content:
              - Keep 'inner_color' pixels from Shape_B.
              - Replace Subgrid_B's background_color pixels within the bounding box with white (0).
