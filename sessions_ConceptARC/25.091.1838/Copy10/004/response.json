            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully identified and removed the \"orphan\" object(s) but failed to place the copy of the \"container\" structure in the correct location. The core issue likely lies in the identification of the container/orphan or the calculation/execution of the placement step.\n\nThe previous logic used \"color groups\" and their combined bounding boxes to determine enclosure. This was flawed, as seen in Example 1 where the combined bounding box of the red objects was not enclosed by the green object's bounding box, even though one red object was clearly inside the green frame.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object-Centric Identification:** Focus on individual objects rather than color groups.\n2.  **Container Definition:** The \"container\" is the single object whose bounding box strictly encloses the bounding boxes of the most *other individual objects*.\n3.  **Contained Definition:** \"Contained\" objects are those whose bounding boxes are strictly enclosed within the container's bounding box.\n4.  **Orphan Definition:** \"Orphan\" objects are all objects that are neither the container nor contained.\n5.  **Placement Logic:** Calculate the target top-left coordinates for the copy based on the bounding box of the container and the bounding box of the *primary* orphan object (assuming the first identified orphan dictates placement, as the examples only show one type of orphan). Maintain the 2-pixel gap rule relative to the orphan's position (copy is placed 2 pixels *away* from the orphan's edge, towards the container's original side).\n6.  **Transformation Steps:**\n    *   Copy the input grid to create the output grid.\n    *   Remove *all* identified orphan objects from the output grid by setting their pixels to white (0).\n    *   Extract the rectangular pattern defined by the container's bounding box from the *original input grid*.\n    *   Paste this pattern onto the output grid at the calculated target coordinates, handling boundary clipping.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"

            "text": "**Analysis Results Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The analysis correctly identifies the Green frame (id 0) as the container, enclosing the inner Red square (id 1). The outer Red square (id 2) is correctly identified as the orphan. The placement direction is 'right', and the target coordinate (2, 12) matches the visual output.\n*   **Example 2:** The analysis identifies the central Blue plus sign (id 4) as the container *because it's the largest object by area* (the fallback when no strict enclosure is found). It finds *zero* contained objects and *13* orphan objects (all the Yellow diamond pixels plus the lower Blue plus sign). This is **incorrect** based on the visual structure. The Yellow diamond *is* the container, enclosing the upper Blue plus. The lower Blue plus is the orphan. The definition of \"container\" needs refinement again. Strict geometrical enclosure `(is_strictly_enclosed)` seems too rigid for shapes that touch the container boundary internally.\n\n**Further Refinement:**\n\nLet's reconsider the container definition and enclosure:\n\n1.  **Enclosure:** Instead of strict enclosure (`> min`, `< max`), maybe allow edges to touch (`>= min`, `<= max`), but the inner object must still be fully within the outer object's bounding box. Let's call this `is_inclusively_enclosed`.\n2.  **Container Definition:** The container might not be the object enclosing the *most* others, but rather the object that *forms a distinct structure* with enclosed objects, contrasted with a similar structure elsewhere. In both examples, the container + contained elements form a recognizable pattern that is replicated. The orphan is a similar shape/color to one of the *contained* elements.\n\n**Revised Strategy 2.0:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all individual objects (color, coords, bbox).\n2.  **Identify Potential Pairs:** Look for pairs of objects (ObjA, ObjB) where ObjA's bbox inclusively encloses ObjB's bbox (`is_inclusively_enclosed`).\n3.  **Identify Container/Contained:** Group potential pairs. If multiple objects are enclosed, the enclosing object is likely the Container (`C`). The enclosed objects are Contained (`I`). If only one pair exists, the enclosing object is `C`, the enclosed is `I`. Handle ambiguity (e.g., multiple potential containers) perhaps by size or complexity. *In these examples, the container seems to be the object whose bbox encloses at least one object of a *different* color.*\n4.  **Identify Orphans:** Find objects (`O`) that are neither `C` nor `I`. Look specifically for an orphan (`O_p`) that has the same color and potentially similar shape/size characteristics as one of the *contained* objects (`I`). This `O_p` dictates placement.\n5.  **Transformation:** Copy input `G_in` to output `G_out`. Remove *all* orphan objects (`O`) from `G_out`. Extract pattern `P` from `G_in` using `C`'s bbox. Calculate placement `(tr, tc)` based on `C` and `O_p` (2-pixel gap). Paste `P` onto `G_out`.\n\nLet's re-run the analysis mentally with this approach:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Green (bbox: 2,2,9,9) inclusively encloses Red1 (bbox: 4,4,7,7). Red2 (bbox: 4,14,7,17) is not enclosed. Container=Green, Contained=Red1, Orphan=Red2. Orphan Red2 has the same color as Contained Red1. Placement based on Red2 (right) -> (2, 12). Matches.\n*   **Example 2:** Yellow (bbox: 1,1,7,5) inclusively encloses Blue1 (bbox: 3,2,5,4). Blue2 (bbox: 11,2,13,4) is not enclosed. Container=Yellow, Contained=Blue1, Orphan=Blue2. Orphan Blue2 has the same color as Contained Blue1. Placement based on Blue2 (below) -> (9, 1). Matches.\n\nThis revised logic seems to fit both examples correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts Block (Based on Revised Strategy 2.0)**\n\n"

Based on whether the primary orphan is below or to the right of the container, calculate the target row/column to be 2 pixels away from the orphan's corresponding edge (top edge if orphan is below, left edge if orphan is right), while aligning the other coordinate with the container's original top-left position.\n7.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n8.  Remove *all* orphan objects from the output grid by setting their pixels to white (0).\n9.  Extract the rectangular pattern defined by the container's bounding box from the *original input grid*. This pattern includes the container and all contained objects within that box.\n10. Paste the extracted pattern onto the output grid starting at the calculated target top-left corner, overwriting existing pixels. Handle cases where the pattern might go partially off-grid by clipping.\n11. The resulting grid is the final output."
