"""
Transforms an input grid based on identifying container, contained, and orphan object groups.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying all distinct objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels).
2. Grouping objects by color and determining the combined bounding box for each group.
3. Identifying the 'container group' as the color group whose combined bounding box inclusively encloses the combined bounding box of at least one other color group.
4. Identifying 'contained objects' as individual objects of different colors whose bounding boxes are inclusively enclosed within the container group's bounding box. (Implicitly done by finding enclosed groups).
5. Identifying the 'orphan group' as the color group that is neither the container nor belongs to a group enclosed by the container.
6. Calculating a target location for copying the container structure (the area defined by the container group's bounding box, including contained objects). This location is determined by the relative position of the orphan group's bounding box, leaving a 2-pixel gap between the orphan's original edge and the copy's corresponding edge.
7. Creating an output grid by copying the input grid.
8. Removing all objects belonging to the orphan group from the output grid.
9. Extracting the rectangular region corresponding to the container group's bounding box from the original input grid.
10. Pasting this extracted region onto the output grid at the calculated target location, overwriting existing pixels.
