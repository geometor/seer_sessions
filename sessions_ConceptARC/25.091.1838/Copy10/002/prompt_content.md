"""
This module transforms an input grid based on identifying container, contained, and orphan objects.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying all distinct objects (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) and their bounding boxes.
2. Finding the 'container' object, defined as the object whose bounding box encloses the most other objects.
3. Identifying 'contained' objects lying fully within the container's bounding box.
4. Identifying 'orphan' objects, which are neither the container nor contained. (Assuming one primary orphan determines placement).
5. Calculating a target location for a copy of the container and its contents. This location is determined by the position of the primary orphan object, placing the copy's edge 2 pixels away from the orphan's corresponding edge, towards the original container.
6. Creating an output grid by copying the input grid.
7. Removing the orphan object from the output grid (setting its pixels to white).
8. Extracting the rectangular region defined by the container's bounding box from the original input grid.
9. Pasting this extracted region onto the output grid at the calculated target location, overwriting existing pixels.
