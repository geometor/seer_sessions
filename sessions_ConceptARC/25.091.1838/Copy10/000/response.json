            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) composed of colored pixels against a white background.\n2.  **Object Relationships:** In both examples, there's a primary larger object (\"container\") that encloses one or more smaller objects within its spatial boundary (bounding box). There is also at least one other object (\"orphan\") located elsewhere in the grid, separate from the container and its contents.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the container and its enclosed objects, identifying the separate orphan object, removing the orphan object, and then creating a duplicate of the container and its contents.\n4.  **Placement of Copy:** The duplicated container+contents structure is placed in the grid in a location determined by the original position of the orphan object. Specifically, the copy seems to be positioned such that its bounding box edge (the one facing the original container) is 2 pixels away from the corresponding edge of the *original* orphan object's bounding box.\n5.  **Overwriting:** The copied structure overwrites any pixels previously occupying that space, including the area where the orphan object was removed. The original container and its contents remain unchanged in their initial position.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
