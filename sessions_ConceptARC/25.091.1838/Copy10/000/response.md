Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) composed of colored pixels against a white background.
2.  **Object Relationships:** In both examples, there's a primary larger object ("container") that encloses one or more smaller objects within its spatial boundary (bounding box). There is also at least one other object ("orphan") located elsewhere in the grid, separate from the container and its contents.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the container and its enclosed objects, identifying the separate orphan object, removing the orphan object, and then creating a duplicate of the container and its contents.
4.  **Placement of Copy:** The duplicated container+contents structure is placed in the grid in a location determined by the original position of the orphan object. Specifically, the copy seems to be positioned such that its bounding box edge (the one facing the original container) is 2 pixels away from the corresponding edge of the *original* orphan object's bounding box.
5.  **Overwriting:** The copied structure overwrites any pixels previously occupying that space, including the area where the orphan object was removed. The original container and its contents remain unchanged in their initial position.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Copy a 'container' object and its 'contained' objects to a new location determined by an 'orphan' object, replacing the orphan object.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of non-white pixels.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - container: An object whose bounding box fully encloses the bounding box(es) of one or more other objects. (In these examples, it's the object enclosing the most others).
  - contained_object: An object whose bounding box is fully within the bounding box of the container.
  - orphan_object: An object that is neither the container nor a contained object. (Assume one primary orphan determines placement).

steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct objects (contiguous non-white pixels) and their bounding boxes in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: identify_container
    description: Determine which object is the container by finding the object whose bounding box encloses the most other objects' bounding boxes.
  - step: 3
    action: identify_contained
    description: Identify all objects whose bounding boxes are fully within the container's bounding box.
  - step: 4
    action: identify_orphan
    description: Identify the object(s) that are neither the container nor contained. Assume a single primary orphan dictates placement.
  - step: 5
    action: calculate_copy_location
    inputs:
      - container_bounding_box
      - orphan_bounding_box
    description: >
      Determine the top-left coordinates (target_row, target_col) for placing the copy of the container.
      Find the axis of greatest separation between the container and orphan bounding boxes.
      If horizontal separation (orphan is right of container):
        target_row = container.top
        target_col = orphan.left - 2
      If vertical separation (orphan is below container):
        target_row = orphan.top - 2
        target_col = container.left
      (Adjust logic if orphan is left/above container, though not seen in examples).
  - step: 6
    action: prepare_output_grid
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - orphan_object
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Set all pixels belonging to the orphan object to white (0).
  - step: 7
    action: extract_pattern_to_copy
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - container_bounding_box
    description: Extract the subgrid defined by the container's bounding box from the original input grid (this includes the container and all contained objects).
  - step: 8
    action: place_copy
    inputs:
      - output_grid
      - pattern_to_copy
      - target_location (target_row, target_col)
    description: Paste the extracted subgrid (pattern_to_copy) onto the output grid starting at the calculated target location, overwriting existing pixels.

final_output: The modified output grid after removing the orphan and placing the copy.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all separate objects (groups of connected, non-white pixels) and determine their bounding boxes.
2.  Identify the "container" object, defined as the object whose bounding box encloses the highest number of other objects.
3.  Identify all "contained" objects, whose bounding boxes lie entirely inside the container's bounding box.
4.  Identify the "orphan" object(s), which are neither the container nor contained within it. (Assume there's one primary orphan used for positioning).
5.  Determine the placement coordinates for a copy of the container. Find the orphan's bounding box. Calculate the target top-left corner for the container copy by finding the main axis separating the container and the orphan, and positioning the copy's corresponding edge 2 pixels away from the orphan's corresponding edge, towards the original container's side. Maintain the other coordinate (row or column) from the original container's top-left position.
6.  Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.
7.  Remove the orphan object from the output grid by changing its pixels to white (0).
8.  Copy the rectangular region defined by the container's bounding box from the *original input grid* (this includes the container and all its contained objects).
9.  Paste this copied region onto the output grid at the calculated placement coordinates, overwriting any existing pixels.
10. The resulting grid is the final output.
