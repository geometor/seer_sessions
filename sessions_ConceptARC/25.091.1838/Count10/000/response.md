Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a 2D grid containing white pixels (0) and one or more contiguous objects made of a single non-white color. In the examples provided, the non-white colors are green (3), red (2), and yellow (4).
2.  **Output Structure:** Each output is a 1D grid (a single row) composed entirely of white pixels (0).
3.  **Transformation Observation:** The key transformation seems to relate the *color* of the objects in the input grid to the *width* of the output grid. The shapes, sizes, number, and positions of the non-white objects within the input grid do not appear to influence the output grid's content (which is always white) or its height (which is always 1).
4.  **Rule Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, the input color is green (3), and the output width is 4.
    *   In `train_2`, the input color is red (2), and the output width is 3.
    *   In `train_3`, the input color is yellow (4), and the output width is 5.
    *   This suggests a consistent relationship: the width of the output grid is equal to the numerical value of the non-white color in the input grid plus one (`output_width = color_value + 1`).
5.  **Output Content:** The content of the output grid is always white pixels (0), regardless of the input.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Transforms an input grid containing objects of a single non-white color into a single row of white pixels, where the row's width is determined by the input color's numerical value.

examples:
  - example_index: train_1
    input_grid_description: 8x8 grid with a single green (3) object surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 3 (green)
      - number_of_objects: 1
    output_grid_description: 1x4 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 4
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (4) = input_color_value (3) + 1

  - example_index: train_2
    input_grid_description: 5x8 grid with a single red (2) object surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 2 (red)
      - number_of_objects: 1
    output_grid_description: 1x3 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (3) = input_color_value (2) + 1

  - example_index: train_3
    input_grid_description: 10x11 grid with four yellow (4) objects surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 4 (yellow)
      - number_of_objects: 4
    output_grid_description: 1x5 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 5
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (5) = input_color_value (4) + 1

derived_rule:
  input: A grid containing at least one pixel of a non-white color (value C > 0). All non-white pixels share the same color value C.
  output: A grid with height 1 and width C + 1, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid to find any pixel with a color value greater than 0 (non-white).
2.  Identify the numerical value (`C`) of this non-white color. (Assume there's only one non-white color present in the entire grid, even if there are multiple objects).
3.  Calculate the required width for the output grid by adding 1 to the identified color value (`width = C + 1`).
4.  Create a new grid with 1 row and the calculated `width` columns.
5.  Fill all cells of this new grid with the white color (0).
6.  Return the new grid as the output.
