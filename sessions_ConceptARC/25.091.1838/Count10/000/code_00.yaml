task_description: Transforms an input grid containing objects of a single non-white color into a single row of white pixels, where the row's width is determined by the input color's numerical value.

examples:
  - example_index: train_1
    input_grid_description: 8x8 grid with a single green (3) object surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 3 (green)
      - number_of_objects: 1
    output_grid_description: 1x4 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 4
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (4) = input_color_value (3) + 1

  - example_index: train_2
    input_grid_description: 5x8 grid with a single red (2) object surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 2 (red)
      - number_of_objects: 1
    output_grid_description: 1x3 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (3) = input_color_value (2) + 1

  - example_index: train_3
    input_grid_description: 10x11 grid with four yellow (4) objects surrounded by white (0).
    input_properties:
      - non_white_color: 4 (yellow)
      - number_of_objects: 4
    output_grid_description: 1x5 grid of white (0) pixels.
    output_properties:
      - width: 5
      - height: 1
      - content: all white (0)
    relationship: output_width (5) = input_color_value (4) + 1

derived_rule:
  input: A grid containing at least one pixel of a non-white color (value C > 0). All non-white pixels share the same color value C.
  output: A grid with height 1 and width C + 1, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
