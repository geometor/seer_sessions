            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a 2D grid containing white pixels (0) and one or more contiguous objects made of a single non-white color. In the examples provided, the non-white colors are green (3), red (2), and yellow (4).\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output is a 1D grid (a single row) composed entirely of white pixels (0).\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** The key transformation seems to relate the *color* of the objects in the input grid to the *width* of the output grid. The shapes, sizes, number, and positions of the non-white objects within the input grid do not appear to influence the output grid's content (which is always white) or its height (which is always 1).\n4.  **Rule Identification:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the input color is green (3), and the output width is 4.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input color is red (2), and the output width is 3.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input color is yellow (4), and the output width is 5.\n    *   This suggests a consistent relationship: the width of the output grid is equal to the numerical value of the non-white color in the input grid plus one (`output_width = color_value + 1`).\n5.  **Output Content:** The content of the output grid is always white pixels (0), regardless of the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
