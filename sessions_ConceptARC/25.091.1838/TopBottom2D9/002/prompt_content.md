Identifies the object containing the uppermost, leftmost non-white pixel in the input grid and changes the color of all pixels belonging to that object to gray (5). All other pixels remain unchanged. An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color, where contiguity includes diagonal adjacency.
