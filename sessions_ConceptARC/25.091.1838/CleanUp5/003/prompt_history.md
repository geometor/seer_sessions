Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background) and one or more non-white colors (red=2, green=3 in example 1; yellow=4 in example 2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* non-white pixels to white (0). White pixels always remain white. Non-white pixels are either kept as they are or changed to white.
4.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or objects. These objects can be single, isolated pixels or larger contiguous groups.
5.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the input and output grids, it appears that non-white pixels which are "isolated" (i.e., have no neighbors of the same color immediately adjacent horizontally or vertically) are removed (turned white). Pixels that are part of a larger contiguous block (size > 1) of the same color are preserved.

**Facts (YAML):**

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis identified a potential rule: "remove non-white pixels that are isolated (no neighbors of the same color, including diagonals)". The provided code implemented this rule.
The test results showed this rule worked correctly for `train_2` but failed for `train_1`.
The failure report for `train_1` indicated 2 pixels were incorrect, although the displayed "Transformed Output" in the report seemed to match the *expected* output, not the output predicted by the 8-neighbor isolation rule. This created some confusion.

Re-evaluating `train_1` revealed that *all* pixels of the Green color (3) were removed, while all Red pixels (2) were kept. In `train_2`, only *some* Yellow pixels (4) were removed - specifically those isolated via the 8-neighbor rule.

This suggests a conditional rule based on the number of distinct non-white colors:
1.  **Multiple non-white colors:** Identify the least frequent non-white color and remove *all* pixels of that color.
2.  **Single non-white color:** Remove only those pixels of that color which are isolated (no 8-way neighbors of the same color).

This revised hypothesis correctly explains both training examples.

## Metrics

Let's confirm the color counts and isolation status for each example based on the revised hypothesis.

--- Example 1 Analysis ---
Number of distinct non-white colors: 2
Color counts: {np.int64(2): np.int64(19), np.int64(3): np.int64(9)}
Least frequent color: 3
Pixels to remove (Coords): [(np.int64(0), np.int64(11)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(9)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(20)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(12)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(18)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(15)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(6))]

--- Example 2 Analysis ---
Number of distinct non-white colors: 1
Color counts: {np.int64(4): np.int64(30)}
Isolated Pixels (Coords): [(0, 0), (0, 18), (0, 23), (1, 6), (1, 13), (5, 15)]
Pixels to remove (Coords): [(0, 0), (0, 18), (0, 23), (1, 6), (1, 13), (5, 15)]

```
The metrics confirm the conditional hypothesis:
*   Example 1 has Red (19) and Green (9). Green (3) is least frequent. All 9 Green pixels should be removed.
*   Example 2 has only Yellow (30). The 6 isolated Yellow pixels should be removed.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Processes input grids based on the number and frequency of non-white colors.
grid_properties:
  - Grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.
  - Pixels are represented by integers 0-9 (colors).
  - White (0) pixels always remain white.
objects:
  - type: colored_pixel
    properties:
      - color (non-zero integer)
      - location (row, column)
      - neighbors (8 adjacent cells: Moore neighborhood)
      - is_isolated (boolean: true if no neighbor has the same color)
  - type: color_group
    properties:
      - color (non-zero integer)
      - pixels (list of locations of pixels with this color)
      - count (number of pixels in the group)
transformation_logic:
  - conditional_rule:
      condition: Number of distinct non-white colors in the input grid.
      cases:
        - case: count > 1
          actions:
            - Identify the non-white color with the minimum count ('target_color').
            - Change all pixels with 'target_color' to white (0).
            - Keep all other pixels unchanged.
        - case: count == 1
          actions:
            - Identify the single non-white color ('the_color').
            - For each pixel with 'the_color':
                - Check its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood) in the input grid.
                - If no neighbor has 'the_color', change the pixel to white (0) in the output.
                - Otherwise, keep the pixel's color unchanged.
        - case: count == 0 (all white input)
          actions:
            - Output grid is identical to the input grid. # Implicitly handled
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all distinct non-white colors present. Count the number of distinct non-white colors.
2.  **If there is more than one distinct non-white color:**
    a.  Count the total number of pixels for each distinct non-white color.
    b.  Determine which non-white color has the smallest count. This is the 'target color'. (If there's a tie for the minimum count, the examples don't specify how to resolve it, but the first example implies one is chosen - assume the color value itself could break ties if necessary, though not explicitly shown).
    c.  Create the output grid by changing every pixel that has the 'target color' in the input grid to white (0). All other pixels (other non-white colors and the original white pixels) retain their original color from the input grid.
3.  **If there is exactly one distinct non-white color:**
    a.  Let 'the_color' be the single non-white color present.
    b.  Create the output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.
    c.  Examine each pixel in the input grid that has 'the_color'.
    d.  For such a pixel, check its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    e.  If *none* of these eight neighbors in the input grid also have 'the_color', then change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
    f.  If the pixel *does* have at least one neighbor with 'the_color', it remains unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **If there are no non-white colors** (the input grid is entirely white), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
