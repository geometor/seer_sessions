## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis identified a potential rule: "remove non-white pixels that are isolated (no neighbors of the same color, including diagonals)". The provided code implemented this rule.
The test results showed this rule worked correctly for `train_2` but failed for `train_1`.
The failure report for `train_1` indicated 2 pixels were incorrect, although the displayed "Transformed Output" in the report seemed to match the *expected* output, not the output predicted by the 8-neighbor isolation rule. This created some confusion.

Re-evaluating `train_1` revealed that *all* pixels of the Green color (3) were removed, while all Red pixels (2) were kept. In `train_2`, only *some* Yellow pixels (4) were removed - specifically those isolated via the 8-neighbor rule.

This suggests a conditional rule based on the number of distinct non-white colors:
1.  **Multiple non-white colors:** Identify the least frequent non-white color and remove *all* pixels of that color.
2.  **Single non-white color:** Remove only those pixels of that color which are isolated (no 8-way neighbors of the same color).

This revised hypothesis correctly explains both training examples.

## Metrics

Let's confirm the color counts and isolation status for each example based on the revised hypothesis.

--- Example 1 Analysis ---
Number of distinct non-white colors: 2
Color counts: {np.int64(2): np.int64(19), np.int64(3): np.int64(9)}
Least frequent color: 3
Pixels to remove (Coords): [(np.int64(0), np.int64(11)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(9)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(20)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(12)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(18)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(15)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(6))]

--- Example 2 Analysis ---
Number of distinct non-white colors: 1
Color counts: {np.int64(4): np.int64(30)}
Isolated Pixels (Coords): [(0, 0), (0, 18), (0, 23), (1, 6), (1, 13), (5, 15)]
Pixels to remove (Coords): [(0, 0), (0, 18), (0, 23), (1, 6), (1, 13), (5, 15)]

```
The metrics confirm the conditional hypothesis:
*   Example 1 has Red (19) and Green (9). Green (3) is least frequent. All 9 Green pixels should be removed.
*   Example 2 has only Yellow (30). The 6 isolated Yellow pixels should be removed.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all distinct non-white colors present. Count the number of distinct non-white colors.
2.  **If there is more than one distinct non-white color:**
    a.  Count the total number of pixels for each distinct non-white color.
    b.  Determine which non-white color has the smallest count. This is the 'target color'. (If there's a tie for the minimum count, the examples don't specify how to resolve it, but the first example implies one is chosen - assume the color value itself could break ties if necessary, though not explicitly shown).
    c.  Create the output grid by changing every pixel that has the 'target color' in the input grid to white (0). All other pixels (other non-white colors and the original white pixels) retain their original color from the input grid.
3.  **If there is exactly one distinct non-white color:**
    a.  Let 'the_color' be the single non-white color present.
    b.  Create the output grid initially as a copy of the input grid.
    c.  Examine each pixel in the input grid that has 'the_color'.
    d.  For such a pixel, check its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    e.  If *none* of these eight neighbors in the input grid also have 'the_color', then change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
    f.  If the pixel *does* have at least one neighbor with 'the_color', it remains unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **If there are no non-white colors** (the input grid is entirely white), the output grid is identical to the input grid.
