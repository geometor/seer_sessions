            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis identified a potential rule: \"remove non-white pixels that are isolated (no neighbors of the same color, including diagonals)\". The provided code implemented this rule.\nThe test results showed this rule worked correctly for `train_2` but failed for `train_1`.\nThe failure report for `train_1` indicated 2 pixels were incorrect, although the displayed \"Transformed Output\" in the report seemed to match the *expected* output, not the output predicted by the 8-neighbor isolation rule. This created some confusion.\n\nRe-evaluating `train_1` revealed that *all* pixels of the Green color (3) were removed, while all Red pixels (2) were kept. In `train_2`, only *some* Yellow pixels (4) were removed - specifically those isolated via the 8-neighbor rule.\n\nThis suggests a conditional rule based on the number of distinct non-white colors:\n1.  **Multiple non-white colors:** Identify the least frequent non-white color and remove *all* pixels of that color.\n2.  **Single non-white color:** Remove only those pixels of that color which are isolated (no 8-way neighbors of the same color).\n\nThis revised hypothesis correctly explains both training examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's confirm the color counts and isolation status for each example based on the revised hypothesis.\n\n"
