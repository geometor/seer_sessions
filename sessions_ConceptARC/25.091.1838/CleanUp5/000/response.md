Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background) and one or more non-white colors (red=2, green=3 in example 1; yellow=4 in example 2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* non-white pixels to white (0). White pixels always remain white. Non-white pixels are either kept as they are or changed to white.
4.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or objects. These objects can be single, isolated pixels or larger contiguous groups.
5.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the input and output grids, it appears that non-white pixels which are "isolated" (i.e., have no neighbors of the same color immediately adjacent horizontally or vertically) are removed (turned white). Pixels that are part of a larger contiguous block (size > 1) of the same color are preserved.
