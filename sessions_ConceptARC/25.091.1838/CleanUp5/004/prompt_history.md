Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0, background) and one or more non-white colors (red=2, green=3 in example 1; yellow=4 in example 2).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* non-white pixels to white (0). White pixels always remain white. Non-white pixels are either kept as they are or changed to white.
4.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or objects. These objects can be single, isolated pixels or larger contiguous groups.
5.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the input and output grids, it appears that non-white pixels which are "isolated" (i.e., have no neighbors of the same color immediately adjacent horizontally or vertically) are removed (turned white). Pixels that are part of a larger contiguous block (size > 1) of the same color are preserved.

**Facts (YAML):**


```python
"""
Identify non-white pixels in the input grid. For each non-white pixel, examine its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). If none of the neighbors have the same color as the pixel itself, change that pixel to white (0) in the output grid. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color. White (0) pixels remain white.
