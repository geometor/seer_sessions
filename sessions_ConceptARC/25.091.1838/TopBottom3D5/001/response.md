"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-white color in the input grid.
For each object, determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing it) 
and calculate the bounding box's height and width.

Count how many objects have a bounding box that is exactly 3x3 
(height=3 and width=3).

If exactly one object has a 3x3 bounding box:
    Select that object.
Else (if zero or more than one object has a 3x3 bounding box):
    Create a candidate list of objects whose bounding box height is 3 
    OR whose bounding box width is 3.
    From this candidate list, find the object whose bottom edge 
    (maximum row index of its bounding box) is lowest in the grid 
    (has the highest row index value).
    Select this bottom-most object.

Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid defined by the 
bounding box coordinates of the selected object. This subgrid is the output.
