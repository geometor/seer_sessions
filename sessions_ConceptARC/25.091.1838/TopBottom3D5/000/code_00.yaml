task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers (colors) between 0 and 9. Contains a white background (0) and multiple distinct colored objects.
  - Output Grid: A smaller 2D array, representing a subgrid extracted from the input.
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. Each object has properties like color, shape, size, position, and a bounding box.
  - Bounding Box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object. Defined by min/max row/column indices. Has height and width.

transformation_steps:
  - Step: Identify Objects
    action: Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    details: Each component is treated as a distinct object. Determine its color and pixel coordinates.
  - Step: Calculate Bounding Boxes
    action: For each identified object, calculate its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    details: Derive height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1).
  - Step: Primary Selection (3x3 Rule)
    action: Filter objects to find those with a bounding box of exactly 3x3 (height=3 and width=3).
    condition: Check if the count of such objects is exactly one.
    outcome: If true, select this unique 3x3 object.
  - Step: Fallback Selection (Height/Width=3 Rule)
    action: If the primary selection did not yield a unique object (zero or multiple 3x3 objects found), apply this rule.
    sub_steps:
      - Filter objects to find those where bounding_box_height = 3 OR bounding_box_width = 3.
      - From this filtered set, identify the object(s) with the maximum 'max_row' value (i.e., the object(s) extending furthest down).
      - Select the unique object meeting this criterion (assuming no ties based on examples).
  - Step: Extract Output
    action: Determine the bounding box coordinates of the finally selected object.
    details: Copy the rectangular region from the input grid corresponding to these bounding box coordinates.
    outcome: This extracted subgrid is the final output grid.

relationships:
  - The output grid's content and dimensions are determined by the bounding box of a single selected object from the input.
  - The selection process prioritizes objects with a 3x3 bounding box.
  - If the 3x3 rule isn't decisive, selection falls back to objects with height or width of 3, choosing the bottom-most among them.
