            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nThe task involves identifying and extracting a specific region from the input grid to form the output grid. The input grids contain multiple distinct objects (contiguous blocks of non-white color) of varying shapes, sizes, and colors, set against a white background. The output grid is always a subgrid of the input grid, containing the pixels from a specific region defined by one of the input objects.\n\nThe core of the task seems to be the selection logic for *which* object's region to extract. Through analyzing the examples, a pattern emerges related to the dimensions of the objects' bounding boxes, particularly involving the number 3.\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains several objects. The red object is a solid 3x3 square. The orange object has a bounding box of 4x3. The output is the 3x3 red square.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains several objects. The yellow object has a bounding box of 3x4. The orange object also has a bounding box of 3x4. Neither has a 3x3 bounding box. The orange object is located lower (extends further down) in the grid than the yellow one. The output corresponds to the bounding box of the orange object.\n3.  **Example 3:** The input contains several objects. The yellow, green, and red objects have 2x3 bounding boxes. The gray object has a 3x3 bounding box. The output corresponds to the bounding box of the gray object.\n\nThis suggests a primary selection criterion based on a 3x3 bounding box. If exactly one object fits this, it's selected. If not, a fallback criterion is used: find objects with a bounding box height OR width of 3, and among those, select the one that extends furthest down (bottom-most based on its maximum row index). The output is then the rectangular region defined by the selected object's bounding box, copied directly from the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
