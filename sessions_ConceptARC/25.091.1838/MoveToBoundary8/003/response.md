"""
Transforms an input grid based on identifying a large 'wall' object and smaller 'mover' objects, applying specific movement rules based on the wall's orientation and the movers' arrangement.

1.  Find all connected components (objects) of non-background colors.
2.  Identify the largest component as the 'Wall' and others as 'Movers'.
3.  Place the Wall in the output grid at its original position.
4.  Determine the Wall's orientation (Vertical: width=1, Horizontal: height=1).
5.  Determine if all Movers are co-linear (occupy the same single row).
6.  Apply movement rules:
    *   **Vertical Wall & Co-linear Movers**: Movers shift horizontally as a group. The rightmost mover pixel aligns with the column left of the wall (`Wall_Cmin - 1`).
    *   **Horizontal Wall**: Movers shift horizontally individually and stack vertically below the wall. The horizontal shift amount is constant for all movers (`Wall_Center_Col - Wall_Cmin`). Vertical stacking starts one row below the wall (`Wall_Rmax + 1`) with a one-row gap between movers. Movers maintain their original top-to-bottom order.
    *   **Other Cases (e.g., Vertical Wall & Scattered Movers, Non-linear Wall)**: Movers remain in their original positions (based on lack of examples defining behavior).
7.  Return the transformed grid.
