Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of integer colors (0-9)
  - Background: Color 0 (white)
  - Objects: Connected components of non-background pixels

Identify Components:
  - Find all connected components (pixels of the same non-zero color adjacent horizontally or vertically).
  - Count pixels in each component.

Identify Wall and Movers:
  - Wall: The component with the largest number of pixels. It remains static.
  - Movers: All other components. They change position.

Calculate Wall Properties:
  - Bounding Box: Min/Max row and column indices (Rmin, Rmax, Cmin, Cmax).
  - Width: Cmax - Cmin + 1
  - Height: Rmax - Rmin + 1

Determine Target Column (C_target):
  - If Wall is vertical (Width == 1): C_target = Cmin - 1
  - If Wall is horizontal (Height == 1): C_target = floor((Cmin + Cmax) / 2)
  # Note: Assumes wall is strictly vertical or horizontal based on examples.

Determine Movement Strategy based on Movers' initial positions:
  - Strategy 1 (Co-linear): If all movers share the same initial row index.
  - Strategy 2 (Scattered): If movers occupy different initial rows.

Apply Movement Strategy:
  - Strategy 1 (Co-linear):
    - Find the rightmost column (max_col) occupied by any mover pixel in the shared row.
    - Calculate shift distance: shift = C_target - max_col.
    - Move all mover pixels in that row horizontally by 'shift' columns.
  - Strategy 2 (Scattered):
    - Create a list of movers, storing their original color and top row index.
    - Sort the list by the original top row index (ascending).
    - Determine starting row for stacking: Start_Row = Rmax (of Wall) + 1.
    - Initialize current row: Current_Row = Start_Row.
    - For each mover in the sorted list:
      - Place the mover's pixels in the output grid, translated so their top-left corner (or reference point) is at (Current_Row, C_target). Adjust relative positions if mover is multi-pixel. (Simpler: For single-pixel movers, place at (Current_Row, C_target)).
      - Update current row for the next mover: Current_Row = Current_Row + 2 (to leave one empty row).

Construct Output Grid:
  - Start with a background grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Place the Wall pixels at their original positions.
  - Place the Mover pixels at their calculated final positions.
