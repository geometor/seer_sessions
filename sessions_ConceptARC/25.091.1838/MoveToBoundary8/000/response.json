            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves identifying different colored objects within a grid and moving some of them based on the position and shape of the largest object.\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: In both examples, the input grid contains multiple non-background objects (pixels or groups of pixels). One object is significantly larger (in terms of pixel count) than the others.\n2.  **Static vs. Mobile Objects**: The largest object remains stationary in the output grid (it acts as a \"wall\" or \"anchor\"). The smaller objects (\"movers\") change their positions.\n3.  **Movement Pattern**: The movers shift horizontally towards a specific target column determined by the wall.\n4.  **Wall Type & Target Column**:\n    *   If the wall is a vertical line (like the green line in train_1), the target column is the column immediately to the left of the wall.\n    *   If the wall is a horizontal line (like the red line in train_2), the target column is the horizontal midpoint (center column, rounded down) of the wall.\n5.  **Mover Arrangement & Final Placement**:\n    *   **Co-linear Movers (train_1)**: If all movers initially lie on the same row, they are treated as a single pattern. This pattern is shifted horizontally so that its rightmost pixel lands in the target column. The original row and relative horizontal spacing are maintained.\n    *   **Scattered Movers (train_2)**: If movers are scattered across different rows and columns, they are moved individually to the target column. Their final vertical positions are determined by stacking them vertically within the target column, starting one row below the lowest extent of the wall. The original top-to-bottom order of the movers is preserved, and one empty row is left between each stacked mover.\n6.  **Color Preservation**: Movers retain their original colors. The wall retains its original color and position. Background pixels remain background unless replaced by a moved object.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Find all distinct connected components of non-background colors in the input grid.\n3.  Identify the component with the maximum number of pixels; this is the \"Wall\". Copy the Wall pixels to their original positions in the output grid.\n4.  Identify all other components; these are the \"Movers\". Collect their original pixel coordinates and colors.\n5.  Calculate the bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column) of the Wall.\n6.  Determine the target column (`C_target`) for the Movers:\n    *   If the Wall's width is 1 (vertical line), set `C_target` to the Wall's column minus 1.\n    *   If the Wall's height is 1 (horizontal line), set `C_target` to the floor of the average of the Wall's minimum and maximum column indices (its horizontal center).\n7.

Copy the Mover pixel's color to this new position in the output grid.\n9.  **If Movers are on different rows (Scattered)**:\n    *   Create a list of Movers, recording the original color and minimum row index for each.\n    *   Sort this list based on the minimum row index (top to bottom).\n    *   Set the starting row for placement (`Current_Row`) to the Wall's maximum row index plus 1.\n    *   Iterate through the sorted list of Movers:\n        *   For the current Mover, determine its new top-left position (or single pixel position if it's a single pixel) as (`Current_Row`, `C_target`).\n        *   Copy the Mover's pixels (with their original color), translated to this new position, onto the output grid.\n        *   Increment `Current_Row` by 2 for the next Mover (placing one empty row between Movers).\n10.
