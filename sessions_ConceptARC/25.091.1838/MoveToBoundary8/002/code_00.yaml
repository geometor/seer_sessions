Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of integer colors (0-9)
  - Background: Color 0 (white)
  - Objects: Connected components of non-background pixels (4-connectivity)

Identify Components:
  - Find all connected components.
  - Store pixels, color, size, and bounding box (min/max row/col) for each.

Identify Wall and Movers:
  - Wall: The component with the largest number of pixels. Remains static.
  - Movers: All other components. Change position.

Calculate Wall Properties:
  - Bounding Box: (Rmin, Rmax, Cmin, Cmax).
  - Width: Cmax - Cmin + 1
  - Height: Rmax - Rmin + 1
  - Type: Vertical (Width=1), Horizontal (Height=1), Other (if neither).

Determine Movement Strategy based on Wall Type and Mover Positions:

Strategy 1 (Co-linear Movers, Vertical Wall):
  - Condition: Wall is Vertical AND all Movers initially lie on the same single row.
  - Target Column (C_target): Cmin (of Wall) - 1.
  - Action:
    - Find the maximum column (max_mover_col) occupied by any Mover pixel.
    - Calculate horizontal shift: shift = C_target - max_mover_col.
    - Move all Mover pixels horizontally by 'shift' columns, keeping the original row.

Strategy 2 (Scattered Movers, Horizontal Wall):
  - Condition: Wall is Horizontal AND Movers are on different rows OR span multiple rows.
  - Wall Center Column (C_center): floor((Cmin + Cmax) / 2).
  - Horizontal Shift (Shift): C_center - Cmin (of Wall).
  - Action:
    - Sort Movers by their minimum row index (top to bottom).
    - Determine starting row for stacking: Start_Row = Rmax (of Wall) + 1.
    - Initialize current row: Current_Row = Start_Row.
    - For each Mover in sorted order:
      - Calculate its new top-left position:
        - New_Row = Current_Row
        - New_Col = Mover's original minimum column index + Shift
      - Translate all pixels of the Mover relative to this new top-left position.
      - Update Current_Row for the next Mover: Current_Row = Current_Row + Mover_Height + 1 (gap).

Default/Other Cases: (Assumed based on observed patterns)
  - If Wall is Vertical but movers are NOT co-linear, apply Strategy 2 logic? (Needs clarification/example). Determine shift based on C_target? Shift = C_target - mover's original min_c?
  - If Wall is Horizontal but movers ARE co-linear, apply Strategy 1 logic? (Needs clarification/example). Calculate C_target = C_center + Shift? Or just apply Strategy 2 logic which simplifies to Strategy 1 in this case?
  - If Wall is neither Vertical nor Horizontal, behavior is undefined by examples.

Construct Output Grid:
  - Start with a background grid.
  - Place the Wall pixels at original positions.
  - Place the Mover pixels at their calculated final positions according to the applicable strategy.
