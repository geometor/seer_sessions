The structure of the distinct object and the relative positions of the white pixels within the box are preserved.\n    *   The key steps seem to be: identifying the unique \"foreground\" object's color, determining its bounding box, extracting that region, and then filtering out any \"noise\" colors within that region, keeping only the foreground color and white.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
