Transforms the input grid by:
1. Determining a characteristic size N from the first object encountered 
   (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) that has a square bounding box.
2. Identifying all distinct objects in the input grid that have an N x N bounding box.
3. Sorting these N x N objects based on the coordinate of the top-left corner 
   of their bounding box, primarily by column index (left to right) and 
   secondarily by row index (top to bottom).
4. Creating an output grid by horizontally concatenating N x N squares, each 
   filled solid with the color of one of the sorted objects, in the determined order.
