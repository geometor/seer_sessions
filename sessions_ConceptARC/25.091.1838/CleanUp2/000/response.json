In each example, the input grid contains a primary 'background' color and one or more other 'noise' or 'foreground' colors scattered within it. The output grid consists only of the background color, replacing all the noise pixels. In one case (example 3), there's a distinct border color which is preserved, and the homogenization happens only within this border.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Iterate through each pixel (at row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid:\n        a.  If a 'border color' was identified in step 3 and the current pixel's color matches the 'border color', place the 'border color' at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid.\n        b.
