task_type: conditional_homogenization
input_objects:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (HxW)
      - pixels: contain multiple colors
  - object_type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: can be any valid color (0-9)
      - role: potentially 'background', 'noise', or 'frame'
input_actions:
  - action: count_colors
    description: Determine frequency of each color in the grid.
  - action: identify_dominant_color
    description: Find the color with the highest frequency overall.
  - action: check_for_white_frame
    description: Determine if white (0) pixels exist, are present on the border, and if other non-white pixels also exist.
  - action: identify_dominant_interior_color
    description: If a white frame is identified, find the most frequent color among the non-white pixels.
transformation_logic:
  - condition: If a 'white_frame' is identified (white pixels exist, touch border, non-white pixels exist):
      - action: preserve_frame
        target: white (0) pixels
        result: white (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
      - action: fill_interior
        target: all non-white pixels
        value: the 'dominant_interior_color'
        result: all non-white pixels are replaced by the 'dominant_interior_color'.
  - condition: Else (no white frame identified):
      - action: fill_all
        target: all pixels in the grid
        value: the overall 'dominant_color'
        result: the entire output grid is filled with the overall 'dominant_color'.
output_objects:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input (HxW)
      - pixels:
          - If white frame existed: contains original white pixels and the dominant interior color.
          - If no white frame: contains only the overall dominant color.
color_mapping_summary:
  - example 1: No frame -> fill with dominant overall (green, 3)
  - example 2: No frame -> fill with dominant overall (magenta, 6)
  - example 3: White (0) frame detected -> preserve white (0), fill interior with dominant interior (red, 2)
