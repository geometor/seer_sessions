**General Assessment:**

The initial code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. The failure analysis revealed that the initial assumption of transferring the pattern based on aligning the top-left corners of the bounding boxes was incorrect. Example 2 demonstrated that the relative positioning of the pattern within the target object depends on a different alignment strategy.

Comparing the source pattern pixels and the expected output pattern pixels in Example 2 suggests that the transformation aligns the *centers* of the source and target bounding boxes. The translation vector derived from this center alignment, when applied to the source pattern pixels, correctly predicts the locations of the pattern pixels in the output for both examples.

The strategy will be to update the logic to use center-of-bounding-box alignment instead of top-left alignment.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's verify the properties of the objects and patterns using code execution.
