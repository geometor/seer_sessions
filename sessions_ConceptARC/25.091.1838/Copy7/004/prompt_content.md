"""
Identifies the two largest non-white objects in the input grid.
One object (source) contains an internal pattern composed of pixels of a single color different from the object's primary color and the background (white).
This pattern's relative position within the source object's bounding box is determined.
The pattern is then copied (imprinted) onto the second largest object (target) by applying the same relative coordinates to the target object's bounding box.
The pattern color replaces the existing color at the target locations. All other pixels remain unchanged.
