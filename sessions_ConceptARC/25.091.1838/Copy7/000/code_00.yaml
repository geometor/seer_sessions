task_description: Copy an internal color pattern from a source object to a target object based on relative positions within their bounding boxes.

definitions:
  - object: A connected component of non-white pixels.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - primary_color: The most frequent non-white color constituting an object's main structure (e.g., the frame color).
  - pattern_color: A color found within the bounding box of the source object that is different from its primary_color and also not white.
  - source_object: The object containing the pattern_color pixels within its bounding box.
  - target_object: The object onto which the pattern is copied.

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct non-white connected components.
  - determine_largest_objects: Select the two most prominent objects (e.g., by bounding box size or pixel count).
  - identify_source_target_pattern:
      - For each prominent object:
        - Check if its bounding box contains pixels of a color different from its primary color and white.
        - If yes, designate this object as 'source', the other prominent object as 'target', and the differing color as 'pattern_color'.
  - extract_pattern_relative_coords: Find all pixels of 'pattern_color' within the 'source_object's bounding box and calculate their coordinates relative to the top-left corner of this bounding box.
  - apply_pattern_to_target:
      - For each relative coordinate (dr, dc) from the source pattern:
        - Calculate the absolute coordinate (target_row, target_col) by adding (dr, dc) to the top-left coordinate of the 'target_object's bounding box.
        - If the calculated coordinate is within the grid bounds, update the pixel at (target_row, target_col) in the output grid to the 'pattern_color'.
  - copy_unchanged_pixels: Ensure all pixels not modified by the pattern transfer retain their original input color.

example_1:
  objects:
    - Magenta (6) frame object (source)
    - Orange (7) frame object (target)
  pattern_color: Green (3)
  source_pattern_relative_coords: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)] (relative to magenta box top-left)
  target_application: The green pattern is imprinted onto the orange object's area.

example_2:
  objects:
    - Yellow (4) shape object (source)
    - Red (2) rectangle object (target)
  pattern_color: Blue (1)
  source_pattern_relative_coords: [(0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)] (relative to yellow box top-left)
  target_application: The blue anti-diagonal pattern is imprinted onto the red object's area.
