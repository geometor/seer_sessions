The left element is unchanged. The right element now has a green (3) diagonal line inside it, mirroring the pattern from the left element. The green pixels replace the original white pixels at those locations.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Also contains two main visual elements separated by white pixels.\n        *   Left element: A larger, irregular shape made of yellow (4) pixels, containing an anti-diagonal line of blue (1) pixels.\n        *   Right element: A smaller solid rectangle made of red (2) pixels.\n    *   Output: The overall structure is preserved. The left element is unchanged. The right element now has an anti-diagonal line of blue (1) pixels inside it, mirroring the pattern from the left element. The blue pixels replace the original red pixels at those locations.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain distinct non-white objects, often separated by white space.\n2.  **Pattern Source and Target:** There seem to be two primary objects involved. One acts as a 'source' containing an internal pattern (a different color), and the other acts as a 'target' where this pattern is copied or imprinted.\n3.  **Pattern Extraction:** The pattern consists of pixels of a specific color located *within* the bounding box of the source object, but differing from the source object's main color.\n4.  **Pattern Transfer:** The relative positions of the pattern pixels within the source object's bounding box are calculated. These relative positions are then applied to the target object's bounding box to determine where the pattern color should be placed in the output.\n5.  **Imprinting:** The pattern color replaces the existing color at the target locations.\n6.  **Preservation:** Pixels not part of the transferred pattern generally retain their original color from the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Label them Object A and Object B. If fewer than two objects exist, stop and return the copied input grid.\n4.  **Find Source, Target, and Pattern:**\n    a.  Determine the primary color and bounding box of Object A. Check if any pixels *within* Object A's bounding box have a color that is *not* white and *not* Object A's primary color. If such a pixel exists, designate Object A as the `source_object`, Object B as the `target_object`, and the color of this pixel as the `pattern_color`. Proceed to step 5.\n    b.  If no pattern was found in Object A, perform the same check for Object B: Determine its primary color and bounding box. Check if any pixels *within* Object B's bounding box have a color that is *not* white and *not* Object B's primary color. If found, designate Object B as `source_object`, Object A as `target_object`, and this color as `pattern_color`. Proceed to step 5.\n    c.  If neither object contains a pattern according to these rules, stop and return the copied input grid.\n5.  **Extract Relative Pattern:**\n    a.  Get the top-left coordinates (`source_r0`, `source_c0`) of the `source_object`'s bounding box.\n    b.  Create a list of relative coordinates `pattern_coords`.\n    c.  Iterate through all pixels (`r`, `c`) within the `source_object`'s bounding box.\n    d.  If the pixel at (`r`, `c`) has the `pattern_color`, add its relative coordinates (`r - source_r0`, `c - source_c0`) to the `pattern_coords` list.\n6.  **Apply Pattern to Target:**\n    a.  Get the top-left coordinates (`target_r0`, `target_c0`) of the `target_object`'s bounding box.\n    b.  For each relative coordinate (`dr`, `dc`) in `pattern_coords`:\n        i.  Calculate the target absolute coordinates: `target_r = target_r0 + dr`, `target_c = target_c0 + dc`.\n        ii. Check if `target_r` and `target_c` are valid coordinates within the dimensions of the output grid.\n        iii. If the coordinates are valid, update the pixel at (`target_r`, `target_c`) in the output grid to the `pattern_color`.\n7.  **Finalize:** Return the modified output grid."
