task_description: Copy an associated object from one member of a horizontal pair to the corresponding position relative to the other member if it's missing.

example_1:
  input_objects:
    - id: pair_obj_1
      color: blue
      shape: rectangle
      position: rows 3-6, cols 1-6
    - id: pair_obj_2
      color: blue
      shape: rectangle # identical to pair_obj_1
      position: rows 3-6, cols 10-15
    - id: associated_obj_1
      color: red
      shape: cloud-like
      position: rows 0-2, cols 2-6
      association: above pair_obj_1
  output_objects:
    - id: pair_obj_1 # unchanged
      color: blue
      shape: rectangle
      position: rows 3-6, cols 1-6
    - id: pair_obj_2 # unchanged
      color: blue
      shape: rectangle
      position: rows 3-6, cols 10-15
    - id: associated_obj_1 # unchanged
      color: red
      shape: cloud-like
      position: rows 0-2, cols 2-6
    - id: copied_obj_2 # new object
      color: red
      shape: cloud-like # copy of associated_obj_1
      position: rows 0-2, cols 11-15
      association: above pair_obj_2
      derivation: Copied from associated_obj_1, placed relative to pair_obj_2 based on associated_obj_1's alignment with pair_obj_1.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - id: pair_obj_1
      color: yellow
      shape: H-like
      position: rows 0-6, cols 1-5
    - id: pair_obj_2
      color: yellow
      shape: H-like # identical to pair_obj_1
      position: rows 0-6, cols 7-11
    - id: associated_obj_1
      color: green
      shape: triangle-like
      position: rows 7-9, cols 1-4
      association: below pair_obj_1
  output_objects:
    - id: pair_obj_1 # unchanged
      color: yellow
      shape: H-like
      position: rows 0-6, cols 1-5
    - id: pair_obj_2 # unchanged
      color: yellow
      shape: H-like
      position: rows 0-6, cols 7-11
    - id: associated_obj_1 # unchanged
      color: green
      shape: triangle-like
      position: rows 7-9, cols 1-4
    - id: copied_obj_2 # new object
      color: green
      shape: triangle-like # copy of associated_obj_1
      position: rows 7-9, cols 7-10
      association: below pair_obj_2
      derivation: Copied from associated_obj_1, placed relative to pair_obj_2 based on associated_obj_1's alignment with pair_obj_1.

general_transformation:
  - step: Identify pairs of objects (P1, P2) that are identical in shape, color, and occupy the same rows, but are horizontally separated.
  - step: For each pair (P1, P2), search for an associated object (A1) vertically adjacent (above or below) to one member (e.g., P1).
  - step: Check if a corresponding associated object (A2) exists in the same relative vertical position to the other member (P2).
  - step: If A1 exists and A2 does *not* exist:
    - action: Copy object A1.
    - action: Determine the target position for the copy (A2_new).
      - target_rows: Same row indices as A1.
      - target_cols_start: P2_col_start + (A1_col_start - P1_col_start).
      - target_cols_end: P2_col_end + (A1_col_end - P1_col_end).
    - action: Place the copy A2_new onto the output grid at the target position.
  - step: Retain all other elements from the input grid in the output grid.
