            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation illustrated by these examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Transformation**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain distinct geometric shapes (objects) made of contiguous pixels of the same color (excluding the white background). In the examples, we see cloud-like shapes, rectangles, \"H\" shapes, and triangle-like shapes.\n2.  **Paired Objects**: In both examples, there are pairs of identical objects that share the same vertical position (occupy the same rows) but are located in different horizontal positions (left and right).\n    *   Example 1: Two blue rectangles.\n    *   Example 2: Two yellow \"H\" shapes.\n3.  **Associated Objects**: Associated with one object of the pair (the left one in both examples), there is another distinct object located vertically adjacent (above in Example 1, below in Example 2).\n    *   Example 1: A red cloud shape above the left blue rectangle.\n    *   Example 2: A green triangle shape below the left yellow \"H\".\n4.  **Missing Counterpart**: Crucially, the *other* object in the pair (the right one) lacks a corresponding associated object in the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation - Copying**: The core transformation is to copy the associated object from the left pair member and place it in the corresponding position relative to the right pair member.\n6.  **Positional Logic**: The placement of the copied object preserves:\n    *   The exact shape and color of the original associated object.\n    *   The vertical rows occupied by the original associated object.\n    *   The *relative horizontal alignment* between the associated object and its paired object. For instance, if the associated object starts 1 column to the right of its paired object, the copy will start 1 column to the right of the *other* paired object. The same logic applies to the right edge alignment.\n7.  **Grid Integrity**: All other elements in the grid that are not part of this copy operation remain unchanged. The grid dimensions also remain the same.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
