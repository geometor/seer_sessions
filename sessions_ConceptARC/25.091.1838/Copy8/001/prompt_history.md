Okay, let's break down the transformation illustrated by these examples.

**Perception of Elements and Transformation**

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain distinct geometric shapes (objects) made of contiguous pixels of the same color (excluding the white background). In the examples, we see cloud-like shapes, rectangles, "H" shapes, and triangle-like shapes.
2.  **Paired Objects**: In both examples, there are pairs of identical objects that share the same vertical position (occupy the same rows) but are located in different horizontal positions (left and right).
    *   Example 1: Two blue rectangles.
    *   Example 2: Two yellow "H" shapes.
3.  **Associated Objects**: Associated with one object of the pair (the left one in both examples), there is another distinct object located vertically adjacent (above in Example 1, below in Example 2).
    *   Example 1: A red cloud shape above the left blue rectangle.
    *   Example 2: A green triangle shape below the left yellow "H".
4.  **Missing Counterpart**: Crucially, the *other* object in the pair (the right one) lacks a corresponding associated object in the input grid.
5.  **Transformation - Copying**: The core transformation is to copy the associated object from the left pair member and place it in the corresponding position relative to the right pair member.
6.  **Positional Logic**: The placement of the copied object preserves:
    *   The exact shape and color of the original associated object.
    *   The vertical rows occupied by the original associated object.
    *   The *relative horizontal alignment* between the associated object and its paired object. For instance, if the associated object starts 1 column to the right of its paired object, the copy will start 1 column to the right of the *other* paired object. The same logic applies to the right edge alignment.
7.  **Grid Integrity**: All other elements in the grid that are not part of this copy operation remain unchanged. The grid dimensions also remain the same.

**Facts (YAML)**

task_description: Copy an associated object from one member of a horizontal pair to the corresponding position relative to the other member if it's missing.

general_transformation:
  - step: Identify pairs of objects (P1, P2) that are identical in shape, color, and occupy the same rows, but are horizontally separated.
  - step: For each pair (P1, P2), search for an associated object (A1) vertically adjacent (above or below) to one member (e.g., P1).
  - step: Check if a corresponding associated object (A2) exists in the same relative vertical position to the other member (P2).
  - step: If A1 exists and A2 does *not* exist:
    - action: Copy object A1.
    - action: Determine the target position for the copy (A2_new).
      - target_rows: Same row indices as A1.
      - target_cols_start: P2_col_start + (A1_col_start - P1_col_start).
      - target_cols_end: P2_col_end + (A1_col_end - P1_col_end).
    - action: Place the copy A2_new onto the output grid at the target position.
  - step: Retain all other elements from the input grid in the output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct objects in the input grid (contiguous blocks of non-background color).
3.  Identify pairs of objects (P1, P2) that meet the following criteria:
    *   P1 and P2 have the identical shape and size.
    *   P1 and P2 have the same color.
    *   P1 and P2 occupy the exact same range of rows.
    *   P1 is horizontally separated from P2 (e.g., P1 is entirely to the left of P2).
4.  For each such pair (P1, P2) found:
    a.  Search for an object A1 that is vertically adjacent to P1 (either directly above or directly below, potentially separated by background pixels). Record the relative vertical position (above/below) and the row indices of A1.
    b.  If such an A1 is found:
        i.  Search for an object A2 that has the identical shape, size, and color as A1, located in the same relative vertical position (above/below) to P2, and occupying the same row indices as A1.
        ii. If A2 is *not* found:
            1.  Calculate the horizontal starting column offset: `offset_start = A1_start_col - P1_start_col`.
            2.  Calculate the horizontal ending column offset: `offset_end = A1_end_col - P1_end_col`.
            3.  Determine the target starting column for the new object: `target_start_col = P2_start_col + offset_start`.
            4.  Determine the target ending column for the new object: `target_end_col = P2_end_col + offset_end`.
            5.  Extract the pixel data (shape and color) of object A1.
            6.  Place this extracted pixel data onto the output grid, starting at the row index of A1's top row and `target_start_col`, ensuring it occupies the same rows as A1 and columns from `target_start_col` to `target_end_col`. Overwrite existing pixels in the output grid at this location.
5.  Return the final output grid.
