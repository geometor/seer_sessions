Task Description:
Identify pairs of identical objects (P1, P2) that occupy the same rows but are horizontally separated.
Find an object (A1) vertically adjacent (above or below) to one object of the pair (e.g., P1).
If the other object (P2) does not have a corresponding identical object (A2) in the same relative position,
copy object A1 and place the copy (A2_new) in the corresponding position relative to P2.
The relative horizontal alignment between A1 and P1 should be preserved between A2_new and P2.
All other elements in the grid remain unchanged.
