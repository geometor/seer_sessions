task_description: Fill internal white areas of colored shapes based on boundary color and shape topology.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color (1-9).
  - background_region: The main contiguous area of white pixels (0) connected to the grid borders.
  - internal_white_region: A contiguous area of white pixels (0) not part of the background_region.
  - boundary_color: The color of the object pixels immediately adjacent to a white region.
  - shape_topology: Classification of how a shape encloses a white region.
      - C-like: Encloses a white region that IS connected to the background_region.
      - O-like: Encloses a white region that IS NOT connected to the background_region.

examples:
  train_1:
    input_grid_size: [10, 10]
    output_grid_size: [10, 10]
    objects:
      - color: Red (2)
        shape_topology: C-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Green (3).
      - color: Yellow (4)
        shape_topology: O-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Orange (7).
  train_2:
    input_grid_size: [14, 14]
    output_grid_size: [14, 14]
    objects:
      - color: Yellow (4)
        shape_topology: C-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Green (3).
      - color: Red (2)
        shape_topology: O-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Orange (7).
      - color: Orange (7)
        shape_topology: O-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Green (3).
      - color: Orange (7)
        shape_topology: C-like
        action: Fill internal white region with Green (3).

derived_rules:
  - rule: Identify all contiguous white regions.
  - rule: Determine the background_region (white region connected to grid borders).
  - rule: Identify internal_white_regions (all other white regions).
  - rule: For each internal_white_region:
      - Check if all adjacent non-white pixels belong to a single object and have the same boundary_color.
      - If yes:
          - Determine shape_topology by checking connectivity of the internal_white_region to the background_region.
          - Apply fill color based on shape_topology and boundary_color:
              - If C-like: Fill with Green (3).
              - If O-like:
                  - If boundary_color is Red (2) or Yellow (4): Fill with Orange (7).
                  - If boundary_color is Orange (7): Fill with Green (3).
                  - (Potentially other rules for unobserved boundary colors).
