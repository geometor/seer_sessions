task_description: Create a rectangular grid filled with a single color, derived from the input grid.
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: variable (observed 6x6)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects: contiguous or scattered pixels of non-white colors

output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: variable, derived from a selected color's bounding box in the input
  - content: filled uniformly with the selected non-white color

rules:
  - selection_criterion_1: Identify the non-white color(s) whose bounding box height equals the input grid height.
    - condition: If exactly one color meets this criterion, it is the selected color.
    - example_1: Input H=6. Green(3) BBox H=6. Blue(1) BBox H=3. Red(2) BBox H=2. Green is selected.
  - selection_criterion_2: If criterion 1 does not yield a unique color (zero or multiple colors match the input height), identify the non-white color(s) with the maximum bounding box width.
    - example_2: Input H=6. No color BBox H=6. Max Width: Magenta(6) W=5. Yellow(4) W=3. Orange(7) W=3. Magenta is selected.
    - example_3: Input H=6. No color BBox H=6. Max Width: Orange(7) W=5. Red(2) W=3. Azure(8) W=3. Orange is selected.
  - tie_breaking (hypothesized): If criterion 2 results in multiple colors having the same maximum width, select the color among them with the minimum pixel count. (Not strictly required by provided examples, but plausible).
  - output_generation:
    - Determine the height and width from the selected color's bounding box.
    - Create an output grid of these dimensions.
    - Fill the output grid entirely with the selected color.

derived_objects:
  - name: bounding_box
    properties: [color, min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col, height, width, area]
  - name: selected_color
    properties: [color_value, bounding_box_height, bounding_box_width]

actions:
  - find unique non-white colors
  - calculate bounding box for each non-white color
  - compare bounding box heights to input grid height
  - compare bounding box widths
  - (potentially) compare pixel counts for tie-breaking
  - select target color based on hierarchical criteria
  - create output grid using selected color's bounding box dimensions and color
