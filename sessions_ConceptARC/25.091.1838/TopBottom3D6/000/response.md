Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example takes a 6x6 input grid with multiple non-white colors and produces a smaller rectangular output grid filled with a single color.
2.  **Color Selection:** The color used to fill the output grid is present in the input grid, but it's not simply the most frequent, least frequent, or the color of the largest object.
3.  **Output Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples (6x2, 3x5, 3x5) and seem related to the spatial distribution of the selected color within the input grid.
4.  **Bounding Box Relationship:** Calculating the bounding box for each non-white color in the input reveals a strong correlation. The output grid's dimensions consistently match the dimensions of the bounding box of the specific color chosen for the
