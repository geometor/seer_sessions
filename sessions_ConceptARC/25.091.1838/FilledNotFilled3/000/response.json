The shapes observed include solid squares (3x3) and 'plus' shapes (3x3 squares with a distinctly colored center pixel). The output is always a small grid (1x1 or 2x2) filled with a single color. The color and size of the output grid seem dependent on the presence and type of shapes in the input grid. Specifically, the presence of a 'plus' shape appears crucial.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
