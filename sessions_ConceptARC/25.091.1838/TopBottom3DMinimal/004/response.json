            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of color transformation based on adjacency and relative counts (dominance/recessiveness). However, the precise condition for the transformation (the number of adjacent dominant neighbors required) was incorrect. The initial code implemented a rule where *any* dominant neighbor triggered the change, leading to more pixels changing color than expected in both examples.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the condition for color change based on a more detailed analysis of the neighbors of the pixels that *do* change versus those that *don't*, despite both being recessive and having at least one dominant neighbor. We will verify the number of dominant neighbors for relevant pixels and adjust the transformation rule accordingly.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nUsing code execution to analyze neighbor counts for key pixels:\n\n"
