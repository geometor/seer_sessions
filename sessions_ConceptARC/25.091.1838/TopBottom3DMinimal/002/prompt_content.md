"""
Identify the two non-background (non-zero) colors in the input grid.
Count the pixels of each of these two colors.
Determine the 'dominant' color (CD) as the one with the strictly greater count, 
and the 'recessive' color (CR) as the one with the lesser count.
Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. 
If a pixel has the recessive color (CR) and has at least one neighbor 
(orthogonal or diagonal) with the dominant color (CD) in the input grid, 
change the color of that corresponding pixel in the output grid to the dominant color (CD).
Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color in the output grid.
Return the modified output grid.
