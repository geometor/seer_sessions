            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt incorrectly identified the rule determining which color changes. The assumption that the color with the *higher* count (dominant) converts the adjacent pixels of the color with the *lower* count (recessive) was reversed.\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples shows that the transformation rule is actually: **The color with the *lower* pixel count in the input grid (recessive color) changes to the color with the *higher* pixel count (dominant color) if, and only if, a pixel of the recessive color is adjacent (including diagonals) to a pixel of the dominant color in the input grid.**\n\nThe strategy is to correct the identification of the dominant and recessive colors based on their counts and apply the adjacency-based conversion rule accordingly.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` to confirm the relationship between color counts and the transformation.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Colors: Red(2), Green(3), White(0)\n*   Red(2) Count: 16\n*   Green(3) Count: 19\n*   Recessive Color (Lower Count): Red(2)\n*   Dominant Color (Higher Count): Green(3)\n*   Changed Pixels: 6 pixels changed from Red(2) to Green(3).\n*   Observation: All changed pixels were originally the recessive color (Red) and became the dominant color (Green), consistent with the refined hypothesis.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Colors: Magenta(6), Orange(7), White(0)\n*   Magenta(6) Count: 13\n*   Orange(7) Count: 12\n*   Recessive Color (Lower Count): Orange(7)\n*   Dominant Color (Higher Count): Magenta(6)\n*   Changed Pixels: 7 pixels changed from Orange(7) to Magenta(6).\n*   Observation: All changed pixels were originally the recessive color (Orange) and became the dominant color (Magenta), consistent with the refined hypothesis.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

(Ignore the background color, white/0).\n2.  **Count Active Colors:** Count the total number of pixels of color C1 (Count1) and the total number of pixels of color C2 (Count2) in the input grid.\n3.  **Determine Dominant and Recessive Colors:** Compare Count1 and Count2.\n    *   Identify the color with the strictly *higher* count as the **Dominant Color (CD)**.\n    *   Identify the color with the strictly *lower* count as the **Recessive Color (CR)**.\n    *   If the counts are equal, no changes will occur; the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially making it an identical copy of the input grid.\n5.  **Iterate and Update:** Process each pixel at position (row, column) in the **input** grid:\n    a.  Check if the pixel's color in the **input** grid is the Recessive Color (CR).\n    b.  If it is CR, examine all its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) in the **input** grid.\n    c.  Check if **at least one** of these neighbors in the **input** grid has the Dominant Color (CD).\n    d.  If the pixel at (row, column) is CR *and* it has at least one neighbor with color CD (based on the input grid), then update the color of the pixel at (row, column) in the **output grid** to the Dominant Color (CD).\n    e.  If the pixel's color is not CR, or if it is CR but has no neighbors with color CD, its color in the **output grid** remains unchanged (as copied in step 4).\n6.  **Final Output:** Return the completed **output grid**."
