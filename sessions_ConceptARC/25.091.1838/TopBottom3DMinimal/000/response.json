            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples operate on 8x8 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example involves three colors: a background color (white/0) and two other distinct colors.\n    *   Example 1: white(0), red(2), green(3)\n    *   Example 2: white(0), magenta(6), orange(7)\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* pixels from one non-background color to the other non-background color. The background color remains unchanged.\n4.  **Stability:** One of the two non-background colors appears \"stable\" or \"dominant\" \u2013 its pixels never change color. The other non-background color is \"recessive\" \u2013 some of its pixels may change into the dominant color.\n5.  **Mechanism:** The change occurs at the interface between the two non-background colors. Specifically, a pixel of the recessive color changes to the dominant color if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to *any* pixel of the dominant color in the input grid.\n6.  **Determining Dominance:** Comparing the two examples, the dominant color appears to be the one that has a higher count of pixels in the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input has 14 red(2) pixels and 21 green(3) pixels. Green(3) is dominant. Red pixels adjacent to green pixels change to green.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 18 orange(7) pixels and 20 magenta(6) pixels. Magenta(6) is dominant. Orange pixels adjacent to magenta pixels change to magenta.\n7.  **Simultaneity:** The transformation seems to happen based solely on the state of the input grid. Changes don't cascade within the transformation step; all pixels are evaluated based on their input neighbors.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Let these be C1 and C2.\n2.  **Count Colors:** Count the total number of pixels of color C1 and the total number of pixels of color C2 in the input grid.\n3.  **Determine Dominant Color:** Compare the counts. Identify the color with the strictly greater count as the Dominant Color (CD) and the color with the lesser count as the Recessive Color (CR).\n4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  **Iterate and Update:** For each pixel at position (row, column) in the input grid:\n    a.  Check if the pixel's color is the Recessive Color (CR).\n    b.  If it is CR, examine all its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) *in the input grid*.\n    c.  Check if any of these neighbors have the Dominant Color (CD).\n    d.  If at least one neighbor has the Dominant Color (CD), change the color of the pixel at (row, column) *in the output grid* to the Dominant Color (CD).\n    e.  If the pixel's color is not CR, or if it is CR but has no neighbors with color CD, its color in the output grid remains unchanged (it was already copied in step 4).\n6.  **Final Output:** The completed output grid is the result of the transformation."
