elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - has: dimensions (height, width)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous pixels of the same non-white color (using orthogonal adjacency)
      - has: color (single non-white value)
      - has: shape
      - has: position (defined by pixel coordinates)
      - derived_property: pixel_mask (boolean array indicating object location)
      - derived_property: top_row_index (minimum row index of any pixel in the object)
      - derived_property: bottom_row_index (maximum row index of any pixel in the object)
relationships:
  - description: Multiple objects can exist within a single input grid.
  - description: Objects are distinguished by color and spatial separation.
actions:
  - action: identify_unique_colors
    input: input grid
    output: set of non-white colors present
  - action: identify_objects_by_color
    input: input grid, unique color, connectivity structure (orthogonal)
    output: set of distinct objects of that specific color
  - action: calculate_bottom_row
    input: object (pixel coordinates or mask)
    output: maximum row index for that object
  - action: find_overall_max_bottom_row
    input: set of bottom_row_indices for all identified objects across all colors
    output: maximum value among the bottom_row_indices
  - action: filter_objects_by_max_bottom_row
    input: set of all objects, overall_max_bottom_row value
    output: subset of objects whose bottom_row_index equals the overall_max_bottom_row value
  - action: construct_output
    input: input grid dimensions, filtered objects (with their colors and masks)
    output: output grid (white background with filtered objects placed in their original positions)
transformation:
  - description: Selects and keeps only the object(s) whose bottom-most pixel(s) are located at the lowest row index (maximum row index value) compared to all other objects in the input grid. Objects are defined as orthogonally connected components of the same color. All other objects are removed.
