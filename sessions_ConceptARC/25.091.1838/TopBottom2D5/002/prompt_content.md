"""
Identifies all distinct non-background objects in the input grid. 
Determines the top-most row index for each object. 
Finds the maximum of these top-most row indices (representing the lowest starting position on the grid).
Constructs an output grid containing only the object(s) whose top-most row index matches this maximum value, preserving their original colors and positions.
