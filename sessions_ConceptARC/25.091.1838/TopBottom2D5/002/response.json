            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed on Example 3 because it incorrectly identified the selection criterion and the definition of an \"object\" for this specific task.\n\n1.  **Selection Criterion Error:** The code selected objects based on their *top-most* pixel being at the maximum row index (lowest start). The examples, particularly Example 3, show the correct criterion is selecting objects whose *bottom-most* pixel is at the maximum row index (reaches lowest on the grid).\n2.  **Object Definition Error:** The initial code treated any connected non-background pixels as a single object, regardless of color changes or diagonal connections (using default `scipy.ndimage.label` behavior). Example 3 demonstrates that objects must be contiguous areas of the *same* color, and connectivity should likely be considered orthogonal only, separating the Yellow 'C' from the Green 'C' even though they touch.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the object identification process to find connected components for *each unique non-background color separately*, using orthogonal connectivity.\n2.  For each identified same-color object, determine the row index of its bottom-most pixel.\n3.  Find the maximum bottom-row index among all objects.\n4.  Filter the objects, keeping only those whose bottom-row index matches the maximum value found.\n5.  Reconstruct the output grid using only the kept objects.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Example | Input Objects (Color, Top Row, Bottom Row)                     | Max Bottom Row | Kept Object(s) in Output (Color, Bottom Row) | Code Output Match | Issue with Initial Code                                                                                             |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | Blue 'T' (1, 1, 2), Red 'L' (2, 2, 3), Magenta 'H' (6, 6, 7) | 7              | Magenta 'H' (7)                              | True              | Correct (Magenta 'H' also has max *top* row, coincidentally)                                                      |\n| 2       | Green 'C' (3, 2, 3), Orange 'C' (7, 2, 3), Azure 'L' (8, 5, 6), Red 'L' (2, 8, 9) | 9 | Red 'L' (9) | True | Correct (Red 'L' also has max *top* row, coincidentally) |\n| 3       | Yellow 'C' (4, 4, 6), Azure 'H' (8, 6, 8), Green 'C' (3, 7, 9) | 9              | Green 'C' (9)                                | False             | Selected Azure 'H' (max *top* row was 7 for Green 'C'). Also initially merged Yellow/Green due to wrong object definition. |\n\n*Note: Rows are 0-indexed from the top.*\n*Metrics gathered using the revised object definition (same-color components, orthogonal connectivity) and bottom-row criterion.*\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
