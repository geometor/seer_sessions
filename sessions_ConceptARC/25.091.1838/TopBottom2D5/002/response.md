**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed on Example 3 because it incorrectly identified the selection criterion and the definition of an "object" for this specific task.

1.  **Selection Criterion Error:** The code selected objects based on their *top-most* pixel being at the maximum row index (lowest start). The examples, particularly Example 3, show the correct criterion is selecting objects whose *bottom-most* pixel is at the maximum row index (reaches lowest on the grid).
2.  **Object Definition Error:** The initial code treated any connected non-background pixels as a single object, regardless of color changes or diagonal connections (using default `scipy.ndimage.label` behavior). Example 3 demonstrates that objects must be contiguous areas of the *same* color, and connectivity should likely be considered orthogonal only, separating the Yellow 'C' from the Green 'C' even though they touch.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the object identification process to find connected components for *each unique non-background color separately*, using orthogonal connectivity.
2.  For each identified same-color object, determine the row index of its bottom-most pixel.
3.  Find the maximum bottom-row index among all objects.
4.  Filter the objects, keeping only those whose bottom-row index matches the maximum value found.
5.  Reconstruct the output grid using only the kept objects.

**Metrics**

| Example | Input Objects (Color, Top Row, Bottom Row)                     | Max Bottom Row | Kept Object(s) in Output (Color, Bottom Row) | Code Output Match | Issue with Initial Code                                                                                             |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Blue 'T' (1, 1, 2), Red 'L' (2, 2, 3), Magenta 'H' (6, 6, 7) | 7              | Magenta 'H' (7)                              | True              | Correct (Magenta 'H' also has max *top* row, coincidentally)                                                      |
| 2       | Green 'C' (3, 2, 3), Orange 'C' (7, 2, 3), Azure 'L' (8, 5, 6), Red 'L' (2, 8, 9) | 9 | Red 'L' (9) | True | Correct (Red 'L' also has max *top* row, coincidentally) |
| 3       | Yellow 'C' (4, 4, 6), Azure 'H' (8, 6, 8), Green 'C' (3, 7, 9) | 9              | Green 'C' (9)                                | False             | Selected Azure 'H' (max *top* row was 7 for Green 'C'). Also initially merged Yellow/Green due to wrong object definition. |

*Note: Rows are 0-indexed from the top.*
*Metrics gathered using the revised object definition (same-color components, orthogonal connectivity) and bottom-row criterion.*

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white).
2.  Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
3.  Create an empty list to store all identified objects and their properties.
4.  For each unique non-white color found:
    a.  Create a mask of the input grid showing only pixels of the current color.
    b.  Identify all distinct, orthogonally connected components (objects) within this color mask.
    c.  For each object found:
        i.  Determine the maximum row index occupied by any pixel of this object (its `bottom_row`).
        ii. Store the object's color, its pixel locations (or mask), and its `bottom_row` in the list of all objects.
5.  If no objects were found in step 4, return the empty output grid.
6.  Examine the `bottom_row` property of all stored objects and find the maximum value among them. Let this be `max_bottom_row`.
7.  Iterate through the list of all stored objects.
8.  For each object whose `bottom_row` is equal to `max_bottom_row`:
    a.  Copy the pixels belonging to this object (using its stored color and locations/mask) onto the corresponding positions in the output grid.
9.  Return the final output grid.
