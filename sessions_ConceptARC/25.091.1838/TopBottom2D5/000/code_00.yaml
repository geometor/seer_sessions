elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - composed_of: contiguous non-white pixels
      - has: color (non-white)
      - has: shape
      - has: position (defined by pixel coordinates)
      - has: bounding_box
      - derived_property: top_row_index (minimum row index of any pixel in the object)
relationships:
  - description: Multiple objects can exist within a single input grid.
  - description: Objects are distinguished by color and spatial separation.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input grid
    output: set of distinct non-white objects
  - action: calculate_top_row
    input: object
    output: minimum row index for that object
  - action: find_lowest_starting_row
    input: set of top_row_indices for all objects
    output: maximum value among the top_row_indices
  - action: filter_objects
    input: set of objects, lowest_starting_row value
    output: subset of objects whose top_row_index equals the lowest_starting_row value
  - action: construct_output
    input: input grid dimensions, filtered objects
    output: output grid (white background with filtered objects placed in their original positions)
transformation:
  - description: Selects and keeps only the object(s) whose top-most pixel(s) are located at the lowest row index compared to all other objects in the input grid. All other objects are removed.
