The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple distinct \"objects,\" which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels. These objects have different shapes (like 'L', 'T', 'H', 'C') and colors.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting certain objects from the input grid and discarding others. The selected objects retain their original shape, color, and position in the output grid. The discarded objects are replaced by the white background color.\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the input and output across the examples, the key factor determining which object(s) are kept seems to be their vertical position. Specifically, the object(s) that start at the lowest row index (i.e., are closest to the bottom of the grid) are preserved. If multiple objects share the same lowest starting row index, all of them are kept.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n3.  If no non-white objects are found, return the empty output grid.\n4.  For each identified object, determine its minimum row index (the row index of its highest pixel).\n5.  Find the maximum value among these minimum row indices calculated in the previous step. This value represents the lowest starting row achieved by any object(s). Let's call this `lowest_start_row`.\n6.  Iterate through all the identified objects again.\n7.  If an object's minimum row index is equal to `lowest_start_row`, copy all pixels belonging to this object from the input grid to their corresponding positions in the output grid.\n8.  Return the final output grid."
