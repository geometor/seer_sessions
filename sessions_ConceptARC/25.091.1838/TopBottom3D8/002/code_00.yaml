task_description: Modify the color at the intersection pixel(s) of a dominant vertical line and dominant horizontal line(s) based on the color of the horizontal line.

definitions:
  background_color: white (0)
  object_types:
    - vertical_line: A column containing predominantly one non-background color. Its properties are 'column_index' and 'dominant_color'.
    - horizontal_line: A row containing predominantly one non-background color. Its properties are 'row_index' and 'dominant_color'.
  relationship:
    - intersection: A pixel location (row, column) where the vertical_line's column_index matches the intersection column, and the horizontal_line's row_index matches the intersection row.

identification_strategy:
  vertical_line:
    - Iterate through each column.
    - Count occurrences of each non-background color.
    - Identify the color that appears most frequently (the dominant_color).
    - If a single dominant_color exists and significantly outnumbers others/background, designate this column as the vertical_line column.
    - The vertical_line's dominant_color is this identified color.
  horizontal_line:
    - Iterate through each row.
    - Count occurrences of each non-background color.
    - Identify the color that appears most frequently (the dominant_color).
    - If a single dominant_color exists and significantly outnumbers others/background, designate this row as a horizontal_line row.
    - The horizontal_line's dominant_color is this identified color.

transformation_rule:
  action: Modify the color of identified intersection pixels in a copy of the input grid.
  condition: For each intersection point defined by a horizontal_line (row `h_row`, color `h_color`) and the vertical_line (column `v_col`, color `v_color`):
    - Check the dominant_color (`h_color`) of the horizontal_line.
  outcome:
    - If `h_color` is yellow (4), set the pixel at (`h_row`, `v_col`) in the output grid to yellow (4).
    - Otherwise (if `h_color` is not yellow), set the pixel at (`h_row`, `v_col`) in the output grid to the vertical_line's dominant_color (`v_color`).
