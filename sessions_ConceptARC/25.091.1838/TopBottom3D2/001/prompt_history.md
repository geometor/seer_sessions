Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 7x7 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, maroon) to form patterns.
3.  **Patterns:** The inputs consist of distinct horizontal lines and distinct vertical lines of solid colors (ignoring the white background). These lines intersect.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the vertical lines to white (0), effectively removing them. The horizontal lines remain unchanged.
5.  **Selection Logic:** The key is to determine *which* vertical lines are removed.
    *   In example 1, there are 3 horizontal green lines and 3 vertical red lines (cols 1, 3, 5). The middle vertical red line (col 3) is removed.
    *   In example 2, there are 2 horizontal blue lines and 2 vertical yellow lines (cols 1, 4). The leftmost vertical yellow line (col 1) is removed.
    *   In example 3, there is 1 horizontal magenta line and 1 vertical maroon line (col 3). The only (and therefore rightmost) vertical maroon line is removed.
6.  **Hypothesis:** The number of horizontal lines of a specific color determines which of the intersecting vertical lines (of a different color) are removed.
    *   3 horizontal lines -> remove the middle vertical line(s).
    *   2 horizontal lines -> remove the leftmost vertical line(s).
    *   1 horizontal line -> remove the rightmost vertical line(s).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of solid colors (excluding white background) and remove specific vertical lines based on the count of horizontal lines.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - size: constant (7x7 in examples, potentially variable)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color (e.g., green, blue, magenta)
      - extent: Spans the full width of the grid
      - composition: Consists only of the line color and potentially the background color (white) within its row(s).
      - count: The number of rows representing these lines is significant (1, 2, or 3 in examples).
  - type: vertical_line
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color, different from the horizontal line color (e.g., red, yellow, maroon)
      - extent: Spans the full height of the grid
      - composition: Consists only of the line color and potentially the background color (white) within its column(s).
      - location: Identified by column index.
      - intersects: Must intersect with the identified horizontal lines.

relationships:
  - type: intersection
    between:
      - horizontal_line
      - vertical_line
    description: Pixels exist where a horizontal line row and a vertical line column meet. The color of these pixels matches the vertical line color in the examples.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: horizontal_lines
    criteria: Rows containing only white (0) and one other consistent color (Color H).
    outputs:
      - count: Number of such horizontal lines (H_count).
      - color: The specific color (Color H).
  - action: identify
    target: vertical_lines
    criteria: Columns containing only white (0) and one other consistent color (Color V), where Color V is different from Color H and intersects the identified horizontal lines.
    outputs:
      - indices: List of column indices where these vertical lines occur.
      - color: The specific color (Color V).
  - action: select_target
    target: vertical_lines
    based_on: H_count (count of horizontal lines)
    rule:
      - if H_count == 3: select the middle column index/indices.
      - if H_count == 2: select the leftmost column index.
      - if H_count == 1: select the rightmost column index.
  - action: modify_grid
    target: input_grid
    operation: change_color
    location: Pixels within the selected target vertical column(s) that match Color V.
    new_color: white (0)
    result: output_grid

constants:
  - background_color: white (0)

derived_properties:
  - H_count: Count of unique horizontal lines of a single color (Color H).
  - V_indices: List of column indices for vertical lines of a single color (Color V) intersecting Color H lines.
  - target_indices: Subset of V_indices selected based on H_count.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the primary color (let's call it `H_color`) and count (`H_count`) of the horizontal lines that span the grid width (rows containing only white and `H_color`).
3.  Identify the primary color (let's call it `V_color`, where `V_color` is different from `H_color`) and the column indices (`V_indices`) of the vertical lines that span the grid height (columns containing only white and `V_color`) and intersect the horizontal lines.
4.  Determine the target column index/indices (`target_indices`) to modify based on `H_count`:
    a.  If `H_count` is 3, select the middle index from `V_indices`. If `V_indices` has an even number of elements, select the two centermost indices.
    b.  If `H_count` is 2, select the minimum (leftmost) index from `V_indices`.
    c.  If `H_count` is 1, select the maximum (rightmost) index from `V_indices`.
5.  For each `target_index` in `target_indices`:
    a.  Iterate through each row of the output grid.
    b.  If the pixel at `(row, target_index)` has the color `V_color`, change its color to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
