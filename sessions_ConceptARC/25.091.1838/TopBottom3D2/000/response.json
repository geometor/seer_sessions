            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 7x7 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, maroon) to form patterns.\n3.  **Patterns:** The inputs consist of distinct horizontal lines and distinct vertical lines of solid colors (ignoring the white background). These lines intersect.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the vertical lines to white (0), effectively removing them. The horizontal lines remain unchanged.\n5.  **Selection Logic:** The key is to determine *which* vertical lines are removed.\n    *   In example 1, there are 3 horizontal green lines and 3 vertical red lines (cols 1, 3, 5). The middle vertical red line (col 3) is removed.\n    *   In example 2, there are 2 horizontal blue lines and 2 vertical yellow lines (cols 1, 4). The leftmost vertical yellow line (col 1) is removed.\n    *   In example 3, there is 1 horizontal magenta line and 1 vertical maroon line (col 3). The only (and therefore rightmost) vertical maroon line is removed.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The number of horizontal lines of a specific color determines which of the intersecting vertical lines (of a different color) are removed.\n    *   3 horizontal lines -> remove the middle vertical line(s).\n    *   2 horizontal lines -> remove the leftmost vertical line(s).\n    *   1 horizontal line -> remove the rightmost vertical line(s).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
