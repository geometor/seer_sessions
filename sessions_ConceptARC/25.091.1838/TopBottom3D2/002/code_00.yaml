task_description: Identify primary horizontal and vertical structures based on dominant colors in rows and columns, respectively. Remove specific vertical structures based on the count of horizontal structures.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: two primary non-background colors interacting.
  - type: horizontal_structure
    properties:
      - identifier: H_Color (the color that is dominant in these rows)
      - location: Rows where H_Color is the most frequent non-background color.
      - count: H_Count (number of rows dominated by H_Color).
  - type: vertical_structure
    properties:
      - identifier: V_Color (the color that is dominant in these columns)
      - location: Columns where V_Color is the most frequent non-background color. Identified by V_Indices.
      - relationship: Intersects with horizontal_structures. V_Color is different from H_Color.

relationships:
  - type: dominance
    between: color, row/column
    description: A color dominates a row/column if it's the most frequent non-background color within that row/column.
  - type: role_assignment
    criteria: The modification affects vertical structures.
    assigns:
      - V_Color: The color dominating the columns structure(s) targeted for modification.
      - H_Color: The other primary non-background color, dominating the row structure(s).

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    target: grid
    outputs: H_Color, V_Color (the two non-background colors).
  - action: identify_structures
    target: grid
    criteria: Color dominance within rows and columns.
    outputs:
      - H_Count: Count of rows dominated by H_Color.
      - V_Indices: List of column indices dominated by V_Color.
  - action: select_target
    target: vertical_structures (represented by V_Indices)
    based_on: H_Count
    rule:
      - if H_Count >= 3: select the middle index from V_Indices (index at position len(V_Indices)//2).
      - if H_Count == 2: select the minimum (leftmost) index from V_Indices.
      - if H_Count == 1: select the maximum (rightmost) index from V_Indices.
    outputs: target_indices (list of column indices to modify).
  - action: modify_grid
    target: input_grid
    operation: change_color
    location: Pixels within the columns specified by target_indices.
    condition: Only change pixels whose current color is V_Color.
    new_color: white (0)
    result: output_grid

constants:
  - background_color: white (0)

derived_properties:
  - H_Color: Dominant color in horizontal structures.
  - V_Color: Dominant color in vertical structures.
  - H_Count: Number of rows dominated by H_Color.
  - V_Indices: Sorted list of column indices dominated by V_Color.
  - target_indices: Subset of V_Indices selected for modification.
