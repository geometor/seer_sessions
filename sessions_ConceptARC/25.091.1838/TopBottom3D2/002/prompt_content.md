"""
Identify intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of solid colors (excluding white background).
Determine the number of horizontal lines (H_count) of a specific color (H_color).
Identify the vertical lines (V_lines) of a different color (V_color) that intersect the horizontal lines.
Based on H_count, select specific vertical line(s) to remove:
- If H_count is 3, remove the middle vertical line.
- If H_count is 2, remove the leftmost vertical line.
- If H_count is 1, remove the rightmost vertical line.
Removal is done by changing the color of the pixels belonging to the selected vertical line(s) (with V_color) to white (0).
