Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 7x7 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) as the background and various other colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, maroon) to form patterns.
3.  **Patterns:** The inputs consist of distinct horizontal lines and distinct vertical lines of solid colors (ignoring the white background). These lines intersect.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the vertical lines to white (0), effectively removing them. The horizontal lines remain unchanged.
5.  **Selection Logic:** The key is to determine *which* vertical lines are removed.
    *   In example 1, there are 3 horizontal green lines and 3 vertical red lines (cols 1, 3, 5). The middle vertical red line (col 3) is removed.
    *   In example 2, there are 2 horizontal blue lines and 2 vertical yellow lines (cols 1, 4). The leftmost vertical yellow line (col 1) is removed.
    *   In example 3, there is 1 horizontal magenta line and 1 vertical maroon line (col 3). The only (and therefore rightmost) vertical maroon line is removed.
6.  **Hypothesis:** The number of horizontal lines of a specific color determines which of the intersecting vertical lines (of a different color) are removed.
    *   3 horizontal lines -> remove the middle vertical line(s).
    *   2 horizontal lines -> remove the leftmost vertical line(s).
    *   1 horizontal line -> remove the rightmost vertical line(s).

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the primary color (let's call it `H_color`) and count (`H_count`) of the horizontal lines that span the grid width (rows containing only white and `H_color`).
3.  Identify the primary color (let's call it `V_color`, where `V_color` is different from `H_color`) and the column indices (`V_indices`) of the vertical lines that span the grid height (columns containing only white and `V_color`) and intersect the horizontal lines.
4.  Determine the target column index/indices (`target_indices`) to modify based on `H_count`:
    a.  If `H_count` is 3, select the middle index from `V_indices`. If `V_indices` has an even number of elements, select the two centermost indices.
    b.  If `H_count` is 2, select the minimum (leftmost) index from `V_indices`.
    c.  If `H_count` is 1, select the maximum (rightmost) index from `V_indices`.
5.  For each `target_index` in `target_indices`:
    a.  Iterate through each row of the output grid.
    b.  If the pixel at `(row, target_index)` has the color `V_color`, change its color to white (0).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
Identify intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of solid colors (excluding white background).
Determine the number of horizontal lines (H_count) of a specific color (H_color).
Identify the vertical lines (V_lines) of a different color (V_color) that intersect the horizontal lines.
Based on H_count, select specific vertical line(s) to remove:
- If H_count is 3, remove the middle vertical line.
- If H_count is 2, remove the leftmost vertical line.
- If H_count is 1, remove the rightmost vertical line.
Removal is done by changing the color of the pixels belonging to the selected vertical line(s) (with V_color) to white (0).
