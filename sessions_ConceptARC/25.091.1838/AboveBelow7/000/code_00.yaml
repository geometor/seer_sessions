task_type: object_manipulation

elements:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0
  - role: color_group
    description: A collection of all pixels sharing the same non-background color. Acts as a single unit for transformation.
    properties:
      color: any non-white color (e.g., yellow, green, red, azure)
      value: 1-9
      shape: Can be contiguous or non-contiguous, simple or complex.
      vertical_extent: Defined by the minimum and maximum row indices occupied by pixels of this color.
      horizontal_extent: Defined by the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by pixels of this color.

relationships:
  - type: vertical_ordering
    description: Color groups are ordered vertically based on their topmost pixel row index.
    between: [color_group, color_group]
  - type: vertical_spacing
    description: The number of background rows separating the bounding boxes of vertically adjacent color groups.
    between: [color_group, color_group]

actions:
  - name: identify_color_groups
    input: input_grid
    output: list of color_groups with their properties (pixels, color, vertical_extent)
  - name: determine_vertical_order
    input: list of color_groups
    output: ordered list of color_groups (top to bottom)
  - name: reverse_vertical_order
    input: ordered list of color_groups
    output: list of color_groups in reversed vertical order
  - name: calculate_vertical_shifts
    input: original_order, reversed_order, original_vertical_spacing
    output: vertical shift amount for each color_group
    description: Calculates how many rows each group needs to move up or down to achieve the reversed order while preserving inter-group spacing.
  - name: apply_shifts
    input: input_grid, color_groups, vertical_shifts
    output: output_grid
    description: Creates the output grid by moving pixels of each color group according to the calculated vertical shift.

goal: Reverse the vertical order of the distinct color groups found in the input grid, preserving their internal structure, horizontal positions, and the vertical spacing between them.
