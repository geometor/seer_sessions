            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain distinct shapes made of non-white pixels set against a white background.\n2.  **Objects:** In `train_1`, we see two distinct objects: a yellow horizontal line and a green hollow rectangle below it. In `train_2`, we see a complex red shape and multiple disconnected azure shapes located above the red shape. It appears that objects are grouped by color.\n3.  **Color Grouping:** All pixels of the same non-white color seem to act as a single unit or group, even if they form disconnected shapes (like the azure pixels in `train_2`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a vertical rearrangement of these color groups. In `train_1`, the yellow group (line) and the green group (rectangle) swap their vertical positions. In `train_2`, the azure group (all azure pixels collectively) and the red group swap their vertical positions.\n5.  **Spacing:** The relative vertical spacing *between* the bounding boxes of the color groups seems to be preserved during the swap. For instance, in `train_1`, the yellow line is directly above the green rectangle (0 rows gap), and in the output, the green rectangle is directly above the yellow line (0 rows gap). Similarly, in `train_2`, the lowest azure pixel is directly above the highest red pixel, and in the output, the lowest red pixel is directly above the highest azure pixel.\n6.  **Internal Structure:** The internal structure and relative positions of pixels within each color group remain unchanged.\n7.  **Horizontal Position:** The horizontal position of each color group appears unchanged relative to the grid boundaries.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
