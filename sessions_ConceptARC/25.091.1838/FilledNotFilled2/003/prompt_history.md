**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a grid containing a white background (color 0) and several distinct "objects". Each object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a grid filled entirely with white pixels (color 0). The size (height and width) of the output grid varies between examples.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to determine the correct dimensions (height and width) for the output grid based on the properties of the objects found in the input grid.
4.  **Object Properties:** The key properties of the objects seem to be their bounding box dimensions (height and width). Color itself doesn't directly determine the output grid's content (which is always white) or necessarily its size, but it helps distinguish objects.
5.  **Identifying the Rule:**
    *   First, all distinct non-white objects need to be identified.
    *   For each object, its height and width (based on its bounding box) must be calculated.
    *   From the set of all object dimensions, four values are crucial: the overall maximum height (MaxH), the overall minimum width (MinW), the overall maximum width (MaxW), and potentially the overall minimum height (MinH), although MinH wasn't needed in the final rule.
    *   A comparison between MaxH and MaxW determines how the output dimensions are calculated.
    *   If the maximum height found among all objects is strictly greater than the maximum width found among all objects (MaxH > MaxW), then the output grid's dimensions are MaxW x MaxW.
    *   Otherwise (if MaxH <= MaxW), the output grid's dimensions are MaxH x MinW.
    *   The output grid is then created with these calculated dimensions and filled with white (0).

**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the core concept of finding objects and using their dimensions to determine the output size. However, it failed on the first training example, indicating the specific rule for deriving the output dimensions from the object dimensions (MaxH, MaxW, MinW) was slightly incorrect. The code successfully handled examples 2 and 3, suggesting the object identification and dimension calculation parts are likely correct.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to precisely calculate the dimensions (height, width) of each object in all three training examples. Determine the overall maximum height (MaxH), maximum width (MaxW), and minimum width (MinW) for each example.
2.  **Compare Metrics to Output:** Compare these calculated metrics (MaxH, MaxW, MinW) with the expected output dimensions for each example.
3.  **Refine Rule:** Adjust the conditional logic that determines the output height and width based on the comparison between MaxH, MaxW, and MinW, ensuring the revised rule holds true for all three training examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding.

**Gather Metrics:**

**Revised YAML Facts:**

```yaml
InputDescription: Grid containing a white background (0) and multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels.
OutputDescription: Grid filled entirely with white pixels (0).
TransformationRule:
  1. IdentifyObjects: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects).
  2. CalculateObjectProperties: For each object, determine its bounding box height (H) and width (W).
  3. AggregateProperties:
     - Find the maximum height across all objects (MaxH).
     - Find the maximum width across all objects (MaxW).
     - Find the minimum width across all objects (MinW).
  4. DetermineOutputDimensions:
     - If MaxH > MaxW: The output grid dimensions are MaxW x MaxW.
     - If MaxH <= MaxW: The output grid dimensions are MaxH x MinW.
  5. CreateOutputGrid: Generate a grid with the determined dimensions, filled entirely with white (0).

ExampleMetrics:
  - Example: 1
    ObjectDimensions: [[3, 3], [3, 2], [3, 4]] # Red(2), Green(3), Blue(1)
    MaxH: 3
    MaxW: 4
    MinW: 2
    Condition: MaxH (3) <= MaxW (4)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxH x MinW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [3, 2]
    DerivedOutputShape: [3, 2]
  - Example: 2
    ObjectDimensions: [[4, 4], [6, 3], [3, 3]] # Yellow(4), Orange(7), Azure(8)
    MaxH: 6
    MaxW: 4
    MinW: 3
    Condition: MaxH (6) > MaxW (4)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxW x MaxW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [4, 4]
    DerivedOutputShape: [4, 4]
  - Example: 3
    ObjectDimensions: [[3, 5], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]] # Magenta(6), Azure(8), Yellow(4), Red(2) Note: Object 6 width is 5 (cols 1 to 5), not 6.
    MaxH: 5
    MaxW: 5
    MinW: 3
    Condition: MaxH (5) <= MaxW (5)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxH x MinW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [5, 3]
    DerivedOutputShape: [5, 3]

Observations:
 - The crucial metrics are the maximum height (MaxH), maximum width (MaxW), and minimum width (MinW) calculated across *all* objects found in the input grid.
 - The relationship between MaxH and MaxW determines which combination of these metrics defines the output grid's dimensions.
 - The colors of the objects are used only to distinguish them for dimension calculation and do not influence the output content or dimensions otherwise.
```


*Correction Note:* During metric calculation via `tool_code`, it was observed that the Magenta object (6) in Example 3 has a width of 5 (columns 1 through 5), not 6 as initially perceived. This correction resulted in MaxH=5 and MaxW=5 for Example 3, which aligns with the `MaxH <= MaxW` condition and correctly yields the expected 5x3 output using the `MaxH x MinW` rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input grid to identify all distinct objects. An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels with the same non-white color.
2.  For each identified object, calculate the height and width of its bounding box.
3.  From the set of all object dimensions calculated in the previous step, determine three key values:
    *   `MaxH`: The overall maximum height found among all objects.
    *   `MaxW`: The overall maximum width found among all objects.
    *   `MinW`: The overall minimum width found among all objects.
4.  Compare `MaxH` and `MaxW` to determine the dimensions for the output grid:
    *   If `MaxH` is strictly greater than `MaxW`, the output grid's height will be `MaxW` and its width will be `MaxW`.
    *   Otherwise (if `MaxH` is less than or equal to `MaxW`), the output grid's height will be `MaxH` and its width will be `MinW`.
5.  Construct the output grid with the calculated height and width, filling all its pixels with the white color (0).
