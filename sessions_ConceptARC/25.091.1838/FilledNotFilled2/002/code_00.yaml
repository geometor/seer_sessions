InputDescription: Grid containing a white background (0) and multiple distinct objects composed of contiguous non-white pixels.
OutputDescription: Grid filled entirely with white pixels (0).
TransformationRule:
  1. IdentifyObjects: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects).
  2. CalculateObjectProperties: For each object, determine its bounding box height (H) and width (W).
  3. AggregateProperties:
     - Find the maximum height across all objects (MaxH).
     - Find the maximum width across all objects (MaxW).
     - Find the minimum width across all objects (MinW).
  4. DetermineOutputDimensions:
     - If MaxH > MaxW: The output grid dimensions are MaxW x MaxW.
     - If MaxH <= MaxW: The output grid dimensions are MaxH x MinW.
  5. CreateOutputGrid: Generate a grid with the determined dimensions, filled entirely with white (0).

ExampleMetrics:
  - Example: 1
    ObjectDimensions: [[3, 3], [3, 2], [3, 4]] # Red(2), Green(3), Blue(1)
    MaxH: 3
    MaxW: 4
    MinW: 2
    Condition: MaxH (3) <= MaxW (4)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxH x MinW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [3, 2]
    DerivedOutputShape: [3, 2]
  - Example: 2
    ObjectDimensions: [[4, 4], [6, 3], [3, 3]] # Yellow(4), Orange(7), Azure(8)
    MaxH: 6
    MaxW: 4
    MinW: 3
    Condition: MaxH (6) > MaxW (4)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxW x MaxW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [4, 4]
    DerivedOutputShape: [4, 4]
  - Example: 3
    ObjectDimensions: [[3, 5], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]] # Magenta(6), Azure(8), Yellow(4), Red(2) Note: Object 6 width is 5 (cols 1 to 5), not 6.
    MaxH: 5
    MaxW: 5
    MinW: 3
    Condition: MaxH (5) <= MaxW (5)
    RuleApplication: Use MaxH x MinW
    ExpectedOutputShape: [5, 3]
    DerivedOutputShape: [5, 3]

Observations:
 - The crucial metrics are the maximum height (MaxH), maximum width (MaxW), and minimum width (MinW) calculated across *all* objects found in the input grid.
 - The relationship between MaxH and MaxW determines which combination of these metrics defines the output grid's dimensions.
 - The colors of the objects are used only to distinguish them for dimension calculation and do not influence the output content or dimensions otherwise.
