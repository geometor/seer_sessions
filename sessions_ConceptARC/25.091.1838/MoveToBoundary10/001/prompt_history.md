Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

### Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and one or more distinct colored objects (contiguous pixels of the same non-white color). In the examples, we see pairs of colored objects/groups (red & blue in train_1, green & yellow in train_2).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids. The background color remains white. The colored objects from the input are still present but have changed their horizontal positions.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a horizontal movement of the colored objects towards the edges of the grid.
4.  **Movement Direction:** Objects initially located further to the left seem to move towards the left edge (column 0). Objects initially located further to the right seem to move towards the right edge (the last column).
5.  **Movement Magnitude:** The movement is such that the leftmost pixel of the left-moving object(s) aligns with column 0, and the rightmost pixel of the right-moving object(s) aligns with the last column of the grid.
6.  **Object Integrity:** The shapes, sizes, colors, and relative vertical positions of the objects are preserved during the transformation. Only their horizontal positions change.
7.  **Grouping:** It seems all objects of the color(s) that define the leftmost extent move left together by the same amount, and similarly, all objects of the color(s) defining the rightmost extent move right together by the same amount.

### Facts


```yaml
Task: Horizontal alignment of colored objects to grid edges.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
      - Properties: Color, Shape, Size, Position (row, column).
      - Count: Typically two distinct color groups per example.
      - Spatial Relationship: Objects/groups are horizontally separated.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Same objects as input (color, shape, size preserved).
      - Position: Horizontally shifted relative to input.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Identify Objects: Find all non-white pixels and group them into objects.
  - Determine Extents:
      - Find the minimum column index (leftmost_col) occupied by any non-white pixel.
      - Find the maximum column index (rightmost_col) occupied by any non-white pixel.
  - Identify Target Groups:
      - Left Group: All objects containing pixels at leftmost_col.
      - Right Group: All objects containing pixels at rightmost_col.
      - Note: A single object/color might belong to both groups if it spans the entire width, though not seen in examples.
  - Calculate Shifts:
      - Left Shift: `0 - leftmost_col` (negative value or zero).
      - Right Shift: `(grid_width - 1) - rightmost_col` (positive value or zero).
  - Apply Shifts:
      - For every pixel belonging to an object in the Left Group: New Column = Original Column + Left Shift.
      - For every pixel belonging to an object in the Right Group: New Column = Original Column + Right Shift.
      - Row index remains unchanged.
  - Construct Output: Create a new grid, initially filled with the background color, and place the shifted pixels into it.

Relationships:
  - The direction of movement (left or right) for an object group is determined by its initial horizontal position relative to other object groups (specifically, whether it contributes to the overall leftmost or rightmost extent).
  - All pixels within a moved group (Left Group or Right Group) shift by the same horizontal distance.
  - Vertical positions are invariant.

### Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (white, 0). If no non-white pixels exist, the output is identical to the input.
3.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among all non-white pixels.
4.  Find the maximum column index (`max_col`) among all non-white pixels.
5.  Determine the required horizontal shift for the leftmost object(s): `left_shift = 0 - min_col`.
6.  Determine the required horizontal shift for the rightmost object(s): `right_shift = (input_grid_width - 1) - max_col`.
7.  Iterate through each pixel (`pixel`) of the input grid at `(row, col)` with a non-white color (`color`):
    a.  Check if this `pixel` contributes to the leftmost extent (i.e., if `col == min_col`). If it does, apply the `left_shift` to all pixels of the same `color`. Place these shifted pixels (at `(row, original_col + left_shift)`) with their original `color` into the output grid. Mark this `color` as processed for leftward movement.
    b.  Check if this `pixel` contributes to the rightmost extent (i.e., if `col == max_col`). If it does, and if this `color` has *not* already been processed for leftward movement (to handle cases where one object spans the whole width), apply the `right_shift` to all pixels of the same `color`. Place these shifted pixels (at `(row, original_col + right_shift)`) with their original `color` into the output grid.
8.  Return the populated output grid.

*(Self-correction on step 7: A simpler approach is to determine which *colors* are associated with `min_col` and `max_col` first, then iterate through all pixels, applying the appropriate shift if the pixel's color belongs to the left-moving set or the right-moving set.)*

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Find all non-white pixels in the input grid. If none exist, return the input grid.
3.  Determine the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by any non-white pixel.
4.  Identify the set of colors (`left_moving_colors`) present at `min_col`.
5.  Identify the set of colors (`right_moving_colors`) present at `max_col`.
6.  Calculate the horizontal shift for left-moving colors: `left_shift = 0 - min_col`.
7.  Calculate the horizontal shift for right-moving colors: `right_shift = (input_grid_width - 1) - max_col`.
8.  Iterate through each pixel at `(row, col)` in the input grid:
    a.  Get the pixel's color (`color`).
    b.  If `color` is in `left_moving_colors`:
        i.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + left_shift`.
        ii. Place the `color` at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
    c.  Else if `color` is in `right_moving_colors`:
        i.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + right_shift`.
        ii. Place the `color` at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
    d.  Else (if the color is background or a color not at the min/max extents - though this last case shouldn't happen based on examples): Do nothing (output grid already has background).
9.  Return the output grid.
