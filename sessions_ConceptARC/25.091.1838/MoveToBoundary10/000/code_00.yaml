Task: Horizontal alignment of colored objects to grid edges.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
      - Properties: Color, Shape, Size, Position (row, column).
      - Count: Typically two distinct color groups per example.
      - Spatial Relationship: Objects/groups are horizontally separated.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Same objects as input (color, shape, size preserved).
      - Position: Horizontally shifted relative to input.

Transformation_Actions:
  - Identify Objects: Find all non-white pixels and group them into objects.
  - Determine Extents:
      - Find the minimum column index (leftmost_col) occupied by any non-white pixel.
      - Find the maximum column index (rightmost_col) occupied by any non-white pixel.
  - Identify Target Groups:
      - Left Group: All objects containing pixels at leftmost_col.
      - Right Group: All objects containing pixels at rightmost_col.
      - Note: A single object/color might belong to both groups if it spans the entire width, though not seen in examples.
  - Calculate Shifts:
      - Left Shift: `0 - leftmost_col` (negative value or zero).
      - Right Shift: `(grid_width - 1) - rightmost_col` (positive value or zero).
  - Apply Shifts:
      - For every pixel belonging to an object in the Left Group: New Column = Original Column + Left Shift.
      - For every pixel belonging to an object in the Right Group: New Column = Original Column + Right Shift.
      - Row index remains unchanged.
  - Construct Output: Create a new grid, initially filled with the background color, and place the shifted pixels into it.

Relationships:
  - The direction of movement (left or right) for an object group is determined by its initial horizontal position relative to other object groups (specifically, whether it contributes to the overall leftmost or rightmost extent).
  - All pixels within a moved group (Left Group or Right Group) shift by the same horizontal distance.
  - Vertical positions are invariant.
