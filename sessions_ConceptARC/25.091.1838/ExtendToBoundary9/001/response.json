The original container and inner shapes \nretain their colors and positions.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Identifying all distinct non-white objects (connected components) in the grid.\n2. Determining which object is the 'container' (typically the largest by pixel count or bounding box).\n3. Determining which object(s) are 'inner' (located inside the container).\n4. Extracting the color of an inner object to use as the fill color.\n5. Performing a flood fill starting from a pixel of the inner object. The fill propagates through white pixels but stops at the boundary defined by the container's color. Only white pixels encountered during the fill are changed to the fill color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of non-background (non-zero) pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:\n              (color, set_of_coordinates).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    components = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                component_coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                \n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    if grid[row, col] == color: # Only expand within the same color for this component definition\n                        component_coords.add((row, col))\n                        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                               grid[nr, nc] == color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                \n                if component_coords:\n                   components.append((color, component_coords))\n\n    return components\n\ndef get_bounding_box(coords):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box of a set of coordinates.\"\"\"\n    if not coords:\n        return None\n    min_r = min(r for r, c in coords)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in coords)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in coords)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in coords)\n    return (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the flood fill transformation based on container and inner shapes.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
