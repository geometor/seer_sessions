            "text": "Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the examples and the previous attempt.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe core task involves identifying two distinct non-background shapes: a 'container' and an 'inner' shape. The transformation consists of filling the empty space (white pixels) *inside* the container shape with the color of the inner shape. The original shapes must be preserved.\n\nThe previous code attempt failed due to a syntax error, preventing evaluation of its logic. However, the conceptual approach (identifying roles and performing a conditional flood fill) seems correct. The main challenge lies in robustly identifying the 'container' and 'inner/fill' colors, especially when the container doesn't touch the absolute grid boundaries (as seen in train_1 and train_2 based on the metric analysis).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Role Identification:** Implement a more robust method to distinguish the container and inner colors. The metrics show that edge-touching isn't always sufficient. A combination of edge-touching and relative pixel count seems necessary.\n2.  **Implement Conditional Flood Fill:** Use a standard algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a pixel of the identified inner shape. The fill should only propagate through white pixels and stop when encountering the container color pixels.\n3.  **Ensure Preservation:** The fill process must only change white pixels (0) to the fill color. Pixels belonging to the original container and inner shapes must retain their initial colors in the output grid.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n"
