```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying a 'container' shape and an 'inner' shape based on specific rules, 
then filling the empty space (white pixels, value 0) enclosed within the container shape 
with the color of the inner shape using a conditional flood fill (BFS). 
The original container and inner shapes retain their colors and positions.

Role Identification Logic:
1. Assumes exactly two non-white colors exist in the grid.
2. Determines which color touches the grid boundary (edge).
3. If only one color touches the edge, it's the container, the other is the inner/fill color.
4. If neither touches the edge, the one with more pixels is the container, the other is the inner/fill color.
5. If both touch the edge or the number of non-white colors is not two, roles cannot be determined, and the original grid is returned.

Conditional Flood Fill:
1. Starts from all pixels of the inner shape.
2. Expands through adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
3. Fill propagation stops at pixels matching the container color.
4. Only pixels that were originally white (0) are changed to the fill color.
