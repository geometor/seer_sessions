            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nIn each example pair, the input grid contains an outer hollow shape (a container) of one color and one or more smaller solid shapes of a second color located inside the container. The background is white (color 0). The output grid retains the outer container shape and the original inner shape(s). The key transformation is that the empty space (white pixels) *inside* the container shape is filled with the color of the inner shape(s). The space outside the container remains unchanged (white).\n\n*   **Example 1:** A green hollow rectangle contains a red solid rectangle. The white space inside the green rectangle is filled with red.\n*   **Example 2:** A yellow hollow rectangle contains a gray solid rectangle. The white space inside the yellow rectangle is filled with gray.\n*   **Example 3:** A magenta hollow diamond-like shape contains an orange solid rectangle. The white space inside the magenta shape is filled with orange.\n\nThe transformation behaves like a conditional flood fill: identify the region enclosed by the main outer shape and fill the background pixels within that region using the color of the object(s) initially present inside.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Note its color (`container_color`) and the coordinates of its pixels.\n    *   Identify the object(s) located entirely within the area enclosed by the `container_shape` as the `inner_shape(s)`. Note the color of one of these shapes (`fill_color`) and the coordinates of at least one of its pixels (`start_pixel`). (In all examples, there's only one inner shape).\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n3.  **Perform Conditional Flood Fill:**\n    *   Start a flood fill process from the `start_pixel` (a pixel belonging to the `inner_shape`).\n    *   Use a queue or stack to manage pixels to visit, initially containing `start_pixel`. Maintain a set of visited pixels to avoid cycles.\n    *   While there are pixels to visit:\n        *   Get the current pixel's coordinates (`r`, `c`).\n        *   If (`r`, `c`) has already been visited, skip it.\n        *   Mark (`r`, `c`) as visited.\n        *   Check the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *input* grid:\n            *   If the color is white (0), change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to `fill_color`.\n        *   For each neighbor (up, down, left, right) of (`r`, `c`):\n            *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n            *   Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid is *not* the `container_color`.\n            *   If both conditions are true and the neighbor has not been visited, add the neighbor to the queue/stack.\n4.  **Return Output:** The modified grid after the flood fill is complete is the final output."
