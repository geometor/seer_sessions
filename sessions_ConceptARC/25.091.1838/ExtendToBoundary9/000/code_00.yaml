task_description: Fill the empty space (white pixels) inside a container shape with the color of the object(s) found within it.

elements:
  - object: container_shape
    description: The largest, outermost, often hollow shape in the grid, defined by a single color. It encloses other elements.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (green, yellow, magenta).
      - structure: Typically hollow, forming a boundary.
  - object: inner_shape
    description: A smaller solid shape located spatially inside the container_shape.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (red, gray, orange). This color determines the fill color.
      - structure: Solid block of color.
      - location: Strictly inside the boundary formed by the container_shape.
  - object: background
    description: The empty space in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0).

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: container_shape
    to: inner_shape
    description: The container_shape fully encloses the inner_shape.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels of the same color connected side-by-side form shapes.

actions:
  - action: identify_container
    input: input_grid
    output: container_shape object (pixels and color)
    description: Find the largest connected component that acts as a boundary.
  - action: identify_inner_object
    input: input_grid, container_shape
    output: inner_shape object (pixels and color)
    description: Find the object(s) located within the bounds of the container_shape. Extract the color for filling.
  - action: fill_region
    input: input_grid, container_shape, inner_shape color
    output: modified_grid
    description: Fill the white background pixels located inside the container_shape boundary with the color derived from the inner_shape. Pixels of the container_shape and the original inner_shape remain unchanged.

output_grid_composition:
  - Retain the container_shape pixels from the input.
  - Retain the inner_shape pixels from the input.
  - Replace white pixels inside the container_shape with the inner_shape's color.
  - Retain white pixels outside the container_shape.
