            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. The background color, white (0), remains unchanged and acts as a separator between distinct shapes or objects.\n2.  **Objects:** The core elements are distinct objects composed of connected non-white pixels. These objects are separated horizontally by columns of the white background color.\n3.  **Object Types:** There appear to be two categories of objects based on their composition across the examples:\n    *   **Type 1 (Train_1):** Objects contain exactly two non-white colors: gray (5) and one other 'primary' color (blue, red, yellow, or green). The shape is relatively solid.\n    *   **Type 2 (Train_2):** Objects contain only one non-white color (yellow, red, magenta, or orange) but may contain internal \"holes\" represented by the white (0) background color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors of the pixels *within* each object, while preserving the object's overall shape, position, and any internal holes (white pixels within the object's boundary). The specific color change depends on the type of object.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** The presence or absence of the gray (5) color within an object dictates which color transformation rule is applied.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
