Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. The background color, white (0), remains unchanged and acts as a separator between distinct shapes or objects.
2.  **Objects:** The core elements are distinct objects composed of connected non-white pixels. These objects are separated horizontally by columns of the white background color.
3.  **Object Types:** There appear to be two categories of objects based on their composition across the examples:
    *   **Type 1 (Train_1):** Objects contain exactly two non-white colors: gray (5) and one other 'primary' color (blue, red, yellow, or green). The shape is relatively solid.
    *   **Type 2 (Train_2):** Objects contain only one non-white color (yellow, red, magenta, or orange) but may contain internal "holes" represented by the white (0) background color.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors of the pixels *within* each object, while preserving the object's overall shape, position, and any internal holes (white pixels within the object's boundary). The specific color change depends on the type of object.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** The presence or absence of the gray (5) color within an object dictates which color transformation rule is applied.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Unchanged between input and output.
    - Background: Color white (0) is preserved. Acts as a separator.
Objects:
  Definition: Connected components of non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0).
  Properties:
    - Pixels: The set of coordinates belonging to the component.
    - Has_Gray: Boolean flag, true if any pixel in the component has value gray (5).
    - Primary_Color:
        - If Has_Gray is true: The non-gray, non-white color within the component (assuming one primary color exists besides gray based on examples).
        - If Has_Gray is false: The single non-white color of the component.
    - Shape: Defined by the `Pixels` coordinates. Preserved in the output (including internal white/0 pixels).
Transformation:
  Type: Color substitution within objects.
  Rule: Conditional based on the `Has_Gray` property of the object.
  Mappings:
    - Rule_Gray_Present: # Applied if Has_Gray is true
        Input_Color: Blue (1) -> Output_Color: Yellow (4)
        Input_Color: Red (2) -> Output_Color: Red (2)
        Input_Color: Yellow (4) -> Output_Color: Green (3)
        Input_Color: Green (3) -> Output_Color: Blue (1)
    - Rule_Gray_Absent: # Applied if Has_Gray is false
        Input_Color: Yellow (4) -> Output_Color: Magenta (6)
        Input_Color: Red (2) -> Output_Color: Orange (7)
        Input_Color: Magenta (6) -> Output_Color: Red (2)
        Input_Color: Orange (7) -> Output_Color: Yellow (4)
Action:
  - Iterate through each identified object in the input grid.
  - Determine `Has_Gray` and `Primary_Color` for the object.
  - Select the appropriate transformation mapping (Rule_Gray_Present or Rule_Gray_Absent).
  - Determine the `Output_Color` by applying the selected mapping to the `Primary_Color`.
  - For every pixel coordinate within the object's `Pixels` set, change the color in the output grid at that coordinate to the determined `Output_Color`.
  - Pixels that were originally white (0), whether background or internal holes, remain white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a group of connected pixels with colors other than white (0).
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Examine all pixels belonging to the object to check if any of them are gray (5).
    b.  Determine the object's 'primary color'. If gray (5) is present, the primary color is the *other* non-white color in the object. If gray (5) is absent, the primary color is the single non-white color composing the object.
    c.  Select the appropriate color transformation rule based on whether gray (5) was found:
        i.  **If gray (5) is present:** Use the mapping: Blue (1) becomes Yellow (4), Red (2) becomes Red (2), Yellow (4) becomes Green (3), Green (3) becomes Blue (1).
        ii. **If gray (5) is absent:** Use the mapping: Yellow (4) becomes Magenta (6), Red (2) becomes Orange (7), Magenta (6) becomes Red (2), Orange (7) becomes Yellow (4).
    d.  Apply the selected transformation rule to the object's primary color to find the target output color.
    e.  For every pixel coordinate that belongs to the current object in the input grid, update the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the calculated target output color. (This ensures both the primary color and the gray color pixels, if present, are updated).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
