"""
This program transforms an input grid into an output grid based on the colors within connected objects.

1.  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of non-white (non-zero) pixels.
2.  For each object, it determines if the color gray (5) is present among its pixels.
3.  Based on the presence or absence of gray (5), it identifies a 'primary' color for the object:
    - If gray (5) is present, the primary color is the other non-white color in the object.
    - If gray (5) is absent, the primary color is the single non-white color composing the object.
4.  Applies a color transformation rule to the primary color to get a target output color. There are two separate rules: one for objects containing gray, and one for objects without gray.
    - Rule (Gray Present): Blue (1) -> Yellow (4), Red (2) -> Red (2), Yellow (4) -> Green (3), Green (3) -> Blue (1).
    - Rule (Gray Absent): Yellow (4) -> Magenta (6), Red (2) -> Orange (7), Magenta (6) -> Red (2), Orange (7) -> Yellow (4).
5.  Updates all pixels belonging to the original object in the output grid to this single target output color, preserving the object's shape and position.
6.  White (0) pixels (background or internal holes) remain unchanged.
