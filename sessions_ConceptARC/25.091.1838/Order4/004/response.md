**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the core transformation logic based on the presence or absence of the gray color (5) within distinct objects and applied the corresponding color mapping rules. It successfully processed the first training example.

However, the failure in the second example highlights an issue with handling "internal holes" (white/0 pixels completely surrounded by an object). The expected output for the second example shows that these internal holes should be filled with the object's transformed color, effectively making the transformed object solid. The previous code attempted to identify these holes separately and add them to the update list, but this failed for at least one pixel (`(7, 14)` in the orange object).

The strategy will be revised to ensure these internal holes are correctly filled:
1.  Identify each connected component of non-white pixels (the core object).
2.  Determine the properties of the object (colors present, presence of gray, primary color).
3.  Calculate the single target color based on the transformation rules.
4.  Instead of just recoloring the original object pixels, perform an operation that fills the entire area occupied by the object in the output grid, including any internal white pixels, with the target color. This could involve identifying the object's pixels and its internal holes and then painting them all, or potentially using a flood-fill approach from within the object on the output grid, constrained by the external background. The key insight is that the output object is solid, using the single transformed color.

**Metrics**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 8x13
    *   Output Grid Size: 8x13
    *   Number of Objects: 4
    *   Objects with Gray: 4 (Blue/Gray, Red/Gray, Yellow/Gray, Green/Gray)
    *   Objects without Gray: 0
    *   Internal Holes: None observed.
    *   Code Result: Match (Success)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid Size: 8x15
    *   Output Grid Size: 8x15
    *   Number of Objects: 4
    *   Objects with Gray: 0
    *   Objects without Gray: 4 (Yellow, Red, Magenta, Orange)
    *   Internal Holes: Yes (e.g., within Yellow at (2,1), Red at (6,5), Magenta at (8,13), Orange at (7,14)).
    *   Code Result: Mismatch (Failure) - Specifically, the internal hole at (7,14) in the orange object was not filled with the target color (Yellow/4).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Unchanged between input and output.
    - Background: Color white (0) pixels that are part of the external background remain white (0).
Objects:
  Definition: Connected components of non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0) in the input grid.
  Properties:
    - Pixels: The set of coordinates belonging to the non-white component.
    - Has_Gray: Boolean flag, true if any pixel in the component has value gray (5).
    - Primary_Color:
        - If Has_Gray is true: The non-gray, non-white color within the component.
        - If Has_Gray is false: The single non-white color of the component.
    - Internal_Holes: Set of coordinates of white (0) pixels completely enclosed by the object's `Pixels`.
    - Footprint: The union of the object's `Pixels` and `Internal_Holes`.
Transformation:
  Type: Color substitution covering the object's entire footprint.
  Rule: Conditional based on the `Has_Gray` property of the object.
  Mappings:
    - Rule_Gray_Present: # Applied if Has_Gray is true
        Input_Color: Blue (1) -> Target_Output_Color: Yellow (4)
        Input_Color: Red (2) -> Target_Output_Color: Red (2)
        Input_Color: Yellow (4) -> Target_Output_Color: Green (3)
        Input_Color: Green (3) -> Target_Output_Color: Blue (1)
    - Rule_Gray_Absent: # Applied if Has_Gray is false
        Input_Color: Yellow (4) -> Target_Output_Color: Magenta (6)
        Input_Color: Red (2) -> Target_Output_Color: Orange (7)
        Input_Color: Magenta (6) -> Target_Output_Color: Red (2)
        Input_Color: Orange (7) -> Target_Output_Color: Yellow (4)
Action:
  - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Identify all distinct objects (connected non-white components) in the input grid.
  - For each identified object:
    a. Determine its `Has_Gray` status and `Primary_Color`.
    b. Select the appropriate transformation mapping (Rule_Gray_Present or Rule_Gray_Absent).
    c. Determine the `Target_Output_Color` by applying the selected mapping to the `Primary_Color`.
    d. Identify all pixels belonging to the object's `Footprint` (the original non-white pixels plus any enclosed white pixels).
    e. Update the output grid by setting the color of every pixel coordinate within the `Footprint` to the calculated `Target_Output_Color`.
  - Return the modified output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all separate objects in the input grid. An object is a connected group of pixels that are not white (color 0).
3.  For each object found:
    a.  Check if any pixel within the object is gray (color 5).
    b.  Identify the object's 'primary color':
        i.  If gray (5) is present, the primary color is the other non-white color in the object.
        ii. If gray (5) is absent, the primary color is the single non-white color making up the object.
    c.  Determine the 'target color' using one of two rules, based on whether gray was present:
        i.  **Gray Present Rule:** Blue (1) maps to Yellow (4); Red (2) maps to Red (2); Yellow (4) maps to Green (3); Green (3) maps to Blue (1).
        ii. **Gray Absent Rule:** Yellow (4) maps to Magenta (6); Red (2) maps to Orange (7); Magenta (6) maps to Red (2); Orange (7) maps to Yellow (4).
    d.  Find all pixel coordinates that belong to this object in the input grid (the non-white pixels).
    e.  Find all white (0) pixel coordinates that are completely surrounded by this object's pixels (internal holes).
    f.  Combine the coordinates from steps 3d and 3e.
    g.  For every coordinate in this combined set, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to the 'target color' determined in step 3c.
4.  Return the final output grid.
