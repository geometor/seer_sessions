            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core transformation logic based on the presence or absence of the gray color (5) within distinct objects and applied the corresponding color mapping rules. It successfully processed the first training example.\n\nHowever, the failure in the second example highlights an issue with handling \"internal holes\" (white/0 pixels completely surrounded by an object). The expected output for the second example shows that these internal holes should be filled with the object's transformed color, effectively making the transformed object solid. The previous code attempted to identify these holes separately and add them to the update list, but this failed for at least one pixel (`(7, 14)` in the orange object).\n\nThe strategy will be revised to ensure these internal holes are correctly filled:\n1.  Identify each connected component of non-white pixels (the core object).\n2.  Determine the properties of the object (colors present, presence of gray, primary color).\n3.  Calculate the single target color based on the transformation rules.\n4.  Instead of just recoloring the original object pixels, perform an operation that fills the entire area occupied by the object in the output grid, including any internal white pixels, with the target color. This could involve identifying the object's pixels and its internal holes and then painting them all, or potentially using a flood-fill approach from within the object on the output grid, constrained by the external background. The key insight is that the output object is solid, using the single transformed color.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 8x13\n    *   Output Grid Size: 8x13\n    *   Number of Objects: 4\n    *   Objects with Gray: 4 (Blue/Gray, Red/Gray, Yellow/Gray, Green/Gray)\n    *   Objects without Gray: 0\n    *   Internal Holes: None observed.\n    *   Code Result: Match (Success)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid Size: 8x15\n    *   Output Grid Size: 8x15\n    *   Number of Objects: 4\n    *   Objects with Gray: 0\n    *   Objects without Gray: 4 (Yellow, Red, Magenta, Orange)\n    *   Internal Holes: Yes (e.g., within Yellow at (2,1), Red at (6,5), Magenta at (8,13), Orange at (7,14)).\n    *   Code Result: Mismatch (Failure) - Specifically, the internal hole at (7,14) in the orange object was not filled with the target color (Yellow/4).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
