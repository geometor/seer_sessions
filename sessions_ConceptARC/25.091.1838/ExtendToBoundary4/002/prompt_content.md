"""
Identifies a single vertical line and a single horizontal line in the input grid. 
Then, based on their relative positions, extends one of the lines.
- If the horizontal line is entirely to the right of the vertical line's column, the horizontal line extends one pixel to the right.
- Otherwise, the vertical line extends downwards. 
  - If the vertical line is entirely above the horizontal line's row, it extends down to the row just above the horizontal line.
  - Otherwise (if the vertical line intersects, touches, or is below the horizontal line), it extends down by exactly one pixel.
