White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there are exactly two distinct non-white objects. These objects always appear to be straight lines, either perfectly horizontal or perfectly vertical. One line is always horizontal, and the other is always vertical.\n3.  **Colors:** The lines have specific colors (blue, red, magenta, green, yellow, orange, azure, maroon) that are preserved from input to output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves one of the two lines extending its length. The other line remains unchanged.\n5.  **Extension Direction:** Vertical lines, when they extend, always extend downwards. Horizontal lines, when they extend, always extend rightwards.\n6.  **Extension Trigger & Length:** The key is determining *which* line extends and by *how much*.\n    *   It appears the horizontal line extends only if it is located entirely to the right of the vertical line (Example 4). In this case, it extends by one pixel to the right.\n    *   In all other cases (horizontal line is left of, intersects, or touches the vertical line), the vertical line extends downwards.\n    *   The length of the vertical extension depends on its position relative to the horizontal line:\n        *   If the vertical line is entirely above the horizontal line, it extends downwards until it reaches the row immediately preceding the horizontal line's row (Examples 2 & 3).\n        *   If the vertical line intersects, touches, or is entirely below the horizontal line, it extends downwards by exactly one pixel (Example 1).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
