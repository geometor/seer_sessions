task_description: Identify a single vertical line and a single horizontal line in the input grid, then extend one of them based on their relative positions.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x6 in examples)

objects:
  - name: vertical_line
    count: 1
    properties:
      - shape: vertical line segment
      - color: non-white (variable, e.g., red, magenta, yellow, azure)
      - location: defined by a single column index and a range of row indices
  - name: horizontal_line
    count: 1
    properties:
      - shape: horizontal line segment
      - color: non-white (variable, different from vertical_line, e.g., blue, green, orange, maroon)
      - location: defined by a single row index and a range of column indices

relationships_and_actions:
  - relationship: relative_position
    between: [vertical_line, horizontal_line]
    types:
      - horizontal_line is entirely to the right of vertical_line column
      - horizontal_line is not entirely to the right (left of, intersects, touches)
      - vertical_line is entirely above horizontal_line row
      - vertical_line intersects, touches, or is below horizontal_line row
  - action: extend_line
    target: EITHER vertical_line OR horizontal_line (mutually exclusive)
    conditions_and_rules:
      - condition: horizontal_line is entirely to the right of vertical_line
        action_details:
          - target: horizontal_line
          - direction: rightwards
          - length: 1 pixel
      - condition: horizontal_line is NOT entirely to the right of vertical_line
        action_details:
          - target: vertical_line
          - direction: downwards
          - length:
              - if vertical_line is entirely above horizontal_line: extend until the row just before horizontal_line's row
              - otherwise: extend by 1 pixel

output_specification: A grid identical to the input, except for the extension applied to the selected line according to the rules. The color of the extended portion matches the color of the line being extended.
