Input Grid:
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - Objects:
      - Type: Line
      - Shape: Diagonal (either main or anti-diagonal)
      - Color: C (variable, e.g., yellow/4, green/3)
      - Pixels: Set D = {(r, c) | input[r, c] == C}

Output Grid:
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)
  - Objects:
      - Type: Filled Region
      - Shape: Right-angled Triangle (bottom-left corner)
      - Color: C (same as input line color)
      - Defining Feature: Bounded by the original diagonal line, the left grid edge, and the bottom grid edge.

Transformation Rule:
  - Rule: Fill based on input line coordinates.
  - Condition: A pixel at output coordinates (ro, co) gets color C if there exists an input pixel coordinates (ri, ci) in set D such that ro >= ri AND co <= ci.
  - Otherwise: The pixel at output coordinates (ro, co) gets color white (0).
  - Relationship: The output is determined by iterating through all potential output pixels and checking their spatial relationship (below and to the left of, or on) relative to *any* of the original colored input pixels.
