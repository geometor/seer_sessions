            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids primarily consist of a white background (color 0). Embedded within this background is a single, contiguous diagonal line composed of pixels of a single non-white color (yellow/4 in the first example, green/3 in the second).\n2.  **Diagonal Types:** The diagonal line can either descend from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonal) or from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonal).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the original diagonal line. Additionally, a region below and to the left of this line is filled with the same non-white color.\n4.  **Transformation Effect:** The transformation effectively \"fills\" a triangular area. This area seems bounded by the original diagonal line (as the hypotenuse), the left edge of the grid, and the bottom edge of the grid. Regardless of whether the input line was a main diagonal or an anti-diagonal, the resulting filled shape appears in the bottom-left portion of the grid.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The non-white color used in the input diagonal is the *only* non-white color used in the output grid.\n6.  **Rule Identification:** A pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the output grid gets the non-white color if and only if there was a non-white pixel at position (row `ri`, column `ci`) in the input grid such that `r >= ri` and `c <= ci`. All other output pixels are white.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Identify the single non-white color (let's call it `fill_color`) present in the input grid.\n3.  Create a list (or set) containing the coordinates (`r_in`, `c_in`) of all pixels in the input grid that have the `fill_color`.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel position (`r_out`, `c_out`) in the grid dimensions (from row 0 to height-1, and column 0 to width-1).\n5.  For the current position (`r_out`, `c_out`), check if there exists *any* coordinate (`r_in`, `c_in`) in the list created in step 3 such that `r_out >= r_in` AND `c_out <= c_in`.\n6.  If such a coordinate pair exists (the condition in step 5 is true for at least one input pixel), set the color of the pixel at (`r_out`, `c_out`) in the output grid to `fill_color`.\n7.  If no such coordinate pair exists (the condition in step 5 is false for all input pixels), ensure the color of the pixel at (`r_out`, `c_out`) in the output grid is white (0). (This step is crucial if you started by copying the input grid, otherwise, if you started with a white grid, you only need to perform step 6).\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
