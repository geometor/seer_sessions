Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (train_1 and train_2).

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains two distinct, non-overlapping objects placed on a white (0) background.
2.  **Object Types:**
    *   One object consistently appears as a "frame" or "hollow shape". In both examples, this frame is made of azure (8) pixels and encloses a rectangular area of the white background.
    *   The other object is a smaller, potentially multi-colored "pattern". In train_1, it's a red (2) cross with a yellow (4) center. In train_2, it's a magenta (6) diamond/cross shape with a blue (1) center.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the original positions and shapes of both the "frame" object and the "pattern" object from the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the *copying* of the "pattern" object and *pasting* it into the empty space *inside* the "frame" object.
5.  **Placement/Alignment:** The copied pattern is aligned such that its top-left pixel (relative to its bounding box) is placed at the top-left position of the white space enclosed by the frame. The original background pixels within the frame are replaced by the corresponding pixels of the pattern.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors (colors 1 through 9) in the input grid. There should be exactly two such objects.
3.  Determine which of these two objects is the 'frame'. The frame object is characterized by completely enclosing a rectangular region consisting only of the background color (white, 0).
4.  Identify the other object as the 'pattern'.
5.  Find the bounding box of the 'pattern' object. Determine its top-left corner coordinates (min_row_pattern, min_col_pattern) and its dimensions (height_pattern, width_pattern).
6.  Find the rectangular region of background color enclosed by the 'frame' object. Determine the top-left coordinates (target_row, target_col) of this enclosed region.
7.  Iterate through each pixel within the bounding box of the 'pattern' object in the input grid. For each pixel at `(r, c)` where `min_row_pattern <= r < min_row_pattern + height_pattern` and `min_col_pattern <= c < min_col_pattern + width_pattern`:
    a.  Get the color `color_pattern` of the pixel `input[r][c]`.
    b.  Calculate the corresponding target coordinates in the output grid: `output_r = target_row + (r - min_row_pattern)` and `output_c = target_col + (c - min_col_pattern)`.
    c.  If the `color_pattern` is *not* the background color (0), update the pixel in the *output grid* at `(output_r, output_c)` with `color_pattern`. (This overwrites the background pixels within the frame's interior).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
