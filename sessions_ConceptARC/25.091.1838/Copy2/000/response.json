            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples (train_1 and train_2).\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains two distinct, non-overlapping objects placed on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Object Types:**\n    *   One object consistently appears as a \"frame\" or \"hollow shape\". In both examples, this frame is made of azure (8) pixels and encloses a rectangular area of the white background.\n    *   The other object is a smaller, potentially multi-colored \"pattern\". In train_1, it's a red (2) cross with a yellow (4) center. In train_2, it's a magenta (6) diamond/cross shape with a blue (1) center.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the original positions and shapes of both the \"frame\" object and the \"pattern\" object from the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the *copying* of the \"pattern\" object and *pasting* it into the empty space *inside* the \"frame\" object.\n5.  **Placement/Alignment:** The copied pattern is aligned such that its top-left pixel (relative to its bounding box) is placed at the top-left position of the white space enclosed by the frame. The original background pixels within the frame are replaced by the corresponding pixels of the pattern.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors (colors 1 through 9) in the input grid. There should be exactly two such objects.\n3.  Determine which of these two objects is the 'frame'. The frame object is characterized by completely enclosing a rectangular region consisting only of the background color (white, 0).\n4.  Identify the other object as the 'pattern'.\n5.  Find the bounding box of the 'pattern' object. Determine its top-left corner coordinates (min_row_pattern, min_col_pattern) and its dimensions (height_pattern, width_pattern).\n6.  Find the rectangular region of background color enclosed by the 'frame' object. Determine the top-left coordinates (target_row, target_col) of this enclosed region.\n7.  Iterate through each pixel within the bounding box of the 'pattern' object in the input grid. For each pixel at `(r, c)` where `min_row_pattern <= r < min_row_pattern + height_pattern` and `min_col_pattern <= c < min_col_pattern + width_pattern`:\n    a.  Get the color `color_pattern` of the pixel `input[r][c]`.\n    b.  Calculate the corresponding target coordinates in the output grid: `output_r = target_row + (r - min_row_pattern)` and `output_c = target_col + (c - min_col_pattern)`.\n    c.  If the `color_pattern` is *not* the background color (0), update the pixel in the *output grid* at `(output_r, output_c)` with `color_pattern`. (This overwrites the background pixels within the frame's interior).\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
