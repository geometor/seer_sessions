            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed because the `find_objects` function incorrectly assumed objects were monochromatic. It split multi-colored patterns into separate objects, violating the expectation of exactly two objects (one frame, one pattern) per grid. The subsequent `find_frame_and_pattern` logic, which relied on exactly two objects being passed to it, therefore failed to identify the roles correctly, resulting in the transformation step being skipped and the original input being returned.\n\nThe core transformation logic (copying the pattern into the frame's hollow) appears conceptually correct but was never executed due to the object identification failure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct `find_objects`:** Modify the function to identify contiguous areas of *any* non-background pixels, treating connected components as single objects regardless of internal color variation.\n2.  **Refine `find_frame_and_pattern`:** Adapt the function to use the corrected object definition. Implement robust criteria to distinguish the frame (monochromatic, encloses a pure background rectangle) from the pattern (the other object, potentially polychromatic).\n3.  **Verify Copy Logic:** Ensure the copy-paste mechanism correctly uses the identified pattern's pixels and the frame's inner top-left coordinate for placement.\n\n**Metrics (Based on `tool_code` analysis):**\n\n*   **Object Identification (Original Code):**\n    *   `train_1`: Failed. Found 3 objects (1 red, 1 yellow, 1 azure) instead of 2.\n    *   `train_2`: Failed. Found 10 objects (multiple magenta, multiple blue, 1 azure) instead of 2.\n*   **Object Identification (Corrected Code):**\n    *   `train_1`: Success. Found 2 objects: Object 1 (Pattern: {Red, Yellow}), Object 2 (Frame: {Azure}).\n    *   `train_2`: Success. Found 2 objects: Object 1 (Pattern: {Magenta, Blue}), Object 2 (Frame: {Azure}).\n*   **Frame/Pattern Role & Location Identification (Revised Code w/ Corrected Objects):**\n    *   `train_1`: Success. Identified Object 2 as Frame, Object 1 as Pattern. Found frame inner top-left: `(6, 4)`.\n    *   `train_2`: Success. Identified Object 2 as Frame, Object 1 as Pattern. Found frame inner top-left: `(7, 8)`.\n\nThe corrected object identification and refined role assignment logic successfully process both training examples according to the task requirements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
