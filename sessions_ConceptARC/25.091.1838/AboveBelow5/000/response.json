            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Color Interaction:** The transformation seems to involve interactions between different colors within the same column. Specifically, one color appears to \"fill\" upwards, replacing another color above it.\n3.  **Column Independence:** The changes in one column do not seem to affect other columns. The transformation operates column by column.\n4.  **Identifying Colors:** In `train_1`, blue (1) pixels are changed to green (3) above existing green pixels within the same column. In `train_2`, yellow (4) pixels are changed to orange (7) above existing orange pixels within the same column.\n5.  **Trigger Mechanism:** It appears that in columns containing exactly two non-background colors, one color acts as a 'trigger' (green in `train_1`, orange in `train_2`), and the other is the 'primary' color being replaced (blue in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`).\n6.  **Identifying Primary vs. Trigger:** In the examples, the 'primary' color (the one being replaced) seems to be the non-background color that appears more frequently within that specific column. The 'trigger' color is the less frequent one.\n7.  **Transformation Rule:** For each instance of a 'trigger' color pixel in a column, all pixels of the 'primary' color located in rows *above* that trigger pixel within the same column are changed to the 'trigger' color in the output. Pixels below the trigger pixel, or pixels that are not the 'primary' color, remain unchanged (unless affected by a trigger pixel lower down).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
