task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: White (0) is the consistent background.
  transformation_type: Column-wise color replacement.
objects:
  - type: Vertical Segments/Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange)
      - role: Can be 'primary' (replaced) or 'trigger' (initiates replacement) based on context within a column.
relationships:
  - type: Spatial (Vertical)
    description: The relative vertical position (above/below) of pixels within the same column is critical.
  - type: Color Interaction (within column)
    description: In columns with exactly two non-background colors, one color ('trigger') causes the other ('primary') to change color above it.
    identification:
      - primary_color: The non-background color with the higher pixel count in the column.
      - trigger_color: The non-background color with the lower pixel count in the column.
actions:
  - name: Column Analysis
    description: Examine each column independently.
  - name: Color Identification
    description: Identify non-background colors present in a column and their counts.
  - name: Conditional Transformation
    description: Apply color change only if exactly two non-background colors are found.
  - name: Upward Fill/Replacement
    description: For each pixel of the 'trigger' color, replace all pixels of the 'primary' color located strictly above it in the same column with the 'trigger' color.
