Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions. The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Color Interaction:** The transformation seems to involve interactions between different colors within the same column. Specifically, one color appears to "fill" upwards, replacing another color above it.
3.  **Column Independence:** The changes in one column do not seem to affect other columns. The transformation operates column by column.
4.  **Identifying Colors:** In `train_1`, blue (1) pixels are changed to green (3) above existing green pixels within the same column. In `train_2`, yellow (4) pixels are changed to orange (7) above existing orange pixels within the same column.
5.  **Trigger Mechanism:** It appears that in columns containing exactly two non-background colors, one color acts as a 'trigger' (green in `train_1`, orange in `train_2`), and the other is the 'primary' color being replaced (blue in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`).
6.  **Identifying Primary vs. Trigger:** In the examples, the 'primary' color (the one being replaced) seems to be the non-background color that appears more frequently within that specific column. The 'trigger' color is the less frequent one.
7.  **Transformation Rule:** For each instance of a 'trigger' color pixel in a column, all pixels of the 'primary' color located in rows *above* that trigger pixel within the same column are changed to the 'trigger' color in the output. Pixels below the trigger pixel, or pixels that are not the 'primary' color, remain unchanged (unless affected by a trigger pixel lower down).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - background_color: White (0) is the consistent background.
  transformation_type: Column-wise color replacement.
objects:
  - type: Vertical Segments/Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange)
      - role: Can be 'primary' (replaced) or 'trigger' (initiates replacement) based on context within a column.
relationships:
  - type: Spatial (Vertical)
    description: The relative vertical position (above/below) of pixels within the same column is critical.
  - type: Color Interaction (within column)
    description: In columns with exactly two non-background colors, one color ('trigger') causes the other ('primary') to change color above it.
    identification:
      - primary_color: The non-background color with the higher pixel count in the column.
      - trigger_color: The non-background color with the lower pixel count in the column.
actions:
  - name: Column Analysis
    description: Examine each column independently.
  - name: Color Identification
    description: Identify non-background colors present in a column and their counts.
  - name: Conditional Transformation
    description: Apply color change only if exactly two non-background colors are found.
  - name: Upward Fill/Replacement
    description: For each pixel of the 'trigger' color, replace all pixels of the 'primary' color located strictly above it in the same column with the 'trigger' color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (index `col` from 0 to width-1).
3.  For the current column `col`:
    a.  Identify all unique non-background colors present in this column and count the occurrences of each.
    b.  Check if there are exactly two unique non-background colors in this column.
    c.  If yes (exactly two non-background colors found):
        i.  Determine the `primary_color` (the one with the higher count) and the `trigger_color` (the one with the lower count).
        ii. Find all row indices where the `trigger_color` appears in this column (`trigger_rows`).
        iii. For each `row_trigger` in `trigger_rows`:
            1. Iterate through the rows *above* the trigger row (from `row = 0` up to `row = row_trigger - 1`).
            2. Check the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *original input grid*.
            3. If the input grid's pixel at `(row, col)` is the `primary_color`, change the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *output grid* to the `trigger_color`.
    d.  If no, (zero, one, or more than two non-background colors found), make no changes to this column in the output grid (it remains as copied from the input).
4.  After processing all columns, the final output grid is complete.
