            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n*   **Input Structure:** The input grids contain mostly background (white, 0). There are distinct colored objects. Specifically, we see pairs of objects:\n    1.  A single, isolated pixel of one color (e.g., red in `train_1`, azure in `train_2`). Let's call this the \"marker pixel\".\n    2.  A horizontal line segment of another color (e.g., green in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`). Let's call this the \"line segment\".\n*   **Spatial Relationship:** In both examples, the marker pixel appears exactly one row above the row containing the horizontal line segment.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The overall grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n    *   The original marker pixel disappears in the output (becomes white).\n    *   The horizontal line segment mostly remains, but the pixel at its horizontal midpoint might be overwritten.\n    *   A new vertical line of 3 pixels appears in the output.\n*   **Output Structure:**\n    *   The color of the new vertical line matches the color of the original marker pixel.\n    *   The vertical line is centered horizontally at the midpoint of the original horizontal line segment.\n    *   The vertical line is centered vertically on the row where the original horizontal line segment was located. It extends one pixel above and one pixel below that row.\n*   **Multiple Instances:** `train_2` shows that this transformation can occur multiple times independently within the same grid if multiple marker/line pairs exist.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each identified pair (marker pixel, line segment):\n    a.  Calculate the horizontal midpoint column of the line segment: `C_mid = C_start + floor((C_end - C_start) / 2)`.\n    b.
