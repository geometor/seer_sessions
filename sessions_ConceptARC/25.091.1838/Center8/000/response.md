Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

*   **Input Structure:** The input grids contain mostly background (white, 0). There are distinct colored objects. Specifically, we see pairs of objects:
    1.  A single, isolated pixel of one color (e.g., red in `train_1`, azure in `train_2`). Let's call this the "marker pixel".
    2.  A horizontal line segment of another color (e.g., green in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`). Let's call this the "line segment".
*   **Spatial Relationship:** In both examples, the marker pixel appears exactly one row above the row containing the horizontal line segment.
*   **Transformation:**
    *   The overall grid dimensions remain unchanged.
    *   The original marker pixel disappears in the output (becomes white).
    *   The horizontal line segment mostly remains, but the pixel at its horizontal midpoint might be overwritten.
    *   A new vertical line of 3 pixels appears in the output.
*   **Output Structure:**
    *   The color of the new vertical line matches the color of the original marker pixel.
    *   The vertical line is centered horizontally at the midpoint of the original horizontal line segment.
    *   The vertical line is centered vertically on the row where the original horizontal line segment was located. It extends one pixel above and one pixel below that row.
*   **Multiple Instances:** `train_2` shows that this transformation can occur multiple times independently within the same grid if multiple marker/line pairs exist.

**Facts**


```yaml
# Focus on train_1 first, then generalize based on train_2
train_1:
  input:
    grid_size: [13, 13]
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        color: red
        position: [1, 2]
        label: marker_pixel
      - type: line_segment
        color: green
        orientation: horizontal
        start_pos: [2, 2]
        end_pos: [2, 10]
        label: reference_line
    relationships:
      - type: relative_position
        object1: marker_pixel
        object2: reference_line
        details: marker_pixel is 1 row directly above the start of reference_line (or just generally 1 row above the line's row).
  output:
    grid_size: [13, 13]
    objects_removed:
      - label: marker_pixel # Original red pixel at [1, 2] is gone
    objects_added:
      - type: line_segment
        color: red # Same color as original marker_pixel
        orientation: vertical
        start_pos: [1, 6]
        end_pos: [3, 6]
        length: 3
        label: output_line
    objects_modified:
      - label: reference_line
        details: Pixel at [2, 6] (midpoint) changed from green to red (overwritten by output_line).
    relationships:
      - type: derivation
        object: output_line
        derived_from: [marker_pixel, reference_line]
        details:
          - color is from marker_pixel.
          - horizontal position (column 6) is the midpoint of reference_line (columns 2 to 10 -> length 9 -> midpoint index 4 -> col 2+4=6).
          - vertical position ([1, 6] to [3, 6]) is centered on the row of reference_line (row 2).

generalization_from_train_2:
  - Multiple independent instances of the marker/line pair can exist.
  - The colors of the marker (C1) and line (C2) can vary (azure/yellow), but C1 != C2 and neither is white.
  - The transformation logic (find midpoint, draw 3-pixel vertical line of color C1 centered on line's row and midpoint column, remove marker) holds for each instance.
  - Calculation of midpoint: col_mid = col_start + floor((col_end - col_start) / 2).
  - Output vertical line coordinates: (row_line - 1, col_mid), (row_line, col_mid), (row_line + 1, col_mid).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all pairs of objects consisting of:
    a.  A "marker pixel": A single pixel of color C1 (where C1 is not white) located at row `R_marker` and column `C_marker`. This pixel should be isolated, meaning its 8 neighbors are either white or part of the associated line segment below it.
    b.  A "line segment": A continuous horizontal line of pixels of color C2 (where C2 is not white, and C1 is not equal to C2) located at row `R_line = R_marker + 1`, spanning from column `C_start` to `C_end`.
3.  For each identified pair (marker pixel, line segment):
    a.  Calculate the horizontal midpoint column of the line segment: `C_mid = C_start + floor((C_end - C_start) / 2)`.
    b.  In the output grid, change the color of the original marker pixel's location (`R_marker`, `C_marker`) to white (0).
    c.  In the output grid, draw a 3-pixel vertical line using the marker pixel's color C1 at column `C_mid`. This line covers the cells: (`R_line - 1`, `C_mid`), (`R_line`, `C_mid`), and (`R_line + 1`, `C_mid`). Overwrite any existing colors at these locations.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
