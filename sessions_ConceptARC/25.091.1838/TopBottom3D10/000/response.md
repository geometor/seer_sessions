Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids with distinct colored objects and a background color (white, 0).
2.  **Objects:**
    *   Example 1: Features a blue (1) outlined rectangle filled with blue (2), and a separate large green (3) shape.
    *   Example 2: Features an azure (8) outlined shape filled with yellow (4), surrounded by a larger magenta (6) structure with internal white (0) spaces.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels based on their horizontal neighbors. The output grid is largely identical to the input, except for these targeted pixel changes.
4.  **Rule Identification:** Two distinct scenarios for color change based on horizontal adjacency seem apparent:
    *   **Scenario 1 (Example 1):** Non-background pixels (blue, 2) change color. If a blue (2) pixel is horizontally adjacent to a green (3) pixel, the blue pixel becomes green (3) in the output. The influencing color (green, 3) "spreads" to the adjacent target pixel (blue, 2).
    *   **Scenario 2 (Example 2):** Background pixels (white, 0) change color. If a white (0) pixel is horizontally adjacent to an azure (8) pixel, the white pixel takes on the color of the dominant non-background, non-influencing color in its immediate 8-neighbor vicinity (which is magenta, 6 in this case). The influencing color (azure, 8) acts as a trigger, causing the background pixel to adopt the color of its surrounding structure.
5.  **Adjacency:** Only horizontal (left/right) adjacency appears relevant to trigger the change. Vertical and diagonal adjacencies do not seem to cause transformations in these examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Example 1:
  Input Objects:
    - Object: Blue Rectangle
      Color_Outline: 1 (blue)
      Color_Fill: 2 (blue)
      Location: Top-left
    - Object: Green Shape
      Color: 3 (green)
      Location: Lower/Right
  Background_Color: 0 (white)
  Transformation:
    Target_Color: 2 (blue)
    Influencing_Color: 3 (green)
    Resulting_Color: 3 (green)
    Condition: Pixel is Target_Color AND horizontally adjacent to Influencing_Color.
    Rule_Type: Color Spread (Target becomes Influencing Color)

Example 2:
  Input Objects:
    - Object: Azure/Yellow Shape
      Color_Outline: 8 (azure)
      Color_Fill: 4 (yellow)
      Location: Top-center
    - Object: Magenta Structure
      Color: 6 (magenta)
      Internal_Color: 0 (white)
      Location: Surrounding Azure/Yellow shape and below
  Background_Color: 0 (white)
  Transformation:
    Target_Color: 0 (white)
    Influencing_Color: 8 (azure)
    Resulting_Color: 6 (magenta) # Derived from local neighborhood context
    Condition: Pixel is Target_Color AND horizontally adjacent to Influencing_Color.
    Rule_Type: Context Fill (Target becomes dominant neighbor color, excluding Target and Influencing colors)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel `P` at location `(row, col)` in the input grid. Let `C_P` be the color of pixel `P`.
3.  Examine the horizontal neighbors of `P`: the pixel to the left `L` at `(row, col-1)` (if it exists) and the pixel to the right `R` at `(row, col+1)` (if it exists). Let their colors be `C_L` and `C_R` respectively.
4.  Check if `P` is horizontally adjacent to a pixel `N` (where `N` is either `L` or `R`) such that `C_P` is different from `C_N`. Let `C_N` be the "influencing color".
5.  **Apply Transformation Rule based on `C_P`:**
    *   **If `C_P` is not the background color (0):** If pixel `P` (color `C_P`) is horizontally adjacent to pixel `N` (color `C_N`), change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to `C_N`.
    *   **If `C_P` is the background color (0):** If pixel `P` (color 0) is horizontally adjacent to pixel `N` (color `C_N`), find the most frequent color among the 8 neighbors of `P` in the input grid, excluding the background color (0) and the influencing color (`C_N`). If such a dominant color exists, change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to this dominant neighbor color. Otherwise, make no change.
6.  After checking all pixels, the finalized output grid represents the transformed result.
