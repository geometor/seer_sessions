            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids with distinct colored objects and a background color (white, 0).\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   Example 1: Features a blue (1) outlined rectangle filled with blue (2), and a separate large green (3) shape.\n    *   Example 2: Features an azure (8) outlined shape filled with yellow (4), surrounded by a larger magenta (6) structure with internal white (0) spaces.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels based on their horizontal neighbors. The output grid is largely identical to the input, except for these targeted pixel changes.\n4.  **Rule Identification:** Two distinct scenarios for color change based on horizontal adjacency seem apparent:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Example 1):** Non-background pixels (blue, 2) change color. If a blue (2) pixel is horizontally adjacent to a green (3) pixel, the blue pixel becomes green (3) in the output. The influencing color (green, 3) \"spreads\" to the adjacent target pixel (blue, 2).\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Example 2):** Background pixels (white, 0) change color. If a white (0) pixel is horizontally adjacent to an azure (8) pixel, the white pixel takes on the color of the dominant non-background, non-influencing color in its immediate 8-neighbor vicinity (which is magenta, 6 in this case). The influencing color (azure, 8) acts as a trigger, causing the background pixel to adopt the color of its surrounding structure.\n5.  **Adjacency:** Only horizontal (left/right) adjacency appears relevant to trigger the change. Vertical and diagonal adjacencies do not seem to cause transformations in these examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Let `C_P` be the color of pixel `P`.\n3.  Examine the horizontal neighbors of `P`: the pixel to the left `L` at `(row, col-1)` (if it exists) and the pixel to the right `R` at `(row, col+1)` (if it exists). Let their colors be `C_L` and `C_R` respectively.\n4.  Check if `P` is horizontally adjacent to a pixel `N` (where `N` is either `L` or `R`) such that `C_P` is different from `C_N`. Let `C_N` be the \"influencing color\".\n5.  **Apply Transformation Rule based on `C_P`:**\n    *   **If `C_P` is not the background color (0):** If pixel `P` (color `C_P`) is horizontally adjacent to pixel `N` (color `C_N`), change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to `C_N`.\n    *   **If `C_P` is the background color (0):** If pixel `P` (color 0) is horizontally adjacent to pixel `N` (color `C_N`), find the most frequent color among the 8 neighbors of `P` in the input grid, excluding the background color (0) and the influencing color (`C_N`). If such a dominant color exists, change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to this dominant neighbor color. Otherwise, make no change.\n6.
