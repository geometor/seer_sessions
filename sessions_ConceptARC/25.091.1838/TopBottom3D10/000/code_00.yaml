Example 1:
  Input Objects:
    - Object: Blue Rectangle
      Color_Outline: 1 (blue)
      Color_Fill: 2 (blue)
      Location: Top-left
    - Object: Green Shape
      Color: 3 (green)
      Location: Lower/Right
  Background_Color: 0 (white)
  Transformation:
    Target_Color: 2 (blue)
    Influencing_Color: 3 (green)
    Resulting_Color: 3 (green)
    Condition: Pixel is Target_Color AND horizontally adjacent to Influencing_Color.
    Rule_Type: Color Spread (Target becomes Influencing Color)

Example 2:
  Input Objects:
    - Object: Azure/Yellow Shape
      Color_Outline: 8 (azure)
      Color_Fill: 4 (yellow)
      Location: Top-center
    - Object: Magenta Structure
      Color: 6 (magenta)
      Internal_Color: 0 (white)
      Location: Surrounding Azure/Yellow shape and below
  Background_Color: 0 (white)
  Transformation:
    Target_Color: 0 (white)
    Influencing_Color: 8 (azure)
    Resulting_Color: 6 (magenta) # Derived from local neighborhood context
    Condition: Pixel is Target_Color AND horizontally adjacent to Influencing_Color.
    Rule_Type: Context Fill (Target becomes dominant neighbor color, excluding Target and Influencing colors)
