"""
Identify contiguous non-background color objects.
For each object, determine its bounding box.
Check if the object is a solid rectangle/square (i.e., it completely fills its bounding box).
If an object is a solid rectangle/square, change the color of its interior pixels (pixels not on the border within the bounding box) to the background color (white, 0).
Leave non-solid objects and the background unchanged.
