background_color: 0 # white
transformation_rule:
  - Identify all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
  - For each object:
      - Determine its color and bounding box.
      - Check if the object is a 'solid rectangle' (all pixels within its bounding box in the input grid share the object's color).
      - If the object IS a solid rectangle:
          - Action: Hollow out.
          - Change the color of its interior pixels (those not on the border of the bounding box) to the background color (0).
          - Requires width > 2 and height > 2 for an interior to exist.
      - If the object IS NOT a solid rectangle:
          - Action: Fill internal holes.
          - Change the color of any background-colored pixels (0) located *within* the object's bounding box to the object's color.
