However, the comparison between the code's output (as reported) and the expected output reveals that the code only performed this hollowing action. The expected output requires an additional transformation: non-solid rectangular objects (like the 'U' and 'C' shapes) should have their internal background-colored pixels (within their bounding box) filled with the object's color. The previous code did not implement this \"filling\" action, leading to the discrepancy. The reported \"Pixels Off: 5\" corresponds exactly to the pixels that should have been filled but weren't.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Perception:** Acknowledge the dual nature of the transformation: hollow solid rectangles, fill non-solid objects within their bounding box.\n2.  **Update Logic:** Modify the `transform` function. After identifying objects and checking `is_solid_rectangle`:\n    *   If `True`, perform the hollowing operation as before.\n    *   If `False`, iterate through the pixels within the object's bounding box. If a pixel has the background color, change it to the object's color in the output grid.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect this dual rule in the YAML facts and the natural language program.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on comparing the input and expected output for `train_1`:\n<ctrl97>tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input for train_1\ninput_grid_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\"\"\"\n\n# Expected Output for train_1\nexpected_output_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\n0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\"\"\"\n\ndef parse_grid(grid_str):\n    return np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid_str.strip().split('\\n')])\n\ninput_grid = parse_grid(input_grid_str)\nexpected_output_grid = parse_grid(expected_output_str)\n\n# Find differences\ndiff = input_grid != expected_output_grid\ndiff_coords = np.where(diff)\ndiff_count = np.sum(diff)\n\nprint(f\"Input Grid Shape: {input_grid.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output Grid Shape: {expected_output_grid.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Background Color (assumed): 0 (white)\")\nprint(f\"Number of pixels changed between input and expected output: {diff_count}\")\n\n# Identify objects and their actions based on the refined hypothesis\n# Object 1: Yellow 'U' (rows 1-4, cols 1-4), color 4.
