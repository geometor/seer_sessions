"""
Transforms an input grid based on object properties:
1. Identifies all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
2. For each object, determines its bounding box and checks if it's a 'solid rectangle' 
   (all pixels within its bounding box in the input grid share the object's color).
3. If the object IS a solid rectangle:
    - Hollows it out by changing its interior pixels (those not on the border of the 
      bounding box) to the background color (0), provided an interior exists 
      (width > 2 and height > 2).
4. If the object IS NOT a solid rectangle:
    - Fills its internal holes by changing any background-colored pixels (0) located 
      *within* the object's bounding box to the object's color.
