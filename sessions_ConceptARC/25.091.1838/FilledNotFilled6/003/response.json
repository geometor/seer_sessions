Identifies all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).\n2. For each object, determines its bounding box and checks if it's a 'solid rectangle' \n   (all pixels within its bounding box in the input grid share the object's color).\n3. If the object IS a solid rectangle:\n    - Hollows it out by changing its interior pixels (those not on the border of the \n      bounding box) to the background color (0), provided an interior exists \n      (width > 2 and height > 2).\n4. If the object IS NOT a solid rectangle:\n    - Fills its internal holes by changing any background-colored pixels (0) located \n      *within* the object's bounding box to the object's color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, background_color=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        background_color (int): The color considered background.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, each representing an object with \n              'color', 'pixels' (list of (r, c) tuples), and \n              'bounding_box' (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            #
