The output grid shows that the solid squares (gray and yellow) have been hollowed out, meaning their interior pixels have been changed to the background color (white), while their borders remain intact. The non-solid shapes (yellow 'U' and green 'C') are unchanged. The transformation rule appears to be: identify solid rectangular or square objects and make them hollow by changing their internal pixels to the background color.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
