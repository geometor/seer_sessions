*   **Perception:** The input grid contains four distinct objects on a white background: a yellow 'U' shape, a solid gray square, a green 'C' shape, and a solid yellow square. The output grid shows that the solid squares (gray and yellow) have been hollowed out, meaning their interior pixels have been changed to the background color (white), while their borders remain intact. The non-solid shapes (yellow 'U' and green 'C') are unchanged. The transformation rule appears to be: identify solid rectangular or square objects and make them hollow by changing their internal pixels to the background color.

    transformation_rule:
      - Identify contiguous non-background color objects.
      - For each object, determine its bounding box.
      - Check if the object is a solid rectangle/square (i.e., it completely fills its bounding box).
      - If an object is a solid rectangle/square, change the color of its interior pixels (pixels not on the border within the bounding box) to the background color (white, 0).
      - Leave non-solid objects and the background unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid, where an object is a contiguous group of pixels with the same non-background color (not white).
    2.  For each identified object:
        a.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses the object.
        b.  Check if the object perfectly fills this bounding box (i.e., all pixels within the bounding box have the object's color). This identifies solid rectangles or squares.
        c.  If the object is a solid rectangle/square:
            i.  Identify the interior pixels of the object. These are the pixels within the bounding box that are not part of the outermost layer (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the object within that box.
            ii. Change the color of these interior pixels to the background color (white, 0).
        d.  If the object is not a solid rectangle/square, leave it unchanged.
    3.  Output the modified grid.
