            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis based only on the first example led to an overly simplistic hypothesis: keep all azure (8) pixels and discard others. Testing this against all training examples revealed inconsistencies. The key insight gained from analyzing the failures is that the retention of azure (8) pixels is conditional and depends on the context of the *row* in which they appear. Specifically, azure pixels are discarded if the predominant color within their row (excluding white (0) and azure (8)) is green (3). Otherwise, they are kept. The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to incorporate this row-based conditional filtering.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nTo verify the row-based filtering hypothesis, the dominant color (excluding white (0) and azure (8)) for each relevant row in each example was determined:\n"
