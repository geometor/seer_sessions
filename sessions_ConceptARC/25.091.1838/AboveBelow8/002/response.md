**General Assessment**

The initial analysis based only on the first example led to an overly simplistic hypothesis: keep all azure (8) pixels and discard others. Testing this against all training examples revealed inconsistencies. The key insight gained from analyzing the failures is that the retention of azure (8) pixels is conditional and depends on the context of the *row* in which they appear. Specifically, azure pixels are discarded if the predominant color within their row (excluding white (0) and azure (8)) is green (3). Otherwise, they are kept. The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to incorporate this row-based conditional filtering.

**Metrics**

To verify the row-based filtering hypothesis, the dominant color (excluding white (0) and azure (8)) for each relevant row in each example was determined:

``` python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def get_dominant_color(row):
    """Finds the most common color in a row, excluding white (0) and azure (8)."""
    filtered_row = [pixel for pixel in row if pixel != 0 and pixel != 8]
    if not filtered_row:
        return None
    counts = Counter(filtered_row)
    dominant_color, _ = counts.most_common(1)[0]
    # Ensure the returned type is a standard Python int if it's a numpy int type
    if isinstance(dominant_color, np.integer):
        dominant_color = int(dominant_color)
    return dominant_color

The metrics confirm the hypothesis:
-   **Example 1**: Rows 3 and 4 have green (3) as the dominant color (excluding white/azure). Azure (8) pixels in these rows are discarded. All other rows with azure pixels have non-green dominant colors (magenta-6, orange-7, yellow-4), and their azure pixels are kept. The generated output matches the expected output.
-   **Example 2**: Rows 0 and 1 have green (3) as the dominant color. Azure (8) pixels in these rows are discarded. All other rows with azure pixels have non-green dominant colors (red-2, orange-7, maroon-9, blue-1), and their azure pixels are kept. The generated output matches the expected output.
-   **Example 3**: Rows 1 through 5 have green (3) as the dominant color. Azure (8) pixels in these rows are discarded. Rows 6 through 9 have blue (1) as the dominant color, and their azure pixels are kept. The generated output matches the expected output.

    rule: |
      1. Initialize output grid with white (0).
      2. For each row `r`: Determine its dominant color `d` (ignoring 0 and 8).
      3. For each pixel at `(r, c)` in the input:
         - If the pixel is azure (8) AND the dominant color `d` of row `r` is NOT green (3):
           Copy azure (8) to the output grid at `(r, c)`.
         - Otherwise:
           The corresponding output pixel remains white (0).

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color white (0).
2.  For each row `r` in the input grid:
    a.  Identify all pixel colors present in the row, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
    b.  Determine the most frequent color among these remaining colors. This is the "dominant row color". If no such colors exist in the row, consider the condition for keeping azure pixels met by default (i.e., the dominant color is not green).
    c.  Check if this dominant row color is green (3).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the input pixel at `(r, c)` is azure (8):
        i.  Retrieve the result from step 2c for row `r`.
        ii. If the dominant row color for row `r` was *not* green (3), set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).
    b.  If the input pixel is not azure (8), or if it is azure (8) but the dominant color of its row is green (3), leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid as white (0).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
