Each input grid contains various colored pixels, including a significant number of azure (8) pixels, often interspersed within or forming patterns across other colored regions. The corresponding output grid retains only the azure (8) pixels in their original positions, while all other pixels are replaced with the background color, white (0). The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. The transformation acts as a selective filter, isolating the azure pixels against a uniform white background.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
