            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of colored pixels as input and produces a modified grid as output.\n2.  **Colors:** Specific colors seem to trigger actions or are targets of actions: azure (8), green (3), yellow (4), white (0). Other colors (red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), orange (7)) are present but might be part of larger structures or treated as 'noise'.\n3.  **Structures/Objects:** The grids contain contiguous blocks of color forming distinct objects. These can be simple spots, lines, or complex shapes like hollow rectangles.\n4.  **Key Relationships:**\n    *   **Adjacency:** The relationship between adjacent pixels (orthogonal and diagonal) is critical, particularly between azure (8) and green (3) in `train_1`.\n    *   **Object Size:** The number of pixels in a contiguous object seems relevant for distinguishing 'major' objects from 'minor' ones or 'noise' in `train_2`.\n    *   **Containment:** Some pixels exist 'inside' shapes formed by other colors (e.g., `train_2`), although this might be captured by the object size rule.\n5.  **Transformations:** The core transformations observed are:\n    *   Changing specific pixels to white (0) based on their color and/or adjacency to other colors (`train_1`, `train_2`).\n    *   Changing pixels of one color to another specific color (`train_3`).\n    *   Keeping only the largest objects and removing everything else (`train_2`).\n6.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule appears to be conditional, depending on the specific content of the input grid. Three distinct rules were identified, applied based on the presence and arrangement of certain colors and object structures.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
