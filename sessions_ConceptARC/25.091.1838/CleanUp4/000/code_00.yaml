task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  color_space: 0-9 integer map
  max_size: 30x30
observed_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties: [color, location]
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous block of same-colored pixels (non-white)
    properties: [color, size (pixel_count), shape, location, pixels]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Orthogonal or diagonal neighboring pixels
    relevance: Used in rule 1 (azure(8) affecting adjacent green(3))
  - type: relative_size
    definition: Comparing pixel counts of different objects
    relevance: Used in rule 2 (selecting the 4 largest objects)
transformations:
  - type: color_change
    details:
      - change_to: white (0) # Removal
        conditions:
          - rule_1: pixel is azure(8) OR pixel is green(3) adjacent to azure(8)
          - rule_2: pixel is not part of the 4 largest objects
      - change_to: green (3)
        conditions:
          - rule_3: pixel is yellow (4)
conditional_rules:
  - condition: Presence of azure(8) AND green(3) pixels, with at least one instance of adjacency (orthogonal or diagonal) between them.
    applies_rule: rule_1
  - condition: Absence of condition_1 AND presence of >= 4 distinct contiguous non-white objects with size >= 10 pixels.
    applies_rule: rule_2
  - condition: Absence of condition_1 and condition_2 AND presence of yellow(4) pixels.
    applies_rule: rule_3
  - default: No change (implied if no conditions met)
