Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of colored pixels as input and produces a modified grid as output.
2.  **Colors:** Specific colors seem to trigger actions or are targets of actions: azure (8), green (3), yellow (4), white (0). Other colors (red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), orange (7)) are present but might be part of larger structures or treated as 'noise'.
3.  **Structures/Objects:** The grids contain contiguous blocks of color forming distinct objects. These can be simple spots, lines, or complex shapes like hollow rectangles.
4.  **Key Relationships:**
    *   **Adjacency:** The relationship between adjacent pixels (orthogonal and diagonal) is critical, particularly between azure (8) and green (3) in `train_1`.
    *   **Object Size:** The number of pixels in a contiguous object seems relevant for distinguishing 'major' objects from 'minor' ones or 'noise' in `train_2`.
    *   **Containment:** Some pixels exist 'inside' shapes formed by other colors (e.g., `train_2`), although this might be captured by the object size rule.
5.  **Transformations:** The core transformations observed are:
    *   Changing specific pixels to white (0) based on their color and/or adjacency to other colors (`train_1`, `train_2`).
    *   Changing pixels of one color to another specific color (`train_3`).
    *   Keeping only the largest objects and removing everything else (`train_2`).
6.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation rule appears to be conditional, depending on the specific content of the input grid. Three distinct rules were identified, applied based on the presence and arrangement of certain colors and object structures.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  color_space: 0-9 integer map
  max_size: 30x30
observed_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties: [color, location]
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous block of same-colored pixels (non-white)
    properties: [color, size (pixel_count), shape, location, pixels]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Orthogonal or diagonal neighboring pixels
    relevance: Used in rule 1 (azure(8) affecting adjacent green(3))
  - type: relative_size
    definition: Comparing pixel counts of different objects
    relevance: Used in rule 2 (selecting the 4 largest objects)
transformations:
  - type: color_change
    details:
      - change_to: white (0) # Removal
        conditions:
          - rule_1: pixel is azure(8) OR pixel is green(3) adjacent to azure(8)
          - rule_2: pixel is not part of the 4 largest objects
      - change_to: green (3)
        conditions:
          - rule_3: pixel is yellow (4)
conditional_rules:
  - condition: Presence of azure(8) AND green(3) pixels, with at least one instance of adjacency (orthogonal or diagonal) between them.
    applies_rule: rule_1
  - condition: Absence of condition_1 AND presence of >= 4 distinct contiguous non-white objects with size >= 10 pixels.
    applies_rule: rule_2
  - condition: Absence of condition_1 and condition_2 AND presence of yellow(4) pixels.
    applies_rule: rule_3
  - default: No change (implied if no conditions met)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Examine the colors and their arrangement.
2.  **Check Rule 1 Condition:** Determine if the grid contains both azure (8) pixels and green (3) pixels, AND if any azure (8) pixel is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any green (3) pixel.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 1):** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the input grid. Change all azure (8) pixels in the copy to white (0). Change all green (3) pixels in the copy that had an azure (8) neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) in the *original* input grid to white (0). Output the modified copy.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to the next check.
3.  **Check Rule 2 Condition:** Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the grid. Count how many of these objects have a size (pixel count) of 10 or more. Check if this count is 4 or greater.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 2):** Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects and calculate their sizes. Select the four objects with the largest sizes (if there's a tie for the 4th position, include all tied objects, potentially resulting in more than 4 being kept). Create a new grid initialized to white (0). Copy only the pixels belonging to these selected largest objects from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original colors and positions. Output the new grid.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to the next check.
4.  **Check Rule 3 Condition:** Determine if the grid contains any yellow (4) pixels.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 3):** Create a copy of the input grid. Change all yellow (4) pixels in the copy to green (3). Output the modified copy.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to the default case.
5.  **Default:** If none of the above conditions were met, output the input grid unchanged.

This function transforms an input grid based on one of three conditional rules or returns the grid unchanged if no rule applies.

Rule 1: If the grid contains both azure (8) and green (3) pixels, and at least one azure pixel is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a green pixel, then change all azure pixels to white (0) and change all green pixels that were adjacent to an azure pixel to white (0).

Rule 2: If Rule 1 does not apply, find all contiguous non-white objects. If there are 4 or more distinct objects with a size (pixel count) of 10 or more, keep only the 4 largest objects (including ties for the 4th position) and set all other pixels to white (0).

Rule 3: If neither Rule 1 nor Rule 2 applies, and the grid contains yellow (4) pixels, change all yellow pixels to green (3).

Default: If none of the above conditions are met, return the input grid unchanged.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis identified three distinct transformation rules based on the examples. The provided code implemented these rules sequentially. The test results show:
*   **Example 1 (Rule 1 Failure):** The code incorrectly removed green (3) pixels adjacent to azure (8). The expected output only removes the azure (8) pixels themselves, leaving the adjacent green pixels intact. The rule needs adjustment: only azure pixels are removed if adjacent to green.
*   **Example 2 (Rule 2 Failure):** The code correctly identified this case for Rule 2 (keeping large objects) but produced a slightly incorrect output, removing one pixel that should have been kept. The previous implementation kept objects with size >= 10 if there were 4+ such objects. Reviewing the example, the rule seems to be simpler: keep exactly the 4 largest non-white objects, regardless of their size threshold, and remove everything else. The single pixel difference suggests the objects kept might be slightly wrong, possibly due to how ties in size are handled or the object identification itself. We need to recalculate the objects and their sizes for `train_2`.
*   **Example 3 (Rule 3 Success):** The code correctly applied the rule to change yellow (4) to green (3).

**Strategy:**
1.  Correct Rule 1: Modify the logic to only remove azure (8) pixels if they have a green (3) neighbor (8-connectivity), leaving the green pixels untouched.
2.  Correct Rule 2: Modify the logic to find all non-white objects (4-connectivity), sort them by size (descending), select the top 4 objects (handling ties appropriately - standard sorting should suffice unless specific tie-breaking is needed, but keeping all tied for 4th seems reasonable), and construct the output grid using only the pixels from these top 4 objects.
3.  Keep Rule 3 as is.
4.  Verify the updated logic against all examples.

**Analysis of Metrics (Example 2):**

The code execution confirms:
1.  Rule 1 (Azure/Green adjacency) does not apply to `train_2` input.
2.  Rule 2 should apply.
3.  The top 4 largest objects (using 4-connectivity) are: Yellow (4, size 21), Azure (8, size 16), Red (2, size 14), and Magenta (6, size 14).
4.  Constructing the output using only these 4 objects results in a grid that is *almost* identical to the expected output.
5.  The discrepancy is exactly the pixel at `(7, 6)`, which is blue (1) in the input grid. This pixel is part of a very small blue object (size 1) according to the 4-connectivity object finding.
6.  The *expected* output grid contains a yellow object (color 4) at `(7, 7)` to `(7, 10)` and `(8, 7)`, `(8, 10)`, etc., matching the largest yellow object (size 21) found. It *does not* contain the blue pixel at `(7, 6)`.
7.  Comparing the `reconstructed_grid` from the top 4 objects with the `expected_output_2`, they are identical.

**Conclusion:** The previous execution error for Example 2 must have stemmed from an earlier, incorrect implementation of Rule 2 (e.g., the size >= 10 threshold logic). The current logic, keeping exactly the top 4 largest objects identified via 4-connectivity, produces the correct output for Example 2. The previous failed test result description seems inconsistent with the actual expected output for Example 2. The refined Rule 2 (keep exactly top 4) appears correct.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Examine the colors and their arrangement.
2.  **Check Rule 1 Condition:** Determine if the grid contains both azure (8) pixels and green (3) pixels, AND if any azure (8) pixel is adjacent (using 8-connectivity: orthogonal or diagonal) to any green (3) pixel.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 1):** Create a copy of the input grid. Identify all azure (8) pixels in the *original* input grid that have at least one green (3) neighbor (8-connectivity). Change *only these specific azure (8) pixels* in the copy to white (0). Output the modified copy and stop.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to Rule 2.
3.  **Apply Rule 2:** Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the grid using 4-connectivity (orthogonal neighbors only). Calculate the size (pixel count) of each object. Sort the objects by size in descending order. Select the four objects with the largest sizes. If there is a tie for the 4th position, include all objects tied for that position. Create a new grid initialized entirely with white (0). Copy only the pixels belonging to these selected top 4 (or more, in case of ties) objects from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original colors and positions. Output the new grid and stop.
4.  **Check Rule 3 Condition:** (This step is only reached if Rule 1 was False and Rule 2 did not apply - which shouldn't happen with the current definition of Rule 2 applying whenever Rule 1 doesn't). Determine if the grid contains any yellow (4) pixels.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 3):** Create a copy of the input grid. Change all yellow (4) pixels in the copy to green (3). Output the modified copy and stop.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to the default case.
5.  **Default:** (This step is only reached if Rule 1 was False, Rule 2 did not apply, and Rule 3 was False). Output the input grid unchanged.

*Self-Correction Note:* The structure implies Rule 2 *always* applies if Rule 1 doesn't. Therefore, Rule 3 and Default will likely never be reached under the current interpretation derived from the examples. Example 3 triggered Rule 3 only because the conditions for Rule 1 and the *previous incorrect* Rule 2 were not met. With the refined Rule 2 (keep top 4), Example 3 would now trigger Rule 2 instead of Rule 3. Let's re-examine Example 3 in light of the new Rule 2.

**Re-evaluation of Example 3 with New Rules:**
Input:

```
3 4 3 3 3 3
3 3 2 2 2 2
3 3 2 3 4 2
3 4 2 3 3 2
3 3 2 2 2 2
4 3 3 3 3 3
```

- Rule 1: No azure (8), so Rule 1 is False.
- Rule 2: Find objects (4-conn): Green (3) object, Red (2) object, several Yellow (4) objects (size 1 or 2). Let's list them.

```
**Revised Assessment:**

The re-evaluation confirms that applying the refined Rule 2 (keep top 4 objects) to Example 3 produces the *wrong* output. The expected output for Example 3 comes from applying Rule 3 (Yellow to Green).

This means the condition for applying Rule 2 is *not* simply "Rule 1 is false". There must be a specific condition that triggers Rule 2, which is met by Example 2 but not by Example 1 or Example 3.

Let's reconsider the condition for Rule 2. The original hypothesis was "Absence of condition_1 AND presence of >= 4 distinct contiguous non-white objects with size >= 10 pixels."

*   Example 1: Rule 1 applies.
*   Example 2: Rule 1 is false. Objects >= size 10 are: Yellow(21), Azure(16), Red(14), Magenta(14). There are exactly 4 such objects. Condition met. Rule 2 applies.
*   Example 3: Rule 1 is false. Objects >= size 10 are: Green(13), Red(12). There are only 2 such objects. Condition not met. Proceed to Rule 3. Rule 3 applies (Yellow exists).

This original condition for Rule 2 seems correct after all. The implementation failed because it kept *all* objects >= size 10, not necessarily just the top 4 if there were more than 4. The *action* for Rule 2 should be: if the condition (Rule 1 false AND >=4 objects size >=10) is met, then keep *only* those objects meeting the size >= 10 criterion.

**Final Refined Logic:**

1.  **Check Rule 1:** Azure(8) adjacent (8-conn) to Green(3)?
    *   Yes: Apply Rule 1 Action (Remove only the adjacent Azure pixels). Stop.
    *   No: Proceed.
2.  **Check Rule 2:** Are there 4 or more distinct non-white objects (4-conn) with size >= 10?
    *   Yes: Apply Rule 2 Action (Keep *only* the objects with size >= 10). Stop.
    *   No: Proceed.
3.  **Check Rule 3:** Are there any Yellow(4) pixels?
    *   Yes: Apply Rule 3 Action (Change Yellow to Green). Stop.
    *   No: Proceed.
4.  **Default:** Output unchanged.

**Final Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Examine the colors and their arrangement.
2.  **Check Rule 1 Condition:** Determine if the grid contains both azure (8) pixels and green (3) pixels, AND if any azure (8) pixel is adjacent (using 8-connectivity: orthogonal or diagonal) to any green (3) pixel.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 1 Action):** Create a copy of the input grid. Identify all azure (8) pixels in the *original* input grid that have at least one green (3) neighbor (8-connectivity). Change *only these specific azure (8) pixels* in the copy to white (0). Output the modified copy and stop.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to Check Rule 2.
3.  **Check Rule 2 Condition:** Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the grid using 4-connectivity. Count how many of these objects have a size (pixel count) of 10 or more. Check if this count is 4 or greater.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 2 Action):** Identify all objects with size >= 10. Create a new grid initialized entirely with white (0). Copy *only* the pixels belonging to these large objects (size >= 10) from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their original colors and positions. Output the new grid and stop.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to Check Rule 3.
4.  **Check Rule 3 Condition:** Determine if the grid contains any yellow (4) pixels.
    *   **If True (Apply Rule 3 Action):** Create a copy of the input grid. Change all yellow (4) pixels in the copy to green (3). Output the modified copy and stop.
    *   **If False:** Proceed to the default case.
5.  **Default:** Output the input grid unchanged.
