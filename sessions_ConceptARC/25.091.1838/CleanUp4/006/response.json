            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis identified three distinct transformation rules based on the examples. The provided code implemented these rules sequentially. The test results show:\n*   **Example 1 (Rule 1 Failure):** The code incorrectly removed green (3) pixels adjacent to azure (8). The expected output only removes the azure (8) pixels themselves, leaving the adjacent green pixels intact. The rule needs adjustment: only azure pixels are removed if adjacent to green.\n*   **Example 2 (Rule 2 Failure):** The code correctly identified this case for Rule 2 (keeping large objects) but produced a slightly incorrect output, removing one pixel that should have been kept. The previous implementation kept objects with size >= 10 if there were 4+ such objects. Reviewing the example, the rule seems to be simpler: keep exactly the 4 largest non-white objects, regardless of their size threshold, and remove everything else. The single pixel difference suggests the objects kept might be slightly wrong, possibly due to how ties in size are handled or the object identification itself. We need to recalculate the objects and their sizes for `train_2`.\n*   **Example 3 (Rule 3 Success):** The code correctly applied the rule to change yellow (4) to green (3).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Correct Rule 1: Modify the logic to only remove azure (8) pixels if they have a green (3) neighbor (8-connectivity), leaving the green pixels untouched.\n2.  Correct Rule 2: Modify the logic to find all non-white objects (4-connectivity), sort them by size (descending), select the top 4 objects (handling ties appropriately - standard sorting should suffice unless specific tie-breaking is needed, but keeping all tied for 4th seems reasonable), and construct the output grid using only the pixels from these top 4 objects.\n3.  Keep Rule 3 as is.\n4.  Verify the updated logic against all examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Example 2):**\n"

The top 4 largest objects (using 4-connectivity) are: Yellow (4, size 21), Azure (8, size 16), Red (2, size 14), and Magenta (6, size 14).\n4.  Constructing the output using only these 4 objects results in a grid that is *almost* identical to the expected output.\n5.  The discrepancy is exactly the pixel at `(7, 6)`, which is blue (1) in the input grid. This pixel is part of a very small blue object (size 1) according to the 4-connectivity object finding.\n6.  The *expected* output grid contains a yellow object (color 4) at `(7, 7)` to `(7, 10)` and `(8, 7)`, `(8, 10)`, etc., matching the largest yellow object (size 21) found. It *does not* contain the blue pixel at `(7, 6)`.\n7.  Comparing the `reconstructed_grid` from the top 4 objects with the `expected_output_2`, they are identical.\n\n**Conclusion:** The previous execution error for Example 2 must have stemmed from an earlier, incorrect implementation of Rule 2 (e.g., the size >= 10 threshold logic). The current logic, keeping exactly the top 4 largest objects identified via 4-connectivity, produces the correct output for Example 2. The previous failed test result description seems inconsistent with the actual expected output for Example 2. The refined Rule 2 (keep exactly top 4) appears correct.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts:**\n\n"

The expected output for Example 3 comes from applying Rule 3 (Yellow to Green).\n\nThis means the condition for applying Rule 2 is *not* simply \"Rule 1 is false\". There must be a specific condition that triggers Rule 2, which is met by Example 2 but not by Example 1 or Example 3.\n\nLet's reconsider the condition for Rule 2. The original hypothesis was \"Absence of condition_1 AND presence of >= 4 distinct contiguous non-white objects with size >= 10 pixels.\"\n\n*   Example 1: Rule 1 applies.\n*   Example 2: Rule 1 is false. Objects >= size 10 are: Yellow(21), Azure(16), Red(14), Magenta(14). There are exactly 4 such objects. Condition met. Rule 2 applies.\n*   Example 3: Rule 1 is false. Objects >= size 10 are: Green(13), Red(12). There are only 2 such objects. Condition not met. Proceed to Rule 3. Rule 3 applies (Yellow exists).\n\nThis original condition for Rule 2 seems correct after all. The implementation failed because it kept *all* objects >= size 10, not necessarily just the top 4 if there were more than 4. The *action* for Rule 2 should be: if the condition (Rule 1 false AND >=4 objects size >=10) is met, then keep *only* those objects meeting the size >= 10 criterion.\n\n**Final Refined Logic:**\n\n1.  **Check Rule 1:** Azure(8) adjacent (8-conn) to Green(3)?\n    *   Yes: Apply Rule 1 Action (Remove only the adjacent Azure pixels). Stop.\n    *   No: Proceed.\n2.  **Check Rule 2:** Are there 4 or more distinct non-white objects (4-conn) with size >= 10?\n    *   Yes: Apply Rule 2 Action (Keep *only* the objects with size >= 10). Stop.\n    *   No: Proceed.\n3.  **Check Rule 3:** Are there any Yellow(4) pixels?\n    *   Yes: Apply Rule 3 Action (Change Yellow to Green). Stop.\n    *   No: Proceed.\n4.  **Default:** Output unchanged.\n\n**Final YAML:**\n\n"
