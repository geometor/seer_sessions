grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  color_space: 0-9 integer map
  max_size: 30x30
observed_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties: [color, location]
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous block of same-colored non-white pixels (using 4-connectivity)
    properties: [color, size (pixel_count), pixels]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: 8-connectivity (orthogonal or diagonal) neighboring pixels
    relevance: Used in rule 1 condition (detecting azure(8) near green(3))
  - type: size_threshold
    definition: Object pixel count >= 10
    relevance: Used in rule 2 condition
  - type: count_threshold
    definition: Number of objects meeting size_threshold >= 4
    relevance: Used in rule 2 condition
transformations:
  - type: color_change
    details:
      - change_to: white (0) # Removal
        conditions:
          - rule_1_action: pixel is azure(8) AND is adjacent (8-connectivity) to at least one green(3) pixel
          - rule_2_action: pixel does not belong to an object with size >= 10 (when rule 2 is triggered)
      - change_to: green (3)
        conditions:
          - rule_3_action: pixel is yellow (4) (when rule 3 is triggered)
conditional_rules:
  - priority: 1
    condition: Grid contains azure(8) AND green(3) pixels, AND at least one azure(8) pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to a green(3) pixel.
    action: rule_1_action (Remove specific azure pixels)
  - priority: 2
    condition: Rule 1 condition is false AND count of (non-white objects with size >= 10) >= 4.
    action: rule_2_action (Keep only objects with size >= 10)
  - priority: 3
    condition: Rule 1 and Rule 2 conditions are false AND grid contains yellow(4) pixels.
    action: rule_3_action (Change yellow to green)
  - priority: 4 (default)
    condition: None of the above conditions are met.
    action: No change.
