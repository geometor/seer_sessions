task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  color_space: 0-9 integer map
  max_size: 30x30
observed_elements:
  - type: pixel
    properties: [color, location]
  - type: object
    definition: contiguous block of same-colored non-white pixels (using 4-connectivity)
    properties: [color, size (pixel_count), pixels]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: 8-connectivity (orthogonal or diagonal) neighboring pixels
    relevance: Used in rule 1 (detecting azure(8) near green(3))
  - type: relative_size
    definition: Comparing pixel counts of different objects
    relevance: Used in rule 2 (selecting the 4 largest objects)
transformations:
  - type: color_change
    details:
      - change_to: white (0) # Removal
        conditions:
          - rule_1: pixel is azure(8) AND is adjacent (8-connectivity) to at least one green(3) pixel
          - rule_2: pixel is not part of one of the 4 largest non-white objects (by pixel count, 4-connectivity for object definition)
      - change_to: green (3)
        conditions:
          - rule_3: pixel is yellow (4)
conditional_rules:
  - priority: 1
    condition: Grid contains azure(8) AND green(3) pixels, AND at least one azure(8) pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to a green(3) pixel.
    applies_rule: rule_1 (Remove specific azure pixels)
  - priority: 2
    condition: Rule 1 condition is false.
    applies_rule: rule_2 (Keep only the 4 largest objects)
  - priority: 3
    condition: Rule 1 and Rule 2 conditions are false AND grid contains yellow(4) pixels.
    applies_rule: rule_3 (Change yellow to green)
  - priority: 4 (default)
    condition: None of the above conditions are met.
    action: No change.
