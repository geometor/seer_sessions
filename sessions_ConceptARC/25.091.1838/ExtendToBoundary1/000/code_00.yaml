Task: Add a line extending from a central point of an existing object to a grid edge.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Contains exactly one solid-colored, non-white rectangular object.
    - Object_Color: Varies (green(3), red(2) in examples).
    - Object_Shape: Rectangular (can be square or non-square).
    - Object_Properties: Bounding box (top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col), height, width.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Original_Object: Preserved from the input grid.
  - Added_Element: A single straight line (horizontal or vertical).
    - Line_Color: Same as the Object_Color from the input.
    - Line_Origin: Starts adjacent to the original object.
    - Line_Extent: Extends to one edge of the grid (right or bottom).

Transformation_Rules:
  - Identify the single non-white rectangular object in the input grid.
  - Determine the object's bounding box, height, width, and color.
  - Compare the object's width and height:
    - If width >= height:
      - Action: Draw a horizontal line.
      - Row: object_top_row + object_height // 2 (middle row).
      - Start_Column: object_right_col + 1.
      - End_Column: grid_width - 1 (right edge).
      - Color: object_color.
    - If height > width:
      - Action: Draw a vertical line.
      - Column: object_left_col + object_width // 2 (middle column).
      - Start_Row: object_bottom_row + 1.
      - End_Row: grid_height - 1 (bottom edge).
      - Color: object_color.
  - Result: Output grid is the input grid with the added line.
