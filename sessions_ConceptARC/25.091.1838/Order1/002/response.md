**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified objects and determined the arrangement axis (horizontal/vertical). However, it failed because the transformation logic was flawed in two key aspects:

1.  **Permutation Rule (Horizontal):** The implemented cyclic shift logic did not match the pattern required by the first example's output. The expected transformation is a *right* cyclic shift of the first N-1 objects, leaving the last object in place.
2.  **Object Placement:** The code attempted to place objects into the *original* bounding boxes of the permuted positions. The correct logic requires calculating *new* positions for the objects based on their permuted order, their dimensions, and the *original spatial gaps* between them, aligning them along the non-arrangement axis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Permutation:** Implement the correct permutation logic:
    *   Horizontal: Right cyclic shift of the first N-1 objects' indices.
    *   Vertical: Reverse the order of objects' indices.
2.  **Calculate Gaps:** Before permuting, calculate the gaps (number of background pixels) between adjacent objects along the arrangement axis in their original sorted order.
3.  **Calculate New Positions:** After determining the permutation of object indices, iterate through the *new sequence order*. For each position `i` in the new sequence:
    *   Identify the *original* object that moves to this position `i`.
    *   Determine the starting coordinate for drawing (top-left corner). This depends on the accumulated sizes of previous objects in the *new sequence* and the accumulated *original gaps* corresponding to the *slots* between objects in the new sequence.
    *   Align objects along the non-arrangement axis based on the minimum coordinate observed across all objects along that axis.
4.  **Redraw:** Draw the identified original object at the newly calculated starting coordinate.
