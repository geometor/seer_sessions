            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grids contain distinct rectangular or L-shaped objects composed of single, non-white colors (blue, yellow, green, red in train_1; gray, red, orange in train_2). These objects are separated by white (0) pixels, acting as a background and buffer space.\n2.  **Spatial Arrangement:** The objects are arranged either primarily horizontally (train_1) or primarily vertically (train_2). There's clear spacing between them along one axis.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the *positions* of these identified objects while preserving their internal structure (shape and color). The background remains white.\n4.  **Rearrangement Rule:** The specific way objects are rearranged depends on their initial spatial layout:\n    *   If objects are arranged horizontally (left-to-right), their positions undergo a cyclic shift to the left, excluding the rightmost object, which stays in place.\n    *   If objects are arranged vertically (top-to-bottom), their vertical order is completely reversed.\n5.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is reconstructed by placing the original objects into their new, calculated positions on a white background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels. For each object, record its color, the coordinates of all its pixels, and its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column).\n3.  Analyze the bounding boxes of the identified objects to determine if they are primarily separated horizontally or vertically. This defines the 'arrangement axis'.\n    *   If the horizontal gaps between object bounding boxes are consistently larger than the vertical overlaps/gaps, the axis is 'horizontal'.\n    *   If the vertical gaps between object bounding boxes are consistently larger than the horizontal overlaps/gaps, the axis is 'vertical'.\n4.  Sort the objects based on their position along the determined arrangement axis:\n    *   If 'horizontal', sort by the minimum column index (left-to-right).\n    *   If 'vertical', sort by the minimum row index (top-to-bottom). Keep track of the original bounding box associated with each object in this sorted list.\n5.  Determine the permutation rule based on the arrangement axis:\n    *   If 'horizontal', the rule is 'cyclic shift left N-1': The position of the first object moves to the second object's original position, the second to the third's, ..., the (N-1)th to the first's original position. The Nth (last) object's position remains unchanged.\n    *   If 'vertical', the rule is 'reverse': The position of the first object is swapped with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.\n6.  Apply the determined permutation rule to the *list of original bounding box positions* derived from the sorted objects. This yields a list of target positions.\n7.  Iterate through the originally sorted objects (from step 4). For each object, retrieve its corresponding target position from the permuted list (from step 6).\n8.  Draw the object (using its original color and relative pixel coordinates within its original bounding box) onto the output grid, offset by the top-left corner of its *target* bounding box.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
