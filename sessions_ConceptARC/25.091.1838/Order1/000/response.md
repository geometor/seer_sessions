Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grids contain distinct rectangular or L-shaped objects composed of single, non-white colors (blue, yellow, green, red in train_1; gray, red, orange in train_2). These objects are separated by white (0) pixels, acting as a background and buffer space.
2.  **Spatial Arrangement:** The objects are arranged either primarily horizontally (train_1) or primarily vertically (train_2). There's clear spacing between them along one axis.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the *positions* of these identified objects while preserving their internal structure (shape and color). The background remains white.
4.  **Rearrangement Rule:** The specific way objects are rearranged depends on their initial spatial layout:
    *   If objects are arranged horizontally (left-to-right), their positions undergo a cyclic shift to the left, excluding the rightmost object, which stays in place.
    *   If objects are arranged vertically (top-to-bottom), their vertical order is completely reversed.
5.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is reconstructed by placing the original objects into their new, calculated positions on a white background.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_rearrangement

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills empty space, separates objects
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels (can be rectangular, L-shaped, etc.)
      - position: defined by a bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
    role: primary elements being manipulated

relationships:
  - type: spatial_separation
    axis: horizontal OR vertical
    description: Objects are distinctly separated along one primary axis.
  - type: relative_order
    based_on: spatial_separation axis (left-to-right OR top-to-bottom)
    description: Objects can be ordered based on their position along the separation axis.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input grid
    outputs: list of objects (color, pixel coordinates, bounding box)
  - action: determine_arrangement_axis
    inputs: list of object bounding boxes
    outputs: axis ('horizontal' or 'vertical')
  - action: sort_objects
    inputs: list of objects, arrangement_axis
    outputs: ordered list of objects
  - action: determine_permutation
    inputs: arrangement_axis
    outputs: permutation_rule ('cyclic_shift_left_n-1' or 'reverse')
  - action: apply_permutation_to_positions
    inputs: ordered list of object bounding boxes, permutation_rule
    outputs: list of new bounding box positions corresponding to the original objects
  - action: reconstruct_output
    inputs: original grid dimensions, list of objects, list of new positions
    outputs: output grid

examples:
  - train_1:
      arrangement_axis: horizontal
      initial_order (left-to-right): [blue(1), yellow(4), green(3), red(2)]
      permutation_rule: cyclic_shift_left_n-1 (applied to first 3)
      permuted_position_order: [yellow(4)_pos, green(3)_pos, blue(1)_pos, red(2)_pos]
      result: Objects drawn in the permuted positions.
  - train_2:
      arrangement_axis: vertical
      initial_order (top-to-bottom): [gray(5), red(2), orange(7)]
      permutation_rule: reverse
      permuted_position_order: [orange(7)_pos, red(2)_pos, gray(5)_pos]
      result: Objects drawn in the permuted positions.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels. For each object, record its color, the coordinates of all its pixels, and its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column).
3.  Analyze the bounding boxes of the identified objects to determine if they are primarily separated horizontally or vertically. This defines the 'arrangement axis'.
    *   If the horizontal gaps between object bounding boxes are consistently larger than the vertical overlaps/gaps, the axis is 'horizontal'.
    *   If the vertical gaps between object bounding boxes are consistently larger than the horizontal overlaps/gaps, the axis is 'vertical'.
4.  Sort the objects based on their position along the determined arrangement axis:
    *   If 'horizontal', sort by the minimum column index (left-to-right).
    *   If 'vertical', sort by the minimum row index (top-to-bottom). Keep track of the original bounding box associated with each object in this sorted list.
5.  Determine the permutation rule based on the arrangement axis:
    *   If 'horizontal', the rule is 'cyclic shift left N-1': The position of the first object moves to the second object's original position, the second to the third's, ..., the (N-1)th to the first's original position. The Nth (last) object's position remains unchanged.
    *   If 'vertical', the rule is 'reverse': The position of the first object is swapped with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.
6.  Apply the determined permutation rule to the *list of original bounding box positions* derived from the sorted objects. This yields a list of target positions.
7.  Iterate through the originally sorted objects (from step 4). For each object, retrieve its corresponding target position from the permuted list (from step 6).
8.  Draw the object (using its original color and relative pixel coordinates within its original bounding box) onto the output grid, offset by the top-left corner of its *target* bounding box.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
