task_description: Extract a specific rectangular object from within a framed area in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with color values 0-9.
  - element: background
    property: color
    value: white (0)
    description: The typically most frequent color, surrounding other elements.
  - element: frame
    property: shape
    value: rectangle (usually 1 pixel thick)
    property: location
    value: outermost non-background border
    property: color
    value: variable (blue, red, yellow in examples)
    description: Encloses other objects. Not present in the output.
  - element: object
    property: location
    value: enclosed within the frame
    property: color
    value: variable (non-background)
    property: shape
    value: variable (contiguous pixels of the same color)
    description: Distinct items inside the frame.
  - element: perfect_rectangle_object
    description: An object forming a solid or hollow rectangle.
    property: type
    value: solid or hollow
    property: color
    value: single color
    property: area
    value: calculated from bounding box (width * height)
    relationship: subset of 'object'

transformation:
  input: grid
  output: subgrid (cropped perfect_rectangle_object)
  steps:
    - identify: background color (usually white=0).
    - identify: frame (outermost non-background border).
    - find: all contiguous non-background, non-frame objects inside the frame.
    - filter: keep only objects that are 'perfect rectangles' (solid or hollow with background-colored interior).
    - selection_logic:
        condition: if only one perfect rectangle exists
        action: select that rectangle.
        condition: if multiple perfect rectangles exist
        action:
          - calculate: bounding box area for each perfect rectangle.
          - determine: median area among them.
          - filter: keep only rectangles with the median area.
          - determine: median color index among the remaining rectangles.
          - select: the rectangle with the median color index.
    - final_step: extract the selected perfect rectangle object and crop it to its bounding box to create the output grid.
