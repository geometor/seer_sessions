These rectangles can be solid (filled with a single color) or hollow (an outline of a single color with a background-colored interior). Some shapes might be more complex or irregular (like the green shape in example 3).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a smaller grid representing one of the rectangular objects from the input grid, cropped to its bounding box.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify *which* specific rectangular object from the input should be extracted to form the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Identify all contiguous groups of non-background pixels within the input grid.\n3.  From these groups, identify the objects that form \"perfect rectangles\". A perfect rectangle can be either:\n    *   A solid rectangle (a rectangular block of a single color).\n    *   A hollow rectangle (a rectangular outline of a single color, at least one pixel thick, surrounding a rectangular area filled with the background color).\n4.  Ignore any object that constitutes the outermost frame of the grid (if one exists). Focus only on objects fully contained within any such frame.\n5.  Count the number of perfect rectangle objects identified in step 4.\n6.  **If** exactly one perfect rectangle object was found, this object is the target.\n7.  **Else (if multiple perfect rectangle objects were found):**\n    a.  Calculate the bounding box area (width * height) for each perfect rectangle object.\n    b.  Find the median value among these calculated areas.\n    c.  Filter the list of perfect rectangles, keeping only those whose area matches the median area.\n    d.  From this filtered list (of median-area rectangles), get the color index of each rectangle.\n    e.  Find the median value among these color indices.\n    f.  The target object is the perfect rectangle whose color index matches this median color index. (If there's an even number of items when finding the median color index, clarification might be needed - standard median definition usually averages the middle two, but ARC colors are discrete. Assume it takes the lower of the two middle indices if necessary, although examples suggest an odd number).\n8.  Create the output grid by taking the selected target object and cropping the input grid to the exact bounding box of this object."
