Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a background (white, 0), an outer frame of a single color, and multiple distinct colored objects enclosed within the frame.
2.  **Object Types:** The objects within the frame appear to be geometric shapes, primarily rectangles. These rectangles can be solid (filled with a single color) or hollow (an outline of a single color with a background-colored interior). Some shapes might be more complex or irregular (like the green shape in example 3).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a smaller grid representing one of the rectangular objects from the input grid, cropped to its bounding box.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to identify *which* specific rectangular object from the input should be extracted to form the output.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract a specific rectangular object from within a framed area in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with color values 0-9.
  - element: background
    property: color
    value: white (0)
    description: The typically most frequent color, surrounding other elements.
  - element: frame
    property: shape
    value: rectangle (usually 1 pixel thick)
    property: location
    value: outermost non-background border
    property: color
    value: variable (blue, red, yellow in examples)
    description: Encloses other objects. Not present in the output.
  - element: object
    property: location
    value: enclosed within the frame
    property: color
    value: variable (non-background)
    property: shape
    value: variable (contiguous pixels of the same color)
    description: Distinct items inside the frame.
  - element: perfect_rectangle_object
    description: An object forming a solid or hollow rectangle.
    property: type
    value: solid or hollow
    property: color
    value: single color
    property: area
    value: calculated from bounding box (width * height)
    relationship: subset of 'object'

transformation:
  input: grid
  output: subgrid (cropped perfect_rectangle_object)
  steps:
    - identify: background color (usually white=0).
    - identify: frame (outermost non-background border).
    - find: all contiguous non-background, non-frame objects inside the frame.
    - filter: keep only objects that are 'perfect rectangles' (solid or hollow with background-colored interior).
    - selection_logic:
        condition: if only one perfect rectangle exists
        action: select that rectangle.
        condition: if multiple perfect rectangles exist
        action:
          - calculate: bounding box area for each perfect rectangle.
          - determine: median area among them.
          - filter: keep only rectangles with the median area.
          - determine: median color index among the remaining rectangles.
          - select: the rectangle with the median color index.
    - final_step: extract the selected perfect rectangle object and crop it to its bounding box to create the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color (typically white, color 0).
2.  Identify all contiguous groups of non-background pixels within the input grid.
3.  From these groups, identify the objects that form "perfect rectangles". A perfect rectangle can be either:
    *   A solid rectangle (a rectangular block of a single color).
    *   A hollow rectangle (a rectangular outline of a single color, at least one pixel thick, surrounding a rectangular area filled with the background color).
4.  Ignore any object that constitutes the outermost frame of the grid (if one exists). Focus only on objects fully contained within any such frame.
5.  Count the number of perfect rectangle objects identified in step 4.
6.  **If** exactly one perfect rectangle object was found, this object is the target.
7.  **Else (if multiple perfect rectangle objects were found):**
    a.  Calculate the bounding box area (width * height) for each perfect rectangle object.
    b.  Find the median value among these calculated areas.
    c.  Filter the list of perfect rectangles, keeping only those whose area matches the median area.
    d.  From this filtered list (of median-area rectangles), get the color index of each rectangle.
    e.  Find the median value among these color indices.
    f.  The target object is the perfect rectangle whose color index matches this median color index. (If there's an even number of items when finding the median color index, clarification might be needed - standard median definition usually averages the middle two, but ARC colors are discrete. Assume it takes the lower of the two middle indices if necessary, although examples suggest an odd number).
8.  Create the output grid by taking the selected target object and cropping the input grid to the exact bounding box of this object.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import math

"""

If multiple perfect rectangles are found:
1. Calculate the bounding box area for each perfect rectangle.
2. Find the median area among these rectangles.
3. Filter the rectangles to keep only those with the median area.
4. Get the color index of each remaining rectangle.
5. Find the median color index among these.
6. Select the rectangle with the median color index (if count is even, use the lower of the two middle indices).
Finally, crop the input grid to the bounding box of the selected perfect rectangle to produce the output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully processed the first two training examples but failed on the third. The failure occurred because the selection logic, based solely on median bounding-box area and then median color, incorrectly selected a small green solid rectangle instead of the larger, hollow yellow rectangle that was the expected output for Example 3.

The strategy is to refine the selection logic. Analysis of all three examples suggests a revised approach:
1.  Identify all "perfect rectangles" (both solid and hollow) within the input grid, excluding any potential outer frame.
2.  Check if exactly one of these identified rectangles is *hollow*.
3.  If yes, select that unique hollow rectangle.
4.  If no (meaning zero or multiple hollow rectangles exist), revert to the original logic: select the rectangle(s) with the median bounding-box area, and if there's still ambiguity, select the one among those with the median color index.
5.  Crop the input grid to the bounding box of the finally selected rectangle.

This revised strategy correctly identifies the target object in all three training examples. The `is_perfect_rectangle` function needs to reliably distinguish between solid and hollow rectangles.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's re-analyze Example 3 using the original code's logic components to confirm the failure point.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution reveals a critical flaw in the original `is_perfect_rectangle` function, specifically for Example 3:

1.  **Frame Identification:** The largest object (yellow, color 4) was correctly identified as the likely frame and excluded.
2.  **Perfect Rectangle Identification:**
    *   The target hollow yellow rectangle (Color 4, Area 24) was **incorrectly classified as NOT a perfect rectangle**.
    *   The large, irregular green shape (Color 3, Area 36) was also correctly identified as not a perfect rectangle.
    *   **Only the small 1x3 solid green rectangle (Color 3, Area 3) was identified as a perfect rectangle.**
3.  **Selection:** Since only one object was deemed a perfect rectangle, the selection logic trivially chose it.

**Conclusion:** The primary failure for Example 3 was the **incorrect identification** of the target hollow rectangle by the `is_perfect_rectangle` function. The subsequent selection logic (median area/color or the proposed "prioritize hollow" rule) wouldn't even be reached correctly.

**Revised Strategy:** Focus first on fixing `is_perfect_rectangle` to correctly identify both solid and hollow rectangles based on their structure within their bounding box. Then, apply the "prioritize unique hollow" selection logic.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the background color is white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-background colors in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, the set of pixel coordinates it occupies, and its bounding box.
3.  For each identified object, check if it qualifies as a "perfect rectangle". An object is a perfect rectangle if it meets EITHER the "solid" OR the "hollow" criteria:
    *   **Solid Check:** The object's pixels perfectly fill its entire bounding box, and all pixels within the bounding box have the object's color.
    *   **Hollow Check:** The object's bounding box must be larger than 2x2. All pixels within the bounding box that lie on its outer edge (top/bottom row, first/last column) must belong to the object and have the object's color. All pixels strictly *inside* this outer edge must have the background color.
4.  Create a list of all objects that qualified as perfect rectangles. Note whether each is solid or hollow.
5.  Count how many of the perfect rectangles in the list are hollow.
6.  **Selection Rule:**
    *   **If** exactly one perfect rectangle in the list is hollow, **then** select that single hollow rectangle as the target.
    *   **Else** (if there are zero hollow rectangles, or more than one hollow rectangle):
        a.  Consider *all* perfect rectangles (both solid and hollow) found in step 4.
        b.  Calculate the bounding box area (width * height) for each of these rectangles.
        c.  Find the median value among these calculated areas.
        d.  Filter the list, keeping only those rectangles whose area matches the median area.
        e.  **If** only one rectangle remains after filtering by area, **then** select it as the target.
        f.  **Else** (if multiple rectangles remain with the median area):
            i.  Get the color index of each remaining rectangle.
            ii. Find the median value among these color indices.
            iii. Select the rectangle whose color index matches this median color index as the target. (If there's a tie in color after filtering by median area and median color, select the first one encountered).
7.  Create the output grid by cropping the input grid to the exact bounding box coordinates of the selected target rectangle.
