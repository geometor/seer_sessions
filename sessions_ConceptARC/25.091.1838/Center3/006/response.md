Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully solved the first two examples but failed on the third. Examples 1 and 2 involve selecting a rectangle based on median area and then median color among several candidate rectangles within a frame. Example 3 also contains multiple objects, including two hollow rectangles (one frame, one internal object) and an irregular shape. The expected output for Example 3 is the *smaller* of the two hollow rectangles.

The failure in Example 3, where the code outputted `[[3, 3, 3]]` instead of the inner yellow hollow rectangle, indicates a flaw in either the object identification, the "perfect rectangle" check, or the selection logic implementation. The core logic derived (find perfect rectangles, filter by median area, then median color) seems plausible based on the patterns across all three examples. The error likely stems from an implementation bug that misclassified an object or incorrectly applied the selection criteria in Example 3.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Object/Rectangle Identification:** Use code execution to trace the identification of objects and specifically which ones are classified as "perfect rectangles" (solid or hollow) in Example 3. Pay close attention to the properties (color, bounding box, area, type) recorded for each.
2.  **Verify Selection Logic Execution:** Trace the application of the median area and median color filters for Example 3 using the identified perfect rectangles. Confirm that the median values are calculated correctly and that the filtering steps lead to the selection of the correct object based on the established logic.
3.  **Refine Definitions:** Ensure the definition of a "perfect hollow rectangle" in the code is robust and correctly distinguishes it from irregular shapes or objects that merely contain background-colored pixels.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the confirmed logic, ensuring clarity on handling multiple rectangles and the median selection process.
