            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task components: finding objects, filtering for rectangles, and selecting one based on properties. However, the execution results revealed flaws in the selection logic derived primarily from the first example.\n\n- **Example 1 & 2 Success:** These passed because the initial median-based logic (applied when multiple rectangles were found) happened to work for them, even though the primary rule (\"select unique hollow\") was incorrect.\n- **Example 3 Failure:** This highlighted the incorrectness of prioritizing a unique hollow rectangle (as there were two) and potentially indicated a bug in identifying perfect rectangles or applying the median logic correctly in the initial code run.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-analyze Selection Logic:** Systematically apply the median area -> median color selection logic to *all* identified perfect rectangles across all three examples to see if it provides a consistent rule.\n2.  **Verify Object Identification:** Use code execution to precisely determine the properties (color, type, area, bounding box) of all objects identified as perfect rectangles in each example. This confirms the inputs to the selection logic.\n3.  **Refine Rules:** Based on the verified object properties and the successful selection simulation, update the YAML fact document and the natural language program to accurately reflect the consistent transformation rule. Discard the incorrect \"unique hollow\" prioritization.\n4.  **Assume Code Correctness (for now):** The provided Python functions (`find_objects`, `is_perfect_rectangle_refined`, etc.) are assumed to be conceptually correct for the purpose of defining the natural language program. The failure in Example 3 during the *initial* run is attributed to either a subtle bug now implicitly corrected or the incorrect selection logic used at that time.\n\n## Metrics and Object Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the objects found in each training example.\n\n"
