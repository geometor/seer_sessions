## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully processed the first two training examples but failed on the third. The failure occurred because the selection logic, based solely on median bounding-box area and then median color, incorrectly selected a small green solid rectangle instead of the larger, hollow yellow rectangle that was the expected output for Example 3.

The strategy is to refine the selection logic. Analysis of all three examples suggests a revised approach:
1.  Identify all "perfect rectangles" (both solid and hollow) within the input grid, excluding any potential outer frame.
2.  Check if exactly one of these identified rectangles is *hollow*.
3.  If yes, select that unique hollow rectangle.
4.  If no (meaning zero or multiple hollow rectangles exist), revert to the original logic: select the rectangle(s) with the median bounding-box area, and if there's still ambiguity, select the one among those with the median color index.
5.  Crop the input grid to the bounding box of the finally selected rectangle.

This revised strategy correctly identifies the target object in all three training examples. The `is_perfect_rectangle` function needs to reliably distinguish between solid and hollow rectangles.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution reveals a critical flaw in the original `is_perfect_rectangle` function, specifically for Example 3:

1.  **Frame Identification:** The largest object (yellow, color 4) was correctly identified as the likely frame and excluded.
2.  **Perfect Rectangle Identification:**
    *   The target hollow yellow rectangle (Color 4, Area 24) was **incorrectly classified as NOT a perfect rectangle**.
    *   The large, irregular green shape (Color 3, Area 36) was also correctly identified as not a perfect rectangle.
    *   **Only the small 1x3 solid green rectangle (Color 3, Area 3) was identified as a perfect rectangle.**
3.  **Selection:** Since only one object was deemed a perfect rectangle, the selection logic trivially chose it.

**Conclusion:** The primary failure for Example 3 was the **incorrect identification** of the target hollow rectangle by the `is_perfect_rectangle` function. The subsequent selection logic (median area/color or the proposed "prioritize hollow" rule) wouldn't even be reached correctly.

**Revised Strategy:** Focus first on fixing `is_perfect_rectangle` to correctly identify both solid and hollow rectangles based on their structure within their bounding box. Then, apply the "prioritize unique hollow" selection logic.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Assume the background color is white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-background colors in the input grid. For each object, determine its color, the set of pixel coordinates it occupies, and its bounding box.
3.  For each identified object, check if it qualifies as a "perfect rectangle". An object is a perfect rectangle if it meets EITHER the "solid" OR the "hollow" criteria:
    *   **Solid Check:** The object's pixels perfectly fill its entire bounding box, and all pixels within the bounding box have the object's color.
    *   **Hollow Check:** The object's bounding box must be larger than 2x2. All pixels within the bounding box that lie on its outer edge (top/bottom row, first/last column) must belong to the object and have the object's color. All pixels strictly *inside* this outer edge must have the background color.
4.  Create a list of all objects that qualified as perfect rectangles. Note whether each is solid or hollow.
5.  Count how many of the perfect rectangles in the list are hollow.
6.  **Selection Rule:**
    *   **If** exactly one perfect rectangle in the list is hollow, **then** select that single hollow rectangle as the target.
    *   **Else** (if there are zero hollow rectangles, or more than one hollow rectangle):
        a.  Consider *all* perfect rectangles (both solid and hollow) found in step 4.
        b.  Calculate the bounding box area (width * height) for each of these rectangles.
        c.  Find the median value among these calculated areas.
        d.  Filter the list, keeping only those rectangles whose area matches the median area.
        e.  **If** only one rectangle remains after filtering by area, **then** select it as the target.
        f.  **Else** (if multiple rectangles remain with the median area):
            i.  Get the color index of each remaining rectangle.
            ii. Find the median value among these color indices.
            iii. Select the rectangle whose color index matches this median color index as the target. (If there's a tie in color after filtering by median area and median color, select the first one encountered).
7.  Create the output grid by cropping the input grid to the exact bounding box coordinates of the selected target rectangle.
