            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully processed the first two training examples but failed on the third. The failure occurred because the selection logic, based solely on median bounding-box area and then median color, incorrectly selected a small green solid rectangle instead of the larger, hollow yellow rectangle that was the expected output for Example 3.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the selection logic. Analysis of all three examples suggests a revised approach:\n1.  Identify all \"perfect rectangles\" (both solid and hollow) within the input grid, excluding any potential outer frame.\n2.  Check if exactly one of these identified rectangles is *hollow*.\n3.  If yes, select that unique hollow rectangle.\n4.  If no (meaning zero or multiple hollow rectangles exist), revert to the original logic: select the rectangle(s) with the median bounding-box area, and if there's still ambiguity, select the one among those with the median color index.\n5.  Crop the input grid to the bounding box of the finally selected rectangle.\n\nThis revised strategy correctly identifies the target object in all three training examples. The `is_perfect_rectangle` function needs to reliably distinguish between solid and hollow rectangles.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's re-analyze Example 3 using the original code's logic components to confirm the failure point.\n"
