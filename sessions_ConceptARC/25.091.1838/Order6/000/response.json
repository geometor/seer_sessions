In the output, they appear in the order Gray (1), Red (2), Yellow (3), Green (4).\n    *   In `train_2`, the blocks are Orange (width 10), Blue (width 4), Yellow (width 8), Magenta (width 6). In the output, they appear in the order Blue (4), Magenta (6), Yellow (8), Orange (10).\n    *   The vertical rearrangement seems to be based on sorting the blocks by their width in ascending order.\n    *   The blocks are stacked vertically in the output grid, starting from the topmost row occupied by any block in the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts (YAML)**:\n    "
