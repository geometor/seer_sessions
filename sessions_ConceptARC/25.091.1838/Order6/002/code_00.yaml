  - type: horizontal_rectangular_block
    definition: A contiguous rectangular area of pixels with the same non-background color, aligned with the grid axes, and starting at column 0.
    properties:
      - color: The color index (1-9) of the block's pixels.
      - height: The number of rows the block occupies.
      - width: The number of columns the block occupies.
      - top_row: The row index of the block's topmost row in the input grid.
      - left_column: Always 0 for identified blocks in this task.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Find all distinct horizontal rectangular blocks of non-background color that start at column 0 in the input grid. Record their color, height, width, and original top_row. Determine the minimum top_row among all found blocks.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_blocks (each with color, height, width, top_row), min_original_top_row
  - action: sort_blocks
    description: Sort the identified blocks based on their width in ascending order.
    input: list_of_blocks
    parameter: width
    order: ascending
    output: sorted_list_of_blocks
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: Create an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color. Place the sorted blocks onto this grid vertically, one after another, preserving their original height, width, and color. Start placement of the first sorted block at the minimum original top_row. Each subsequent block starts immediately below the previous one. All blocks are placed starting at column 0.
    inputs: sorted_list_of_blocks, original_grid_dimensions, min_original_top_row, background_color
    output: output_grid
relationships:
  - relation: vertical_reordering
    description: The vertical order of the blocks in the output grid is determined by sorting the blocks from the input grid based on their width in ascending order.
