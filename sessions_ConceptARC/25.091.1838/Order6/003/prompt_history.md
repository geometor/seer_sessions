*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    *   The background color is white (0) and remains unchanged.
    *   The inputs contain distinct horizontal rectangular blocks of solid colors.
    *   Each block has a specific color, height (number of rows), and width (number of columns).
    *   In the output grids, these same blocks appear but are rearranged vertically.
    *   The blocks retain their original color, height, and width.
    *   Comparing the input and output blocks in both examples suggests a sorting mechanism.
    *   In `train_1`, the blocks are Gray (width 1), Yellow (width 3), Red (width 2), Green (width 4). In the output, they appear in the order Gray (1), Red (2), Yellow (3), Green (4).
    *   In `train_2`, the blocks are Orange (width 10), Blue (width 4), Yellow (width 8), Magenta (width 6). In the output, they appear in the order Blue (4), Magenta (6), Yellow (8), Orange (10).
    *   The vertical rearrangement seems to be based on sorting the blocks by their width in ascending order.
    *   The blocks are stacked vertically in the output grid, starting from the topmost row occupied by any block in the input grid.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an empty list to store information about identified blocks.
    2.  Scan the input grid to find all distinct horizontal rectangular blocks of non-white pixels. For each block found:
        a.  Determine its color, height (number of rows), width (number of columns), and the row index of its top edge. Assume the leftmost column is 0 based on examples.
        b.  Store this information (color, height, width, original top row) as a record for the block.
    3.  Find the minimum top row index among all identified blocks in the input grid. This will be the starting row for placing blocks in the output.
    4.  Sort the list of block records based on their width in ascending order.
    5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white background color (0).
    6.  Initialize a variable `current_row` to the minimum top row index found in step 3.
    7.  Iterate through the sorted list of block records:
        a.  For the current block record, retrieve its color, height, and width.
        b.  Place the block onto the output grid. The block will occupy rows from `current_row` to `current_row + height - 1`, and columns from 0 to `width - 1`, using the block's color.
        c.  Update `current_row` by adding the height of the block just placed (`current_row = current_row + height`).
    8.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed on both training examples. The core logic described in the natural language program (identifying horizontal blocks, sorting by width, and reconstructing) appeared correct, but the implementation produced incorrect outputs. Example 1 showed incorrect vertical ordering, while Example 2 simply reproduced the input. This suggested a flaw either in the block identification (`find_blocks` function) or in applying the sorted order during reconstruction. The metrics gathered using a simplified block-finding approach confirmed that the blocks are indeed horizontal rectangles starting at column 0, and sorting them by width ascending produces the correct vertical order seen in the output examples. The original `find_blocks` function was likely too complex or buggy, and/or the main `transform` function failed to use the correctly sorted list.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to replace the faulty `find_blocks` function with the simplified version (`find_blocks_simplified`) which was validated during the metric gathering phase. This function correctly identifies the relevant blocks (horizontal rectangles starting at column 0) and their properties. The rest of the `transform` function's logic (sorting by width, reconstructing from the minimum original top row) is sound and should work correctly when provided with the accurate block list and minimum starting row.

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid Dimensions: 12x6
    *   Output Grid Dimensions: 12x6
    *   Background Color: 0 (white)
    *   Input Blocks (Color, Height, Width, TopRow): Gray(5, 1, 1, 2), Yellow(4, 3, 3, 3), Red(2, 2, 2, 6), Green(3, 4, 4, 8)
    *   Minimum Original Top Row: 2
    *   Blocks Sorted by Width (Color, Width): Gray(1), Red(2), Yellow(3), Green(4)
    *   Output Block Order (Color, TopRow): Gray(2), Red(3), Yellow(5), Green(8)
    *   Verification: The sorted block order matches the vertical order in the expected output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid Dimensions: 13x10
    *   Output Grid Dimensions: 13x10
    *   Background Color: 0 (white)
    *   Input Blocks (Color, Height, Width, TopRow): Orange(7, 3, 10, 1), Blue(1, 3, 4, 4), Yellow(4, 3, 8, 7), Magenta(6, 3, 6, 10)
    *   Minimum Original Top Row: 1
    *   Blocks Sorted by Width (Color, Width): Blue(4), Magenta(6), Yellow(8), Orange(10)
    *   Output Block Order (Color, TopRow): Blue(1), Magenta(4), Yellow(7), Orange(10)
    *   Verification: The sorted block order matches the vertical order in the expected output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `blocks` to store information about identified blocks and set a variable `min_original_top_row` to a large value (e.g., the grid height).
2.  Create a boolean grid `visited` of the same size as the input, initialized to `False`.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid from top to bottom.
4.  Check the cell at `(r, 0)` (first column). If it contains a non-background color (not 0) and `visited[r, 0]` is `False`:
    a.  This marks the potential start of a new block. Record its `color`.
    b.  Determine the `width` by scanning rightwards from `(r, 0)` as long as the color matches.
    c.  Determine the `height` by scanning downwards from row `r`, checking if each row segment from column 0 to `width - 1` perfectly matches the `color` and ensuring the block doesn't extend further right (i.e., `grid[row_idx, width]` is not the same `color` if `width` < grid width). Stop when a row doesn't match or the bottom is reached.
    d.  If a valid block (`height > 0`) is confirmed:
        i.  Store the block's `color`, `height`, `width`, and original `top_row` (`r`) in the `blocks` list.
        ii. If `r` is less than `min_original_top_row`, update `min_original_top_row` to `r`.
        iii. Mark all cells within this found block's bounds (`r` to `r + height - 1`, `0` to `width - 1`) as `True` in the `visited` grid.
5.  If the `blocks` list is empty after scanning the grid, return the original input grid.
6.  Sort the `blocks` list based on the `width` property of each block in ascending order.
7.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (0).
8.  Initialize a variable `current_row` to `min_original_top_row`.
9.  Iterate through the sorted `blocks` list:
    a.  For the current `block`, retrieve its `color`, `height`, and `width`.
    b.  Fill the region in the output grid from `current_row` to `current_row + height - 1` and from column `0` to `width - 1` with the block's `color`.
    c.  Add the `height` of the placed block to `current_row`.
10. Return the completed output grid.
