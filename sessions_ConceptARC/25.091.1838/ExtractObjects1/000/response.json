The output grid is always smaller than the input grid.\n2.  **Colors:** Each example uses only two colors: white (0) and one other color (green, yellow, or magenta). The non-white color is preserved in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or objects within the input grid. These objects can be single pixels or larger contiguous blocks.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a selection or cropping process. The output grid seems to focus on a specific region of the input grid containing a prominent non-white object.\n5.  **Key Feature:** By comparing the input and output, the output grid seems to be the smallest rectangular area (bounding box) that fully encloses the *largest* contiguous object of the non-white color present in the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
