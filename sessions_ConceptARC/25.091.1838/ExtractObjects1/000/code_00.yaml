task_description: Crop the input grid to the bounding box of the largest contiguous non-background object.
components:
  - role: grid
    input_grid: Input 2D array of pixels (0-9).
    output_grid: Output 2D array of pixels (0-9), a subgrid of the input.
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
  - role: objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., green, yellow, magenta).
      - size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - position: Coordinates of the pixels comprising the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object (defined by min/max row/column).
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects
  - name: calculate_object_sizes
    description: Determine the number of pixels for each identified object.
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: list_of_object_sizes
  - name: find_largest_object
    description: Identify the object with the maximum size. Assumes a single largest object based on examples.
    inputs: list_of_objects, list_of_object_sizes
    outputs: largest_object
  - name: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain all pixels of the largest object.
    inputs: largest_object
    outputs: bounding_box_coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
  - name: crop_grid
    description: Extract the subgrid from the input grid defined by the bounding box coordinates.
    inputs: input_grid, bounding_box_coordinates
    outputs: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid's content and dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the single largest non-white object found in the input grid.
