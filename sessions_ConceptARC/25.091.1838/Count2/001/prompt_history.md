**Perception:**

The input grids contain a single, contiguous shape made of blue pixels (color 1) on a white background (color 0). The shapes vary across examples: a rectangle, an open V-shape, and a diamond. The output is always a single row of orange pixels (color 7). The length of this orange row varies and seems related to the geometry of the blue shape in the input. Specifically, the length of the output row corresponds to the number of vertices (corners or endpoints) of the blue shape.

*   **Example 1:** The blue shape is a rectangle. Rectangles have 4 corners. The output is a row of 4 orange pixels.
*   **Example 2:** The blue shape is an open V. It has one vertex at the bottom and two endpoints at the top. Totaling 3 significant points. The output is a row of 3 orange pixels.
*   **Example 3:** The blue shape is a diamond. It has 4 primary corners. Additionally, the horizontal top and bottom segments each have two endpoints where they meet the diagonal sides, which could also be considered vertices in the line path. Counting these gives 4 corners + 2 points on the top segment + 2 points on the bottom segment = 8 points. However, the output is 6. Let's reconsider the definition. Perhaps it's points where the line path changes direction *sharply* or ends. In Example 3, there are 4 corners (90-degree turns internally) and the two side vertices where the top/bottom horizontal lines meet the diagonals. This sums to 6 vertices. The output is 6 orange pixels. This definition seems consistent.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - objects:
    - type: single contiguous shape.
    - color: blue (1).
    - properties:
      - shape: varies (rectangle, V-shape, diamond).
      - vertices: points where the boundary of the shape changes direction sharply or line segments end.

Output:
  - grid: 1D array (single row) of integers.
  - pixels:
    - color: orange (7).
    - count: equals the number of vertices identified in the input blue shape.

Transformation:
  - identifies the blue shape in the input grid.
  - counts the number of vertices (corners and endpoints) of this shape.
  - generates a 1xN output grid, where N is the vertex count.
  - fills the output grid with the orange color (7).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous object composed of blue pixels (color 1) within the input grid.
2.  Trace the boundary of this blue object.
3.  Count the number of vertices on this boundary. A vertex is defined as a point where the boundary line path significantly changes direction (like a corner) or where a line segment terminates (an endpoint).
4.  Determine the total count (N) of these vertices.
5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 1 row and N columns.
6.  Fill all cells of this output grid with the orange color (7).
