Input:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - objects:
    - type: single contiguous shape.
    - color: blue (1).
    - properties:
      - shape: varies (rectangle, V-shape, diamond).
      - vertices: points where the boundary of the shape changes direction sharply or line segments end.

Output:
  - grid: 1D array (single row) of integers.
  - pixels:
    - color: orange (7).
    - count: equals the number of vertices identified in the input blue shape.

Transformation:
  - identifies the blue shape in the input grid.
  - counts the number of vertices (corners and endpoints) of this shape.
  - generates a 1xN output grid, where N is the vertex count.
  - fills the output grid with the orange color (7).
