Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the single contiguous object composed of blue pixels (color 1) within the input grid against a white background (color 0).
2. For each blue pixel in the object, count its eight neighbors (including diagonals). Consider cells outside the grid boundaries as non-blue.
3. A blue pixel is defined as a "vertex" if it has 5 or more non-blue neighbors.
4. Count the total number of such vertices (N).
5. Create a new output grid with dimensions 1 row and N columns.
6. Fill all cells of this output grid with the orange color (7).
