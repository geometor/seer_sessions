"""
This program transforms an input grid based on the relationship between two non-background elements: a 'marker pixel' (a single isolated pixel) and a 'reference structure' (a line-like pattern).

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color (most frequent).
2.  **Identify Elements:**
    *   Find all non-background pixels.
    *   Identify the 'marker pixel' (the single pixel of a unique color or location). Record its color and position.
    *   Identify the 'reference structure' (the remaining non-background pixels). Record their coordinates and determine their orientation (Vertical, Horizontal, or Diagonal).
3.  **Prepare Output:** Create a copy of the input grid.
4.  **Execute Drawing Rule:**
    *   **If Vertical Reference:** Draw a horizontal line using the marker's color. The line is in the marker's row, extending from the column immediately after the reference structure's column(s) up to the marker's column.
    *   **If Horizontal Reference:** Draw a vertical line using the marker's color. The line is in the marker's column, extending from the row immediately after the reference structure's row(s) down to the marker's row.
    *   **If Diagonal Reference:** Draw a diagonal path using the marker's color, starting one step away from the marker pixel and moving towards the reference structure. The path stops just before entering a column that contains any part of the reference structure.
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.
