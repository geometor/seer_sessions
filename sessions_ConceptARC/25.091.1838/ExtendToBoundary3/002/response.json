            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components (marker pixel, reference structure) and the general transformation types (horizontal line, vertical line, diagonal path). The code successfully implemented the logic for horizontal and vertical reference structures (Examples 1 and 2).\n\nThe failure occurred in Example 3 (Diagonal Reference). The original code implemented a stopping condition based on the *next* step entering a column occupied by the reference structure. However, the expected output shows that the path should continue until the point being drawn shares either a row or a column with *any* of the reference structure's pixels. The final point satisfying this condition *is* drawn.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the logic for the diagonal case, specifically updating the stopping condition for the path generation loop.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Vertical Reference):**\n    *   Input Size: 12x12\n    *   Output Size: 12x12\n    *   Marker: (5, 11), Color 4 (yellow)\n    *   Reference: Col 1, Color 5 (gray)\n    *   Action: Draw horizontal line (color 4) at row 5 from col 2 to col 11.\n    *   Code Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2 (Horizontal Reference):**\n    *   Input Size: 9x14\n    *   Output Size: 9x14\n    *   Marker: (7, 8), Color 7 (orange)\n    *   Reference: Row 1, Color 7 (orange)\n    *   Action: Draw vertical line (color 7) at col 8 from row 2 to row 7.\n    *   Code Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 3 (Diagonal Reference):**\n    *   Input Size: 7x11\n    *   Output Size: 7x11\n    *   Marker: (6, 0), Color 2 (red)\n    *   Reference: {(0,0), (2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}, Color 3 (green)\n    *   Action: Draw diagonal path (color 2) starting one step from marker (up-right), stopping when the current point shares a row or column with any reference pixel. Points added: (5, 1), (4, 2).\n    *   Code Result: Incorrect. Only drew (5, 1). Missed (4, 2). The code stopped because column 2 contains a reference pixel, but it stopped *before* drawing the point at (4, 2). The revised logic indicates it should draw (4, 2) because row 4 contains a reference pixel ((4,4)), and then stop.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Group them by color and count the occurrences of each color.\n    *   If there is a color that appears only once, identify the pixel with that color as the `Marker Pixel`. Record its `marker_color` and `marker_position` (row, col). All other non-background pixels constitute the `Reference Structure`.\n    *   If all non-background pixels share the same color, identify the one with the largest row index, and among those, the largest column index, as the `Marker Pixel`. Record its `marker_color` and `marker_position`. All other pixels of that color constitute the `Reference Structure`.\n    *   Record the coordinates of all pixels in the `Reference Structure`. Determine its primary orientation (Vertical, Horizontal, or Diagonal) based on whether all its pixels share the same column, row, or follow a consistent diagonal step. Also, record the set of unique rows (`ref_rows`) and columns (`ref_cols`) occupied by the `Reference Structure`.\n3.  **Prepare Output:** Create a copy of the input grid.\n4.  **Execute Drawing Rule based on Reference Structure Orientation:**\n    *   **If Vertical Reference:**\n        *   Find the column index (`ref_col`) occupied by the `Reference Structure` pixels.\n        *   Draw a horizontal line in the output grid using `marker_color`.\n        *   The line is drawn in the row `marker_position.row`.\n        *   The line extends from column `ref_col + 1` to `marker_position.col`.
