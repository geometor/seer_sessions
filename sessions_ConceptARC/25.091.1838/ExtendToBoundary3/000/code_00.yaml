# General observations across examples
task_type: drawing_completion
background_color: 0 # white
elements:
  - role: reference_structure
    description: A pattern of non-background pixels (line, dashed line, diagonal).
    properties:
      - color: Varies (gray, orange, green)
      - shape: Line-like (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)
      - count: Multiple pixels
  - role: marker_pixel
    description: A single, isolated non-background pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (yellow, orange, red)
      - shape: Single pixel
      - count: 1
transformation:
  action: draw_line
  properties:
    color: Determined by marker_pixel.color
    orientation: Determined by reference_structure.shape and relative position to marker_pixel
    start_point: Near reference_structure, aligned with marker_pixel
    end_point: Near marker_pixel, aligned with reference_structure (or stops based on collision rule)
relationship: The new line connects the 'area' of the reference structure to the 'area' of the marker pixel, following specific alignment and stopping rules based on the reference structure's orientation.

# Example-specific observations
example_1:
  reference_structure:
    color: 5 # gray
    location: Column 1, various rows
    orientation: Vertical
  marker_pixel:
    color: 4 # yellow
    location: (5, 11)
  drawn_line:
    color: 4 # yellow
    orientation: Horizontal
    row: 5
    start_col: 2 # col after reference + 1
    end_col: 11 # marker_pixel column

example_2:
  reference_structure:
    color: 7 # orange
    location: Row 1, various columns
    orientation: Horizontal
  marker_pixel:
    color: 7 # orange
    location: (7, 8)
  drawn_line:
    color: 7 # orange
    orientation: Vertical
    col: 8
    start_row: 2 # row after reference + 1
    end_row: 7 # marker_pixel row

example_3:
  reference_structure:
    color: 3 # green
    location: Diagonal ((0,0), (2,2), (4,4), (6,6))
    orientation: Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
  marker_pixel:
    color: 2 # red
    location: (6, 0)
  drawn_line:
    color: 2 # red
    orientation: Diagonal path (up-right)
    start_pos: (6, 0) # marker_pixel position (path originates here)
    path_points_added: [(5, 1), (4, 2)]
    stop_condition: Next step's column (col 2) contains a reference_structure pixel (at row 2).
