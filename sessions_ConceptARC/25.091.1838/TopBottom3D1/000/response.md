Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The examples consistently show a pattern where a central vertical structure is partially overwritten by the color of flanking vertical structures.

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains at least three distinct visual components arranged vertically:
    *   A left-side vertical structure (can be a single column or multiple columns wide).
    *   A right-side vertical structure of the *same color* as the left-side one.
    *   A central vertical structure of a *different color*, positioned between the left and right structures.
    *   The background is typically white (0), but the core transformation doesn't seem directly dependent on it.

2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the overall structure, but with a specific modification:
    *   The left and right flanking structures remain unchanged.
    *   Parts of the central structure *that are horizontally aligned with the flanking structures* change color. They adopt the color of the flanking structures.
    *   Parts of the central structure *not* horizontally aligned with the flanking structures remain unchanged.

3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the rows where the flanking structures exist. In these rows, it finds the pixels belonging to the central structure that lie horizontally *between* the flanking structures. These specific central pixels are then recolored to match the color of the flanking structures. Essentially, the flanking color "fills" the horizontal gap occupied by the central structure, but only in the rows where the flanking structures are present.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap within a central vertical object using the color of flanking vertical objects, but only in rows where both flanking objects exist."

objects:
  - type: flanking_structures
    description: "Two separate vertical structures (bars or regions) of the same color, located on the left and right sides of the grid."
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (blue, green, orange). Let's call this 'flanking_color'.
      - position: One on the left, one on the right.
      - shape: Vertical bars or regions.
  - type: central_structure
    description: "A vertical structure (bar or region) located between the flanking structures."
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (red, yellow, magenta), different from 'flanking_color'. Let's call this 'central_color'.
      - position: Between the flanking structures.
      - shape: Vertical bar or region.
  - type: background
    description: "The area surrounding the main structures."
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The central structure is horizontally positioned between the left and right flanking structures."
  - type: alignment
    description: "The transformation depends on the horizontal alignment (rows) where both left and right flanking structures exist."

actions:
  - name: identify_flanking_color_and_rows
    description: "Find the color of the flanking structures ('flanking_color') and identify the rows where pixels of this color exist on both the left and right sides of the central structure."
  - name: identify_central_pixels_for_change
    description: "Within the identified rows, locate the pixels belonging to the central structure ('central_color') that fall horizontally between the innermost columns of the left flanking structure and the outermost columns of the right flanking structure."
  - name: recolor_pixels
    description: "Change the color of the identified central pixels to the 'flanking_color'."
  - name: keep_others
    description: "All other pixels in the grid retain their original color."

transformation_logic: "For each row, check if pixels of the 'flanking_color' exist both to the left and to the right of the central structure's columns. If they do, find the horizontal segment occupied by the 'central_color' that lies strictly between the flanking pixels in that row. Recolor this segment with the 'flanking_color'."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-background colors present in the input grid. One color forms two separate vertical flanking structures (left and right), call this `flanking_color`. The other color forms a central vertical structure, call this `central_color`.
2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
3.  Iterate through each row of the grid.
4.  For the current row, determine the minimum column index (`left_flank_col`) containing the `flanking_color` and the maximum column index (`right_flank_col`) containing the `flanking_color`. Check if both `left_flank_col` and `right_flank_col` exist in this row and if `left_flank_col` is less than `right_flank_col`.
5.  If both flanking pixels exist in the row, iterate through the columns `c` from `left_flank_col + 1` up to (but not including) `right_flank_col`.
6.  For each column `c` in this range, check if the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *input* grid has the `central_color`.
7.  If it does, change the color of the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *output* grid to the `flanking_color`.
8.  If the flanking pixels do not both exist in the current row, or if a pixel between them does not have the `central_color`, make no change to that pixel in the output grid (it retains its original color from the input).
9.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
