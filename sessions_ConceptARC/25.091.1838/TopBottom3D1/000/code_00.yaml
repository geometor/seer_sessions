task_description: "Fill the horizontal gap within a central vertical object using the color of flanking vertical objects, but only in rows where both flanking objects exist."

objects:
  - type: flanking_structures
    description: "Two separate vertical structures (bars or regions) of the same color, located on the left and right sides of the grid."
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (blue, green, orange). Let's call this 'flanking_color'.
      - position: One on the left, one on the right.
      - shape: Vertical bars or regions.
  - type: central_structure
    description: "A vertical structure (bar or region) located between the flanking structures."
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (red, yellow, magenta), different from 'flanking_color'. Let's call this 'central_color'.
      - position: Between the flanking structures.
      - shape: Vertical bar or region.
  - type: background
    description: "The area surrounding the main structures."
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The central structure is horizontally positioned between the left and right flanking structures."
  - type: alignment
    description: "The transformation depends on the horizontal alignment (rows) where both left and right flanking structures exist."

actions:
  - name: identify_flanking_color_and_rows
    description: "Find the color of the flanking structures ('flanking_color') and identify the rows where pixels of this color exist on both the left and right sides of the central structure."
  - name: identify_central_pixels_for_change
    description: "Within the identified rows, locate the pixels belonging to the central structure ('central_color') that fall horizontally between the innermost columns of the left flanking structure and the outermost columns of the right flanking structure."
  - name: recolor_pixels
    description: "Change the color of the identified central pixels to the 'flanking_color'."
  - name: keep_others
    description: "All other pixels in the grid retain their original color."

transformation_logic: "For each row, check if pixels of the 'flanking_color' exist both to the left and to the right of the central structure's columns. If they do, find the horizontal segment occupied by the 'central_color' that lies strictly between the flanking pixels in that row. Recolor this segment with the 'flanking_color'."
