            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe examples consistently show a pattern where a central vertical structure is partially overwritten by the color of flanking vertical structures.\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains at least three distinct visual components arranged vertically:\n    *   A left-side vertical structure (can be a single column or multiple columns wide).\n    *   A right-side vertical structure of the *same color* as the left-side one.\n    *   A central vertical structure of a *different color*, positioned between the left and right structures.\n    *   The background is typically white (0), but the core transformation doesn't seem directly dependent on it.\n\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the overall structure, but with a specific modification:\n    *   The left and right flanking structures remain unchanged.\n    *   Parts of the central structure *that are horizontally aligned with the flanking structures* change color. They adopt the color of the flanking structures.\n    *   Parts of the central structure *not* horizontally aligned with the flanking structures remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the rows where the flanking structures exist. In these rows, it finds the pixels belonging to the central structure that lie horizontally *between* the flanking structures. These specific central pixels are then recolored to match the color of the flanking structures. Essentially, the flanking color \"fills\" the horizontal gap occupied by the central structure, but only in the rows where the flanking structures are present.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

One color forms two separate vertical flanking structures (left and right), call this `flanking_color`. The other color forms a central vertical structure, call this `central_color`.\n2.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n3.  Iterate through each row of the grid.\n4.  For the current row, determine the minimum column index (`left_flank_col`) containing the `flanking_color` and the maximum column index (`right_flank_col`) containing the `flanking_color`. Check if both `left_flank_col` and `right_flank_col` exist in this row and if `left_flank_col` is less than `right_flank_col`.\n5.  If both flanking pixels exist in the row, iterate through the columns `c` from `left_flank_col + 1` up to (but not including) `right_flank_col`.\n6.  For each column `c` in this range, check if the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *input* grid has the `central_color`.\n7.  If it does, change the color of the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *output* grid to the `flanking_color`.\n8.  If the flanking pixels do not both exist in the current row, or if a pixel between them does not have the `central_color`, make no change to that pixel in the output grid (it retains its original color from the input).\n9.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output."
