            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\nObserving the input and output grids in both examples, the core transformation appears to be a form of \"gravity\" acting vertically within each column.\n\n1.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the non-white pixels (yellow in example 1, magenta in example 2) remain unchanged from input to output.\n2.  **Vertical Movement:** Non-white pixels move downwards. White pixels (0) seem to represent empty space through which other pixels can fall.\n3.  **Column Independence:** The movement happens independently within each column. A pixel in one column does not affect the movement of pixels in other columns.\n4.  **Stacking:** When a non-white pixel falls, it stops when it reaches the bottom edge of the grid or rests on top of another non-white pixel within the same column.\n5.  **Order Preservation (within column):** Although pixels fall, their relative vertical order within a column seems to be preserved if you read the non-white pixels from top to bottom in the input and compare them to the stacked pixels read from top to bottom in the output. However, it's simpler to think of it as collecting all non-white pixels in a column and stacking them at the bottom.\n6.  **Grid Size:** The dimensions (height and width) of the grid remain constant.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
