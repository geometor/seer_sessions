task_context:
  - The transformation simulates vertical gravity independently within each column of the grid.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - pixels: cells containing integer values (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: height, width
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: row, column
      - type: white (0) or non-white (1-9)
  - name: column
    properties:
      - index: integer representing the vertical slice of the grid
      - contains: sequence of pixels
actions:
  - identify: locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - collect: gather the non-white pixels for each column separately.
  - stack: place the collected non-white pixels at the bottom of their respective columns in the output grid.
  - fill: ensure all remaining positions above the stacked pixels in each column are filled with white (0).
relationships:
  - spatial: pixels exist within columns; columns make up the grid.
  - transformation: input grid pixels determine output grid pixels based on the gravity rule.
  - column_constraint: gravity acts solely within the boundaries of each column.
