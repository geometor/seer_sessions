Input Grids:
  - Contain a background color (white, 0).
  - Contain multiple objects composed of non-background colors (e.g., gray, red, yellow, green, magenta, azure, orange).
  - Objects have varying shapes, sizes, and positions.
  - Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 10x10, 8x8).

Output Grids:
  - Are always 1 row high.
  - Width (N) varies.
  - Are filled uniformly with the background color (white, 0).

Relationship & Transformation:
  - The width (N) of the output grid depends on the input grid.
  - Property influencing N: Count of unique non-background colors (C) in the input.
  - Action: Count unique non-background colors (C).
  - Rule for N:
    - If C is 2, N = 3.
    - Otherwise, N = C.
  - Action: Construct the output grid.
  - Output structure: A grid with 1 row and N columns.
  - Output content: All cells are filled with the background color (0).

Examples:
  - Example 1: C = 4 (colors 2, 3, 4, 5) -> N = 4. Output is 1x4, all 0s.
  - Example 2: C = 2 (colors 4, 6) -> N = 3. Output is 1x3, all 0s.
  - Example 3: C = 4 (colors 3, 4, 7, 8) -> N = 4. Output is 1x4, all 0s.
