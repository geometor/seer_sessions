Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The inputs are grids of varying sizes (10x10, 10x10, 8x8) containing multiple "objects." Objects are contiguous areas of non-background colors (colors other than white/0). The background is white (0). Different colors and shapes appear in each input.
2.  **Output:** The outputs are smaller, square grids filled entirely with the background color (white/0). The sizes vary (4x4, 3x3, 4x4).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves analyzing the input grid to determine the size of the output grid. The content of the output grid is always uniform (all white/0). The core task seems to be figuring out the rule that dictates the output grid's dimension.
4.  **Relationship:** By comparing the inputs and outputs, the key seems to lie in a global property of the input grid rather than the specific shapes or locations of objects. The number of unique non-background colors present appears correlated with the output dimension.
    *   Example 1: Input has 4 unique non-background colors (gray-5, red-2, yellow-4, green-3). Output is 4x4.
    *   Example 2: Input has 2 unique non-background colors (magenta-6, yellow-4). Output is 3x3.
    *   Example 3: Input has 4 unique non-background colors (yellow-4, azure-8, green-3, orange-7). Output is 4x4.
5.  **Hypothesis:** The dimension `N` of the output `N`x`N` grid seems to be determined by the count of unique non-background colors (`C`) in the input. If `C` is 4, `N` is 4. If `C` is 2, `N` is 3. It appears the rule is: `N = C` unless `C = 2`, in which case `N = 3`.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grids:
  - Contains a background color (white, 0).
  - Contains multiple objects composed of non-background colors.
  - Objects vary in shape, size, color, and position across examples.
  - Grid dimensions vary.

Output Grids:
  - Are always square.
  - Are filled uniformly with the background color (white, 0).
  - Dimensions (N x N) vary across examples.

Relationship:
  - The dimension N of the output grid depends on the input grid.
  - Property influencing N: Count of unique non-background colors (C).
    - Example 1: C = 4 (colors 5, 2, 4, 3) -> N = 4.
    - Example 2: C = 2 (colors 6, 4) -> N = 3.
    - Example 3: C = 4 (colors 4, 8, 3, 7) -> N = 4.
  - Rule for N:
    - If C (count of unique non-background colors) is 2, N = 3.
    - Otherwise, N = C.

Transformation:
  - Step 1: Analyze the input grid to identify all unique pixel values (colors) excluding the background color (0).
  - Step 2: Count the number of these unique colors (C).
  - Step 3: Determine the output grid dimension (N) based on C: N = 3 if C == 2, else N = C.
  - Step 4: Construct an N x N grid filled entirely with the background color (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid and identify all the distinct colors present, ignoring the background color (white, value 0).
2.  Count how many unique non-background colors were found. Let this count be `C`.
3.  Determine the dimension `N` for the output grid. If the count `C` is exactly 2, set the dimension `N` to 3. For any other count `C`, set the dimension `N` to be equal to `C`.
4.  Generate the output grid as a square grid of size `N` by `N`, where every cell contains the background color (white, value 0).
```python
"""
Determine the size of the output grid based on the count of unique non-background colors in the input grid.

1. Scan the input grid to find all unique pixel values (colors) excluding the background color (0).
2. Count the number of these unique non-background colors (C).
3. Determine the output grid dimension (N). If C is exactly 2, set N to 3. Otherwise, set N equal to C.
4. Create an N x N grid filled entirely with the background color (0).
