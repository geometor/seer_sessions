The background is white (0). Different colors and shapes appear in each input.\n2.  **Output:** The outputs are smaller, square grids filled entirely with the background color (white/0). The sizes vary (4x4, 3x3, 4x4).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves analyzing the input grid to determine the size of the output grid. The content of the output grid is always uniform (all white/0). The core task seems to be figuring out the rule that dictates the output grid's dimension.\n4.  **Relationship:** By comparing the inputs and outputs, the key seems to lie in a global property of the input grid rather than the specific shapes or locations of objects. The number of unique non-background colors present appears correlated with the output dimension.\n    *   Example 1: Input has 4 unique non-background colors (gray-5, red-2, yellow-4, green-3). Output is 4x4.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 2 unique non-background colors (magenta-6, yellow-4). Output is 3x3.\n    *   Example 3: Input has 4 unique non-background colors (yellow-4, azure-8, green-3, orange-7). Output is 4x4.\n5.  **Hypothesis:** The dimension `N` of the output `N`x`N` grid seems to be determined by the count of unique non-background colors (`C`) in the input. If `C` is 4, `N` is 4. If `C` is 2, `N` is 3. It appears the rule is: `N = C` unless `C = 2`, in which case `N = 3`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
