Input Grids:
  - Contains a background color (white, 0).
  - Contains multiple objects composed of non-background colors.
  - Objects vary in shape, size, color, and position across examples.
  - Grid dimensions vary.

Output Grids:
  - Are always square.
  - Are filled uniformly with the background color (white, 0).
  - Dimensions (N x N) vary across examples.

Relationship:
  - The dimension N of the output grid depends on the input grid.
  - Property influencing N: Count of unique non-background colors (C).
    - Example 1: C = 4 (colors 5, 2, 4, 3) -> N = 4.
    - Example 2: C = 2 (colors 6, 4) -> N = 3.
    - Example 3: C = 4 (colors 4, 8, 3, 7) -> N = 4.
  - Rule for N:
    - If C (count of unique non-background colors) is 2, N = 3.
    - Otherwise, N = C.

Transformation:
  - Step 1: Analyze the input grid to identify all unique pixel values (colors) excluding the background color (0).
  - Step 2: Count the number of these unique colors (C).
  - Step 3: Determine the output grid dimension (N) based on C: N = 3 if C == 2, else N = C.
  - Step 4: Construct an N x N grid filled entirely with the background color (0).
