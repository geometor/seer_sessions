elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: canvas
  - object: horizontal_line
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - spans full width
      - solid (no breaks)
      - exactly one instance per grid
    role: separator/boundary
  - object: other_pixels
    color: [green (3), orange (7)] # Any color other than background or line color
    properties:
      - can form contiguous shapes or be individual pixels
      - located above or below the horizontal_line
    role: content_to_be_filtered
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: other_pixels are either 'above' or 'below' the horizontal_line based on their row index compared to the line's row index.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: horizontal_line
    purpose: find the row index of the separator.
  - action: iterate
    target: grid pixels
    condition: row index > horizontal_line row index
  - action: replace
    target: other_pixels below horizontal_line
    result: replaced with background color (white - 0)
  - action: preserve
    target:
      - horizontal_line
      - other_pixels above horizontal_line
      - background pixels
    result: remain unchanged
