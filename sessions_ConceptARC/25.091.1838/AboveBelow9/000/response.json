These objects appear both above and below the yellow line.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be related to the position of these other colored objects relative to the yellow horizontal line.\n4.  **Selective Removal:** In the output grids, all the colored objects (green or orange) that were located *below* the yellow line in the input have been removed and replaced with the white (0) background color.\n5.  **Preservation:** The yellow line itself and all colored objects located *above* the yellow line remain unchanged in the output.\n\nThe task appears to involve using the horizontal yellow line as a dividing boundary and clearing everything below it, except for the background itself.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
