            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: shifting the object with the minimum color value one column to the left. However, the initial implementation failed on examples 3 and 4 because it incorrectly handled the pixels vacated by the moving object. The original code simply set these pixels to the background color (0).\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples reveals a more nuanced rule:\nWhen a pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the moving object is vacated, its new color is determined by its neighbors in the *original* input grid. If any adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, right) belongs to a *stationary* object, the pixel `(r, c)` takes the color of that stationary neighbor. If multiple stationary neighbors exist, the specific choice doesn't seem critical based on the examples (perhaps the first one found during a standard neighbor check order, e.g., up, down, left, right). If no adjacent neighbor belongs to a stationary object, the pixel `(r, c)` becomes the background color (white, 0).\n\nCrucially, this \"filling\" of vacated space happens *before* the moving object is drawn in its new, shifted position. The final drawing step might overwrite some of the pixels filled during the vacation step.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze each example with the refined understanding. We need to identify objects, minimum color, moving object coordinates, stationary object coordinates, and check neighbors for vacated pixels.\n\n"
