*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are grids of colored pixels.
    *   Each input grid contains multiple distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-white colors.
    *   In the transformation from input to output, one specific object appears to move exactly one column to the left.
    *   The other objects in the grid remain in their original positions.
    *   The pixels where the moving object was originally located become white (background color), unless they are overwritten by the object's new position (if the shift causes overlap with its original footprint).
    *   The pixels into which the object moves adopt the color of the moving object, overwriting any color previously there.
    *   Comparing the colors of the objects present in each example, the object that moves is consistently the one with the lowest numerical color value (e.g., blue=1 moves when red=2 is present; green=3 moves when yellow=4 is present; yellow=4 moves when magenta=6 is present).

*   **Facts:**

      - type: grid
        description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
      - type: background
        color_name: white
        color_value: 0
        description: The default background color.
      - type: object
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels sharing the same non-white color.
        properties:
          - color_name: Varies (e.g., blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta)
          - color_value: Integer from 1 to 9.
          - shape: Varies (e.g., L-shape, rectangle, single pixel, plus-shape).
          - position: Location within the grid.
    transformation:
      - action: identify_objects
        description: Find all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
      - action: select_object_by_color
        condition: If multiple objects exist, select the object whose color has the minimum numerical value. If only one object exists, select that object.
        target: The selected object.
      - action: shift_object
        direction: left
        distance: 1 column
        target: The selected object identified in the previous step.
        effect_on_original_position: Pixels become white (0).
        effect_on_new_position: Pixels take the color of the shifted object, overwriting existing content.
      - action: preserve_objects
        target: All non-selected objects.
        description: Objects not selected for shifting remain unchanged in the output grid.
      - result: Output grid reflects the shifted object and preserved objects.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects of non-white color in the input grid. Record the color value and pixel coordinates for each object.
    2.  Determine the minimum color value among all identified objects.
    3.  Select the object that corresponds to this minimum color value. This is the "target object".
    4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  For every pixel belonging to the target object in the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
    6.  For every pixel belonging to the target object in the input grid, calculate its new position by subtracting 1 from its column coordinate.
    7.  If the new column coordinate is valid (greater than or equal to 0), set the pixel at this new position (original row, new column) in the output grid to the color of the target object.
