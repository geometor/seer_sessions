"""
Identifies all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid. 
Finds the object with the minimum color value (the target object).
Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
For each pixel originally belonging to the target object:
  - If an adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, right in the input grid) belongs to a stationary object (an object not being moved), the pixel's position in the output grid takes the color of that stationary neighbor.
  - Otherwise, the pixel's position in the output grid becomes white (0).
Finally, shifts the target object one column to the left, drawing its pixels with its original color onto the output grid at the new positions. This drawing step overwrites any color previously set at the new positions.
