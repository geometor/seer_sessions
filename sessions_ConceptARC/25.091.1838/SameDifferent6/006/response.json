            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: objects defined by an \"Outer Color\", a \"Special Color\" derived from the grid context, and a removal rule based on the Special Color and the sorted list of Outer Colors. However, the implementation failed because it only removed the pixels of the object's Outer Color, neglecting the associated Special Color pixels that were spatially related (inside/adjacent) to the removed object.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the removal step:\n1.  Identify the objects and their Outer Colors.\n2.  Determine the Special Color (the unique color in the grid that is not black and not an Outer Color; defaults to black if not unique or non-existent).\n3.  Select the Outer Color to remove based on the Special Color (smallest if Special != 0, second smallest if Special == 0).\n4.  Identify all pixels belonging to objects with the selected Outer Color.\n5.  Identify all pixels of the Special Color.\n6.  Determine which Special Color pixels should also be removed: those that are adjacent (4-way or 8-way, let's assume 4-way for now, but might need 8-way) to any pixel identified in step 4.\n7.  Create the output grid by taking the input grid and setting both the object pixels (step 4) and the associated adjacent Special Color pixels (step 6) to black (0).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"

            "text": "**Analysis Update:**\n\nThe code execution reveals a flaw in my `_get_special_color` logic or its application.\n*   **Example 1:** Outer Colors are {1, 2, 4, 8}. The unique color in the grid that isn't black or an outer color *should be* Blue (1). However, the code identified Blue (1) as an *object* color because it forms a contiguous block. My previous manual analysis incorrectly identified Blue(1) as the Inner/Special color. Let's redefine:\n    *   Objects: Red(2, 16 pixels), Blue(1, 2 pixels at (2,2),(6,2)), Yellow(4, 8 pixels), Azure(8, 8 pixels), Blue(1, 2 pixels at (2,7),(6,7)). *Correction:* The Blue(1) pixels are singletons or pairs, maybe not full objects depending on connectivity rule. Re-running `_find_objects` focusing on non-black.\n    *   Let's rethink the \"Special Color\". It's the color *used* by *all* primary objects but isn't their main color. In Ex 1, Red(2), Yellow(4), Azure(8) objects seem primary. They all contain/are adjacent to Blue(1). So Special=1. Outer={2,4,8}. Rule: Special!=0 -> remove smallest (2).\n    *   In Ex 2, Magenta(6), Green(3), Gray(5) seem primary. They all contain/are adjacent to Orange(7). Special=7. Outer={3,5,6}. Rule: Special!=0 -> remove smallest (3).\n    *   In Ex 3, Yellow(4), Blue(1), Orange(7) seem primary. They all contain/are adjacent to Black(0). Special=0. Outer={1,4,7}. Rule: Special==0 -> remove second smallest (4).\n\nThis matches the expected outputs and the original hypothesis *before* the code execution confused the issue by finding objects of the special color itself. The `_find_objects` needs refinement to distinguish \"primary\" objects from the \"special color\" pixels, perhaps by size or by the fact the special color is *inside* multiple different primary objects.\n\nAlternatively, the logic can remain: find *all* non-black objects. Calculate the true \"Special Color\" based on visual inspection / common internal color (as done manually above). Then apply the rule. The crucial part is the removal step: remove the object pixels *and* the adjacent special color pixels using 8-way adjacency.\n\nLet's re-run the analysis *manually* determining the Special Color based on the visual pattern:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Objects={Red(2), Yellow(4), Azure(8)}. Special=Blue(1). Outer={2, 4, 8}. Special=1 (non-zero). Remove smallest: 2. Pixels to remove: All Red(2) pixels + Blue(1) pixels adjacent (8-way) to Red(2) pixels. (This matches the expected output).\n*   **Example 2:** Objects={Magenta(6), Green(3), Gray(5)}. Special=Orange(7). Outer={3, 5, 6}. Special=7 (non-zero). Remove smallest: 3. Pixels to remove: All Green(3) pixels + Orange(7) pixels adjacent (8-way) to Green(3) pixels. (This matches the expected output).\n*   **Example 3:** Objects={Yellow(4), Blue(1), Orange(7)}. Special=Black(0). Outer={1, 4, 7}. Special=0 (zero). Remove second smallest: 4. Pixels to remove: All Yellow(4) pixels + Black(0) pixels adjacent (8-way) to Yellow(4) pixels. (This matches the expected output).\n\nThe 8-way adjacency for removing associated special color pixels seems correct. The definition of the Special Color needs to be carefully implemented \u2013 it's not just *any* non-object color, but the one associated visually/spatially with *all* the main objects. The previous `_get_special_color` function was too simplistic. A better approach might be to find bounding boxes for primary objects and see which non-primary color appears within all (or most) of them. For now, let's assume we can correctly identify the Special Color as per the manual analysis above.\n\n**YAML Fact Document (Revised)**\n\n"
