Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions of non-black pixels ("Primary Objects") and their colors ("Outer Colors").
2.  Determine the "Special Color": This is the unique color (potentially Black=0) that is spatially associated (inside or adjacent) with *all* identified Primary Objects but is different from their Outer Colors.
    - Find all unique colors in the grid.
    - Identify the set of Outer Colors from the Primary Objects.
    - Candidate Special Colors are those grid colors that are not Black and not in the Outer Color set.
    - If exactly one such Candidate exists, it is the Special Color.
    - Otherwise (zero or multiple Candidates), the Special Color is Black (0).
3.  Determine the Target Outer Color for Removal:
    - Get the sorted list of unique Outer Colors.
    - If the Special Color is Black (0) and there are at least two Outer Colors, the color to remove is the *second* smallest Outer Color.
    - If the Special Color is *not* Black (0) and there is at least one Outer Color, the color to remove is the *smallest* Outer Color.
    - If these conditions aren't met, no color is targeted for removal.
4.  Construct the Output Grid:
    - Start with a copy of the input grid.
    - Identify all pixels belonging to Primary Objects whose Outer Color is the target color for removal.
    - Identify all pixels in the grid that have the Special Color.
    - Find the subset of Special Color pixels that are 8-way adjacent (includes diagonals) to any of the object pixels targeted for removal.
    - Set both the targeted object pixels and the adjacent Special Color pixels to Black (0) in the output grid.
