Determine the Target Outer Color for Removal:\n    - Get the sorted list of unique Outer Colors.\n    - If the Special Color is Black (0) and there are at least two Outer Colors, the color to remove is the *second* smallest Outer Color.\n    - If the Special Color is *not* Black (0) and there is at least one Outer Color, the color to remove is the *smallest* Outer Color.\n    - If these conditions aren't met, no color is targeted for removal.\n4.
