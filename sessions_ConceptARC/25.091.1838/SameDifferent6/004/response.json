            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core logic involving object identification, a \"special color\" concept, and a removal rule based on the special color and the sorted order of object colors (Outer Colors). The rule identified (remove smallest outer color if special color is non-black; remove second smallest outer color if special color is black) holds true for the expected outputs of all three training examples.\n\nHowever, the code failed on examples 1 and 2 due to an incorrect implementation of the final step: constructing the output grid. The previous code created a blank grid and copied only the *kept* objects, thereby losing any non-object pixels (including the \"special color\" pixels when they were not black). Example 3 succeeded coincidentally because the special color was black (0), which matched the background of the blank grid created.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to:\n1.  Maintain the logic for identifying objects, the special color, and the color to remove.\n2.  Modify the output construction step: Instead of building from a blank grid, start with a *copy* of the input grid and then *erase* (set to black/0) the pixels belonging to the objects whose color matches the \"Color To Remove\". This preserves all other pixels, including the special color pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nBased on analysis of the examples and expected outputs:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Objects: Red (2), Yellow (4), Azure (8). Outer Colors: {2, 4, 8}. Sorted: [2, 4, 8].\n    *   Grid Colors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}.\n    *   Special Color Check: `GridColors - OuterColors - {0}` = `{1}`. Special Color = 1 (Blue).\n    *   Rule: Special Color is non-zero (1). Remove smallest Outer Color = 2 (Red).\n    *   Expected Output confirms Red (2) objects are removed, preserving Blue (1), Yellow (4), and Azure (8) pixels.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects: Magenta (6), Green (3), Gray (5). Outer Colors: {3, 5, 6}. Sorted: [3, 5, 6].\n    *   Grid Colors: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}.\n    *   Special Color Check: `GridColors - OuterColors - {0}` = `{7}`. Special Color = 7 (Orange).\n    *   Rule: Special Color is non-zero (7). Remove smallest Outer Color = 3 (Green).\n    *   Expected Output confirms Green (3) objects are removed, preserving Orange (7), Magenta (6), and Gray (5) pixels.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Objects: Yellow (4), Blue (1), Orange (7). Outer Colors: {1, 4, 7}. Sorted: [1, 4, 7].\n    *   Grid Colors: {0, 1, 4, 7}.\n    *   Special Color Check: `GridColors - OuterColors - {0}` = `{}`. Special Color = 0 (Black).\n    *   Rule: Special Color is zero (0). Remove second smallest Outer Color = 4 (Yellow).\n    *   Expected Output confirms Yellow (4) objects are removed, preserving Blue (1) and Orange (7) pixels.\n\nThe derived logic consistently matches the expected transformations. The error was purely in the implementation of applying the transformation to generate the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
