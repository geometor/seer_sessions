            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the transformation rule for Example 3 but failed on Examples 1 and 2. The failures reveal a misunderstanding in how the \"inner color\" influences the removal and what exactly gets removed.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code removed the objects with the smallest Outer Color (Red, 2) but failed to remove the associated non-outer color (Blue, 1) pixels located within those objects' original positions. The expected output removes the Red objects *and* the Blue pixels contained within them.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code again seems to have identified the correct Outer Color for removal (Green, 3, the smallest), but the resulting output is incorrect. The expected output removes the Green objects *and* the associated non-outer color (Orange, 7) pixels within them, while *keeping* the Orange pixels associated with the *kept* objects (Magenta, 6 and Gray, 5).\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  The core logic for identifying the *Outer Color* to remove seems partially correct and depends on a `SpecialColor` derived from the grid.\n2.  The `SpecialColor` is the unique color present in the input grid that is *not* black (0) and *not* one of the identified Outer Colors. If no such unique color exists, the `SpecialColor` is considered black (0).\n3.  The selection rule remains: if `SpecialColor` is black (0), remove the objects with the *second smallest* Outer Color; otherwise, remove objects with the *smallest* Outer Color.\n4.  **Crucially:** When an object is selected for removal, *all* pixels within its original bounding box in the input grid must be considered for removal. However, pixels belonging to *other objects that are being kept* should be preserved. The most straightforward way to implement this is to:\n    *   Identify all objects and their Outer Colors.\n    *   Determine the `ColorToRemove`.\n    *   Create a blank output grid (all black).\n    *   Iterate through all identified objects. If an object's Outer Color is *not* `ColorToRemove`, copy *all* pixels corresponding to that object from the input grid to the output grid. This ensures that even shared \"inner\" pixels are retained if they belong to a kept object.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the components for each example:\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics Results:**\n\nHold on, the `find_objects` function seems to have incorrectly identified colors 1 and 7 as Outer Colors in Examples 1 and 2, respectively. An \"Object\" was defined as a contiguous block of a *single non-black* color. Colors 1 (Blue) and 7 (Orange) appear *within* other colored shapes, but not as standalone contiguous objects themselves in the way that Red (2), Yellow (4), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Green (3), or Gray (5) do.\n\nLet's redefine `find_objects` slightly or refine the interpretation. The \"Outer Color\" should correspond to the main color forming the distinct shapes. The `SpecialColor` logic needs refinement based on this correct identification of Outer Colors.\n\n**Corrected Approach:**\n\n1.  Identify \"primary\" objects (shapes) and their colors (Outer Colors). These are the contiguous blocks of non-black color that are not fully contained within another object's bounding box (this is a heuristic, might need refinement).\n2.  Determine the `SpecialColor` as before: unique color != 0 and != any Outer Color.\n3.  Apply the removal rule based on `SpecialColor`.\n4.  Reconstruct the output by copying *only the pixels belonging to the kept objects*.\n\nLet's manually re-identify for the examples:\n\n*   **Ex 1:**\n    *   Primary Objects/Outer Colors: Red (2), Yellow (4), Azure (8). Outer Set = {2, 4, 8}.\n    *   Other non-black colors: Blue (1).\n    *   SpecialColor = 1 (unique, non-outer, non-black).\n    *   Rule: SpecialColor != 0 -> Remove smallest Outer Color.\n    *   ColorToRemove = 2 (Red).\n*   **Ex 2:**\n    *   Primary Objects/Outer Colors: Magenta (6), Green (3), Gray (5). Outer Set = {3, 5, 6}.\n    *   Other non-black colors: Orange (7).\n    *   SpecialColor = 7.\n    *   Rule: SpecialColor != 0 -> Remove smallest Outer Color.\n    *   ColorToRemove = 3 (Green).\n*   **Ex 3:**\n    *   Primary Objects/Outer Colors: Yellow (4), Blue (1), Orange (7). Outer Set = {1, 4, 7}.\n    *   Other non-black colors: None.\n    *   SpecialColor = 0.\n    *   Rule: SpecialColor == 0 -> Remove second smallest Outer Color.\n    *   ColorToRemove = 4 (Yellow).\n\nThis manual analysis matches the expected outputs and the derived removal rule. The key was correctly identifying the \"Outer Color\" objects versus the \"inner\" or `SpecialColor`. The previous code execution failed because the simple `find_objects` treated the inner Blue (1) and Orange (7) pixels as separate objects.\n\n**Refined Fact Document:**\n\n"
