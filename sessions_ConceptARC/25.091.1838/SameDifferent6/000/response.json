            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct shapes or objects. Each object is primarily composed of a single non-black color (let's call this the \"Outer Color\").\n2.  **Object Characteristics:** The objects vary in shape (squares, rectangles, L-shapes, T-shapes) and Outer Color.\n3.  **Shared Feature:** Within each input grid, all the identified objects seem to share a common characteristic: they all contain or surround pixels of a single, specific color (let's call this the \"Inner Color\"). This Inner Color is different from the Outer Color of the objects themselves.\n    *   Example 1: Objects (Red, Yellow, Azure) all contain Blue (1). Inner Color = Blue (1).\n    *   Example 2: Objects (Magenta, Green, Gray) all contain Orange (7). Inner Color = Orange (7).\n    *   Example 3: Objects (Yellow, Blue, Orange) all contain Black (0). Inner Color = Black (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively removing *entire* objects based on their Outer Color. The output grid retains only a subset of the objects from the input grid, replacing the removed objects' pixels with the background color (Black, 0).\n5.  **Removal Rule:** The decision of which object color(s) to remove appears to depend on a comparison or relationship between the Outer Colors present and the shared Inner Color.\n    *   In Ex 1 (Inner=1), Outer={2, 4, 8}. Color 2 (smallest) is removed.\n    *   In Ex 2 (Inner=7), Outer={3, 5, 6}. Color 3 (smallest) is removed.\n    *   In Ex 3 (Inner=0), Outer={1, 4, 7}. Color 4 (second smallest) is removed.\n    *   This suggests a rule based on the sorted order of Outer Colors, conditional on the Inner Color value.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
