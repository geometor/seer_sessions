task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Black (0) is the background.
  - element: Object
    description: A contiguous region of pixels sharing the same non-black color (Outer Color).
    properties:
      - OuterColor: The primary color of the object's pixels.
      - Pixels: The coordinates of the pixels comprising the object.
      - BoundingBox: The minimum rectangle enclosing the object.
  - element: InnerColor
    description: A single color found within the spatial extent (e.g., bounding box or internal adjacency) of all Objects in a given input grid. This color differs from the OuterColor of the objects it is associated with. It can be Black (0).
    relationship: Contained within or adjacent internally to all Objects.
  - element: SetOfOuterColors
    description: The unique collection of Outer Colors of all objects present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - UniqueColors: List of distinct Outer Colors.
      - SortedColors: UniqueColors sorted numerically.
      - MinColor: The smallest color in UniqueColors.
      - SecondMinColor: The second smallest color in UniqueColors (if it exists).

actions:
  - action: IdentifyObjects
    description: Find all connected components of non-black pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: Input Grid
    outputs: List of Objects (with their OuterColor and Pixels).
  - action: IdentifyInnerColor
    description: Determine the single color shared internally by all identified objects.
    inputs: Input Grid, List of Objects
    outputs: InnerColor value.
  - action: SelectColorToRemove
    description: Choose which Outer Color objects should be removed based on the InnerColor and the sorted list of Outer Colors.
    inputs: InnerColor, Sorted List of Outer Colors
    outputs: ColorToRemove.
    logic: |
      If InnerColor is Black (0), ColorToRemove is the second element in Sorted List of Outer Colors.
      If InnerColor is not Black (0), ColorToRemove is the first element (minimum) in Sorted List of Outer Colors.
  - action: FilterObjects
    description: Remove objects based on the selected ColorToRemove.
    inputs: Input Grid, List of Objects, ColorToRemove
    outputs: Output Grid.
    logic: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initially Black (0). Copy pixels of all objects whose OuterColor is NOT ColorToRemove from the input to the output.

relationships:
  - relationship: RemovalCondition
    description: The rule determining object removal depends on the InnerColor and the relative order of the OuterColors.
    entities: InnerColor, SetOfOuterColors, ColorToRemove
