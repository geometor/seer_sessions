"""
Identifies distinct contiguous objects of non-black colors (Outer Colors) in the input grid.
Determines a 'Special Color': the unique color present in the grid that is neither black (0) nor one of the Outer Colors. If no such unique color exists, the Special Color is defined as Black (0).
Selects an Outer Color for removal based on the Special Color:
- If the Special Color is 0, remove the second smallest Outer Color (if it exists).
- If the Special Color is non-zero, remove the smallest Outer Color (if it exists).
Constructs the output grid by starting with a copy of the input and changing the pixels of the objects selected for removal to black (0).
