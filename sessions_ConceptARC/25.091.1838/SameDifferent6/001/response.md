"""
Identify all distinct contiguous objects of a single non-black color (Outer Color).
Determine the single color (Inner Color) that is present in the grid but is not black (0) and not one of the Outer Colors. If no such color exists, the Inner Color is black (0).
Collect the unique Outer Colors and sort them numerically.
If the Inner Color is black (0), the color to remove is the second smallest Outer Color.
If the Inner Color is not black (0), the color to remove is the smallest Outer Color.
Create an output grid by copying only those objects whose Outer Color is NOT the color selected for removal.
