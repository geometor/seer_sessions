"""
Identify all non-white pixels (color C) in the input grid.
Determine if these pixels form a single connected component (8-way adjacency) or multiple components.

If a single connected component exists:
  Keep only the boundary pixels of this component (pixels of color C that are adjacent, including diagonally, to at least one white pixel).
  Change the interior pixels of the component to white.

If multiple disconnected components/pixels exist:
  Calculate the convex hull enclosing all non-white pixel coordinates.
  Fill the area inside and on the boundary of this convex hull with color C.
  The rest of the grid remains white.
