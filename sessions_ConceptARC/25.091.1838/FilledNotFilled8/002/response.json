However, the initial analysis and the natural language program appear conceptually sound based on visual inspection of the two examples.\n\nThe core hypothesis involves a conditional transformation based on the connectivity of the non-background pixels:\n1.  **Single Connected Component:** Extract the boundary (outline).\n2.  **Multiple Disconnected Components/Pixels:** Fill the convex hull enclosing all points.\n\nThe strategy remains to refine this logic based on a careful re-examination of the examples and gather detailed metrics to confirm the properties of the input and output grids in each case. We will proceed assuming the geometric operations (connectivity check, boundary finding, convex hull) are feasible.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n"

The pixels form the outline of the input diamond. My manual connectivity check surprisingly reports **2 components** for the output outline. This might be an artifact of the simple BFS check not fully capturing the notion of an \"outline\" as a single entity, or perhaps the outline *is* technically disconnected at certain points in 8-way adjacency (e.g., corners touching diagonally). However, visually and conceptually, it represents the single boundary of the input object. The transformation clearly involves removing interior points.\n\n**Refined YAML Facts:**\n\n"
