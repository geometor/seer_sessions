task_description: Apply one of two transformations based on the connectivity of non-white pixels.

example_1:
  input_features:
    - objects: Multiple disconnected magenta (6) pixels.
    - arrangement: Scattered points.
    - background_color: white (0)
  output_features:
    - objects: A single solid magenta (6) object.
    - shape: Convex hull of the input points.
    - background_color: white (0)
  action:
    - type: Geometric construction
    - name: Convex Hull Filling
    - description: Find the convex hull of the input magenta pixels and fill the enclosed area with magenta.

example_2:
  input_features:
    - objects: A single connected green (3) object.
    - shape: Diamond (filled).
    - background_color: white (0)
  output_features:
    - objects: Multiple connected green (3) pixels forming an outline.
    - shape: Diamond (outline).
    - background_color: white (0)
  action:
    - type: Boundary extraction
    - name: Outline Finding
    - description: Identify the boundary pixels of the input green object and discard the interior pixels (set to white).

general_logic:
  condition: Check connectivity of non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals).
  if_single_connected_object: Apply Outline Finding.
  if_multiple_disconnected_pixels_or_objects: Apply Convex Hull Filling using the color of the input pixels.
