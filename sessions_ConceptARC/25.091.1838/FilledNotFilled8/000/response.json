            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Train_1 Example:**\n    *   The input grid contains several scattered magenta (6) pixels against a white (0) background. These pixels are not connected to each other.\n    *   The output grid retains the original magenta pixels and fills the area \"between\" them with more magenta pixels. The resulting shape looks like the convex hull of the initial set of magenta points.\n2.  **Train_2 Example:**\n    *   The input grid contains a single, solid, connected green (3) diamond shape against a white (0) background.\n    *   The output grid shows only the outline or border pixels of the input diamond shape in green. The interior pixels of the diamond have been changed to white (0).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe task seems to involve two distinct transformations based on the properties of the non-white pixels in the input:\n\n*   **Case 1 (Scattered Points):** If the input contains multiple disconnected pixels of the same color, the transformation finds the smallest convex polygon enclosing all these points (the convex hull) and fills this polygon with the input color.\n*   **Case 2 (Solid Object):** If the input contains a single, connected, solid object of one color, the transformation extracts the boundary/outline of this object, keeping only the boundary pixels and changing the interior pixels to the background color (white).\n\nThe key distinguishing factor appears to be whether the non-white pixels form a single connected component or are scattered as multiple individual points/components.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
