Okay, let's break down the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Train_1 Example:**
    *   The input grid contains several scattered magenta (6) pixels against a white (0) background. These pixels are not connected to each other.
    *   The output grid retains the original magenta pixels and fills the area "between" them with more magenta pixels. The resulting shape looks like the convex hull of the initial set of magenta points.
2.  **Train_2 Example:**
    *   The input grid contains a single, solid, connected green (3) diamond shape against a white (0) background.
    *   The output grid shows only the outline or border pixels of the input diamond shape in green. The interior pixels of the diamond have been changed to white (0).

**Analysis:**

The task seems to involve two distinct transformations based on the properties of the non-white pixels in the input:

*   **Case 1 (Scattered Points):** If the input contains multiple disconnected pixels of the same color, the transformation finds the smallest convex polygon enclosing all these points (the convex hull) and fills this polygon with the input color.
*   **Case 2 (Solid Object):** If the input contains a single, connected, solid object of one color, the transformation extracts the boundary/outline of this object, keeping only the boundary pixels and changing the interior pixels to the background color (white).

The key distinguishing factor appears to be whether the non-white pixels form a single connected component or are scattered as multiple individual points/components.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply one of two transformations based on the connectivity of non-white pixels.

example_1:
  input_features:
    - objects: Multiple disconnected magenta (6) pixels.
    - arrangement: Scattered points.
    - background_color: white (0)
  output_features:
    - objects: A single solid magenta (6) object.
    - shape: Convex hull of the input points.
    - background_color: white (0)

    - type: Geometric construction
    - name: Convex Hull Filling
    - description: Find the convex hull of the input magenta pixels and fill the enclosed area with magenta.

example_2:
  input_features:
    - objects: A single connected green (3) object.
    - shape: Diamond (filled).
    - background_color: white (0)
  output_features:
    - objects: Multiple connected green (3) pixels forming an outline.
    - shape: Diamond (outline).
    - background_color: white (0)
  action:
    - type: Boundary extraction
    - name: Outline Finding
    - description: Identify the boundary pixels of the input green object and discard the interior pixels (set to white).

general_logic:
  condition: Check connectivity of non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency, including diagonals).
  if_single_connected_object: Apply Outline Finding.
  if_multiple_disconnected_pixels_or_objects: Apply Convex Hull Filling using the color of the input pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and determine their color (let's call it `C`). Record their coordinates.
2.  Analyze the connectivity of these non-white pixels (using 8-way adjacency, considering diagonal neighbors). Determine if they form a single connected component or multiple disconnected components/pixels.
3.  **If** the non-white pixels form a *single connected component*:
    a.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    b.  Iterate through each non-white pixel (`P`) of color `C` in the input grid.
    c.  Check if `P` has at least one neighbor (including diagonals) that is the background color (white, 0).
    d.  If `P` has a background-colored neighbor, mark the corresponding pixel in the new grid with color `C`.
    e.  The resulting new grid is the output.
4.  **Else (if** the non-white pixels are *not* a single connected component):
    a.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    b.  Find the set of all coordinates `(row, col)` corresponding to the non-white pixels.
    c.  Calculate the convex hull polygon enclosing this set of coordinates.
    d.  Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the new grid.
    e.  If the pixel `(r, c)` lies inside or on the boundary of the calculated convex hull polygon, set its color to `C`.
    f.  The resulting new grid is the output.
