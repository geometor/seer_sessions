"""
Transforms the input grid based on the connectivity of its non-background pixels (assuming white '0' is background).

1.  If the non-background pixels form a single connected component (using 8-way adjacency), 
    the output grid contains only the boundary pixels of that component. Boundary pixels are 
    those non-background pixels adjacent (including diagonally) to at least one background pixel 
    or the grid edge.

2.  If the non-background pixels form multiple disconnected components (or are isolated pixels),
    the output grid is the original grid with the area defined by the convex hull of all 
    non-background pixels filled with their color. If fewer than 3 non-background pixels exist,
    only those pixels are colored in the output.
