            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples contain two distinct, separated rectangular patterns composed of non-white pixels. These patterns are set against a white background. A single column of white pixels consistently separates the two main patterns.\n2.  **Pattern Types:** In each input grid, one pattern exhibits colors arranged in horizontal stripes (rows are predominantly one color or alternate colors row by row), while the other pattern shows colors arranged in vertical stripes (columns are predominantly one color or alternate colors column by column).\n    *   In `train_1`, the left pattern has vertical stripes (alternating red/green columns), and the right pattern has horizontal stripes (alternating red/green rows).\n    *   In `train_2`, the left pattern has horizontal stripes (alternating yellow/azure rows), and the right pattern has vertical stripes (alternating blue/magenta columns).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting one of the two patterns and discarding the other. The separating white column is also discarded (effectively becoming part of the white background).\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** The pattern that is *kept* in the output grid is always the one exhibiting horizontal stripes. The pattern with vertical stripes is removed.\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It contains only the selected horizontal stripe pattern, placed in its original position. All other pixels, including the area previously occupied by the vertical stripe pattern and the separating column, are white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
