task_description: Isolate the pattern with horizontal stripes from two separated patterns in the input grid.

examples:
  train_1:
    input:
      grid_dimensions: [11, 14]
      objects:
        - id: pattern_left
          pixels:
            - color: red (2)
            - color: green (3)
          structure: vertical_stripes
          location: columns 0-5
          bounding_box: [[0, 0], [10, 5]] # Approx
        - id: pattern_right
          pixels:
            - color: red (2)
            - color: green (3)
          structure: horizontal_stripes
          location: columns 7-12
          bounding_box: [[2, 7], [7, 12]] # Approx
      relationships:
        - type: separation
          object_ids: [pattern_left, pattern_right]
          details: Separated by a single vertical column of white (0) pixels at column index 6.
    output:
      grid_dimensions: [11, 14]
      objects:
        - id: pattern_right_preserved
          pixels:
            - color: red (2)
            - color: green (3)
          structure: horizontal_stripes
          location: columns 7-12 # Same as input
          bounding_box: [[2, 7], [7, 12]] # Same as input
      background: white (0)
      action_summary: pattern_left and the separator column were removed (replaced with white). pattern_right was kept.

  train_2:
    input:
      grid_dimensions: [12, 12]
      objects:
        - id: pattern_left
          pixels:
            - color: yellow (4)
            - color: azure (8)
          structure: horizontal_stripes
          location: columns 1-5
          bounding_box: [[1, 1], [9, 5]] # Approx
        - id: pattern_right
          pixels:
            - color: blue (1)
            - color: magenta (6)
          structure: vertical_stripes
          location: columns 7-11
          bounding_box: [[2, 7], [9, 11]] # Approx
      relationships:
        - type: separation
          object_ids: [pattern_left, pattern_right]
          details: Separated by a single vertical column of white (0) pixels at column index 6.
    output:
      grid_dimensions: [12, 12]
      objects:
        - id: pattern_left_preserved
          pixels:
            - color: yellow (4)
            - color: azure (8)
          structure: horizontal_stripes
          location: columns 1-5 # Same as input
          bounding_box: [[1, 1], [9, 5]] # Same as input
      background: white (0)
      action_summary: pattern_right and the separator column were removed (replaced with white). pattern_left was kept.

general_rule:
  input_contains: Two distinct non-white objects (patterns).
  object_properties:
    - One object has a horizontal stripe structure.
    - The other object has a vertical stripe structure.
  relationship: The objects are separated spatially, typically by white pixels.
  transformation: Identify the object with the horizontal stripe structure.
  output_generation: Create a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white). Copy the identified horizontal stripe object into the output grid at its original coordinates. Discard the vertical stripe object and any separator pixels.
