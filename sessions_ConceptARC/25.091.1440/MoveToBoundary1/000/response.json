The shape of the blue object remains the same.\n    *   The direction and distance of the blue object's movement seem to depend on the orientation of the red line and the relative position of the blue object to the red line.\n    *   When the red line is vertical, the blue object moves 1 step horizontally away from the line (to the right in the examples).\n    *   When the red line is horizontal, the blue object moves 2 steps vertically away from the line (downwards in the example).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
