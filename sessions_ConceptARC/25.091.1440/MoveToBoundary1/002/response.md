**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (blue object, red line, background) and the general action (moving the blue object relative to the red line). However, the specific rule for calculating the *distance* of the move was incorrect. The first code attempt assumed fixed distances (1 horizontally, 2 vertically) based on an incomplete perception, leading to failures in examples 1 and 4.

Example 1 failed because the expected horizontal shift was 2, but the code shifted by 1.
Example 4 failed because the expected vertical shift was 1, but the code shifted by 2, causing the blue object to move too far and overwrite parts of the red line in the erroneous output.

The new evidence suggests the shift distance is not fixed but depends on the size of the empty space (gap) between the blue object and the red line.

**Strategy:**

1.  Recalculate the required shift distance based on the gap between the blue object's bounding box and the red line.
2.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this gap-based calculation.
3.  Ensure the code correctly determines the bounding box, line orientation, relative position, gap width, and applies the corresponding shift away from the line.

The metrics calculation confirms that the "gap width" hypothesis correctly predicts the required shift distance and direction for all training examples. The calculated shifts match the expected shifts.

      - For each blue pixel at coordinate `(row, col)` in the input grid, calculate the new coordinate `(new_row, new_col) = (row + dy, col + dx)`. If `(new_row, new_col)` is within grid bounds, place a blue pixel there in the output grid.
      - Copy the red line from the input grid to the output grid at its original position (overwriting any blue pixels that might have landed there, although this shouldn't happen based on task logic).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the coordinates of the blue pixels (color 1) forming the blue object and the red pixels (color 2) forming the red line.
2.  Determine the bounding box of the blue object (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
3.  Determine the orientation (vertical or horizontal) and the fixed coordinate (column index or row index) of the red line.
4.  Calculate the gap width: the number of background (white, 0) cells strictly between the edge of the blue object's bounding box and the red line.
    *   If the line is vertical at `red_col`:
        *   If the line is to the right of the object (`red_col > max_col`), the gap is `red_col - max_col - 1`.
        *   If the line is to the left of the object (`red_col < min_col`), the gap is `min_col - red_col - 1`.
    *   If the line is horizontal at `red_row`:
        *   If the line is below the object (`red_row > max_row`), the gap is `red_row - max_row - 1`.
        *   If the line is above the object (`red_row < min_row`), the gap is `min_row - red_row - 1`.
5.  Determine the shift vector (`dx`, `dy`) based on the line orientation, gap width, and relative position:
    *   If the line is vertical: `dy = 0`.
        *   If the blue object is to the left of the line, `dx = gap_width` (move right).
        *   If the blue object is to the right of the line, `dx = -gap_width` (move left).
    *   If the line is horizontal: `dx = 0`.
        *   If the blue object is above the line, `dy = gap_width` (move down).
        *   If the blue object is below the line, `dy = -gap_width` (move up).
6.  Create the output grid, same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
7.  Translate each blue pixel from the input grid by the shift vector (`dx`, `dy`) and draw it onto the output grid, checking boundary conditions.
8.  Copy the red line pixels from their original positions in the input grid onto the output grid.
