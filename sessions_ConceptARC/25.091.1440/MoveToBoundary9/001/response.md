"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying the distinct non-white color groups. 
It determines the group positioned furthest to the left (based on its minimum column index) 
and the group positioned furthest to the right (based on its maximum column index). 
The leftmost group is shifted horizontally so its leftmost pixel aligns with the first column (index 0) of the grid. 
The rightmost group is shifted horizontally so its rightmost pixel aligns with the last column (index width-1) of the grid. 
The internal structure and vertical position of each group are preserved. The output grid is initialized as white, 
and the pixels of the moved groups are placed in their new locations.
