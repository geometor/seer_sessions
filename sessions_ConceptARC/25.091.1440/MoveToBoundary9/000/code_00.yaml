Task: Move colored groups to opposite horizontal edges.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background: Predominantly white (0).
  - Objects:
      - Defined by contiguous or non-contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
      - Examples show exactly two distinct color groups per input.
      - Groups are spatially separated horizontally.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Same colored groups as input, preserving internal structure and vertical position.
      - Repositioned horizontally.

Transformation_Properties:
  - Identification: Identify distinct non-white color groups.
  - Bounding_Box: Determine the minimum and maximum column index for each color group.
  - Role_Assignment:
      - Leftmost_Group: The group whose minimum column index is the smallest overall.
      - Rightmost_Group: The group whose maximum column index is the largest overall.
  - Action_Horizontal_Shift:
      - Leftmost_Group: Shift horizontally so its minimum column index becomes 0.
      - Rightmost_Group: Shift horizontally so its maximum column index becomes the last column index of the grid (width - 1).
  - Pixel_Mapping: Copy pixels of each identified group (leftmost and rightmost) from their original input positions to their new output positions based on the calculated shifts.
  - Grid_Initialization: Output grid starts as all white.

Assumptions_Based_On_Examples:
  - Exactly two primary, non-overlapping (in terms of columns occupied) color groups exist in the input that define the leftmost and rightmost extents.
  - All other areas are background (white).
