            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both examples show input and output grids of the same dimensions. The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Colored Objects/Groups:** The inputs contain distinct groups of non-white pixels. In Example 1, these are solid 3x3 squares (red and blue). In Example 2, these are more sparse patterns (green and yellow). Crucially, each distinct color forms a separate group.\n3.  **Spatial Separation:** In both inputs, the colored groups are horizontally separated by white space.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving these colored groups horizontally.\n5.  **Movement Pattern:** The group positioned further to the left in the input grid moves to align its leftmost edge with the grid's left boundary (column 0). The group positioned further to the right moves to align its rightmost edge with the grid's right boundary (last column).\n6.  **Integrity Preservation:** The internal structure, shape, and vertical position of each colored group are preserved during the horizontal movement. Pixels within a group maintain their relative positions to each other.\n7.  **Background Update:** The original positions occupied by the moved groups become white, unless overwritten by the final position of a group. The space between the final positions of the groups is also white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.\n3.  For each unique non-white color, find all pixel coordinates `(row, column)` containing that color. Group these coordinates by color.\n4.  For each color group:\n    a.  Determine its horizontal extent: find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) occupied by pixels of this color.\n5.  Identify the \"leftmost\" color group: the group with the overall smallest `min_col`. Record its color (`left_color`) and its `min_col` (`left_min_col`).\n6.  Identify the \"rightmost\" color group: the group with the overall largest `max_col`. Record its color (`right_color`) and its `max_col` (`right_max_col`).\n7.  Calculate the horizontal shift required for the leftmost group: `shift_left = 0 - left_min_col`.\n8.  Calculate the horizontal shift required for the rightmost group: `shift_right = (grid_width - 1) - right_max_col`, where `grid_width` is the number of columns in the grid.\n9.  Iterate through all the original pixel coordinates `(row, col)` identified for the `left_color`:\n    a.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + shift_left`.\n    b.  Set the pixel at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid to `left_color`.\n10. Iterate through all the original pixel coordinates `(row, col)` identified for the `right_color`:\n    a.  Calculate the new column: `new_col = col + shift_right`.\n    b.  Set the pixel at `(row, new_col)` in the output grid to `right_color`.\n11. The resulting output grid is the final answer."
