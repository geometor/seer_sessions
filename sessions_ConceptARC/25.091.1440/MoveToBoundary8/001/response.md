"""
Identifies a static line object (horizontal or vertical) and multiple point objects of a single color.
Moves the point objects relative to the static line.
If the line is horizontal (at row line_r, spanning columns min_c to max_c):
  - Each point (r, c) moves 5 steps up (new_r = r - 5).
  - If the point's original column 'c' is strictly between min_c and max_c, it moves 3 steps right (new_c = c + 3).
  - Otherwise (if c <= min_c or c >= max_c), it moves 5 steps right (new_c = c + 5).
If the line is vertical (at column line_c):
  - Each point (r, c) moves 4 steps right (new_c = c + 4).
  - The vertical position remains unchanged (new_r = r).
The output grid contains the static line in its original position and the points in their new calculated positions, against a background of color 0.
