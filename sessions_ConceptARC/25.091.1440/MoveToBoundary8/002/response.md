**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully solved the first training example (vertical line) but failed on the second (horizontal line). The discrepancy arose from an incorrect assumption about how horizontal movement was calculated for points relative to a horizontal line. The initial hypothesis differentiated movement based on whether the point's column was strictly within the line's column span. However, comparing the failed example's input, expected output, and the code's output reveals that *all* points associated with the horizontal line should move 5 steps right, regardless of their horizontal position relative to the line's span. The vertical movement (5 steps up) was correctly identified. The logic for the vertical line case appears correct.

The strategy is to update the transformation rule for the horizontal line case to apply a constant horizontal shift (5 steps right) to all points, matching the constant vertical shift (5 steps up). The vertical line rule remains unchanged (4 steps right, 0 steps vertical).

**Metrics**

*   **Example 1 (train_1):**
    *   Status: Success
    *   Input Grid Size: 10x12
    *   Output Grid Size: 10x12
    *   Objects: Vertical Green Line (color 3), 3 Yellow Points (color 4)
    *   Line Properties: Vertical, Col=10, Rows=[1, 8]
    *   Point Coordinates (Input): [(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)]
    *   Point Coordinates (Output): [(4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)]
    *   Transformation (Observed): `dr=0`, `dc=+4` for all points.

*   **Example 2 (train_2):**
    *   Status: Failure (Code Output Mismatch)
    *   Input Grid Size: 15x18
    *   Output Grid Size: 15x18
    *   Objects: Horizontal Red Line (color 2), 3 Azure Points (color 8)
    *   Line Properties: Horizontal, Row=2, Cols=[2, 13]
    *   Point Coordinates (Input): [(8, 4), (10, 2), (12, 0)]
    *   Point Coordinates (Expected Output): [(3, 9), (5, 7), (7, 5)]
    *   Point Coordinates (Code Output): [(3, 7), (5, 7), (7, 5)]
    *   Transformation (Required): `dr=-5`, `dc=+5` for all points.
    *   Error Analysis: The code incorrectly applied `dc=+3` instead of `dc=+5` for the point originally at (8, 4) because its column (4) was strictly within the line's span [2, 13].

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Move point objects by a fixed vector, determined by the orientation of a static line object.

elements:
  - type: static_line
    description: A single continuous straight line of a non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, e.g., green, red)
      - orientation: (horizontal or vertical)
      - position: (row index for horizontal, column index for vertical)
      - coordinates: (list of (row, col) tuples)
  - type: moving_points
    description: Multiple single pixels of the same non-background color, distinct from the static line color.
    properties:
      - color: (variable, e.g., yellow, azure)
      - count: (multiple)
      - initial_positions: (list of (row, col) tuples)

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    source: input_grid
    target: static_line, moving_points
    steps:
      - Find all connected components of non-background colors.
      - Identify the component that forms a continuous straight horizontal or vertical line as 'static_line'.
      - Identify all single-pixel components of the *other* non-background color as 'moving_points'.
  - action: determine_line_orientation
    source: static_line
    target: orientation
  - action: calculate_movement_vector
    source: orientation
    target: delta_row, delta_col
    rules:
      - if: orientation == horizontal
        delta_row: -5  # Move 5 steps up
        delta_col: +5  # Move 5 steps right
      - if: orientation == vertical
        delta_row: 0   # No vertical movement
        delta_col: +4  # Move 4 steps right
  - action: calculate_new_positions
    inputs: moving_points.initial_positions, delta_row, delta_col
    for_each: point (r_orig, c_orig) in initial_positions
    output: (r_orig + delta_row, c_orig + delta_col)
    target: new_positions
  - action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions, static_line.color, static_line.coordinates, moving_points.color, new_positions
    steps:
      - Create an empty grid (all background color 0) of the same dimensions as the input.
      - Draw the static_line onto the grid using its color and coordinates.
      - For each calculated new_position (new_r, new_c):
        - If (new_r, new_c) is within the grid boundaries:
          - Draw the moving_points.color at (new_r, new_c).

assumptions:
  - Exactly one static line object (horizontal or vertical) exists.
  - All other non-background pixels belong to a single color and represent the moving points (always single pixels).
  - The movement vector is constant for all points within a single example and depends only on the line's orientation.
  - Points always start on one side of the line (below horizontal lines, left of vertical lines in the examples). The movement is always towards/across the line and parallel to it (up/right for horizontal, right/none for vertical).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single, continuous static line object (horizontal or vertical) and record its color and coordinates.
2.  Identify all pixels belonging to the *other* non-background color; these are the moving points. Record their color and initial coordinates.
3.  Determine the orientation of the static line.
4.  Based on the orientation, determine the movement vector (change in row `dr`, change in column `dc`):
    *   If the line is **horizontal**, the vector is (`dr`=-5, `dc`=+5).
    *   If the line is **vertical**, the vector is (`dr`=0, `dc`=+4).
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
6.  Draw the static line onto the output grid using its original color and coordinates.
7.  For each moving point with initial coordinates (`r_orig`, `c_orig`):
    a.  Calculate its new coordinates: `new_r = r_orig + dr`, `new_c = c_orig + dc`.
    b.  If the `new_r` and `new_c` are within the grid boundaries, place the moving point's color at (`new_r`, `new_c`) in the output grid.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
