task_description: Move point objects relative to a static line object based on orientation and position.

elements:
  - type: static_line
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., green, red)
      - orientation: (horizontal or vertical)
      - position: (row index for horizontal, column index for vertical)
      - span: (min/max column for horizontal, min/max row for vertical)
  - type: moving_points
    properties:
      - color: (varies, e.g., yellow, azure)
      - count: (multiple)
      - initial_positions: (list of (row, col) tuples)

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    source: input_grid
    target: static_line, moving_points
  - action: determine_line_properties
    source: static_line
    target: orientation, position, span
  - action: determine_point_properties
    source: moving_points
    target: color, initial_positions
  - action: calculate_new_positions
    inputs: initial_positions, line_orientation, line_position, line_span
    rules:
      - condition: line_orientation == horizontal
        line_position: line_r
        line_span: [min_c, max_c]
        for_each: point (r, c) in initial_positions
        # Assuming points are below line (r > line_r). Adapt if points can be above.
        new_r: r - 5
        if: (c <= min_c) or (c >= max_c) # Outside or at ends of span
          new_c: c + 5
        else: # Strictly within span (min_c < c < max_c)
          new_c: c + 3
        output: (new_r, new_c)

      - condition: line_orientation == vertical
        line_position: line_c
        line_span: [min_r, max_r]
        for_each: point (r, c) in initial_positions
        # Assuming points are left of line (c < line_c). Adapt if points can be right.
        new_c: c + 4
        # No vertical movement observed in example
        new_r: r
        output: (new_r, new_c)
  - action: construct_output_grid
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions, static_line, moving_points_color, new_positions
    steps:
      - Create empty grid with background color (white).
      - Draw the static_line onto the grid.
      - Draw the moving_points_color at each calculated new_position.

assumptions:
  - Exactly one static line object exists.
  - Exactly one color identifies the moving points.
  - All moving points start on the same side relative to the line (e.g., all below, all left).
  - The movement magnitudes (e.g., 5 up, 3/5 right; 4 right, 0 up) are constant for this task.
  - The direction of movement components is consistent (e.g., always towards the line, secondary movement always right or always stationary vertically).
