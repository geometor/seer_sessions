            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n*   **Example 1 (train_1):**\n    *   Input has a vertical green line segment and three yellow pixels horizontally aligned to the left of the line.\n    *   Output shows the same green line, but the yellow pixels have shifted horizontally to the right. Each yellow pixel moved 4 steps to the right, maintaining its row.\n*   **Example 2 (train_2):**\n    *   Input has a horizontal red line segment and three azure pixels scattered below the line.\n    *   Output shows the same red line, but the azure pixels have moved. Each azure pixel moved 5 steps up. Additionally, their horizontal position changed: pixels whose original column was outside or at the ends of the red line's column span moved 5 steps right; the pixel whose original column was strictly within the red line's span moved 3 steps right.\n\n**Commonalities and Transformation Logic:**\n1.  There is always a single static line object (vertical green or horizontal red).\n2.  There are multiple point objects of a single color (yellow or azure) distinct from the line color.\n3.  The point objects move relative to the static line.\n4.  The primary direction of movement seems to be *towards* the line (rightwards towards the vertical line in train\\_1, upwards towards the horizontal line in train\\_2).\n5.  There's a secondary movement component parallel to the line, which may depend on the point's position relative to the line's *span* (ends vs. interior).\n    *   For the vertical line (train\\_1), the secondary movement (vertical) was zero. All points moved right by 4.\n    *   For the horizontal line (train\\_2), the primary movement (vertical) was 5 steps up. The secondary movement (horizontal) was 5 steps right for points outside/at the ends of the line's span, and 3 steps right for points strictly within the span.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Calculate the new row by moving the point 5 steps vertically towards the line (new\\_row = original\\_row - 5, assuming points start below).\n        ii. Calculate the new column based on the point's original column (`c`): If `c` is strictly between `min_c` and `max_c`, the new column is `c + 3`. Otherwise (if `c <= min_c` or `c >= max_c`), the new column is `c + 5`.\n    b.  If the static line is **vertical** (at column `line_c`, spanning rows `min_r` to `max_r`):\n        i.
