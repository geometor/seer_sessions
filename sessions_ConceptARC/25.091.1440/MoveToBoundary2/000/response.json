            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are grids of pixels, primarily white (0) with scattered orange (7) pixels.\n2.  **Content:** The orange pixels form distinct shapes or objects (connected components). These objects can be single pixels, lines (vertical or horizontal), or more complex shapes.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the orange pixels either downwards or rightwards. The direction of the shift seems to depend on the overall characteristics of the orange shapes present in the input grid.\n4.  **Shift Mechanism (Vertical):** When shifting downwards (as seen in examples 1 and 3), it appears to operate column by column. All orange pixels within a specific column are shifted down by the same amount. This amount is determined by the lowest orange pixel in that column; it's shifted so that it ends up on the bottom-most row of the grid. Columns without any orange pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Shift Mechanism (Horizontal):** When shifting rightwards (as seen in example 2), it appears to operate row by row. All orange pixels within a specific row are shifted right by the same amount. This amount is determined by the rightmost orange pixel in that row; it's shifted so that it ends up in the rightmost column of the grid. Rows without any orange pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Condition for Shift Direction:** The choice between vertical and horizontal shift seems related to the dominant orientation of the orange objects. By calculating the total height and total width of all distinct orange objects, we can determine the mode:\n    *   If the sum of object heights is greater than or equal to the sum of object widths, vertical gravity is applied.\n    *   If the sum of object heights is less than the sum of object widths, horizontal gravity is applied.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
