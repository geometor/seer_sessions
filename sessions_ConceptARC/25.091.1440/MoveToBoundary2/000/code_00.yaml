Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Colors:
    - White (0): Background
    - Orange (7): Foreground Objects
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous block of orange pixels (using 4-connectivity, not diagonal).
  Properties:
    - Position: (row, column) coordinates of constituent pixels.
    - Shape: Variable (pixels, lines, L-shapes, bars, etc.).
    - BoundingBox: Defined by min/max row and column indices.
    - Height: Max row - min row + 1
    - Width: Max col - min col + 1
Transformation:
  Type: Conditional Shift (Gravity)
  Condition:
    - Calculate TotalHeight = Sum of heights of all distinct orange objects.
    - Calculate TotalWidth = Sum of widths of all distinct orange objects.
    - If TotalHeight >= TotalWidth: Apply Vertical Gravity
    - If TotalHeight < TotalWidth: Apply Horizontal Gravity
  Actions:
    - Vertical Gravity:
        Scope: Per Column
        Rule: Shift all orange pixels in a column downwards.
        Shift Amount (for column c): `grid_height - 1 - max_row_index_of_orange_in_column_c`
        Result: Lowest orange pixel in each column moves to the bottom row.
    - Horizontal Gravity:
        Scope: Per Row
        Rule: Shift all orange pixels in a row rightwards.
        Shift Amount (for row r): `grid_width - 1 - max_col_index_of_orange_in_row_r`
        Result: Rightmost orange pixel in each row moves to the rightmost column.
  Output Grid:
    - Start with an all-white grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    - Place the shifted orange pixels onto this grid.
