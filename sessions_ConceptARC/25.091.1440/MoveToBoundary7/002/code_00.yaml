Context:
  - Task involves grids with a white background (0) and typically two distinct colored objects.
  - The core transformation is the movement of one object towards the other along a single axis (horizontal or vertical) until they become edge-adjacent.

Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input:
      Grid_Size: [10, 19]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_A # Green 'C'
          Color: 3
          BoundingBox: [2, 2, 5, 5] # (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)
          Centroid: [3.5, 3.5]
        - ID: Obj_B # Red 'L'
          Color: 2
          BoundingBox: [1, 12, 8, 18]
          Centroid: [4.5, 15.0]
      Separation_Axis: Horizontal (Centroid cols: 3.5 vs 15.0)
      Initial_Gap: 6 (Obj_B.min_c - Obj_A.max_c - 1 = 12 - 5 - 1)
    Output:
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_A # Green 'C' (moved)
          BoundingBox: [2, 8, 5, 11]
          Centroid: [3.5, 9.5]
          Shift: [0, +6]
        - ID: Obj_B # Red 'L' (static)
          BoundingBox: [1, 12, 8, 18]
          Centroid: [4.5, 15.0]
          Shift: [0, 0]
      Final_Gap: 0 (Obj_B.min_c - Obj_A.max_c - 1 = 12 - 11 - 1)
    Transformation_Summary: Obj_A (Green C) moved 6 units right until it touched Obj_B (Red L).

  - ID: train_2
    Input:
      Grid_Size: [14, 12]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_C # Yellow Rectangle
          Color: 4
          BoundingBox: [1, 4, 2, 5]
          Centroid: [1.5, 4.5] # Corrected centroid based on BB
        - ID: Obj_D # Yellow 'U'
          Color: 4
          BoundingBox: [5, 1, 12, 11]
          Centroid: [8.5, 6.0] # Corrected centroid based on BB
      Separation_Axis: Vertical (Centroid rows: 1.5 vs 8.5)
      Initial_Gap: 2 (Obj_D.min_r - Obj_C.max_r - 1 = 5 - 2 - 1)
    Output:
      Objects: # Note: In the output, these merge into one object
        - ID: Obj_C # Yellow Rectangle (moved)
          Final_BoundingBox_Portion: [3, 4, 4, 5] # Position just before merging
          Shift: [+2, 0] # Moved 2 units down
        - ID: Obj_D # Yellow 'U' (static)
          BoundingBox: [5, 1, 12, 11]
          Shift: [0, 0]
      Final_Gap: 0 (Obj_D.min_r - Obj_C.max_r - 1 = 5 - 4 - 1)
    Transformation_Summary: Obj_C (Yellow Rect) moved 2 units down until it touched Obj_D (Yellow U). They merge in the final output grid if they have the same color.

General_Observations:
  - Always two distinct objects in the input grid.
  - Objects retain their shape and color.
  - One object ("moving") translates towards the other ("static") object.
  - Movement occurs purely horizontally or vertically, along the axis of greatest initial separation between the objects' centroids (or bounding boxes).
  - The moving object is the one that is initially further away from the static object along the axis of movement (e.g., if separated horizontally, the leftmost moves right towards the rightmost, or the rightmost moves left towards the leftmost).
  - Movement stops precisely when the moving object becomes edge-adjacent to the static object along the direction of movement. The gap becomes 0.
  - If the objects have the same color, touching results in them appearing as a single larger object in the output.
