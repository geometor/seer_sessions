"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
1. Identifies exactly two distinct non-background objects. If not two, returns the input unchanged.
2. Determines the primary axis of separation (horizontal or vertical) between the objects based on the largest gap between their bounding boxes.
3. Designates one object as "moving" and the other as "static". The object that is further out along the axis of separation moves towards the other object (e.g., the left object moves right, the top object moves down).
4. Simulates the moving object translating one pixel at a time towards the static object along the determined axis.
5. The movement stops when the moving object becomes edge-adjacent (shares a side) to the static object. The step that causes adjacency is the final step. Movement also stops if the next step would cause a direct collision (overlap) with the static object or move the object out of the grid boundaries.
6. Returns the final grid state with the moving object in its final position and the static object unchanged.
