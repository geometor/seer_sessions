**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code successfully solved `train_2` but failed on `train_1`. The output for `train_1` indicates two primary issues:
1.  **Incorrect Final Position:** The moving object (green 'C') stopped several steps short of the expected final position adjacent to the static object (red 'L').
2.  **Static Object Alteration:** The static object (red 'L') appears to have been incorrectly moved or overwritten in the final output grid, whereas it should remain completely stationary.

The likely cause of the incorrect final position is the logic within the movement simulation loop. The previous code checked for adjacency *after* making a move and then stopped. This means it stopped one step too late (i.e., in the position where adjacency occurred), not one step *before* adjacency. The loop needs to check if the *next* potential move would result in adjacency or collision, and if so, stop *before* making that move.

The cause of the static object alteration is less clear from the code structure, as the erase/draw steps explicitly target the `moving_obj.color` and coordinates. However, the erroneous movement logic might have led to an unexpected state or overwrite. Fixing the movement loop's stopping condition is the priority.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the movement simulation logic to check for adjacency/collision/bounds *before* executing a move.
2.  Ensure the logic correctly identifies the moving vs. static object (the object further out along the axis of maximum separation moves towards the other).
3.  Re-verify that the erase/draw operations strictly preserve the static object.
4.  Update the natural language program and facts based on this refined understanding.
