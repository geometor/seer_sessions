Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input:
      Grid_Size: [10, 19]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_A
          Color: green (3)
          Shape: 'C'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(2, 6), cols=(2, 5)) # Approx location
        - ID: Obj_B
          Color: red (2)
          Shape: 'L'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(1, 9), cols=(12, 18)) # Approx location
    Output:
      Grid_Size: [10, 19]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_A
          Color: green (3)
          Shape: 'C'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(2, 6), cols=(8, 11)) # Approx location
        - ID: Obj_B
          Color: red (2)
          Shape: 'L'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(1, 9), cols=(12, 18)) # Approx location
    Transformation:
      Action: Move Object_A rightwards.
      Static_Object: Object_B
      Stop_Condition: Object_A becomes horizontally adjacent to Object_B.

  - ID: train_2
    Input:
      Grid_Size: [14, 12]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_C
          Color: yellow (4)
          Shape: Rectangle (2x2)
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(1, 3), cols=(4, 6)) # Approx location
        - ID: Obj_D
          Color: yellow (4)
          Shape: 'U'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(5, 13), cols=(1, 11)) # Approx location
    Output:
      Grid_Size: [14, 12]
      Objects:
        - ID: Obj_C
          Color: yellow (4)
          Shape: Rectangle (2x2)
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(3, 5), cols=(4, 6)) # Approx location
        - ID: Obj_D
          Color: yellow (4)
          Shape: 'U'
          Location: BoundingBox(rows=(5, 13), cols=(1, 11)) # Approx location
    Transformation:
      Action: Move Object_C downwards.
      Static_Object: Object_D
      Stop_Condition: Object_C becomes vertically adjacent to Object_D.

General_Observations:
  - Background_Color: white (0) is consistent.
  - Object_Integrity: Shapes and colors of objects are preserved during movement.
  - Movement_Mechanism: One object moves towards another static object.
  - Movement_Axis: Movement occurs along a single axis (horizontal or vertical).
  - Adjacency_Rule: Movement stops when the moving object's boundary touches the static object's boundary along the axis of movement.
