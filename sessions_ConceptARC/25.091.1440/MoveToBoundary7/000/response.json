            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each grid contains distinct geometric shapes (objects) formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.\n    *   Example 1: Input has a green (3) 'C' shape and a red (2) 'L' shape. Output has the same shapes.\n    *   Example 2: Input has a small yellow (4) rectangle and a large yellow (4) 'U' shape. Output has the same shapes.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving one object until it becomes adjacent to another object.\n    *   In Example 1, the green 'C' moves horizontally to the right until it touches the side of the red 'L'. The red 'L' does not move.\n    *   In Example 2, the small yellow rectangle moves vertically downwards until it touches the top edge of the large yellow 'U'. The yellow 'U' does not move.\n4.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Moving Object:** An object that changes its position.\n    *   **Static Object (Obstacle):** An object that remains in its original position and acts as a barrier to the moving object.\n    *   **Direction of Movement:** The moving object travels in a straight line (horizontally or vertically) towards the static object.\n    *   **Stopping Condition:** The movement ceases when the moving object is directly adjacent (sharing an edge) to the static object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine which object moves and which object remains static by comparing the input and output grids (or by identifying a smaller object likely intended to move towards a larger one, though relying solely on input requires more inference). Assume there is one moving object and one primary static object (obstacle).\n3.  Determine the primary direction of movement (up, down, left, or right) by observing the relative positions of the moving object and the static object. The moving object moves towards the static object.\n4.  Simulate shifting the *entire* moving object one pixel at a time in the determined direction.\n5.  After each shift, check if any pixel of the moving object is now adjacent (shares an edge, not just a corner) to any pixel of the static object along the axis of movement.\n6.  If adjacency is detected, stop the movement. The current position of the moving object is its final position.\n7.  Construct the output grid by placing the moving object in its final position and keeping the static object and background unchanged from the input grid."
