task_description: Move groups of pixels of the same color horizontally to the nearest edge of the grid.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions_preserved: true
objects:
  - type: color_group
    description: All pixels of a single non-background color are treated as a group.
    properties:
      - color: the specific non-background color (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow)
      - pixels: list of (row, col) coordinates for all pixels of that color
      - horizontal_bounding_box: defined by the minimum and maximum column indices (min_col, max_col) occupied by the group's pixels
      - horizontal_center: calculated as (min_col + max_col) / 2
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The position of a color group relative to the grid's horizontal center determines its movement direction.
    grid_horizontal_center: calculated as (grid_width - 1) / 2
actions:
  - name: identify_color_groups
    input: input_grid
    output: list of color groups (color, pixels, bounding_box)
  - name: determine_movement
    input: color_group, grid_width
    output: horizontal_shift_amount
    logic:
      - if group_center < grid_center: shift = 0 - min_col
      - if group_center >= grid_center: shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col
  - name: apply_shift
    input: color_group_pixels, horizontal_shift_amount
    output: shifted_pixel_coordinates
    logic: For each (row, col) in pixels, new coordinate is (row, col + shift)
  - name: reconstruct_output
    input: grid_dimensions, background_color, all_shifted_pixels_by_color
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create an empty grid and place the shifted pixels onto it.
