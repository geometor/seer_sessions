            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n*   **Input/Output Grids:** Both examples involve grids containing a white background (0) and distinct colored objects or groups of pixels. The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids.\n*   **Objects/Colors:**\n    *   Example 1: Contains a solid 3x3 red (2) object and a solid 3x3 blue (1) object.\n    *   Example 2: Contains multiple green (3) pixels and multiple yellow (4) pixels, arranged in patterns but not necessarily forming single contiguous blocks for each color overall.\n*   **Transformation:** In both examples, the colored elements undergo a horizontal shift. Elements initially positioned on the left side of the grid's horizontal center move towards the left edge. Elements initially positioned on the right side move towards the right edge.\n*   **Movement Details:**\n    *   The vertical positions of all colored pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   The relative horizontal positions *within* a group of the same color seem to be preserved. The entire group of pixels of a specific color moves as a single unit.\n    *   The extent of the movement is such that the outermost pixel(s) of the color group align with the corresponding grid edge (leftmost pixel to column 0 for left-moving groups, rightmost pixel to the last column for right-moving groups).\n*   **Key Factor:** The decision to move left or right appears to depend on the overall horizontal position of all pixels of a given color relative to the grid's horizontal center.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
