*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing a single, contiguous, non-white object on a white background into an output grid. The transformation consists of moving the object horizontally to the right. The amount of the shift is determined by the object's initial position relative to the right edge of the grid. The object itself (its shape and color) remains unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: Fixed 10x10 in examples, but likely variable.
      background_color: white (0)
      num_objects: 1 per grid.
    object:
      description: A single contiguous block of non-white pixels.
      color: Varies (red (2) in examples, but could be any non-white).
      shape: Varies (L-shape, more complex shape in examples).
    action:
      type: Translation
      direction: Horizontal (right)
      magnitude_determination:
        input_property: Object's rightmost column index (`max_col_obj`).
        grid_property: Grid width (`grid_width`).
        rule: Shift distance = (`grid_width` - 1) - `max_col_obj`.
      result: The object's rightmost edge aligns with the grid's rightmost column index (`grid_width` - 1).
    relationships:
      - The object is moved relative to the grid boundaries.
      - The shape and color of the object are preserved during the move.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. These pixels constitute the object to be moved. Note the color of the object.
    2.  Determine the rightmost column index occupied by any pixel of the object (`max_col_obj`).
    3.  Determine the width of the input grid (`grid_width`).
    4.  Calculate the horizontal shift distance required: `shift = (grid_width - 1) - max_col_obj`.
    5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white background color (0).
    6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel at `(row, col)` belongs to the object (i.e., it is non-white):
        a.  Calculate the new column position: `new_col = col + shift`.
        b.  Place a pixel of the same object color at the position `(row, new_col)` in the output grid.
    7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
