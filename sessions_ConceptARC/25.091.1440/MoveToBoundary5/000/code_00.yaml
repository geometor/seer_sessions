General_Rule:
  - Find the single contiguous non-background object in the input grid.
  - Determine the dimensions (height and width) of its bounding box.
  - Compare the height and width.
  - If height is greater than width, calculate the translation vector as [3, 0] (down by 3).
  - If height is less than or equal to width, calculate the translation vector as [0, 3] (right by 3).
  - Create the output grid by applying this translation vector to every pixel of the input object. The background remains unchanged.
