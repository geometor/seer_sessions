            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous object composed of a non-white color (gray/5 in example 1, orange/7 in example 2). The background (white/0) surrounds this object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement (translation) of the single non-white object within the grid. The object's shape, color, and orientation remain identical between the input and output. The background remains white.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:**\n    *   In example 1, the gray 'L' shape moves 3 cells to the right.\n    *   In example 2, the orange inverted 'L' shape moves 3 cells down.\n5.  **Determining Movement Direction:** The direction of movement appears linked to the shape's dimensions.\n    *   Example 1's object has a bounding box of 5x5 (Height=5, Width=5). Aspect Ratio (H/W) = 1. It moves horizontally.\n    *   Example 2's object has a bounding box of 6x5 (Height=6, Width=5). Aspect Ratio (H/W) = 1.2. It moves vertically.\n    *   It seems if the object's bounding box height is greater than its width, the movement is vertical (down by 3). Otherwise (if height is less than or equal to width), the movement is horizontal (right by 3).\n6.  **Movement Magnitude:** The distance moved is consistently 3 cells in both examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
