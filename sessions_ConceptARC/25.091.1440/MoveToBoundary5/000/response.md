Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 10x10. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single contiguous object composed of a non-white color (gray/5 in example 1, orange/7 in example 2). The background (white/0) surrounds this object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement (translation) of the single non-white object within the grid. The object's shape, color, and orientation remain identical between the input and output. The background remains white.
4.  **Movement Pattern:**
    *   In example 1, the gray 'L' shape moves 3 cells to the right.
    *   In example 2, the orange inverted 'L' shape moves 3 cells down.
5.  **Determining Movement Direction:** The direction of movement appears linked to the shape's dimensions.
    *   Example 1's object has a bounding box of 5x5 (Height=5, Width=5). Aspect Ratio (H/W) = 1. It moves horizontally.
    *   Example 2's object has a bounding box of 6x5 (Height=6, Width=5). Aspect Ratio (H/W) = 1.2. It moves vertically.
    *   It seems if the object's bounding box height is greater than its width, the movement is vertical (down by 3). Otherwise (if height is less than or equal to width), the movement is horizontal (right by 3).
6.  **Movement Magnitude:** The distance moved is consistently 3 cells in both examples.

General_Rule:
  - Find the single contiguous non-background object in the input grid.
  - Determine the dimensions (height and width) of its bounding box.
  - Compare the height and width.
  - If height is greater than width, calculate the translation vector as [3, 0] (down by 3).
  - If height is less than or equal to width, calculate the translation vector as [0, 3] (right by 3).
  - Create the output grid by applying this translation vector to every pixel of the input object. The background remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single contiguous object in the input grid that is not the background color (white/0).
2.  Calculate the minimum bounding box containing this object. Determine its height and width.
3.  Compare the height and width of the bounding box.
4.  If the height is strictly greater than the width, determine the translation vector as moving 3 cells down (change in row = +3, change in column = 0).
5.  Otherwise (if the height is less than or equal to the width), determine the translation vector as moving 3 cells right (change in row = 0, change in column = +3).
6.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white/0).
7.  For each pixel belonging to the identified object in the input grid, calculate its new position by adding the determined translation vector to its original coordinates.
8.  Place the object's color at the calculated new position in the output grid.
