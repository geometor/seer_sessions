"""
Relocate a single blue pixel based on the position and orientation of a yellow line marker, removing the marker in the output.

1. Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with white pixels (0).
2. Find the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid.
3. Check if there is a yellow line (4) along the left edge (column 0) of the input grid.
4. If a yellow line exists along the left edge, place the blue pixel (1) at coordinates (`0`, `c`) in the output grid.
5. If no yellow line exists along the left edge, check if there is a yellow line along the top edge (row 0) of the input grid. (Assuming one of these conditions is always met).
6. If a yellow line exists along the top edge, determine the width (`w`) of the grid. Place the blue pixel (1) at coordinates (`r`, `w-1`) in the output grid.
7. Return the completed output grid.
