"""
Relocate a single blue pixel based on the location of a full yellow line marker (either top edge or left edge), removing the marker in the output.

1. Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with white pixels (0).
2. Find the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the single blue pixel (1) in the input grid.
3. Check if all pixels in the first column (column 0) of the input grid are yellow (4).
4. If all pixels in the first column are yellow, place the blue pixel (1) at coordinates (`0`, `c`) in the output grid.
5. Else (meaning not all pixels in the first column are yellow), assume that all pixels in the first row (row 0) are yellow (4). Determine the width (`w`) of the grid. Place the blue pixel (1) at coordinates (`r`, `w-1`) in the output grid.
6. Return the completed output grid.
