This line is always located along either the top edge (horizontal) or the left edge (vertical) of the grid.\n    *   A single blue pixel (1) located somewhere within the grid.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid consists of:\n    *   A background of white pixels (0).\n    *   The single blue pixel (1) from the input, moved to a new location.\n    *   The yellow line from the input is absent in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating the blue pixel based on the position and orientation of the yellow line. The yellow line itself is removed.\n4.  **Relocation Rule:**\n    *   When the yellow line is **vertical** along the **left edge** (column 0), the blue pixel moves to **row 0**, keeping its original column index.\n    *   When the yellow line is **horizontal** along the **top edge** (row 0), the blue pixel moves to the **last column** (index `width - 1`), keeping its original row index.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
