task_description: Relocate a single blue pixel based on the position and orientation of a yellow line marker, removing the marker in the output.

elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fills the grid initially and in the output where other objects are not present.
  - object: marker
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: line (either horizontal or vertical)
    location: always positioned along the top edge (row 0) or the left edge (column 0).
    role: dictates the transformation rule for the target pixel. It is removed in the output.
  - object: target
    color: blue (1)
    shape: single pixel
    location: variable within the input grid.
    role: the object to be moved according to the rule defined by the marker. It is preserved in the output but at a new location.

transformation:
  - action: identify_target
    input: input_grid
    target_color: blue (1)
    output: coordinates (row, col) of the blue pixel.
  - action: identify_marker
    input: input_grid
    marker_color: yellow (4)
    output: location (top_edge or left_edge) and orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the yellow line.
  - action: calculate_new_coordinates
    input: target_coordinates (row, col), marker_location, grid_dimensions (height, width)
    condition: marker at left_edge (vertical)
      new_row: 0
      new_col: col
    condition: marker at top_edge (horizontal)
      new_row: row
      new_col: width - 1
    output: new_coordinates (new_row, new_col)
  - action: generate_output_grid
    input: grid_dimensions, new_coordinates, target_color (blue, 1), background_color (white, 0)
    process: create a grid of the same dimensions as input, fill with background_color, place the target_color pixel at new_coordinates.
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - The location and orientation of the yellow marker deterministically define the final coordinates of the blue target pixel.
  - The marker object is consumed/removed during the transformation.
  - The target object persists but changes location.
  - The background is preserved.
