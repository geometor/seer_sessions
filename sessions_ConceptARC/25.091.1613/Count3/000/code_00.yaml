task: Determine the number of distinct objects in the input grid and represent this count as the length of a green output row.
objects:
  input:
    type: 2D grid
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: figure
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color. These are the objects to be counted.
        colors_observed: [blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8)]
        shapes_observed: lines (horizontal/vertical), rectangles
  output:
    type: 1D grid (single row)
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color: green (3)
relationship:
  quantification: The number of pixels (length) in the output row is equal to the total count of distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  color_mapping: All objects in the input, regardless of their original color, contribute to the count, and the output is always composed of green (3) pixels.
