            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 2D grids of various sizes containing multiple distinct \"objects\". An object appears to be a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. The background is consistently white (0). The objects in the examples are simple shapes, mostly lines (horizontal or vertical) or rectangles.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are always 1D grids (single rows) composed entirely of green (3) pixels. The length of this row varies across examples.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task seems to be transforming the input grid, with its multiple objects, into a simple, single-colored row whose length is determined by some property of the input grid.\n4.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the inputs and outputs, the number of green pixels in the output row directly corresponds to the number of distinct colored objects present in the input grid. The color or shape of the input objects does not influence the output color (always green), only the *count* of objects matters for the output length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
