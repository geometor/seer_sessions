Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 2D grids of various sizes containing multiple distinct "objects". An object appears to be a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. The background is consistently white (0). The objects in the examples are simple shapes, mostly lines (horizontal or vertical) or rectangles.
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are always 1D grids (single rows) composed entirely of green (3) pixels. The length of this row varies across examples.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task seems to be transforming the input grid, with its multiple objects, into a simple, single-colored row whose length is determined by some property of the input grid.
4.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the inputs and outputs, the number of green pixels in the output row directly corresponds to the number of distinct colored objects present in the input grid. The color or shape of the input objects does not influence the output color (always green), only the *count* of objects matters for the output length.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: Determine the number of distinct objects in the input grid and represent this count as the length of a green output row.
objects:
  input:
    type: 2D grid
    elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: figure
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color. These are the objects to be counted.
        colors_observed: [blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8)]
        shapes_observed: lines (horizontal/vertical), rectangles
  output:
    type: 1D grid (single row)
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color: green (3)
relationship:
  quantification: The number of pixels (length) in the output row is equal to the total count of distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  color_mapping: All objects in the input, regardless of their original color, contribute to the count, and the output is always composed of green (3) pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct objects. An object is defined as a connected group of adjacent (sharing a side, not just a corner) pixels that have the same non-white color.
2.  Count the total number of such objects found in the input grid.
3.  Construct the output grid as a single row.
4.  The length (number of columns) of this output row should be equal to the object count determined in step 2.
5.  Fill every cell in the output row with the green color (3).
