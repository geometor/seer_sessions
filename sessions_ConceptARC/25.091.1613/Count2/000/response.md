*   **Perception:**
    *   Each input grid contains a single, hollow shape outlined by blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background.
    *   The shapes observed are a rectangle, a triangle, and a diamond (or rhombus).
    *   The output is always a 1D horizontal array (1 row) filled entirely with orange (7) pixels.
    *   The length (number of columns) of the output array varies between examples.
    *   The length of the output array corresponds to the number of distinct straight line segments forming the perimeter of the blue shape in the input.

    task_description: Identify a hollow shape and count its constituent straight line segments.
    
    input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - shape_color: blue (1)
      - shapes:
          - type: hollow geometric shape (rectangle, triangle, diamond observed)
          - composition: formed by contiguous blue pixels
          - segments: perimeter is composed of straight line segments (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
    
    output_features:
      - grid: 1D array (1xN) of integers (0-9)
      - fill_color: orange (7)
      - length_determination: The number of columns (N) in the output grid is equal to the count of distinct straight line segments forming the perimeter of the input shape.
    
    transformation_logic:
      - step 1: Locate the blue (1) shape in the input grid.
      - step 2: Trace the perimeter of the shape.
      - step 3: Count the number of continuous straight line segments (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) that form the perimeter. A segment boundary occurs where the direction of the line changes.
      - step 4: Determine the count (N) of these segments.
      - step 5: Construct an output grid of size 1xN.
      - step 6: Fill the output grid with the orange (7) color.

      - example 3:
          - input_shape: Hollow Diamond/Rhombus
          - segments: 6 (top horizontal, bottom horizontal, top-left diagonal, bottom-left diagonal, top-right diagonal, bottom-right diagonal)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous object composed of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
    2.  Analyze the perimeter of this blue object.
    3.  Count the number of distinct, continuous straight line segments (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) required to trace the entire perimeter. A new segment begins each time the direction of the perimeter changes (e.g., from horizontal to vertical, or from one diagonal angle to another or to horizontal/vertical).
    4.  Let the total count of these distinct line segments be N.
    5.  Generate a 1-dimensional output grid (a single row) with N columns.
    6.  Fill every cell in this output grid with the orange (7) color.
