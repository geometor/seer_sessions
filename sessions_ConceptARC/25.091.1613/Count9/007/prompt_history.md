## Perception

1.  **Input:** The input is a rectangular grid of pixels, with dimensions varying across examples (10x10, 10x10, 8x8). The grid contains pixels of different colors, including white (0) which acts as the background, and several other colors (Gray, Red, Yellow, Green, Magenta, Azure, Orange).
2.  **Output:** The output is always a square grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels. The size of the square grid varies (4x4, 3x3, 4x4).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input grid form distinct shapes or "objects". An object can be defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity can be considered either 4-way (adjacent horizontally or vertically) or 8-way (including diagonals). Based on analysis, using 4-way connectivity seems appropriate.
4.  **Colors:** The input grids contain multiple distinct non-white colors.
5.  **Relationship:** The size of the output white square seems determined by properties derived from the objects and colors in the input grid. Specifically, it depends on both the total count of distinct contiguous objects (O) and the count of distinct non-white colors (C).
6.  **Transformation Logic:** A conditional rule appears to govern the transformation. The number of objects (O) is compared to a threshold value (4). If the object count exceeds the threshold, the output dimension (N) is determined by the distinct color count (C). Otherwise, the output dimension (N) is determined by the object count (O). The output grid is always an N x N square filled with white.

## Facts

Determine the size (N) of the output square grid based on the input grid's properties.
Count the number of distinct contiguous objects (O) of non-white colors (using 4-way connectivity).
Count the number of distinct non-white colors (C) present in the input grid.
If the number of objects (O) is greater than 4, the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of distinct colors (C).
Otherwise (if O is 4 or less), the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of objects (O).

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core logic for determining a numerical parameter (N) based on the count of objects (O) and distinct colors (C) in the input grid. The conditional rule (`if O > 4, N = C else N = O`) was successfully applied. However, the interpretation of the output format was incorrect; the examples show the output is consistently a single row of white pixels (a 1xN grid), not an NxN square grid as previously assumed.

The execution results confirm that the calculated value of N using the derived rule matches the required length of the output row in all training examples. The discrepancy lies solely in the shape of the final output grid.

The strategy is to refine the transformation process by modifying the final step: instead of creating an NxN grid, create a 1xN grid (a single row) filled with white pixels, where N is determined by the established rule.

**Metrics:**

Code execution was used to verify the object counts, distinct color counts, and the conditional rule for determining the output length N.
