**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core logic for determining a numerical parameter (N) based on the count of objects (O) and distinct colors (C) in the input grid. The conditional rule (`if O > 4, N = C else N = O`) was successfully applied. However, the interpretation of the output format was incorrect; the examples show the output is consistently a single row of white pixels (a 1xN grid), not an NxN square grid as previously assumed.

The execution results confirm that the calculated value of N using the derived rule matches the required length of the output row in all training examples. The discrepancy lies solely in the shape of the final output grid.

The strategy is to refine the transformation process by modifying the final step: instead of creating an NxN grid, create a 1xN grid (a single row) filled with white pixels, where N is determined by the established rule.

**Metrics:**

Code execution was used to verify the object counts, distinct color counts, and the conditional rule for determining the output length N.

            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:
