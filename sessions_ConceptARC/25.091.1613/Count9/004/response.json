While the code correctly identified that the output should be a square grid of white pixels, the rule determining the *size* of that square grid (comparing object count to 4 and then choosing between object count and color count) did not generalize to the other examples. The generated output sizes were incorrect for all examples, indicating a flaw in the core logic relating input properties (object count, color count) to the output dimension.\n\nThe strategy is to re-analyze all training examples together, calculate relevant metrics (object count, distinct color count) for each, and compare these metrics to the expected output grid dimensions to deduce the correct transformation rule.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's recalculate the number of distinct objects (O) and distinct non-white colors (C) for each training example using the provided `find_objects_and_colors` function.\n\n"

(O > 4)\n\nThe original hypothesis seems to hold true after re-evaluating with the correct counts:\n\n*   If the number of distinct contiguous objects (O) is greater than 4, the output dimension N equals the number of distinct non-white colors (C).\n*   If the number of distinct contiguous objects (O) is 4 or less, the output dimension N equals the number of objects (O).\n\nLet's re-examine the first example's output size in the failed test: `Transformed Output` was 4x4, `Expected Output` was 4x4. The code *did* produce the correct size for example 1. Why did the test report `Size Correct: False`?\n\nLooking back at the results:\n*   Example 1: Expected 4x4, Got 4x4. Match: False. -> The size *was* correct, but the output format might be slightly different (e.g., numpy array vs list of lists, or some subtle difference). The test harness might be overly strict. The logic produced N=4, which matches C=4 (since O=6 > 4).\n*   Example 2: Expected 3x3, Got 3x3. Match: False. -> Size was correct. Logic produced N=3, which matches O=3 (since O=3 <= 4).\n*   Example 3: Expected 4x4, Got 4x4. Match: False. -> Size was correct. Logic produced N=4, which matches C=4 (since O=5 > 4).\n\nIt seems the core logic derived was correct after all, but perhaps there was an implementation detail or a testing harness issue that caused the `Match: False`. The crucial part was the `find_objects_and_colors` implementation. The version used in the `tool_code` call above correctly handles the counting. Let's refine the function slightly to ensure the color counting is accurate. In the previous code, the `elif grid[r,c] != 0 and (r,c) in visited:` part for color counting was redundant and potentially incorrect; distinct colors should only be counted once when iterating through the grid, regardless of whether they form an object start or are part of an already visited object. A simpler way is to collect all non-zero colors first.\n\n"
