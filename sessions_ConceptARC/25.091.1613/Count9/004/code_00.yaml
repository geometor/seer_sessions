facts:
  - Rationale: Analyze the input grid to determine the properties required for the transformation.
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Definition: Contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
      - Connectivity: 4-way (horizontal/vertical adjacency).
      - Property 1 (O): Count of distinct objects.
  - Colors:
      - Definition: Unique non-white pixel values present in the input grid.
      - Property 2 (C): Count of distinct non-white colors.
  - Transformation Rule:
      - Compare the object count (O) to a threshold value of 4.
      - If O > 4, the output grid dimension (N) is equal to the distinct color count (C).
      - If O <= 4, the output grid dimension (N) is equal to the object count (O).
  - Output Grid:
      - Type: A square 2D grid.
      - Dimensions: N x N.
      - Content: Filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
