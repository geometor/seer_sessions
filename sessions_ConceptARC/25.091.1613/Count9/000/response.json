The grid contains pixels of different colors, including white (0) which acts as the background, and several other colors (Gray, Red, Yellow, Green, Magenta, Azure, Orange).\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a square grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels. The size of the square grid varies (4x4, 3x3, 4x4).\n3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input grid form distinct shapes or \"objects\". An object can be defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity can be considered either 4-way (adjacent horizontally or vertically) or 8-way (including diagonals). Based on analysis, using 4-way connectivity seems appropriate.\n4.  **Colors:** The input grids contain multiple distinct non-white colors.\n5.  **Relationship:** The size of the output white square seems determined by properties derived from the objects and colors in the input grid. Specifically, it depends on both the total count of distinct contiguous objects (O) and the count of distinct non-white colors (C).\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** A conditional rule appears to govern the transformation. The number of objects (O) is compared to a threshold value (4). If the object count exceeds the threshold, the output dimension (N) is determined by the distinct color count (C). Otherwise, the output dimension (N) is determined by the object count (O). The output grid is always an N x N square filled with white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
