"""
Determine the size (N) of the output square grid based on the input grid's properties.
Count the number of distinct contiguous objects (O) of non-white colors (using 4-way connectivity).
Count the number of distinct non-white colors (C) present in the input grid.
If the number of objects (O) is greater than 4, the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of distinct colors (C).
Otherwise (if O is 4 or less), the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of objects (O).
The output grid is an N x N square filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
