Input_Global:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Content: Pixels with color values 0-9. White (0) is the background.
  Structure: Contains non-white pixels forming contiguous objects.

Output_Global:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Content: Pixels are always white (0).
  Structure: Always a square grid (N x N).

Derived_Properties:
  - Property: Object Count (O)
    Description: The total number of distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Connectivity is defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    Examples:
      - train_1: O = 6
      - train_2: O = 3
      - train_3: O = 5
  - Property: Distinct Color Count (C)
    Description: The number of unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
    Examples:
      - train_1: C = 4 (Gray, Red, Yellow, Green)
      - train_2: C = 2 (Magenta, Yellow)
      - train_3: C = 4 (Yellow, Azure, Green, Orange)
  - Property: Output Dimension (N)
    Description: The side length of the square output grid.
    Calculation_Rule: A conditional rule based on O and C.
      - If O > 4, then N = C.
      - If O <= 4, then N = O.
    Examples:
      - train_1: O=6, C=4. Since O > 4, N = C = 4.
      - train_2: O=3, C=2. Since O <= 4, N = O = 3.
      - train_3: O=5, C=4. Since O > 4, N = C = 4.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Analyze the input grid to determine the Object Count (O) and Distinct Color Count (C).
  - Action: Apply the Calculation_Rule to determine the Output Dimension (N).
  - Action: Construct an N x N grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
