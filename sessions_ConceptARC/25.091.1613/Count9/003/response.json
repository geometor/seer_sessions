Count the number of distinct contiguous objects (O) of non-white colors (using 4-way connectivity).\n2. Count the number of distinct non-white colors (C) present in the input grid.\n3. Apply a conditional rule:\n   - If the number of objects (O) is greater than 4, the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of distinct colors (C).\n   - Otherwise (if O is 4 or less), the output grid dimension N is equal to the number of objects (O).\n4.
