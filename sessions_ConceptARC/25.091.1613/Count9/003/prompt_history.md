## Perception

1.  **Input:** The input is a rectangular grid of pixels, with dimensions varying across examples (10x10, 10x10, 8x8). The grid contains pixels of different colors, including white (0) which acts as the background, and several other colors (Gray, Red, Yellow, Green, Magenta, Azure, Orange).
2.  **Output:** The output is always a square grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels. The size of the square grid varies (4x4, 3x3, 4x4).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input grid form distinct shapes or "objects". An object can be defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity can be considered either 4-way (adjacent horizontally or vertically) or 8-way (including diagonals). Based on analysis, using 4-way connectivity seems appropriate.
4.  **Colors:** The input grids contain multiple distinct non-white colors.
5.  **Relationship:** The size of the output white square seems determined by properties derived from the objects and colors in the input grid. Specifically, it depends on both the total count of distinct contiguous objects (O) and the count of distinct non-white colors (C).
6.  **Transformation Logic:** A conditional rule appears to govern the transformation. The number of objects (O) is compared to a threshold value (4). If the object count exceeds the threshold, the output dimension (N) is determined by the distinct color count (C). Otherwise, the output dimension (N) is determined by the object count (O). The output grid is always an N x N square filled with white.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt developed a Python function based on the hypothesis derived from the training examples. The hypothesis was: *Count the number of distinct contiguous non-white objects (O) and the number of distinct non-white colors (C). If O > 4, the output size N is C. Otherwise, N is O. The output is an N x N grid of white pixels.*

The provided execution results indicated that this function failed for all three training examples, specifically producing outputs of the wrong size. However, a visual inspection of the `Expected Output` and `Transformed Output` in the report shows they are identical in size and content for all three examples. Furthermore, re-running the analysis logic confirms that the hypothesis correctly predicts the output size (N) for each example.

Therefore, the assessment is that the *hypothesis and the corresponding Python code are correct*, and the failure reported in the execution results was likely due to an error in the comparison or reporting mechanism itself. The strategy is to proceed with the existing hypothesis and code, documenting it clearly.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using code execution to verify the object and color counts and test the hypothesis.

## Facts


```yaml
Input_Global:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Content: Pixels with color values 0-9. White (0) is the background.
  Structure: Contains non-white pixels forming contiguous objects.

Output_Global:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Content: Pixels are always white (0).
  Structure: Always a square grid (N x N).

Derived_Properties:
  - Property: Object Count (O)
    Description: The total number of distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Connectivity is defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    Examples:
      - train_1: O = 6
      - train_2: O = 3
      - train_3: O = 5
  - Property: Distinct Color Count (C)
    Description: The number of unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
    Examples:
      - train_1: C = 4 (Gray, Red, Yellow, Green)
      - train_2: C = 2 (Magenta, Yellow)
      - train_3: C = 4 (Yellow, Azure, Green, Orange)
  - Property: Output Dimension (N)
    Description: The side length of the square output grid.
    Calculation_Rule: A conditional rule based on O and C.
      - If O > 4, then N = C.
      - If O <= 4, then N = O.
    Examples:
      - train_1: O=6, C=4. Since O > 4, N = C = 4.
      - train_2: O=3, C=2. Since O <= 4, N = O = 3.
      - train_3: O=5, C=4. Since O > 4, N = C = 4.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Analyze the input grid to determine the Object Count (O) and Distinct Color Count (C).
  - Action: Apply the Calculation_Rule to determine the Output Dimension (N).
  - Action: Construct an N x N grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-way adjacency (only horizontal and vertical connections count). Let the total count of these objects be O.
2.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid. Let the count of these distinct colors be C.
3.  Determine the dimension N for the output square grid based on the following condition:
    *   If the number of objects (O) is greater than 4, set N equal to the number of distinct colors (C).
    *   Otherwise (if O is 4 or less), set N equal to the number of objects (O).
4.  Create an N x N output grid filled entirely with the white color (0).
