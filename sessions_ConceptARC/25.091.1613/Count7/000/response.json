Each input grid features a background color (white, 0) and at least two other colors forming shapes or patterns. In `train_1`, there's a large green (3) 'H' shape with three orange (7) pixels embedded. In `train_2`, there's a gray (5) shape with five yellow (4) pixels embedded.\n2.  **Output:** The outputs are single-column grids (vectors) filled entirely with the color red (2).\n3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation appears to relate the *count* of a specific color in the input grid to the *height* of the output grid.\n4.  **Identifying the Target Color:** In both examples, the color whose count determines the output height (orange in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`) is the least frequent non-background color present in the input grid.\n5.  **Output Construction:** The height of the output grid equals the count of the least frequent non-background color found in the input. The width is always 1, and all cells are filled with red (2).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
