1. Analyze the input grid to identify all unique colors present, excluding the background color (white, 0).
2. For each unique non-background color identified, count how many times it appears in the input grid.
3. Determine which of these non-background colors has the *lowest* count (frequency).
4. Get the count (`N`) of this least frequent color.
5. Create a new output grid with dimensions `N` rows (height) and 1 column (width).
6. Fill every cell in this new output grid with the color red (2).
