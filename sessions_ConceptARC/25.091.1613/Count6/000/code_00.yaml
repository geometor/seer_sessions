task_description: Count specific colored pixels within a bordered region and represent the count as yellow pixels in a fixed-size column output.

elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains_border: true # A rectangular frame of a single color enclosing an area.
      - border_color: variable # Green (3) in ex1, Gray (5) in ex2.
      - background_color: white (0)
      - enclosed_area: Contains background pixels and target pixels.
      - target_pixels:
          role: pixels_to_be_counted
          color: variable # Blue (1) in ex1, Orange (7) in ex2. Defined as the color inside the border that is not the border color or background color.
          count: variable # 2 in ex1, 5 in ex2.

  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x1 (fixed column vector)
      - content: Represents the count of input target_pixels.
      - representation_color: yellow (4)
      - padding_color: white (0)
      - structure: A sequence of N yellow pixels followed by (7-N) white pixels, where N is the count of target_pixels from the input.

relationships:
  - input_target_pixel_count -> output_yellow_pixel_count: The number of target pixels (non-border, non-background color inside the border) in the input grid directly determines the number of yellow pixels in the output grid.

actions:
  - identify_border: Find the rectangular frame and its color.
  - identify_target_pixels: Locate pixels within the border that are not the border color and not the background color.
  - count_target_pixels: Determine the quantity (N) of target pixels.
  - generate_output_grid: Create a 7x1 grid.
  - populate_output_grid: Fill the top N cells with yellow (4) and the remaining cells with white (0).
