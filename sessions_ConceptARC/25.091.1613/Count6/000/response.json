The background is white (0). Inside the border, there are a small number of pixels of another distinct color (blue in example 1, orange in example 2).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is consistently a 7x1 column grid (a vertical vector).\n3.  **Transformation Clues:** The output grid contains yellow (4) pixels at the top, followed by white (0) pixels. The *number* of yellow pixels in the output seems related to the number of non-border, non-background colored pixels within the border of the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: 2 blue pixels inside the green border -> 2 yellow pixels in the output.\n    *   Example 2: 5 orange pixels inside the gray border -> 5 yellow pixels in the output.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The task appears to involve identifying a bordered region, finding specific \"target\" pixels within that region (those that are neither the border color nor the background), counting these target pixels, and representing that count as a number of yellow pixels in a fixed-size (7x1) output column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
