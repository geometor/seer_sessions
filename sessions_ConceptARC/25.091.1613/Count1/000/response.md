Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

*   **Input:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, solid-colored rectangular or L-shaped objects placed on a white background. The colors used for objects include red, magenta, green, orange, gray, azure, and yellow. The size and position of these objects vary across examples. The objects do not overlap.
*   **Output:** The output is always a single row (1xn grid). In the provided examples, the output row has a length of 6. The output row consists only of yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
*   **Relationship:** The key transformation seems to involve counting the number of distinct non-white objects in the input grid. This count directly determines the number of yellow pixels in the output row. The output row appears to have a fixed length (6 in these examples), and the yellow pixels corresponding to the object count are placed at the beginning, followed by white pixels padding the rest of the row.

**Facts**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains multiple distinct objects.
  Objects:
    Type: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Solid color (e.g., red, magenta, green, orange, azure, gray, yellow).
      - Shape (often rectangular, but can be other simple shapes).
      - Variable size and position.
      - Do not overlap.
OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Always a single row (height 1).
    - Fixed width (appears to be 6 in the examples).
    - Contains only yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
Transformation:
  Action: Count the number of distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  Relationship:
    - The count of objects determines the number of yellow (4) pixels in the output.
    - Yellow pixels are placed starting from the left of the output row.
  Padding:
    - If the object count is less than the fixed output width (6), the remaining positions in the output row are filled with white (0) pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all separate, contiguous groups of non-white (not color 0) pixels in the input grid. Treat each such group as a distinct "object".
2.  Count the total number of these distinct objects found in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Create a new output grid consisting of a single row with a fixed width of 6 columns.
4.  Fill the first `N` cells (columns 0 to `N-1`) of the output row with the color yellow (4).
5.  Fill the remaining cells (columns `N` to 5) of the output row with the color white (0).
6.  Return the resulting 1x6 grid.
