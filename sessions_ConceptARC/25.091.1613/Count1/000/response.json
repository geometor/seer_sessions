The colors used for objects include red, magenta, green, orange, gray, azure, and yellow. The size and position of these objects vary across examples. The objects do not overlap.\n*   **Output:** The output is always a single row (1xn grid). In the provided examples, the output row has a length of 6. The output row consists only of yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.\n*   **Relationship:** The key transformation seems to involve counting the number of distinct non-white objects in the input grid. This count directly determines the number of yellow pixels in the output row. The output row appears to have a fixed length (6 in these examples), and the yellow pixels corresponding to the object count are placed at the beginning, followed by white pixels padding the rest of the row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
