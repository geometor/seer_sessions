InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains multiple distinct objects.
  Objects:
    Type: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    Properties:
      - Solid color (e.g., red, magenta, green, orange, azure, gray, yellow).
      - Shape (often rectangular, but can be other simple shapes).
      - Variable size and position.
      - Do not overlap.
OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Always a single row (height 1).
    - Fixed width (appears to be 6 in the examples).
    - Contains only yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
Transformation:
  Action: Count the number of distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  Relationship:
    - The count of objects determines the number of yellow (4) pixels in the output.
    - Yellow pixels are placed starting from the left of the output row.
  Padding:
    - If the object count is less than the fixed output width (6), the remaining positions in the output row are filled with white (0) pixels.
