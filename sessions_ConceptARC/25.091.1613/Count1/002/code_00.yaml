InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains non-white pixels forming contiguous components.
OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Always a single row (height 1).
    - Fixed width (6 in the examples).
    - Contains only yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
Transformation:
  Action: Count "significant entities" in the input grid.
  Entity Definition:
    - Find all distinct contiguous components of the same non-white color.
    - Determine the size (pixel count) of each component.
    - Group components by their color.
    - For each color:
      - Identify components with size >= 2 pixels ("major components").
      - Identify components with size < 2 pixels (i.e., size 1, "minor components").
      - If there are any major components for this color, the number of entities contributed by this color is the *count of major components*.
      - If there are *only* minor components for this color, the number of entities contributed by this color is *1*.
  Counting:
    - Sum the number of entities contributed by each distinct non-white color present in the input. Let this sum be `N`.
  Output Generation:
    - Create a 1x6 grid initialized to white (0).
    - Fill the first `min(N, 6)` cells with yellow (4).
