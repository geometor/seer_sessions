            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code correctly implemented the straightforward interpretation of counting distinct contiguous objects of the same color. This worked for examples 1 and 3. However, it failed on example 2, producing an output indicating 11 objects (`[4,4,4,4,4,4]`, capped at 6) instead of the expected 4 (`[4,4,4,4,0,0]`).\n\nThe key difference in example 2 is the presence of multiple small, disconnected components of the *same* color (orange). The expected output suggests these small components should be collectively treated as representing that color only *once* in the final count. In contrast, example 3 has two *larger* disconnected components of the same color (yellow), and the expected output implies they *should* be counted separately.\n\nThis suggests a refinement of the definition of a \"countable entity\":\n- A color present as one or more *significant* (not tiny) contiguous components is counted based on the number of such components.\n- A color present *only* as tiny (e.g., single pixel) components is counted just once, representing the presence of that color.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the object finding/counting logic to incorporate a size threshold. Components below the threshold don't add to the count individually, but the presence of the color itself contributes 1 to the count if *all* its components are below the threshold.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze the components found by the initial BFS algorithm (which finds contiguous blocks of the same color) for each example, focusing on color and size (pixel count).\n\n"

If a color has *any* components of size >= 2, we count *all* such components for that color. If a color *only* has components of size < 2 (i.e., size 1), we count that color's presence exactly once.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
