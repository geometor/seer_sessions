"""
Identify the single green (3) object in the input grid, which forms a hollow frame one pixel thick.
Determine the bounding box of this green frame.
Calculate the dimensions (width and height) of the rectangular white (0) area enclosed within the green frame (the 'hole'). The hole's width is the bounding box width minus 2, and the hole's height is the bounding box height minus 2.
Calculate the area of this hole by multiplying its width and height.
If the calculated area is less than 1 (e.g., if the input shape doesn't form a proper hole), use 1 as the area.
The output grid is a single row (height 1) with a width equal to the calculated area of the hole.
Fill the output grid entirely with white (0) pixels.
