*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consist of a large, roughly rectangular block of a single dominant color (green in example 1, gray in example 2), surrounded by a white border.
    *   Within this dominant color block, there are a small number of pixels of different colors ('impurity' pixels).
    *   The output grid is always a single column (width 1).
    *   The color of the output grid pixels is always red (2).
    *   The height of the output column corresponds exactly to the number of 'impurity' pixels found within the dominant color block in the input grid.

*   **Facts:**

      - elements:

            properties:
              - dominant_color: variable (green/3 in ex1, gray/5 in ex2)
          - type: impurity_pixels
            description: Pixels located within the bounds of the main_object but having a different color.
            properties:
              - count: variable (3 in ex1, 4 in ex2)
    output_features:
      - type: grid
      - properties:
          - shape: N x 1 column vector
          - color: constant, red (2)
          - height (N): derived from input
    relationship:
      - The height (N) of the output grid is equal to the count of impurity_pixels in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Determine the color of this block (the 'dominant color').
    2.  Iterate through all pixel locations occupied by this dominant color block.
    3.  Count the number of pixels within these locations that have a color *different* from the dominant color. Let this count be `N`.
    4.  Construct an output grid with dimensions `N` rows and 1 column.
    5.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the color red (2).
