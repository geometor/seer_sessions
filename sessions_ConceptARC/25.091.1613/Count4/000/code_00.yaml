task_description: Determine the dimensions of the output grid based on the number of unique non-background colors in the input grid, then fill the output grid with the background color.
background_color: white (0)
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
      - includes a background color (white/0)
      - may contain multiple distinct objects (contiguous blocks of non-background color)
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height is always 1
      - width varies based on input
      - contains only the background color (white/0)
transformation_logic:
  - step: Identify all unique pixel values present in the input grid.
  - step: Filter out the background color (white/0) from the unique values.
  - step: Count the remaining unique non-background colors. Let this count be N.
  - step: Generate an output grid with dimensions 1 row by N columns.
  - step: Fill all cells of the output grid with the background color (white/0).
relationship: The width of the output grid is equal to the count of distinct non-background colors in the input grid. The height of the output grid is always 1. The content of the output grid is always the background color.
