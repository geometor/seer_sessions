Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids contain various colored objects (pixels with values other than 0) placed on a white background (pixels with value 0). The objects differ in color, shape, and position across the examples.

The output grids are consistently small, always consisting of a single row and varying widths. Crucially, all output grids are composed entirely of white pixels (value 0).

There appears to be a relationship between the *variety* of colors in the input and the *size* (specifically, the width) of the output grid.

*   **Example 1:** Input has blue (1), red (2), and azure (8). 3 distinct non-white colors. Output is 1x3.
*   **Example 2:** Input has yellow (4). 1 distinct non-white color. Output is 1x1.
*   **Example 3:** Input has orange (7) and yellow (4). 2 distinct non-white colors. Output is 1x2.

This suggests the transformation involves counting the distinct non-white colors present in the input and using this count to determine the width of the output grid, which is then filled with white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Determine the dimensions of the output grid based on the number of unique non-background colors in the input grid, then fill the output grid with the background color.
background_color: white (0)
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
      - includes a background color (white/0)
      - may contain multiple distinct objects (contiguous blocks of non-background color)
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height is always 1
      - width varies based on input
      - contains only the background color (white/0)
transformation_logic:
  - step: Identify all unique pixel values present in the input grid.
  - step: Filter out the background color (white/0) from the unique values.
  - step: Count the remaining unique non-background colors. Let this count be N.
  - step: Generate an output grid with dimensions 1 row by N columns.
  - step: Fill all cells of the output grid with the background color (white/0).
relationship: The width of the output grid is equal to the count of distinct non-background colors in the input grid. The height of the output grid is always 1. The content of the output grid is always the background color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid and identify all the distinct colors present.
2.  Ignore the white background color (0).
3.  Count how many unique non-white colors were found. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Create a new grid with 1 row and `N` columns.
5.  Fill every cell in this new grid with the white color (0).
6.  This new grid is the output.
