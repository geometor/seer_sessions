The objects differ in color, shape, and position across the examples.\n\nThe output grids are consistently small, always consisting of a single row and varying widths. Crucially, all output grids are composed entirely of white pixels (value 0).\n\nThere appears to be a relationship between the *variety* of colors in the input and the *size* (specifically, the width) of the output grid.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input has blue (1), red (2), and azure (8). 3 distinct non-white colors. Output is 1x3.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has yellow (4). 1 distinct non-white color. Output is 1x1.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has orange (7) and yellow (4). 2 distinct non-white colors. Output is 1x2.\n\nThis suggests the transformation involves counting the distinct non-white colors present in the input and using this count to determine the width of the output grid, which is then filled with white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
