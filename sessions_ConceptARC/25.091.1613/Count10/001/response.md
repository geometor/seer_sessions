Identify the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input grid. 
Calculate the height and width of this bounding box.
Find the maximum of the height and width.
The output is a single row of white pixels whose width is calculated as ceiling(maximum_dimension / 2), which is equivalent to (maximum_dimension + 1) // 2 using integer division.
