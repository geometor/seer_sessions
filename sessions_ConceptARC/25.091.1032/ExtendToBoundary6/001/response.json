Identify the locations (row, column) of all blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid.\n3. For each identified blue pixel location:\n    a. Start tracing a path diagonally upwards and to the right (row decreases, column increases).\n    b. The path consists of blue pixels. The starting blue pixel is the first pixel of the path.\n    c. Continue tracing the path one step at a time.\n    d. Before adding the next pixel to the path, check if the next position:\n        i. Is outside the top grid boundary (row < 0).\n        ii. Is outside the right grid boundary (column >= grid width).\n        iii. Corresponds to a red pixel (color 2) in the original input grid.\n    e. If any of these conditions are met, stop tracing the path for the current starting blue pixel.\n    f.
