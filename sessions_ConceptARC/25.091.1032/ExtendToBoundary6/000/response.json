These objects remain unchanged in the output grids.\n    *   There are one or more single blue pixels in the input grids. These blue pixels are the starting points for transformations.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the blue pixels. Each blue pixel initiates a \"trace\" or \"path\".\n5.  **Path Characteristics:**\n    *   The path starts at the initial blue pixel's location.\n    *   The path extends diagonally upwards and to the right (row index decreases, column index increases).\n    *   The path is composed of blue pixels in the output grid.\n6.  **Path Termination:** The path stops extending just *before* it would:\n    *   Hit a red pixel.\n    *   Go off the top edge of the grid (row index < 0).\n    *   Go off the right edge of the grid (column index >= grid width).\n7.  **Output Composition:** The output grid is essentially the input grid with the traced blue paths added. The original blue starting pixels are part of these paths. The red objects are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If none of the stopping conditions are true, update the current position: `current_row = next_row`, `current_col = next_col`, and continue the loop from step 3.b.i.\n4.
