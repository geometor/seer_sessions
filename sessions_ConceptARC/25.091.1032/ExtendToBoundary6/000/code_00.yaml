task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - variable_size
  - element: red_object
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: appears as solid bars/rectangles (horizontal or vertical)
      - quantity: one per grid in examples
      - behavior: static (position and color unchanged between input and output)
  - element: blue_pixel
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: single pixel
      - quantity: one or more per grid
      - role: initiator of action
    actions:
      - traces a path
  - element: blue_path
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: diagonal line segment (up-right direction)
      - location: starts at initial blue_pixel location
      - generation: created based on rules
      - termination_conditions:
          - proximity to red_object (stops before hitting red)
          - proximity to grid_boundary (stops before top edge)
          - proximity to grid_boundary (stops before right edge)
    relationship:
      - Each blue_pixel generates one blue_path.
      - blue_path pixels overwrite existing white pixels in the output.
      - blue_path generation respects the position of red_objects as barriers.
