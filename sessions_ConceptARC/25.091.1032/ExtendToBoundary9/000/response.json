This object is often hollow or defines an enclosed region. In the examples, this frame is green (3), yellow (4), or magenta (6).\n    *   The second object is located inside the region enclosed by the outer frame. This inner object has a different color (red (2), gray (5), orange (7) in the examples).\n    *   The transformation modifies the area *inside* the outer frame. Specifically, any white pixels (0) within the enclosed region are changed to the color of the inner object.\n    *   The outer frame object and the original inner object remain unchanged in the output grid. The transformation essentially \"fills\" the empty space within the frame using the color of the inner object.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the outer frame object (typically the largest connected non-white object defining a boundary).\n    3.  Identify the inner object (the other non-white object located inside the outer frame). Determine the color of this inner object (`inner_color`).\n    4.  Determine the set of coordinates representing the region strictly *inside* the outer frame. This can be done by performing a flood fill from the outside edges of the grid, marking all reachable white pixels as \"exterior\". Any remaining white pixels not marked as exterior are considered \"interior\".\n    5.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates (`row`, `col`) within the grid dimensions.\n    6.  For each pixel, check if its coordinate (`row`, `col`) belongs to the identified \"interior\" region (i.e., it's inside the frame) AND if the pixel's color in the *input* grid is white (0).\n    7.  If both conditions are true, change the color of the pixel at (`row`, `col`) in the *output* grid to `inner_color`.\n    8.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from their initial copied state (preserving the outer frame, the inner object, and the exterior background).\n    9.  Return the modified output grid."
