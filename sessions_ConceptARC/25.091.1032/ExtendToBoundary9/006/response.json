            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code implemented a plausible interpretation of the task: filling all enclosed white space. However, the results show this interpretation was incorrect. The comparison between the code's output and the expected output reveals that the transformation should **not** fill all interior white space. Instead, the filling seems constrained by the row extent of the inner object.\n\nSpecifically, the code incorrectly filled white pixels in rows that did not contain any part of the original inner object (e.g., rows 2, 6, 7, 8 in Example 1; rows 2-7 and 10 in Example 2; rows 2-4 and 8-12 in Example 3). The correct transformation only fills white pixels located *within the horizontal span of the outer frame* but restricted *only to the rows originally occupied by the inner object*. Crucially, the original pixels of the inner object itself must be preserved, even though the fill color is the same.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Continue using 8-way connectivity for object identification and bounding box containment to distinguish the outer frame from the inner object.\n2.  **Determine Fill Rows:** Identify the minimum and maximum row indices occupied by the `inner_object`.\n3.  **Determine Fill Columns per Row:** For each row within the identified row range, find the minimum and maximum column indices of the `outer_frame` in that specific row.\n4.  **Apply Conditional Fill:** Iterate through the pixels within the identified row range and between the frame's column boundaries for each row. If a pixel's coordinates fall within this range *and* its color in the *input* grid is white (0), change its color in the *output* grid to the `inner_object`'s color. Otherwise, preserve the original pixel color (copied initially).\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe primary discrepancy was the extent of the fill. The initial code filled *all* interior white pixels identified by a flood fill, while the expected output only fills a subset of these pixels, specifically those on the same rows as the inner object and horizontally bounded by the frame.\n\nLet's verify the object identification and the proposed fill logic for Example 1 using the tool code:\n"
