In `train_2`, the barrier is a horizontal gray line.\n3.  **Transformation**: The source pixels are extended or 'painted' towards the gray barrier. The extension stops just before hitting the barrier.\n4.  **Extension Direction**:\n    *   If the barrier is a vertical line, the extension happens horizontally (left or right) along the row of the source pixel.\n    *   If the barrier is a horizontal line, the extension happens vertically (up or down) along the column of the source pixel.\n5.  **Color Preservation**: The extended pixels take the color of the original source pixel. The barrier and background pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Source Pixel Location**: The direction of extension depends on the source pixel's position relative to the barrier (e.g., left of a vertical barrier extends right, above a horizontal barrier extends down).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
