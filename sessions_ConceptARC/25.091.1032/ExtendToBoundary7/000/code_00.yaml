observations:
  - element: Grids
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels with colors 0-9.
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Barrier Object
    description: A contiguous object made of gray pixels (5).
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: Appears as a straight line (vertical or horizontal) in the examples.
      - role: Acts as a boundary for extension.
  - element: Source Pixels
    description: Isolated pixels with colors other than white (0) or gray (5).
    properties:
      - color: Variable (yellow/4 in train_1, green/3 in train_2)
      - count: Can be multiple per input grid.
      - role: Origin points for the extension action.
  - element: Transformation Action
    description: Extending source pixels towards the barrier object.
    properties:
      - direction: Determined by the orientation of the barrier and the relative position of the source pixel.
          - If barrier is vertical, extension is horizontal (towards the barrier).
          - If barrier is horizontal, extension is vertical (towards the barrier).
      - color: The extension uses the color of the source pixel.
      - stopping_condition: The extension stops one pixel away from the barrier.
  - element: Invariance
    description: Elements not part of the extension process remain unchanged.
    properties:
      - background pixels (white)
      - barrier pixels (gray)
relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: The position of a source pixel relative to the barrier determines the direction of extension (left/right or up/down).
  - type: Functional
    description: The orientation of the barrier (vertical/horizontal) determines the axis of extension (horizontal/vertical).
