Transformation Rule:

1. Identify a barrier object composed of gray (5) pixels. Determine if it forms a predominantly vertical or horizontal line.
2. Find all 'source' pixels, which are pixels neither white (0) nor gray (5).
3. For each source pixel:
    a. If the barrier is vertical at column `barrier_col`:
        - If the source pixel is to the left (`source_col < barrier_col`), fill the row horizontally to the right with the source pixel's color, stopping just before the barrier column.
        - If the source pixel is to the right (`source_col > barrier_col`), fill the row horizontally to the left with the source pixel's color, stopping just after the barrier column.
    b. If the barrier is horizontal at row `barrier_row`:
        - If the source pixel is above (`source_row < barrier_row`), fill the column vertically downwards with the source pixel's color, stopping just before the barrier row.
        - If the source pixel is below (`source_row > barrier_row`), fill the column vertically upwards with the source pixel's color, stopping just after the barrier row.
4. Pixels belonging to the barrier or the background remain unchanged unless painted over by the extension process.
