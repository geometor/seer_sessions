            "text": "Okay, let's break down these examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nAcross the three examples, the core operation involves identifying two key components in the input grid:\n1.  A single, isolated \"trigger\" pixel of a specific color (yellow, orange, red in the examples).\n2.  A \"barrier\" structure, which can be a line (vertical gray, horizontal orange/white pattern) or a set of points defining a line (diagonal green).\n\nThe transformation uses the trigger pixel's color and position, along with the barrier's position and orientation, to draw a new line or path onto the grid. The background white pixels are replaced by the trigger pixel's color along this new line/path. The original trigger pixel and barrier remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 1:** A vertical gray barrier exists at column 1. A yellow trigger pixel exists at (5, 11). A horizontal yellow line is drawn on the trigger's row (row 5), starting from the column immediately to the right of the barrier (column 2) and extending to the grid's right edge.\n*   **Example 2:** A horizontal patterned barrier exists at row 1. An orange trigger pixel exists at (7, 8). A vertical orange line is drawn in the trigger's column (column 8), starting from the row immediately below the barrier (row 2) and extending downwards, stopping just before the trigger's row (ending at row 7).\n*   **Example 3:** A diagonal barrier is formed by green pixels (implicitly defining y=x for even coordinates). A red trigger pixel exists at (6, 0). A diagonal path of red pixels is drawn, starting from the trigger's position and moving towards the barrier (up and left: -1 row, -1 column per step), leaving a trail. The path stops just before it would intersect the implicit barrier line. The new pixels are added at (5, 1) and (4, 2).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the single \"trigger\" pixel: Find the pixel whose color is not white (0) and is isolated (not part of a larger line/structure of the same color). Record its color (C) and position (tr, tc).\n3.  Identify the \"barrier\" structure: Find the line or pattern of connected/aligned pixels (can be gray, or another color like orange or green). Determine its orientation (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) and its primary position (e.g., column index for vertical, row index for horizontal, implicit line like y=x for diagonal).\n4.  Based on the barrier orientation and trigger position:\n    *   **If the barrier is vertical (at column b):**\n        *   Determine the starting column (sc): if tc > b, sc = b + 1; else sc = b - 1.\n        *   Determine the ending column (ec): if tc > b, ec = grid_width - 1; else ec = 0.\n        *   Iterate through columns from sc to ec (inclusive, direction depends on sc vs ec). For each column `c`, set the pixel at `(tr, c)` in the output grid to color C.\n    *   **If the barrier is horizontal (at row b):**\n        *   Determine the starting row (sr): if tr > b, sr = b + 1; else sr = b - 1.\n        *   Determine the ending row (er): if tr > b, er = tr - 1; else er = tr + 1.\n        *   Iterate through rows from sr to er (inclusive, direction depends on sr vs er). For each row `r`, set the pixel at `(r, tc)` in the output grid to color C.\n    *   **If the barrier is diagonal (e.g., implies line y=x):**\n        *   Determine the step direction (dr, dc) based on the trigger's position relative to the barrier (e.g., if trigger is below/right of y=x like (6,0), step is (-1, -1)).\n        *   Initialize current position (cr, cc) = (tr, tc).\n        *   Loop:\n            *   Update current position: cr = cr + dr, cc = cc + dc.\n            *   Check boundary conditions: if cr or cc are outside grid bounds, stop.\n            *   Check barrier condition: if the position (cr, cc) is \"on\" or \"past\" the barrier line (e.g., for y=x barrier, check if cr == cc or if the step crossed the line), stop.\n            *   Set the pixel at `(cr, cc)` in the output grid to color C.\n5.
