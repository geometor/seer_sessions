task_description: Identify two straight lines (one horizontal, one vertical) of non-white color separated by a gap of white pixels and fill the gap by extending one of the lines.
grid_properties:
  - size: Varies, but consistent between input and output for each example.
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: line
    count: 2 per grid
    properties:
      - orientation: one horizontal, one vertical
      - color: non-white (1-9), consistent within each line
      - shape: straight line segment
relationships:
  - type: separation
    between: [horizontal line, vertical line]
    details: Separated by a single row or column composed entirely of white pixels (0).
actions:
  - action: identify_lines
    target: non-white pixels forming straight horizontal and vertical lines.
  - action: identify_gap
    target: the row or column of white pixels directly connecting the endpoints of the two lines.
  - action: determine_extension_direction
    based_on: orientation of the gap (vertical or horizontal)
  - action: extend_line
    details:
      - If the gap is vertical (along a column), extend the vertical line to fill the gap.
      - If the gap is horizontal (along a row), extend the horizontal line to fill the gap.
    color: Use the color of the line being extended.
output_changes:
  - The gap between the two initial lines is filled with the color of the extended line.
  - The original lines remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
