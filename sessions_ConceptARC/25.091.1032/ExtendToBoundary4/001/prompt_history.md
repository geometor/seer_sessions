**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids contain two distinct line objects, one oriented horizontally and the other vertically. These lines are composed of non-white pixels and are separated by a gap consisting entirely of white pixels. The gap lies directly between the endpoints of the lines, either along a row or a column. The output grid shows that this gap has been filled with the color of the line that was extended to close the gap.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify two straight lines (one horizontal, one vertical) of non-white color separated by a gap of white pixels and fill the gap by extending one of the lines.
grid_properties:
  - size: Varies, but consistent between input and output for each example.
  - background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: line
    count: 2 per grid
    properties:
      - orientation: one horizontal, one vertical
      - color: non-white (1-9), consistent within each line
      - shape: straight line segment
relationships:
  - type: separation
    between: [horizontal line, vertical line]
    details: Separated by a single row or column composed entirely of white pixels (0).
actions:
  - action: identify_lines
    target: non-white pixels forming straight horizontal and vertical lines.
  - action: identify_gap
    target: the row or column of white pixels directly connecting the endpoints of the two lines.
  - action: determine_extension_direction
    based_on: orientation of the gap (vertical or horizontal)
  - action: extend_line
    details:
      - If the gap is vertical (along a column), extend the vertical line to fill the gap.
      - If the gap is horizontal (along a row), extend the horizontal line to fill the gap.
    color: Use the color of the line being extended.
output_changes:
  - The gap between the two initial lines is filled with the color of the extended line.
  - The original lines remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (objects) in the input grid.
2.  Filter these objects to find exactly one straight horizontal line and one straight vertical line.
3.  Determine the coordinates defining the extent of each line.
4.  Check if the lines are separated by a single, straight path (either one row or one column) consisting only of white pixels (0) that connects an endpoint of the horizontal line to an endpoint of the vertical line.
5.  If the separating path is vertical (a column segment):
    *   Identify the vertical line.
    *   Extend the vertical line along the separating path (column) towards the horizontal line, filling the white pixels with the color of the vertical line, until the gap is closed.
6.  If the separating path is horizontal (a row segment):
    *   Identify the horizontal line.
    *   Extend the horizontal line along the separating path (row) towards the vertical line, filling the white pixels with the color of the horizontal line, until the gap is closed.
7.  Output the modified grid.
