            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Transformation**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) for the background, yellow (4) for static structures, and orange (7) for dynamic elements that initiate a change.\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** The white space (0) acts as the area where changes can occur.\n    *   **Boundary Structure:** The yellow (4) pixels form a static structure, typically a shape like a hollow rectangle, sometimes with internal features. This structure seems to define boundaries for the transformation but remains unchanged itself. In train_2, there's a large yellow rectangle and a smaller internal yellow line.\n    *   **Seed Pixels:** The orange (7) pixels are the starting points or 'seeds' for the transformation. Their initial positions are key.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the orange (7) seed pixels 'painting' or filling adjacent white (0) pixels along a specific axis (either horizontally or vertically).\n4.  **Determining Fill Direction:** The direction of filling seems to depend on the position of the orange seed pixel relative to the main yellow boundary structure.\n    *   In train_1, the orange pixel is at (5,0). The main yellow rectangle spans rows 2-8. Since the orange pixel's row (5) is *within* the vertical span of the yellow structure, the fill occurs *horizontally* along row 5.\n    *   In train_2, the orange pixels are at (10,3) and (11,9). The main yellow rectangle spans rows 1-8. Since the orange pixels' rows (10 and 11) are *outside* the vertical span of the yellow structure, the fill occurs *vertically* along their respective columns (3 and 9).\n5.  **Fill Mechanism:** The fill radiates outwards from the seed pixel along the determined axis (row or column). It colors all contiguous white (0) pixels along that line until it encounters a pixel belonging to the main yellow (4) boundary structure or the edge of the grid. Importantly, internal features of the boundary structure (like the horizontal yellow line inside the rectangle in train_2) seem to be ignored by the fill; the fill continues until it hits the *outermost* boundary defined by that structure along the fill axis. The original seed pixel's location is also colored orange in the output.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
