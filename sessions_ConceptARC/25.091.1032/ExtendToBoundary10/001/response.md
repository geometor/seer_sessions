Transformation rule:
1. Identify the largest connected component of yellow (4) pixels, which forms the main boundary structure.
2. Calculate the vertical span (minimum and maximum row indices) of this main boundary structure.
3. Find all orange (7) 'seed' pixels.
4. For each orange seed pixel at (r, c):
    a. Determine the fill direction based on its row 'r' relative to the boundary's vertical span. If 'r' is within the span (inclusive), fill horizontally. Otherwise, fill vertically.
    b. Perform a 'ray cast' fill along the determined axis (row 'r' or column 'c').
    c. Starting from the seed pixel's location, change adjacent white (0) pixels in the input grid to orange (7) in the output grid along the determined axis (in both directions).
    d. Stop the fill in a given direction when a pixel belonging to the main yellow boundary component is encountered or the grid edge is reached.
    e. The original seed pixel location is also colored orange (7) in the output grid.
5. All other pixels retain their original colors.
