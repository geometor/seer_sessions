            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code successfully solved the first training example (`train_1`) but failed on the second (`train_2`). The failure occurred because the logic for vertical filling was incorrect. In `train_2`, the orange seed pixels were located *below* the vertical span of the main yellow boundary structure. The original code filled both upwards and downwards from these seeds, incorrectly coloring a pixel below one of the seeds.\n\nThe key insight derived from analyzing `train_2` is that the fill directionality is relative to the main boundary structure.\n*   If a seed's row is *within* the boundary's row span, the fill proceeds horizontally outwards (left and right) until the boundary is hit.\n*   If a seed's row is *outside* the boundary's row span, the fill proceeds vertically *only towards* the boundary's row span until the boundary is hit. That is, if the seed is below the boundary rows, fill only upwards; if the seed is above, fill only downwards.\n\nThe stopping condition remains the same: the fill stops upon encountering a pixel that is part of the largest connected component of yellow pixels (the main boundary) or the grid edge. Other yellow pixels not part of this main component do not stop the fill.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics gathered for the examples:\n\n*   **`train_1`**:\n    *   Grid Shape: 10x10\n    *   Main Yellow Boundary: Size=28, Row Span=[2, 8]\n    *   Seed Coordinates: [(5, 0)]\n    *   Seed (5, 0): Row 5 is within [2, 8] -> Horizontal Fill.\n\n*   **`train_2`**:\n    *   Grid Shape: 12x14\n    *   Main Yellow Boundary: Size=27, Row Span=[1, 8] (Note: the internal yellow line at row 8, cols 4-8 is *not* part of the largest component).\n    *   Seed Coordinates: [(10, 3), (11, 9)]\n    *   Seed (10, 3): Row 10 > 8 -> Vertical Fill, Position=Below. Fill direction should be UP only.\n    *   Seed (11, 9): Row 11 > 8 -> Vertical Fill, Position=Below. Fill direction should be UP only.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
