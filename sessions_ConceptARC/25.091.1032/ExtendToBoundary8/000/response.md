Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples consist of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors and Objects:**
    *   The grids contain a background color (white, 0).
    *   There is a larger, hollow rectangular "frame" object made of a single color (green/3 in `train_1`, blue/1 in `train_2`). This frame remains identical in the output.
    *   Inside the area enclosed by the frame, there is initially a single, isolated "seed" pixel of a different color (yellow/4 in `train_1`, magenta/6 in `train_2`).
3.  **Transformation:** The primary change occurs within the area enclosed by the frame.
    *   The original seed pixel remains in its position in the output.
    *   Two lines are drawn using the color of the seed pixel:
        *   A vertical line along the column of the seed pixel.
        *   A horizontal line along the row of the seed pixel.
    *   These lines extend outwards from the seed pixel until they reach the inner boundary of the frame object. The lines fill the background pixels (white/0) within the frame along the seed pixel's row and column, but do not overwrite the frame pixels themselves.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Draw horizontal and vertical lines extending from a single 'seed' pixel within a 'frame', stopping at the frame's boundaries.

elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
      - pixels: 2D array of integers (colors)

  - object: frame

    attributes:
      - color: integer (e.g., 3 for green, 1 for blue)
      - pixels: list of coordinates [(row, col), ...] forming the frame
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) defining the inner boundary

  - object: seed_pixel
    description: A single pixel of a distinct color located inside the frame area.
    attributes:
      - color: integer (e.g., 4 for yellow, 6 for magenta)
      - location: (row, col)

  - object: background
    description: The color filling the area inside the frame, excluding the seed pixel initially.
    attributes:
      - color: integer (typically 0 for white)

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: seed_pixel
    object: frame
    details: The seed pixel's location is within the rows and columns defined by the frame's inner boundary.
  - type: boundary
    subject: frame
    object: drawn_lines
    details: The horizontal and vertical lines drawn from the seed pixel extend up to, but do not include, the frame pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Find the largest connected component that is not the background color (0) and determine its color and bounding box.
  - action: identify_seed_pixel
    description: Find the single pixel inside the frame's bounding box that is neither the frame color nor the background color. Note its color and location.
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
  - action: draw_lines
    description: Modify the output grid by drawing lines.
    details:
      - Draw a vertical line using the seed_pixel's color in the seed_pixel's column, extending from the row just below the top frame boundary to the row just above the bottom frame boundary.
      - Draw a horizontal line using the seed_pixel's color in the seed_pixel's row, extending from the column just right of the left frame boundary to the column just left of the right frame boundary.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify the largest connected object that isn't the background color (white/0); this is the 'frame'. Determine the frame's color and its inner boundaries (the minimum/maximum row/column that are *inside* the frame).
3.  Locate the single 'seed' pixel within the inner boundaries of the frame. This pixel will have a color different from both the background and the frame. Note the seed pixel's color and its coordinates (row, column).
4.  Using the seed pixel's color, fill in pixels in the output grid to draw a vertical line along the seed pixel's column. This line should extend from the row immediately inside the top frame boundary down to the row immediately inside the bottom frame boundary.
5.  Using the seed pixel's color, fill in pixels in the output grid to draw a horizontal line along the seed pixel's row. This line should extend from the column immediately inside the left frame boundary across to the column immediately inside the right frame boundary.
6.  The final modified grid is the result.
