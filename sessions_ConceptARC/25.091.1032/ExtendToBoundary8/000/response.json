The grid dimensions remain unchanged between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors and Objects:**\n    *   The grids contain a background color (white, 0).\n    *   There is a larger, hollow rectangular \"frame\" object made of a single color (green/3 in `train_1`, blue/1 in `train_2`). This frame remains identical in the output.\n    *   Inside the area enclosed by the frame, there is initially a single, isolated \"seed\" pixel of a different color (yellow/4 in `train_1`, magenta/6 in `train_2`).\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary change occurs within the area enclosed by the frame.\n    *   The original seed pixel remains in its position in the output.\n    *   Two lines are drawn using the color of the seed pixel:\n        *   A vertical line along the column of the seed pixel.\n        *   A horizontal line along the row of the seed pixel.\n    *   These lines extend outwards from the seed pixel until they reach the inner boundary of the frame object. The lines fill the background pixels (white/0) within the frame along the seed pixel's row and column, but do not overwrite the frame pixels themselves.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
