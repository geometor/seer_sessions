task_description: Draw horizontal and vertical lines extending from a single 'seed' pixel within a 'frame', stopping at the frame's boundaries.

elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
      - pixels: 2D array of integers (colors)

  - object: frame
    description: A hollow rectangular object, typically one pixel thick, enclosing an area.
    attributes:
      - color: integer (e.g., 3 for green, 1 for blue)
      - pixels: list of coordinates [(row, col), ...] forming the frame
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) defining the inner boundary

  - object: seed_pixel
    description: A single pixel of a distinct color located inside the frame area.
    attributes:
      - color: integer (e.g., 4 for yellow, 6 for magenta)
      - location: (row, col)

  - object: background
    description: The color filling the area inside the frame, excluding the seed pixel initially.
    attributes:
      - color: integer (typically 0 for white)

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: seed_pixel
    object: frame
    details: The seed pixel's location is within the rows and columns defined by the frame's inner boundary.
  - type: boundary
    subject: frame
    object: drawn_lines
    details: The horizontal and vertical lines drawn from the seed pixel extend up to, but do not include, the frame pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_frame
    description: Find the largest connected component that is not the background color (0) and determine its color and bounding box.
  - action: identify_seed_pixel
    description: Find the single pixel inside the frame's bounding box that is neither the frame color nor the background color. Note its color and location.
  - action: copy_grid
    description: Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
  - action: draw_lines
    description: Modify the output grid by drawing lines.
    details:
      - Draw a vertical line using the seed_pixel's color in the seed_pixel's column, extending from the row just below the top frame boundary to the row just above the bottom frame boundary.
      - Draw a horizontal line using the seed_pixel's color in the seed_pixel's row, extending from the column just right of the left frame boundary to the column just left of the right frame boundary.
