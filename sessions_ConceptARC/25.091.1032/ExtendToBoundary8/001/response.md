"""
Identifies a rectangular frame and a single 'seed' pixel within it.
Draws horizontal and vertical lines extending from the seed pixel, using the seed pixel's color.
These lines fill the pixels within the frame along the seed's row and column,
extending up to, but not overwriting, the frame boundaries themselves.

    Identifies the frame, its inner boundaries, the seed pixel color, and its location.
