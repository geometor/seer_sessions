task_description: "Draw two diagonal lines (an 'X' shape) passing through a single given pixel."
grid_properties:
  size_relation: "Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid."
objects:
  - object_name: "marker_pixel"
    description: "The single non-white pixel in the input grid."
    properties:
      color: "orange (7)"
      count: 1
      location: "Variable, defines the center of the output pattern."
  - object_name: "background"
    description: "The uniform background color."
    properties:
      color: "white (0)"
  - object_name: "diagonal_pattern"
    description: "The pattern drawn in the output grid."
    properties:
      shape: "Two intersecting diagonal lines ('X' shape)."
      color: "orange (7)"
      center: "Located at the position of the input marker_pixel."
      extent: "Lines extend from the center to the grid boundaries."
relationships:
  - relation: "identity"
    objects: ["marker_pixel"]
    description: "The marker_pixel from the input is preserved at the same location in the output grid."
  - relation: "generation"
    objects: ["marker_pixel", "diagonal_pattern"]
    description: "The location of the marker_pixel determines the center and placement of the diagonal_pattern in the output grid."
    rule: "A pixel at (row, col) is part of the diagonal_pattern if its coordinates relative to the marker_pixel's coordinates (center_row, center_col) satisfy either (row - center_row) == (col - center_col) OR (row - center_row) == -(col - center_col)."
