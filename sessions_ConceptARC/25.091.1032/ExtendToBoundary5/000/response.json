The rest of the grid is white (value 0). The size of the input grid varies across examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input grid. It contains the original orange pixel from the input, plus several additional orange pixels. The remaining pixels are white.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The added orange pixels in the output grid form a distinct pattern relative to the original orange pixel. They lie along the two main diagonal lines that intersect at the position of the original orange pixel. These diagonals extend outwards from the center point (the original pixel) to the edges of the grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If either Condition 1 or Condition 2 is true for the cell (`r`, `c`), set the color of that cell in the output grid to orange.\n6.  After checking all cells, the resulting output grid is complete."
