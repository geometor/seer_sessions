task_elements:
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      role: occupies the area outside frames.
  - frames:
      description: Hollow rectangular shapes made of a single, non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: varies (green, yellow, magenta, orange, etc.)
        - shape: hollow rectangle
        - count: one or more per grid
        - relationship: Can be nested.
      role: Define boundaries or containers.
  - seed_pixel:
      description: A single pixel located inside the innermost frame, distinguished by having a unique color count of 1 within the grid (excluding background).
      properties:
        - color: unique, different from background and frame colors (red, blue, azure in examples).
        - count: exactly one per grid.
        - location: (seed_row, seed_col) within the vertical and horizontal bounds of the innermost frame.
      role: Determines the column to modify and the fill color.
  - innermost_frame:
      description: The frame object that most tightly encloses the seed_pixel. Its relevant parts are the pixels directly above and below the seed_pixel in the same column.
      properties:
        - top_boundary_pixel: The non-background pixel found by searching upwards from (seed_row - 1, seed_col). Its row is top_boundary_row.
        - bottom_boundary_pixel: The non-background pixel found by searching downwards from (seed_row + 1, seed_col). Its row is bottom_boundary_row.
      role: Defines the vertical boundaries for the fill operation.

transformation:
  - action: copy_input
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: output_grid
  - action: identify_seed_pixel
    inputs: input_grid
    description: Find the pixel (seed_row, seed_col) with a color that appears exactly once (excluding background color 0). Record its color (seed_color).
    outputs: seed_row, seed_col, seed_color
  - action: find_vertical_boundaries
    inputs: input_grid, seed_row, seed_col
    description: >
      Search upwards from (seed_row - 1, seed_col) to find the first non-background pixel; record its row as top_boundary_row.
      Search downwards from (seed_row + 1, seed_col) to find the first non-background pixel; record its row as bottom_boundary_row.
    outputs: top_boundary_row, bottom_boundary_row
  - action: fill_column_segment
    inputs: output_grid, seed_col, top_boundary_row, bottom_boundary_row, seed_color
    description: >
      Iterate through rows from top_boundary_row + 1 up to (but not including) bottom_boundary_row.
      For each row 'r' in this range, set the pixel color at (r, seed_col) in the output_grid to seed_color.
    outputs: modified_output_grid

output_grid:
  description: A copy of the input grid where the column containing the seed pixel has been partially filled.
  properties:
    - Identical to the input grid except for the filled column segment.
    - The filled segment uses the seed_color.
    - The filled segment is in the column seed_col.
    - The filled segment starts at row top_boundary_row + 1 and ends at row bottom_boundary_row - 1 (inclusive).
