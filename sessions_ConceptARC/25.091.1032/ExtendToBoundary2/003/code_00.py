def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by identifying a single 'seed' pixel within one or more nested rectangular frames. 
    It then fills the column containing the seed pixel with the seed pixel's color. 
    The vertical extent of the fill is determined by the innermost frame enclosing the seed pixel and a comparison between the seed color and the top boundary color.

    1. Create a copy of the input grid.
    2. Identify the background color (assumed 0/white).
    3. Find the unique 'seed' pixel (non-background color appearing only once) and record its color and location.
    4. Find the top boundary pixel of the innermost frame directly above the seed pixel in the same column. Record its row and color.
    5. Find the bottom boundary pixel of the innermost frame directly below the seed pixel in the same column. Record its row.
    6. Determine the starting row for the fill: 
       - If the seed pixel's color value is greater than the top boundary pixel's color value, start filling from the top boundary row.
       - Otherwise, start filling from the row immediately below the top boundary row.
    7. The fill ends at the bottom boundary row (inclusive).
    8. Fill the segment of the seed pixel's column between the calculated start and end rows (inclusive) with the seed pixel's color.
    9. Return the modified grid.
