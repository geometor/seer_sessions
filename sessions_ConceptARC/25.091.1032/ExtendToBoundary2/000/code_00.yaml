task_elements:
  - background:
      color: white (0)
      role: occupies most of the grid area
  - frames:
      description: Hollow rectangular shapes made of a single, non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: varies (green, yellow, magenta, orange in examples)
        - shape: hollow rectangle
        - count: one or more per grid
        - relationship: Can be nested inside one another.
      role: Define boundaries or containers.
  - seed_pixel:
      description: A single pixel located inside the innermost frame.
      properties:
        - color: unique, different from background and frame colors (red, blue, azure in examples)
        - count: exactly one per grid
        - location: within the vertical and horizontal bounds of the innermost frame.
      role: Acts as the source color and determines the column to be modified.
  - innermost_frame:
      description: The frame object that directly encloses the seed_pixel. If only one frame exists, it is the innermost frame.
      role: Defines the vertical extent for the fill operation.

  - action: identify_target_column
    inputs: seed_pixel_location
    outputs: column_index
  - action: determine_vertical_bounds
    inputs: innermost_frame_object, column_index
    outputs: top_row_index, bottom_row_index (indices of the frame's pixels in the target column)
  - action: fill_column_segment
    inputs: output_grid_copy, column_index, top_row_index, bottom_row_index, seed_pixel_color
    description: Change the color of pixels in the target column between the top and bottom row indices (inclusive) to the seed_pixel's color.
    outputs: modified_output_grid

output_grid:
  description: A copy of the input grid where a specific column segment has been filled.
  properties:
    - Identical to the input grid except for the filled column segment.
    - The filled segment uses the color of the input's seed_pixel.
    - The filled segment is located in the same column as the input's seed_pixel.
    - The vertical extent of the filled segment is determined by the top and bottom edges of the innermost frame at that specific column.
