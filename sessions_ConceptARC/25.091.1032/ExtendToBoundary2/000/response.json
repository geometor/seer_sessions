Inside the innermost frame, there is a single pixel of a distinct color (the 'seed' pixel). The frames themselves may be nested.\n\nThe transformation observed in the output grids is that the column containing the unique 'seed' pixel is filled with the color of that seed pixel. However, this filling action is constrained vertically. The fill starts at the top edge and ends at the bottom edge of the *innermost* frame that contains the seed pixel. All other elements, including the frames and the background outside the filled segment, remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
