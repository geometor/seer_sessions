def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by identifying a single 'seed' pixel within one or more nested rectangular frames. 
    It then fills the column containing the seed pixel with the seed pixel's color, bounded vertically by the top and bottom edges 
    of the innermost frame enclosing the seed pixel.

    1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2. Identify the background color (assumed to be 0/white).
    3. Find the unique 'seed' pixel: Iterate through the grid to find a pixel whose color appears only once and is not the background color. Record its color and location (row, column).
    4. Determine the vertical boundaries for the fill:
        a. Starting from the row above the seed pixel, move upwards in the same column until a non-background pixel is encountered. This marks the top boundary row.
        b. Starting from the row below the seed pixel, move downwards in the same column until a non-background pixel is encountered. This marks the bottom boundary row. 
        c. These boundary pixels should belong to the innermost frame containing the seed.
    5. Fill the column segment: Modify the output grid by setting the color of all pixels in the seed pixel's column, between the top and bottom boundary rows (inclusive), to the seed pixel's color.
    6. Return the modified output grid.
