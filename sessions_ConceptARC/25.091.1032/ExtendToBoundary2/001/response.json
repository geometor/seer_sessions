Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    2. Identify the background color (assumed to be 0/white).\n    3. Find the unique 'seed' pixel: Iterate through the grid to find a pixel whose color appears only once and is not the background color. Record its color and location (row, column).\n    4. Determine the vertical boundaries for the fill:\n        a. Starting from the row above the seed pixel, move upwards in the same column until a non-background pixel is encountered. This marks the top boundary row.\n        b. Starting from the row below the seed pixel, move downwards in the same column until a non-background pixel is encountered. This marks the bottom boundary row. \n        c. These boundary pixels should belong to the innermost frame containing the seed.\n    5. Fill the column segment: Modify the output grid by setting the color of all pixels in the seed pixel's column, between the top and bottom boundary rows (inclusive), to the seed pixel's color.\n    6.
