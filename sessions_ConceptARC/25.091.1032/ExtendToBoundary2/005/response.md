"""
Transforms the input grid by:
1. Identifying a unique 'seed' pixel (color count = 1, excluding background 0).
2. Finding the vertical boundaries of the innermost frame containing the seed pixel by searching upwards and downwards in the seed pixel's column for the nearest non-background pixels.
3. Filling the segment of the seed pixel's column strictly *between* these top and bottom boundary pixels with the seed pixel's color.
