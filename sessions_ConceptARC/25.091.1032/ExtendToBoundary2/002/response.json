            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples. The core issue was correctly identifying the vertical boundaries of the *innermost* frame containing the seed pixel and applying the fill logic correctly based on those boundaries. The previous code incorrectly identified boundaries (sometimes picking outer frames) and overwrote the frame pixels themselves during the fill operation.\n\nThe refined strategy involves:\n1.  Accurately identifying the unique 'seed' pixel (color and location).\n2.  Correctly finding the top and bottom boundary pixels of the *innermost* frame directly above and below the seed pixel in the same column.\n3.  Comparing the numeric value of the seed pixel's color with the numeric value of the *top* boundary pixel's color.\n4.  Adjusting the starting row of the fill based on this comparison:\n    *   If `seed_color > top_boundary_color`, the fill starts *at* the top boundary row.\n    *   If `seed_color <= top_boundary_color`, the fill starts at the row *below* the top boundary row.\n5.  The fill always ends *at* the bottom boundary row (inclusive).\n6.  Filling the identified column segment with the seed pixel's color.\n\nThis revised approach correctly accounts for the variations observed across the three examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
