Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct, non-overlapping objects composed of a single non-white color. These objects appear to be hollow rectangular shapes. The output grids maintain the exact same structure and dimensions as the input grids. The only change observed is the color of the pixels that constitute the objects. The background pixels remain unchanged (white).

The transformation rule seems to depend solely on the original color of the object's pixels. We can observe the following color changes across the examples:

*   **Example 1:** Green (3) pixels become Yellow (4).
*   **Example 2:** Blue (1) pixels and Magenta (6) pixels both become Gray (5).
*   **Example 3:** Red (2) pixels become Yellow (4).
*   **Example 4:** Azure (8) pixels and Orange (7) pixels both become Gray (5).

Synthesizing these observations, the rule appears to be:
*   If an input pixel is Green (3) or Red (2), its corresponding output pixel is Yellow (4).
*   If an input pixel is Blue (1), Magenta (6), Orange (7), or Azure (8), its corresponding output pixel is Gray (5).
*   If an input pixel is White (0), its corresponding output pixel remains White (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - GridSize: Constant (Input and Output grids have the same dimensions).
  - BackgroundColor: White (0), remains unchanged.
Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - Shape: Often hollow rectangles, but the rule applies pixel-wise.
  - Relationship: Non-overlapping in the examples provided.
Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise color replacement based on input color.
  - RuleMapping:
    - InputColor [Green (3), Red (2)] -> OutputColor Yellow (4)
    - InputColor [Blue (1), Magenta (6), Orange (7), Azure (8)] -> OutputColor Gray (5)
    - InputColor White (0) -> OutputColor White (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current pixel at `[row][col]`:
    *   Get the color value (`input_color`) of the pixel from the input grid.
    *   Determine the corresponding `output_color` based on the following conditions:
        *   If `input_color` is Green (3) or Red (2), set `output_color` to Yellow (4).
        *   If `input_color` is Blue (1), Magenta (6), Orange (7), or Azure (8), set `output_color` to Gray (5).
        *   Otherwise (if `input_color` is White (0)), set `output_color` to White (0).
    *   Set the pixel at `[row][col]` in the output grid to the determined `output_color`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
