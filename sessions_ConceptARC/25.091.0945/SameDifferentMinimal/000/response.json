These objects appear to be hollow rectangular shapes. The output grids maintain the exact same structure and dimensions as the input grids. The only change observed is the color of the pixels that constitute the objects. The background pixels remain unchanged (white).\n\nThe transformation rule seems to depend solely on the original color of the object's pixels. We can observe the following color changes across the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Green (3) pixels become Yellow (4).\n*   **Example 2:** Blue (1) pixels and Magenta (6) pixels both become Gray (5).\n*   **Example 3:** Red (2) pixels become Yellow (4).\n*   **Example 4:** Azure (8) pixels and Orange (7) pixels both become Gray (5).\n\nSynthesizing these observations, the rule appears to be:\n*   If an input pixel is Green (3) or Red (2), its corresponding output pixel is Yellow (4).\n*   If an input pixel is Blue (1), Magenta (6), Orange (7), or Azure (8), its corresponding output pixel is Gray (5).\n*   If an input pixel is White (0), its corresponding output pixel remains White (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
