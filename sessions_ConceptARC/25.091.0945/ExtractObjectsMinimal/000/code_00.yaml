  elements:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        background_color: white (0)
        contains_object: true
    - type: object
      properties:
        color: non-white (e.g., yellow(4), magenta(6))
        contiguity: contiguous
        count: 1
        location: embedded within the white background
- description: Output grid analysis
  elements:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        size: minimal bounding box of the input object
        content: identical to the input object pixels
        background_color: none (or only pixels that were part of the object)
- description: Transformation rule
  action: crop
  input: input grid
  output: output grid
  steps:
    - Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
    - Determine the minimum and maximum row indices (top, bottom) and column indices (left, right) containing these non-white pixels. This defines the bounding box.
    - Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.
  result: The extracted subgrid is the output grid.
