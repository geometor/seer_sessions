task_context:
  grid_size: ثابت (8x8 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  num_examples: 2

identified_objects:
  - object_type: Frame
    description: A large, often U-shaped or enclosing object.
    properties:
      - color: (Red(2) in ex1, Magenta(6) in ex2)
      - forms_boundary: True
  - object_type: InnerObject
    description: An object adjacent to the Frame, often partially within its concave area.
    properties:
      - color: (Green(3) in ex1, Orange(7) in ex2)
      - position: Adjacent to Frame object
      - count: Can be one or more parts (ex1 has two green parts, ex2 has one orange part)

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: Pixels of the Frame object are adjacent (4-connectivity) to pixels of the InnerObject. This adjacency is the site of interaction.

transformation_properties:
  - type: Conditional Color Change
    description: The color change rule depends on the color of the InnerObject.
    condition: InnerObject color == Green(3)
    rule_if_true: Certain Frame pixels adjacent to the InnerObject change color to Green(3).
    rule_if_false: Certain InnerObject pixels adjacent to the Frame change color to the Frame's color.
  - type: Locality
    description: Changes only occur at or near the boundary pixels involved in the adjacency relationship.
  - type: Frame Integrity (Partial)
    description: The Frame object mostly retains its shape and color, except when the InnerObject is Green(3).
  - type: Inner Object Integrity (Partial)
    description: The InnerObject mostly retains its shape and color, except when it's not Green(3) and adjacent to the Frame.

example_specific_details:
  - example: train_1
    frame_color: Red(2)
    inner_color: Green(3)
    action: Change adjacent Frame pixels (Red 2) to Inner color (Green 3).
    affected_pixels: Specific pixels on the 'bottom' edge of the U-frame change.
  - example: train_2
    frame_color: Magenta(6)
    inner_color: Orange(7)
    action: Change adjacent Inner pixels (Orange 7) to Frame color (Magenta 6).
    affected_pixels: Specific Orange pixels touching the Magenta frame change.
