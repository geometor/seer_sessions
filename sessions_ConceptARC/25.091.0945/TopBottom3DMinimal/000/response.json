            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples operate on 8x8 grids. The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Key Objects:** In both inputs, there are two primary non-background objects:\n    *   A larger object that forms a kind of 'U' shape or frame, open on one side (left in example 1, top in example 2). Let's call this the \"Frame Object\".\n    *   One or more other distinct objects located partially inside or adjacent to the opening/cavity of the Frame Object. Let's call these \"Inner Objects\".\n3.  **Interaction:** The transformation clearly involves an interaction between the Frame Object and the Inner Object(s) where they are adjacent or nearly adjacent. The output grid shows modifications primarily at the boundary between these objects.\n4.  **Color Dependency:** The nature of the modification seems to depend crucially on the color of the Inner Object.\n    *   In `train_1`, the Frame is Red(2) and the Inner Object is Green(3). The output shows some pixels of the *Frame* changing color to match the *Inner* object (Red -> Green).\n    *   In `train_2`, the Frame is Magenta(6) and the Inner Object is Orange(7). The output shows some pixels of the *Inner* object changing color to match the *Frame* (Orange -> Magenta).\n5.  **Specific Rule Trigger:** The presence of Green(3) as the Inner Object color in `train_1` appears to trigger a different rule (\"Frame pixels change\") compared to `train_2` where the Inner Object color is Orange(7) (\"Inner pixels change\"). The specific color Green(3) seems to be the deciding factor.\n6.  **Adjacency:** The changes occur only where pixels of the Frame Object and Inner Object(s) are adjacent (sharing a side, i.e., 4-connectivity).\n\n### Facts\n\n"
