            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3, 7x7, 9x9). All input grids consist entirely of 'white' pixels (value 0). The dimensions observed are always odd numbers.\n2.  **Output Grids:** The outputs are nearly identical copies of the input grids. The only difference is the appearance of a single 'red' pixel (value 2).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the placement of a single red pixel onto the initially white grid.\n4.  **Location of Change:** The position of the red pixel seems related to the center of the grid.\n    *   In the 3x3 example, the red pixel is at (1, 1), which is the exact center.\n    *   In the 9x9 example, the red pixel is at (4, 4), which is the exact center.\n    *   In the 7x7 example, the red pixel is at (3, 4). The exact center of a 7x7 grid is (3, 3). The red pixel is one position to the right of the center.\n5.  **Hypothesis:** The primary rule appears to be placing a red pixel at the geometric center of the grid. The geometric center for a grid with height `h` and width `w` (using 0-based indexing) can be calculated as `row = (h - 1) // 2` and `col = (w - 1) // 2`. This rule holds true for the 3x3 and 9x9 examples. The 7x7 example shows a deviation, placing the pixel one column to the right of this calculated center. Given the limited examples, the simplest and most consistent rule derived from the majority of examples is placing the pixel at the geometric center. The 7x7 case might be an exception or indicate a more complex rule not fully determined by these examples alone.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
