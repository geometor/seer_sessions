            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully processed the first example but failed on the subsequent two. The core transformation involves identifying white pixels (color 0) enclosed within non-white objects (\"holes\") and filling them. The failures revealed that not all holes are filled; specifically, only holes comprising 1 or 2 pixels are filled with the surrounding object's color. Larger enclosed white areas remain unchanged.\n\nThe previous code's logic for identifying holes (separating internal white from external white connected to the border) seems sound conceptually, but its implementation failed to correctly apply the filling rule, possibly due to errors in the hole-finding BFS/DFS or the filling step itself. The inconsistent results from the analysis tool further highlight potential implementation issues, but the underlying rule (fill holes of size 1 or 2) is clear from visually comparing inputs and expected outputs.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the algorithm to accurately:\n1.  Distinguish external (border-connected) white pixels from internal (enclosed) white pixels.\n2.  For each distinct internal white region, determine its size (pixel count).\n3.  If an internal region's size is 1 or 2, identify the color of the adjacent non-white pixels (assuming a single enclosing color per hole based on examples) and fill the region's pixels with that color in the output grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Colors | Output Colors | Input Holes (Size, Expected Fill Color, Filled in Output?) | Code Match | Pixels Off (Original Code) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | (8, 8) | (8, 8) | [0, 1] | [0, 1] | Hole 1: (Size 2, Fill 1, Yes) | True | 0 |\n| 2 | (8, 8) | (8, 8) | [0, 6] | [0, 6] | Hole 1: (Size 2, Fill 6, Yes), Hole 2: (Size 18, Fill 6, No) | False | 2 |\n| 3 | (8, 8) | (8, 8) | [0, 3] | [0, 3] | Hole 1: (Size 1, Fill 3, Yes), Hole 2: (Size 1, Fill 3, Yes), Hole 3: (Size 1, Fill 3, Yes) | False | 1 *or* 2 (depending on which holes the original code missed) |\n\n*(Note: Metrics are based on visual inspection and the refined understanding of the task rule, accounting for the size constraint. Pixels Off refers to the discrepancy between the original code's output and the expected output).*\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"

During this search, collect the coordinates of all pixels found in this specific region into a list (`current_hole_pixels`). Mark each found pixel as visited to prevent re-processing.\n    d. While searching, examine the neighbors of the pixels being added to the region. If a neighbor is non-white, record its color as the potential `enclosure_color`.
