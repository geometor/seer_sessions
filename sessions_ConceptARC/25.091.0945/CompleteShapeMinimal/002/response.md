**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly solved the first example but failed on the subsequent two. The failures occurred because the code did not fill all the "holes" (enclosed white areas) in examples 2 and 3.
- In Example 2, the entire 'U' shaped hole was left unfilled.
- In Example 3, one of the two single-pixel holes `(1, 5)` was left unfilled, while the other `(2, 6)` was correctly filled.

The original natural language program correctly identified the core task: filling enclosed white regions. However, the implementation's logic for identifying and processing these regions seems flawed, possibly due to reusing the `visited_external` marker for both border-connected white pixels and pixels processed during hole-filling, leading to incomplete hole detection or filling.

**Strategy:**
1.  Verify the definition of a "hole": A region of white pixels not connected to the grid border via a path of only white pixels.
2.  Verify the fill rule: Holes should be filled with the color of the immediately adjacent non-white pixels. Assume (based on examples) that a hole is always enclosed by a single color.
3.  Refine the algorithm:
    *   Use a first pass (e.g., BFS/DFS starting from all border white pixels) to identify and mark all "external" white pixels.
    *   Use a second pass to iterate through the grid. If an unmarked white pixel is found, initiate a *separate* search (e.g., BFS/DFS) to find *all* connected white pixels belonging to that specific internal hole. During this search, identify the color of the adjacent non-white pixels (the fill color).
    *   Fill all pixels identified as belonging to that hole with the determined fill color. Mark these filled pixels to avoid processing them again.
