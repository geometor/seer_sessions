"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying regions of white pixels (color 0) that are completely enclosed by a single non-white color. 
These enclosed white regions ("holes") are then filled with the color of the surrounding non-white object, *only* if the hole consists of 1 or 2 white pixels. 
White pixels connected to the grid border (external white space) and holes larger than 2 pixels remain unchanged.
