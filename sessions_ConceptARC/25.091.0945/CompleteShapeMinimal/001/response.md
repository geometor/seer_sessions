Transforms the input grid by identifying regions of white pixels (color 0) that are completely enclosed by a single non-white color. 
These enclosed white regions ("holes") are then filled with the color of the surrounding non-white object. 
White pixels connected to the grid border are considered external and remain unchanged.
