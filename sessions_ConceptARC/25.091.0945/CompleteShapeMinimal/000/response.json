These appear as \"holes\" or enclosed empty spaces.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation fills these internal white holes with the color of the object that encloses them.\n6.  **External White Space:** White pixels that are *not* enclosed by the foreground object (i.e., the outer background or gaps that reach the edge) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Identify all white (0) pixels that are connected to the border of the grid. Connectivity is defined by adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. This can be achieved using a flood fill or search algorithm starting from all border white pixels. Mark these connected-to-border white pixels as \"external\".\n3.  Iterate through every pixel of the input grid.\n4.  If a pixel is white (0) and has *not* been marked as \"external\" in step 2, then it is part of an enclosed \"hole\".\n5.  To determine the fill color for this hole pixel, examine its adjacent non-white neighbors in the input grid. Assume all non-white neighbors will have the same color (the color of the enclosing object). Select this neighbor color as the fill color.\n6.  Update the corresponding pixel in the output grid copy with this fill color.\n7.  After checking all pixels, the modified grid copy is the final output."
