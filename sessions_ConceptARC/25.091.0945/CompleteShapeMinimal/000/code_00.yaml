task_description: Fill enclosed white regions within non-white objects with the object's color.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: 8
      - width: 8
      - colors: [0, 1, 6, 3] # White, Blue, Magenta, Green observed in examples

  - element: object
    description: A contiguous region of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., blue, magenta, green).
      - shape: Can be regular (rectangle) or irregular.

  - element: hole
    description: A contiguous region of white (0) pixels completely surrounded by a single non-white object.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0) in the input.
      - location: Inside the boundary of a non-white object.

  - element: background
    description: White (0) pixels not enclosed by any object, typically connected to the grid border.
    properties:
      - color: Always white (0).
      - location: Outside objects or connected to the grid border.

actions:
  - action: identify_holes
    description: Locate regions of white pixels that are enclosed by a non-white object.
    input: input grid
    output: coordinates of pixels belonging to holes

  - action: determine_fill_color
    description: Identify the color of the object surrounding a specific hole.
    input: coordinates of a hole pixel, input grid
    output: fill color (the color of the surrounding object)

  - action: fill_holes
    description: Change the color of pixels identified as holes to the determined fill color.
    input: input grid, identified holes, fill colors
    output: output grid

relationships:
  - relation: enclosure
    description: A non-white object surrounds a region of white pixels. A white pixel is enclosed if it cannot reach the grid boundary by moving only through other white pixels.

transformation_goal: Modify the input grid such that all enclosed white regions (holes) are filled with the color of the object that encloses them.
