            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly solved the first example but failed on the second and third. The failures indicate that the rule \"fill enclosed white regions of size 1 or 2\" is likely correct, but the implementation failed to accurately identify and isolate these regions.\nSpecifically:\n- In Example 2, the code failed to fill the 2-pixel region `{(1, 2), (1, 3)}`. The analysis suggests the BFS algorithm incorrectly merged this small region with the larger adjacent hole, resulting in a combined size > 2, thus preventing the fill.\n- In Example 3, the code filled two 1-pixel holes but missed the one at `(1, 5)`. This likely happened for a similar reason: the BFS exploring one hole might have prematurely marked the starting pixel of another nearby hole as visited, preventing the main loop from initiating a separate BFS for that missed hole.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the hole identification algorithm (BFS) to ensure it only explores contiguous white pixels belonging to a single hole and correctly calculates the size of *that specific hole* before deciding whether to fill it.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the holes in each example:\n"
