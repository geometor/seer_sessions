task_description: Fill small enclosed white regions (holes) within non-white objects.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels (0-9).
    properties:
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8 in examples)

  - element: object
    description: A contiguous region of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The specific non-white color (e.g., 1, 3, 6).

  - element: external_background
    description: White pixels connected (orthogonally) to the grid border.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

  - element: internal_hole
    description: A contiguous region of one or more white pixels completely surrounded (orthogonally) by a single non-white object and not connected to the external_background.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - size: Number of pixels in the contiguous white region.
      - enclosure_color: The color of the surrounding non-white object pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_external_background
    description: Find all white pixels connected to the grid border using BFS/DFS.
    input: input grid
    output: set of coordinates of external background pixels

  - action: identify_internal_holes
    description: Find contiguous regions of white pixels not identified as external_background. Requires iterating through grid cells and performing BFS/DFS for each potential hole start.
    input: input grid, set of external background coordinates
    output: list of internal_hole elements (including their pixels, size, and enclosure_color)

  - action: fill_small_holes
    description: Modify the grid by changing the color of pixels belonging to internal holes that meet the size criteria.
    input: input grid, list of identified internal_holes
    output: output grid (modified copy of input)
    condition: Apply fill only if internal_hole.size is 1 or 2. Fill with internal_hole.enclosure_color.

relationships:
  - relation: enclosure
    description: A non-white object surrounds a region of white pixels orthogonally.
  - relation: connectivity
    description: Pixels are connected if they share an edge (orthogonal adjacency). Used for defining regions (objects, holes, background).
  - relation: size_constraint
    description: The transformation rule depends on the size (pixel count) of the internal_hole.

transformation_goal: Create an output grid where internal holes of size 1 or 2 in the input grid are filled with their respective enclosure_color, while larger holes and the external background remain unchanged.
