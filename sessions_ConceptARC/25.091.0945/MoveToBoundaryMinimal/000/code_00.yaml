task_type: object_movement
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static
  - type: boundary
    description: A solid line (horizontal or vertical) of a single color.
    color: varies (yellow in ex1, green in ex2)
    role: static, acts as a barrier
  - type: mover
    description: A single, isolated pixel.
    color: varies (green in ex1, magenta in ex2)
    role: dynamic, moves towards the boundary
relationships:
  - mover pixel is initially separated from the boundary line by background pixels.
actions:
  - identify: Locate the boundary line.
  - identify: Locate the single mover pixel (distinct color from background and boundary).
  - determine_direction:
      if boundary is vertical:
        movement is horizontal (towards the boundary).
      if boundary is horizontal:
        movement is vertical (towards the boundary).
  - move: Relocate the mover pixel along the determined direction (row or column).
  - stop_condition: The mover pixel stops in the cell immediately adjacent to the boundary line along its path.
output_grid:
  - The background and boundary line remain unchanged from the input.
  - The mover pixel is placed in its final stopped position.
  - The original position of the mover pixel becomes background (white).
