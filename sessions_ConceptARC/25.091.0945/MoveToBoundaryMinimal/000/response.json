The mover pixel does not land *on* the boundary line itself.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the single 'mover' pixel, which has a color distinct from both the background (white) and the boundary line. Record its initial position (row, column) and color.\n3.  Determine the direction of movement:\n    *   If the boundary line is vertical (all its pixels share the same column index), the movement is horizontal towards that column.\n    *   If the boundary line is horizontal (all its pixels share the same row index), the movement is vertical towards that row.\n4.  Determine the target position:\n    *   If moving horizontally towards a vertical boundary at column `C_boundary`: The target position is `(initial_row, C_boundary - 1)` if the mover starts left of the boundary, or `(initial_row, C_boundary + 1)` if the mover starts right of the boundary. (Based on examples, it seems movers start left/below, so it will be `C_boundary - 1` or `R_boundary + 1`).\n    *   If moving vertically towards a horizontal boundary at row `R_boundary`: The target position is `(R_boundary + 1, initial_column)` if the mover starts below the boundary, or `(R_boundary - 1, initial_column)` if the mover starts above the boundary. (Based on examples, it will be `R_boundary + 1`).\n5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n6.  Set the pixel at the mover's initial position to white (0) in the output grid.\n7.  Set the pixel at the calculated target position to the mover's color in the output grid."
