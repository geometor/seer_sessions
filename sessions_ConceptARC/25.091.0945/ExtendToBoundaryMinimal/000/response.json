The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Input Object:** Each input grid contains exactly one non-white pixel. This pixel is always yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extending this single yellow pixel either horizontally across its entire row or vertically down its entire column.\n4.  **Output Object:** The output grid retains the background color, but the single input pixel is replaced by a line (either a row or a column) of the same color (yellow).\n5.  **Decision Logic:** The key seems to be determining *when* to extend horizontally (fill the row) versus vertically (fill the column). Observing the examples:\n    *   If the yellow pixel is in the first column (column index 0), the entire row containing that pixel is filled yellow. (Examples 1 & 4)\n    *   If the yellow pixel is *not* in the first column, the entire column containing that pixel is filled yellow. (Examples 2 & 3)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
