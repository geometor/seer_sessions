Grid Properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Grids contain pixels with color values (0-9).
  - Color 0 (white) typically represents the background.
Objects:
  - Objects are contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - In the examples, objects are colored green (3) or red (2).
Relationships:
  - Objects exist within the grid boundaries.
  - The key relationship is between the location of a pixel and its mirrored location across the vertical centerline of the grid.
Actions:
  - Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - For each non-white pixel at position (row, column) in the input:
    - Calculate its mirrored column index: `mirrored_column = grid_width - 1 - column`.
    - The mirrored position is (row, mirrored_column).
  - Construct the output grid by:
    - Copying all pixels from the input grid.
    - Setting the pixel at each calculated mirrored position (row, mirrored_column) to the color of the original pixel at (row, column).
Symmetry:
  - The transformation creates horizontal symmetry across the vertical center line for the non-white shapes.
