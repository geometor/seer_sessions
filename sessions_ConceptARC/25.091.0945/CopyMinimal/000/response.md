**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid based on a reflection or mirroring operation. In both examples, shapes composed of non-white pixels located in the left half of the input grid are mirrored horizontally across the vertical centerline of the grid. The original shapes remain in their positions in the output grid, and the mirrored copies are added to the right half. The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged unless overwritten by a mirrored shape.

*   **Example 1**: A 2x2 green shape on the left of a 2x5 grid is mirrored to the right side.
*   **Example 2**: A more complex red shape in the left half of a 5x11 grid is mirrored to the right half.

The core operation is horizontal reflection relative to the grid's vertical axis.

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Grids contain pixels with color values (0-9).
  - Color 0 (white) typically represents the background.
Objects:
  - Objects are contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - In the examples, objects are colored green (3) or red (2).
Relationships:
  - Objects exist within the grid boundaries.
  - The key relationship is between the location of a pixel and its mirrored location across the vertical centerline of the grid.
Actions:
  - Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - For each non-white pixel at position (row, column) in the input:
    - Calculate its mirrored column index: `mirrored_column = grid_width - 1 - column`.
    - The mirrored position is (row, mirrored_column).
  - Construct the output grid by:
    - Copying all pixels from the input grid.
    - Setting the pixel at each calculated mirrored position (row, mirrored_column) to the color of the original pixel at (row, column).
Symmetry:
  - The transformation creates horizontal symmetry across the vertical center line for the non-white shapes.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Determine the width of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, column).
4.  If the pixel's color is not white (i.e., its value is not 0):
    a.  Calculate the mirrored column index using the formula: `mirrored_column = grid_width - 1 - column`.
    b.  Update the pixel in the output grid at the position (row, mirrored_column) with the same color as the input pixel at (row, column).
5.  The final output grid contains both the original shapes and their horizontally mirrored copies.
