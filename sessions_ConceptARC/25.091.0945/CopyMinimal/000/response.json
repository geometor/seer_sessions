In both examples, shapes composed of non-white pixels located in the left half of the input grid are mirrored horizontally across the vertical centerline of the grid. The original shapes remain in their positions in the output grid, and the mirrored copies are added to the right half. The background pixels (white, 0) remain unchanged unless overwritten by a mirrored shape.\n\n*   **Example 1**: A 2x2 green shape on the left of a 2x5 grid is mirrored to the right side.\n*   **Example 2**: A more complex red shape in the left half of a 5x11 grid is mirrored to the right half.\n\nThe core operation is horizontal reflection relative to the grid's vertical axis.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
