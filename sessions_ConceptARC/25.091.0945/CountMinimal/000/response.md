Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) with a variable number of red pixels (2) scattered throughout. The output grids are always a single row containing only white pixels (0). The length of the output row appears to directly correspond to the total number of red pixels present in the input grid.

*   In `train_1`, the input has one red pixel, and the output is a 1x1 grid (one white pixel).
*   In `train_2`, the input has two red pixels, and the output is a 1x2 grid (two white pixels).
*   In `train_3`, the input has six red pixels, and the output is a 1x6 grid (six white pixels).

The core operation seems to be counting the occurrences of a specific color (red) in the input and then generating an output grid whose width matches that count, filled entirely with another color (white).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - contains: predominantly white pixels (0)
      - contains: variable number of red pixels (2)
      - size: variable (examples are 6x6, but could differ)
  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - shape: 1 row, N columns (1xN)
      - content: exclusively white pixels (0)
      - relationship_to_input: N equals the total count of red pixels (2) in the input_grid
actions:
  - action: count
    target: red pixels (value 2)
    input: input_grid
    result: integer N (count of red pixels)
  - action: generate
    target: output_grid
    using: count N
    details: create a 1xN grid filled with white pixels (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Count the total number of pixels in the input grid that have the value 2 (red). Let this count be N.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 1 row and N columns.
4.  Fill every cell in the new output grid with the value 0 (white).
5.  Return the generated output grid.
