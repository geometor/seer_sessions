The output grids are always a single row containing only white pixels (0). The length of the output row appears to directly correspond to the total number of red pixels present in the input grid.\n\n*   In `train_1`, the input has one red pixel, and the output is a 1x1 grid (one white pixel).\n*   In `train_2`, the input has two red pixels, and the output is a 1x2 grid (two white pixels).\n*   In `train_3`, the input has six red pixels, and the output is a 1x6 grid (six white pixels).\n\nThe core operation seems to be counting the occurrences of a specific color (red) in the input and then generating an output grid whose width matches that count, filled entirely with another color (white).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
