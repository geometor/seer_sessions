Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task uses grids of pixels with different colors (represented by numbers 0-9). The background color is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form shapes. In the examples, these shapes appear to be straight lines, either horizontal or vertical, or combinations thereof (like the 'L' shape in train_1).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively keeping certain shapes (or parts of shapes) and removing others. Specifically, horizontal lines are retained, while vertical lines are removed (turned into the white background).
4.  **Line Definition:** A "line" seems to be a contiguous segment of pixels of the same non-white color, running either straight horizontally or straight vertically. Based on the examples, these lines appear to be exactly one pixel thick.
5.  **Intersection Handling:** In train_1, an 'L' shape consists of intersecting vertical and horizontal segments. The output shows that the vertical segment is removed, including the pixel at the intersection, while the horizontal segment (excluding the intersection pixel that was part of the removed vertical segment) is kept. This suggests that the removal of vertical lines takes precedence. However, a simpler interpretation that fits all examples is that *only* qualifying horizontal lines are copied to an initially blank output grid.
6.  **Minimum Length:** The lines seem to require a minimum length. Single pixels or isolated groups not forming lines of length >= 2 are not preserved. Let's assume a minimum length of 2 for a line segment to be considered.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Retain only horizontal line segments from the input grid, removing all vertical line segments and other shapes.

definitions:
  - object: line_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - property: orientation
    values: [horizontal, vertical]
  - property: thickness
    description: The dimension perpendicular to the line's direction. For this task, relevant lines appear to be 1 pixel thick.
  - property: length
    description: The number of pixels in the line segment. Minimum relevant length appears to be 2.
  - object: horizontal_line
    isa: line_segment
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal
      - thickness: 1
      - length: ">= 2"
  - object: vertical_line
    isa: line_segment
    properties:
      - orientation: vertical
      - thickness: 1
      - length: ">= 2"
  - background_color: white (0)

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: all horizontal_line objects in the input grid.
  - action: identify
    target: all vertical_line objects in the input grid.
  - action: create_output
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_state: filled with background_color.
  - action: copy
    source: identified horizontal_line objects from input
    destination: corresponding positions in the output grid.
  - rule: Pixels belonging to vertical_line objects or any other configuration (not part of a horizontal_line) are not copied, effectively remaining as the background_color in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all maximal horizontal segments that meet the following criteria:
    *   Composed of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
    *   Have a length of at least 2 pixels.
    *   Have a height (thickness) of exactly 1 pixel (i.e., the pixels directly above and below the segment, if within grid bounds, must not be the same color as the segment).
3.  For every horizontal segment identified in step 2, copy the pixels belonging to that segment (preserving their original color and position) onto the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid. All parts of the input grid that were not identified as qualifying horizontal segments (including vertical lines, single pixels, thicker shapes, and the original background) will remain as the background color in the output grid.
