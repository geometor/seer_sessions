            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task uses grids of pixels with different colors (represented by numbers 0-9). The background color is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form shapes. In the examples, these shapes appear to be straight lines, either horizontal or vertical, or combinations thereof (like the 'L' shape in train_1).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively keeping certain shapes (or parts of shapes) and removing others. Specifically, horizontal lines are retained, while vertical lines are removed (turned into the white background).\n4.  **Line Definition:** A \"line\" seems to be a contiguous segment of pixels of the same non-white color, running either straight horizontally or straight vertically. Based on the examples, these lines appear to be exactly one pixel thick.\n5.  **Intersection Handling:** In train_1, an 'L' shape consists of intersecting vertical and horizontal segments. The output shows that the vertical segment is removed, including the pixel at the intersection, while the horizontal segment (excluding the intersection pixel that was part of the removed vertical segment) is kept. This suggests that the removal of vertical lines takes precedence. However, a simpler interpretation that fits all examples is that *only* qualifying horizontal lines are copied to an initially blank output grid.\n6.  **Minimum Length:** The lines seem to require a minimum length. Single pixels or isolated groups not forming lines of length >= 2 are not preserved. Let's assume a minimum length of 2 for a line segment to be considered.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
