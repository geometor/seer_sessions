task_description: Retain only horizontal line segments from the input grid, removing all vertical line segments and other shapes.

definitions:
  - object: line_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color.
  - property: orientation
    values: [horizontal, vertical]
  - property: thickness
    description: The dimension perpendicular to the line's direction. For this task, relevant lines appear to be 1 pixel thick.
  - property: length
    description: The number of pixels in the line segment. Minimum relevant length appears to be 2.
  - object: horizontal_line
    isa: line_segment
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal
      - thickness: 1
      - length: ">= 2"
  - object: vertical_line
    isa: line_segment
    properties:
      - orientation: vertical
      - thickness: 1
      - length: ">= 2"
  - background_color: white (0)

transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: all horizontal_line objects in the input grid.
  - action: identify
    target: all vertical_line objects in the input grid.
  - action: create_output
    based_on: input grid dimensions
    initial_state: filled with background_color.
  - action: copy
    source: identified horizontal_line objects from input
    destination: corresponding positions in the output grid.
  - rule: Pixels belonging to vertical_line objects or any other configuration (not part of a horizontal_line) are not copied, effectively remaining as the background_color in the output.
