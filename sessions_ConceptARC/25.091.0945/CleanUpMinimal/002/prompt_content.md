Identify the largest contiguous object (non-background color 0) in the input grid based on pixel count.
Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
If a pixel is not part of the largest object and not the background color:
  Check its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) in the original input grid.
  If any neighbor belongs to the largest object, change the pixel's color in the output grid to the largest object's color.
  If no neighbor belongs to the largest object, change the pixel's color in the output grid to the background color (0).
Pixels belonging to the largest object or the background remain unchanged initially.
