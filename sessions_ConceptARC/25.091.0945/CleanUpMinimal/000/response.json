One object is significantly larger than the others. There are also smaller objects or individual pixels of a different color scattered around, some potentially adjacent to or even inside the largest object.\n\nThe output grids retain the largest object from the input but modify the smaller objects/pixels based on their relationship to the largest object. Specifically, smaller pixels adjacent (including diagonally) to the largest object seem to adopt the color of the largest object. Smaller pixels *not* adjacent to the largest object are removed (turned into the white background color).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each object.\n3.  Determine the object with the largest size. If there's a tie, the specific tie-breaking rule isn't clear from these examples, but assume one is chosen consistently (e.g., first encountered). Record the color of this largest object (`C_large`).\n4.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n6.  Let the color of the current input pixel be `C_current`.\n7.  If `C_current` is the background color (white) or `C_current` is equal to `C_large`, proceed to the next pixel (no change needed initially).\n8.  If `C_current` is *not* the background color and *not* `C_large`:\n    a. Examine the 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.\n    b. Check if any of these neighbors have the color `C_large`.\n    c. If at least one neighbor has the color `C_large`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_large`.\n    d. If *none* of the neighbors have the color `C_large`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the background color (white, 0).\n9.  After iterating through all pixels, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
