task_description: Modify pixels based on their adjacency to the single largest non-background object.

definitions:
  background_color: white (0)
  object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-background color. Adjacency includes diagonals.
  largest_object: The object with the greatest number of pixels.

observations:
  - input_grid: Contains multiple objects of different colors on a white background.
  - output_grid: Primarily composed of the largest object from the input grid and the background color.
  - largest_object_persistence: The shape and color of the largest object are mostly preserved in the output.
  - secondary_pixels: Pixels that are not part of the largest object and are not the background color.
  - adjacency_rule:
      condition: A secondary pixel is adjacent (including diagonals) to any pixel of the largest object.
      action: The secondary pixel's color changes to the color of the largest object in the output grid.
  - non_adjacency_rule:
      condition: A secondary pixel is *not* adjacent to any pixel of the largest object.
      action: The secondary pixel's color changes to the background color (white) in the output grid.

examples_analysis:
  - train_1:
      largest_object_color: red (2)
      secondary_pixel_color: yellow (4)
      adjacent_yellow: One yellow pixel at (3, 6) is adjacent to red pixels. It becomes red.
      non_adjacent_yellow: Other yellow pixels are not adjacent to red pixels. They become white.
  - train_2:
      largest_object_color: green (3)
      secondary_pixel_color: magenta (6)
      adjacent_magenta: Magenta pixels at (3,4), (4,5), (6,4) are adjacent to green pixels. They become green.
      non_adjacent_magenta: Other magenta pixels are not adjacent to green pixels. They become white.

general_rule: Identify the largest object. Pixels of other colors are "absorbed" (take the largest object's color) if they touch it, otherwise they are erased (become white).
