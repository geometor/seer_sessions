"""
Identifies all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid, 
considering diagonal adjacency. Determines the object whose topmost pixel 
has the minimum row index (the "highest" object). Creates an output grid 
of the same dimensions containing only this highest object and the original 
background pixels (white, 0). All other pixels are set to white.
