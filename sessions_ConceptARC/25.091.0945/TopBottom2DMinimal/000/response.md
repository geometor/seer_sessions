**Perception:**

The task involves identifying distinct non-white objects within an input grid and selecting one based on its vertical position.

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white colors. In the provided training examples, there are always exactly two such objects.
2.  **Object Identification:** Objects are defined as contiguous areas of the same non-white color. Adjacency includes diagonals.
3.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation identifies all non-white objects in the input. It then determines which object is "highest" in the grid, meaning the object whose topmost pixel has the smallest row index. The output grid retains only this highest object and the original white background pixels. All pixels belonging to other non-white objects are replaced with the background color (white, 0).
4.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. It contains the white background pixels from the input and the pixels corresponding to the highest object identified in the input. All other pixels are set to white (0).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, replacing all non-white pixels with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider diagonally adjacent pixels as connected when defining an object.
3.  For each identified object, determine its topmost row index (the minimum row index among all pixels belonging to that object).
4.  Find the object that has the overall smallest topmost row index. This is the "highest" object. If there's a tie (two objects start on the same highest row), the specific examples don't cover this, but a likely tie-breaker would be the leftmost object or potentially keeping both if they are the same color and effectively part of a larger structure starting at that row. However, based *only* on the examples, we assume there's a unique highest object or the selection method handles ties implicitly (e.g., by processing order). *Correction based on re-evaluating examples*: The examples show distinct objects, implying no ambiguity in selection.
5.  Iterate through the pixels of the identified highest object in the input grid.
6.  For each pixel belonging to the highest object, copy its color and position to the corresponding location in the output grid.
7.  Return the final output grid.
