task_type: object_selection
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_multiple_objects: true
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - shape: variable (line, rectangle, L-shape, cross)
      - contiguity: pixels of the same color are connected (including diagonals)
      - position: defined by row and column indices
      - vertical_extent: defined by min and max row indices
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects have relative vertical positions within the grid.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects
    description: Find all contiguous groups of non-white pixels.
  - action: find_topmost_pixel
    inputs: object
    outputs: min_row_index
    description: Determine the smallest row index occupied by any pixel of the object.
  - action: select_highest_object
    inputs: list_of_objects
    outputs: highest_object
    description: Compare the minimum row indices of all objects and select the one with the overall smallest minimum row index.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - highest_object
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input. Copy the background pixels (white) and the pixels belonging to the highest_object. Set all other pixels to white.
