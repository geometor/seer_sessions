Context:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  Background_Color: white (0).
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  Properties:
    - Color: The specific non-white color of the object's pixels.
    - Pixels: The set of coordinates belonging to the object.
    - Bounding_Box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all the object's pixels.
    - Solidity: A derived property based on the contents of the bounding box.
      - Solid: The bounding box contains *only* pixels belonging to the object.
      - Not_Solid: The bounding box contains at least one pixel that does *not* belong to the object (typically the background color).
Transformation:
  Action: Conditional removal of objects.
  Rule:
    - Identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
    - For each object:
      - Determine its bounding box.
      - Check if the object is Solid (fills its bounding box completely).
      - If the object is Solid, replace all its pixels with the Background_Color (white) in the output grid.
      - If the object is Not_Solid, keep its pixels unchanged in the output grid.
  Output_Grid_Initialization: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid, modified according to the rule.
