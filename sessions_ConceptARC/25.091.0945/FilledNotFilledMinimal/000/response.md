**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels, with values 0-9 representing colors. White (0) acts as the background color.
2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves identifying these non-white objects and deciding whether to keep or remove them based on their shape characteristics.
4.  **Key Characteristic:** The deciding factor appears to be whether an object is "solid" or "hollow/incomplete".
    *   In `train_1`, the green object is a hollow rectangle (frame) and is kept.
    *   In `train_2`, the red object is a solid rectangle and is removed (replaced by the background color).
    *   In `train_3`, there are two yellow objects. One is 'U'-shaped (incomplete/hollow relative to its bounding box) and is kept. The other is a solid square and is removed.
5.  **Rule Definition:** An object is removed if it completely fills its own bounding box. If the object's bounding box contains any background (white) pixels, the object is kept. Removed objects are replaced with the background color (white).

**Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9).
  Background_Color: white (0).
Objects:
  Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  Properties:
    - Color: The specific non-white color of the object's pixels.
    - Pixels: The set of coordinates belonging to the object.
    - Bounding_Box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all the object's pixels.
    - Solidity: A derived property based on the contents of the bounding box.
      - Solid: The bounding box contains *only* pixels belonging to the object.
      - Not_Solid: The bounding box contains at least one pixel that does *not* belong to the object (typically the background color).
Transformation:
  Action: Conditional removal of objects.
  Rule:
    - Identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
    - For each object:
      - Determine its bounding box.
      - Check if the object is Solid (fills its bounding box completely).
      - If the object is Solid, replace all its pixels with the Background_Color (white) in the output grid.
      - If the object is Not_Solid, keep its pixels unchanged in the output grid.
  Output_Grid_Initialization: The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid, modified according to the rule.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each group represents an object.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the object's pixels. These define the object's bounding box.
    b.  Assume the object is "solid" (perfectly fills its bounding box). Set a flag `is_solid` to true.
    c.  Iterate through every pixel coordinate within the object's bounding box (from minimum row/column to maximum row/column, inclusive).
    d.  For each coordinate inside the bounding box, check if the pixel in the *input grid* at that coordinate belongs to the current object.
    e.  If any pixel within the bounding box does *not* belong to the current object (e.g., it's the background color or belongs to a different object), set the `is_solid` flag to false and stop checking pixels for this object's bounding box.
    f.  After checking all pixels within the bounding box (or stopping early if non-object pixel found), if the `is_solid` flag is still true, then iterate through all the pixel coordinates belonging to this object and set their color in the *output grid* to the background color (white, 0).
    g.  If the `is_solid` flag is false, do nothing; the object's pixels remain unchanged in the output grid (as they were copied initially).
4.  Return the final output grid.
