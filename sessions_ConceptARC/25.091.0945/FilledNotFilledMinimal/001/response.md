"""
Identifies all contiguous non-white objects in the input grid. 
For each object, determines its bounding box.
Checks if the object perfectly fills its bounding box (is "solid").
If an object is solid, all its pixels in the output grid are set to the background color (white, 0).
If an object is not solid (its bounding box contains background pixels or pixels of other objects), 
its pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
