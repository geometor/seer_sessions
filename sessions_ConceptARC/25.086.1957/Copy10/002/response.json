The yellow diamond is broken into many 1-pixel objects, which is unexpected but shouldn't break the logic as long as one of them is identified as the container. Wait - `find_objects` uses 4-way connectivity. The yellow diamond *is* contiguous via diagonals. Let me check the `find_objects` BFS neighbours.\n    "

It's found as 12 separate 1-pixel objects.\n    This is the root cause. Since the yellow diamond is not found as a single object, the `check_containment` function is never called with the *intended* container (the whole diamond). It might be called with one of the single yellow pixels as the container candidate, which would fail the bounding box check or the flood fill check.\n\n    The task requires understanding adjacency, and often 8-way (including diagonals) is needed. Let's modify `find_objects` to use 8-way connectivity.\n\n    Hypothesis Update: The `find_objects` function should use 8-way connectivity to correctly identify objects like the yellow diamond in Example 2.\n\nLet's re-run the object finding with 8-way connectivity.\n"
