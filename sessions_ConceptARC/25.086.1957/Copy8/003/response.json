Identifies a central vertical block of columns composed entirely of the\n   background color (0). This block defines the axis of symmetry. It prioritizes\n   blocks not touching the grid edges (column 0 or width-1).\n2. Calculates the reflection axis coordinate based on the start and end\n   indices of this central separator block.\n3. Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4. Iterates through each pixel (r, c) to the *left* of the central separator block\n   in the input grid.\n5. If the pixel's color is not background (0), calculates its reflected column\n   position c_reflected using the formula round(2 * axis - c).\n6. If c_reflected is a valid column index within the grid, updates the pixel at \n   (r, c_reflected) in the output grid with the color from the input pixel (r, c). \n   Existing pixels (including non-background ones from the original input) at \n   the target location are overwritten by the reflection.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_contiguous_blocks(indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks in a sorted list of indices.\n    E.g., [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7] -> [[0, 1], [3, 4, 5], [7]]\n    \"\"\"\n    if not indices:\n        return []\n    blocks = []\n    current_block = [indices[0]]\n    for i in range(1, len(indices)):\n        if indices[i] == indices[i-1] + 1:\n            current_block.append(indices[i])\n        else:\n            blocks.append(current_block)\n            current_block = [indices[i]]\n    blocks.append(current_block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef find_central_separator_indices(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start and end column indices of the central vertical separator block.\n    A separator column consists entirely of the background color (0).\n    The central block is prioritized as one not touching the grid edges (col 0 or width-1).\n    If only edge blocks exist, and there's only one block total, that block is returned\n    (e.g., a single column separator in a 3-wide grid).\n    Returns a tuple (start_col, end_col) or None if no suitable block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_rows, num_cols = grid.shape\n    # Need at least 3 columns for a non-edge separator, or 1 column for an edge-case single separator.\n    if num_cols < 1: \n        return None\n\n    # Find all column indices that consist entirely of the background color (0)\n    all_sep_cols = [c for c in range(num_cols) if np.all(grid[:, c] == 0)]\n    if not all_sep_cols:\n        # No separator columns found at all\n        return None\n\n    # Identify contiguous blocks of separator columns\n    blocks = find_contiguous_blocks(sorted(all_sep_cols))\n\n    # Filter blocks: Keep only blocks that do NOT contain column 0 AND do NOT contain column num_cols - 1\n    central_blocks = []\n    for block in blocks:\n        touches_left_edge = (block[0] == 0)\n        touches_right_edge = (block[-1] == num_cols - 1)\n        if not touches_left_edge and not touches_right_edge:\n            central_blocks.append(block)\n\n    # If one or more non-edge blocks were found, choose the first one (assuming only one truly central block exists per task rule)\n    if central_blocks:\n        chosen_block = central_blocks[0] \n        return (chosen_block[0], chosen_block[-1])\n\n    # If NO non-edge blocks were found, check if there was exactly one block overall.\n    # This handles cases like [[1, 0, 1]] where the only separator is central by definition.\n    if not central_blocks and len(blocks) == 1:\n         chosen_block = blocks[0]\n         # Return this single block's indices\n         return (chosen_block[0], chosen_block[-1])\n\n    # Otherwise (e.g., multiple blocks, all touching edges, or no separators) return None\n    return None\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    num_rows, num_cols = input_arr.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.\n    # Reflection will overwrite pixels on this copy.\n    output_arr = np.copy(input_arr)\n\n    # Find the start and end indices of the central separator block\n    separator_info = find_central_separator_indices(input_arr)\n\n    # If no suitable central separator block is found, return the original grid unchanged.\n    if separator_info is None:\n        return input_grid \n\n    s_start, s_end = separator_info\n\n    # Calculate the vertical reflection axis (can be fractional if separator width is even)\n    axis_col = (s_start + s_end) / 2.0\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        # Iterate through each column strictly to the *left* of the separator block\n        for c in range(s_start): \n            color = input_arr[r, c]\n\n            # Only reflect non-background pixels\n            if color != 0:\n                # Calculate the reflected column index using the axis.\n                # Round to nearest integer for the grid index.\n                c_reflected = round(2 * axis_col - c)\n\n                # Check if the calculated reflected column index is valid (within grid bounds)\n                if 0 <= c_reflected < num_cols:\n                    # Update the output grid at the reflected position with the color\n                    # from the left side.
