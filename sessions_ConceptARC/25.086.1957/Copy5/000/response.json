            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.\n2.  **Key Color:** The blue pixels (color 1) seem crucial. They appear in the input but not the output (except maybe implicitly replaced by white).\n3.  **Repetition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by repeating a portion of the input grid.\n4.  **Control Signal (Blue Pixels):**\n    *   The *number* of blue pixels (N) seems to control *how many times* a pattern is repeated.\n    *   The *arrangement* (aligned in a row vs. aligned in a column) seems to control the *direction* of repetition (horizontal vs. vertical).\n    *   The *location* (specifically, the first row or column containing a blue pixel) seems to define *which part* of the input grid constitutes the pattern to be repeated.\n5.  **Pattern Unit:** The pattern unit is the section of the input grid *before* the row or column where the blue pixels start.\n6.  **Separator:** When repeating the pattern unit, a single line (row or column) of white pixels (color 0) is inserted between the repetitions.\n7.  **Repetition Count:** The pattern unit is repeated N+1 times, where N is the count of blue pixels. The separator is inserted N times between these units.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** One blue pixel at (0, 4). N=1. Aligned horizontally (implicitly). Minimum column is 4. Unit is columns 0-3. Separator is a white column. Output is Unit + Separator + Unit (1+1=2 units).\n*   **Example 2:** Two blue pixels at (0, 3) and (0, 4). N=2. Aligned horizontally (row 0). Minimum column is 3. Unit is columns 0-2. Separator is a white column. Output is Unit + Separator + Unit + Separator + Unit (2+1=3 units).\n*   **Example 3:** Three blue pixels at (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0). N=3. Aligned vertically (column 0). Minimum row is 3. Unit is rows 0-2. Separator is a white row. Output is Unit + Separator + Unit + Separator + Unit + Separator + Unit (3+1=4 units).\n\nThis pattern holds consistently.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If `N` is 0, the output is likely the same as the input (though this case isn't shown, it's a reasonable assumption).\n3.  Determine if all blue pixels lie in the same row or the same column.\n    *   If they are in the same row, the repetition direction is 'horizontal'. Find the minimum column index `c_min` among all blue pixels.\n    *   If they are in the same column, the repetition direction is 'vertical'. Find the minimum row index `r_min` among all blue pixels.\n    *   (Assume one of these conditions will always be met if `N` > 0).\n4.  Extract the `pattern_unit` from the input grid:\n    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the `pattern_unit` consists of all columns from index 0 up to (but not including) `c_min`.\n    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the `pattern_unit` consists of all rows from index 0 up to (but not including) `r_min`.\n5.  Create a `separator`:\n    *   If the direction is 'horizontal', the `separator` is a single column of white pixels (0) with the same height as the `pattern_unit`.\n    *   If the direction is 'vertical', the `separator` is a single row of white pixels (0) with the same width as the `pattern_unit`.\n6.  Construct the output grid by repeatedly concatenating the `pattern_unit` and the `separator` according to the direction:\n    *   Append the `pattern_unit` to the initially empty output grid.\n    *   Repeat `N` times: Append the `separator`, then append the `pattern_unit`.\n    *   Concatenation should be done horizontally or vertically based on the determined direction."
