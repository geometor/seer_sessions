Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples contain two distinct, non-background (white) colored shapes separated by background color.
    *   One shape appears in the upper-left quadrant. In `train_1`, it's a red cross with a yellow center. In `train_2`, it's a magenta and blue flower-like shape. Let's call this the "Pattern Shape".
    *   The other shape appears in the lower-right quadrant. In both examples, it's a hollow rectangle made of azure pixels (color 8), enclosing a rectangular area of background (white) pixels. Let's call this the "Frame Shape".
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains both the Pattern Shape in its original position and the Frame Shape. The key difference is that the white, empty rectangular area inside the Frame Shape is now filled with a copy of the Pattern Shape.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying the Pattern Shape and the empty space (hole) within the Frame Shape, and then copying the Pattern Shape into that hole. The alignment appears to be top-left corner to top-left corner; the Pattern Shape is placed starting at the top-left pixel of the hole. The original Pattern Shape remains untouched.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify two distinct non-background objects. One is a 'pattern' and the other is an 'azure frame' containing a background-colored 'hole'. Copy the 'pattern' object into the 'hole' within the 'azure frame'.

elements:
  - object: Pattern Shape
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels, not constituting the Azure Frame. Its color and specific shape vary between examples.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (red/yellow in train_1, magenta/blue in train_2)
      - shape: Varies (cross in train_1, flower-like in train_2)
      - location: Typically in the upper-left area in examples, separated from the Frame Shape.
  - object: Frame Shape
    description: A rectangular frame made of a single color (azure).
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8)
      - shape: Hollow rectangle
      - location: Typically in the lower-right area in examples.
      - contains: Hole Object
  - object: Hole Object
    description: A rectangular area within the Frame Shape filled with the background color.
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - shape: Rectangle
      - location: Fully enclosed by the Frame Shape.
      - relationship: Target location for the copied Pattern Shape.
  - object: Background
    description: The surrounding area of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: White (0)

actions:
  - action: Identify Objects
    inputs:
      - Input Grid
    outputs:
      - Pattern Shape
      - Frame Shape
      - Hole Object (derived from Frame Shape)
    description: Locate the distinct non-background shapes and identify the hole within the azure frame.
  - action: Extract Pattern
    inputs:
      - Pattern Shape
    outputs:
      - Pattern Data (pixels and relative positions within its bounding box)
    description: Get the pixel data of the Pattern Shape.
  - action: Locate Hole
    inputs:
      - Frame Shape
      - Hole Object
    outputs:
      - Hole Coordinates (top-left corner, dimensions)
    description: Determine the position and size of the rectangular background area inside the Frame Shape.
  - action: Copy and Paste
    inputs:
      - Input Grid
      - Pattern Data
      - Hole Coordinates
    outputs:
      - Output Grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Place the extracted Pattern Data onto the grid, starting at the top-left corner of the Hole Coordinates, overwriting the background pixels within the hole.

relationships:
  - The Frame Shape encloses the Hole Object.
  - The Pattern Shape is copied *into* the Hole Object's location in the output.
  - The original Pattern Shape and Frame Shape persist in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  Identify the "Frame Object": This is the object composed entirely of azure (color 8) pixels and which contains a fully enclosed rectangular region of white (color 0) pixels (the "Hole").
4.  Identify the "Pattern Object": This is the other distinct non-white object found in step 2 (i.e., the one that is *not* the Frame Object).
5.  Determine the bounding box of the Pattern Object. Extract the pixel data within this bounding box.
6.  Determine the bounding box of the white Hole within the Frame Object. Identify its top-left corner coordinates.
7.  Paste the extracted pixel data of the Pattern Object onto the output grid, aligning the top-left corner of the Pattern Object's bounding box with the top-left corner coordinates of the Hole's bounding box. Overwrite the existing pixels in the output grid within this target area.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
