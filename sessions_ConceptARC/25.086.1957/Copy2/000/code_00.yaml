task_description: Identify two distinct non-background objects. One is a 'pattern' and the other is an 'azure frame' containing a background-colored 'hole'. Copy the 'pattern' object into the 'hole' within the 'azure frame'.

elements:
  - object: Pattern Shape
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels, not constituting the Azure Frame. Its color and specific shape vary between examples.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (red/yellow in train_1, magenta/blue in train_2)
      - shape: Varies (cross in train_1, flower-like in train_2)
      - location: Typically in the upper-left area in examples, separated from the Frame Shape.
  - object: Frame Shape
    description: A rectangular frame made of a single color (azure).
    properties:
      - color: Azure (8)
      - shape: Hollow rectangle
      - location: Typically in the lower-right area in examples.
      - contains: Hole Object
  - object: Hole Object
    description: A rectangular area within the Frame Shape filled with the background color.
    properties:
      - color: White (0)
      - shape: Rectangle
      - location: Fully enclosed by the Frame Shape.
      - relationship: Target location for the copied Pattern Shape.
  - object: Background
    description: The surrounding area of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: White (0)

actions:
  - action: Identify Objects
    inputs:
      - Input Grid
    outputs:
      - Pattern Shape
      - Frame Shape
      - Hole Object (derived from Frame Shape)
    description: Locate the distinct non-background shapes and identify the hole within the azure frame.
  - action: Extract Pattern
    inputs:
      - Pattern Shape
    outputs:
      - Pattern Data (pixels and relative positions within its bounding box)
    description: Get the pixel data of the Pattern Shape.
  - action: Locate Hole
    inputs:
      - Frame Shape
      - Hole Object
    outputs:
      - Hole Coordinates (top-left corner, dimensions)
    description: Determine the position and size of the rectangular background area inside the Frame Shape.
  - action: Copy and Paste
    inputs:
      - Input Grid
      - Pattern Data
      - Hole Coordinates
    outputs:
      - Output Grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Place the extracted Pattern Data onto the grid, starting at the top-left corner of the Hole Coordinates, overwriting the background pixels within the hole.

relationships:
  - The Frame Shape encloses the Hole Object.
  - The Pattern Shape is copied *into* the Hole Object's location in the output.
  - The original Pattern Shape and Frame Shape persist in the output grid.
