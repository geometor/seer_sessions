            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the transformation involves selecting pairs of adjacent, same-colored pixels and replacing them with 2x2 squares. The filtering rule based on the pair's top-left coordinate having even row and even column indices (`r % 2 == 0 and c % 2 == 0`) worked for the first example but failed for the second.\n\nThe failure occurred because the Green `(3)` 2x2 square expected in the output of `train_2` at position `(0, 8)` could not be generated by any input pair whose top-left coordinate was `(0, 8)`. The relevant Green pairs in the input had top-left coordinates `(0, 9)` and `(1, 8)`, neither of which satisfy the even/even rule.\n\nHowever, the *output square's* top-left coordinate `(0, 8)` *does* satisfy the even/even rule. This suggests the rule applies not to the input *pair*, but to the 2x2 *region* being considered for the output.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n1. Iterate through potential 2x2 output square locations, defined by top-left coordinates `(r, c)` where both `r` and `c` are even.\n2. For each such location, examine the corresponding 2x2 region in the *input* grid.\n3. Check if this 2x2 input region contains *at least one* pair of adjacent (horizontal or vertical), identical, non-background colored pixels.\n4. If such a pair is found, determine its color and fill the 2x2 region starting at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with that color.\n5. If no such pair is found within the 2x2 input region, the corresponding 2x2 output region remains the background color.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the 2x2 input regions corresponding to the output squares.\n\n**Tool Code for Analysis:**\n"
