task_elements:
  - element: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
      - content: Scattered pixels and small shapes (including adjacent pairs)
  - element: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
      - content: Only solid 2x2 squares of non-background color, aligned on a grid where top-left coordinates (r, c) have both r and c even.
  - element: Target_Region
    description: A 2x2 area in the input grid whose top-left corner (r, c) has both r and c as even numbers.
    properties:
      - location: Defined by top-left corner (r, c) where r%2==0 and c%2==0.
      - content: Four pixels from the input grid: input[r:r+2, c:c+2].
  - element: Trigger_Condition
    description: The condition that determines if a Target_Region in the input leads to a square in the output.
    properties:
      - condition: The Target_Region must contain at least one pair of adjacent (horizontal or vertical) pixels that have the same non-background color.
      - resulting_color: The color of the adjacent pair found within the Target_Region. (Assumes only one such color exists per qualifying region based on examples).
  - element: Transformation_Action
    description: Painting a 2x2 square onto the output grid.
    properties:
      - location: The top-left corner (r, c) matches the Target_Region's top-left corner.
      - color: The resulting_color determined by the Trigger_Condition in the corresponding Target_Region.
relationships:
  - type: Filtering
    description: Only 2x2 regions in the input starting at even/even coordinates are considered.
  - type: Activation
    description: An input Target_Region activates the Transformation_Action if it meets the Trigger_Condition.
  - type: Mapping
    description: An activated Target_Region at (r, c) with a pair of color C maps to a 2x2 square of color C at (r, c) in the output grid.
  - type: Construction
    description: The output grid is built by applying the Transformation_Action for all activated Target_Regions.
