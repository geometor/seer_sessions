Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic from the input to the output grid based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids contain various small colored shapes (single pixels, 1x2 rectangles, 2x1 rectangles) scattered across a white background (color 0).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are much sparser, containing only 2x2 squares of solid color on a white background.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying specific structures in the input, filtering them based on certain criteria, and then replacing those selected structures with larger 2x2 squares in the output. All other elements from the input are discarded.
4.  **Identifying Structures:** The structures that seem relevant are pairs of adjacent pixels (sharing an edge, forming 1x2 or 2x1 rectangles) of the same color. Single pixels or larger shapes are ignored.
5.  **Filtering Criteria:** Not all pairs are transformed. By comparing the pairs present in the input with the squares in the output, a pattern emerges related to the coordinates. Specifically, only pairs whose top-left pixel (the one with the minimum row and minimum column index) resides at a location where *both* the row index and the column index are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...) are selected for transformation.
6.  **Replacement:** Each selected pair is replaced by a 2x2 square of the *same* color. The top-left corner of the 2x2 square in the output corresponds exactly to the top-left corner coordinate of the original pair in the input.
7.  **Output Construction:** The final output grid is initialized as white, and then the 2x2 squares derived from the filtered input pairs are drawn onto it.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
3.  For each non-background pixel at (r, c) with color `C`:
    a.  Check its right neighbor at (r, c+1). If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a horizontal pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).
    b.  Check its bottom neighbor at (r+1, c). If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a vertical pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).
4.  Create a list of all unique pairs found, storing their color `C` and their top-left coordinate (r, c). Ensure each pair is only counted once (e.g., don't count the pair starting at (r, c+1) if you already counted the one starting at (r, c)).
5.  Filter this list of pairs: Keep only those pairs whose top-left coordinate (r, c) satisfies the condition that both `r` is an even number AND `c` is an even number.
6.  For each pair (color `C`, top-left coordinate (r, c)) remaining after filtering:
    a.  Paint a 2x2 square of color `C` onto the output grid, starting at position (r, c). Specifically, set the pixels at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1) to color `C`. Handle boundary conditions if the grid is too small for a full 2x2 square (although example dimensions suggest this won't happen).
7.  Return the completed output grid.

Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the code execution results.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code implemented a hypothesis where 2x2 blocks were examined starting at even coordinates, and *any* adjacent pair within that block would trigger the output square. This worked for Example 1 but failed for Example 2, specifically by incorrectly generating a yellow (4) square at (8, 4).

The failure occurred because the input pair of 4s was at (9, 4) and (9, 5). While this pair existed within the input block `input_grid[8:10, 4:6]`, its own top-left coordinate (9, 4) has an odd row index (9).

Comparing the successful outputs with the inputs suggests the original hypothesis (stated in the first natural language program but not implemented in the first code attempt) was correct:
1.  Identify *all* adjacent (horizontal/vertical), same-colored pairs in the input.
2.  Determine the top-left coordinate (r, c) for *each* identified pair.
3.  Filter these pairs, keeping only those where *both r and c are even*.
4.  For each filtered pair, draw a 2x2 square of the pair's color in the output, starting at (r, c).

The strategy is to reimplement the code following this refined logic. We need to iterate through the grid, find all pairs, check the evenness of *their specific* top-left coordinates, store the valid `(color, r, c)` tuples (using a set to handle potential overlaps), and then draw the 2x2 squares based on this set.

## Metrics

No code execution needed for metrics at this stage. The critical observation is the handling of the input pair of 4s at `(9, 4), (9, 5)` in Example 2.
*   **Input Pair:** Yellow (4) at (9, 4) and (9, 5).
*   **Pair's Top-Left Coordinate:** (9, 4).
*   **Evenness Check:** Row 9 is odd.
*   **Correct Logic:** This pair should *not* generate an output square because its top-left row coordinate is odd.
*   **Previous Code Logic:** The code checked the 2x2 *block* starting at (8, 4), found this pair within it, and *incorrectly* generated an output square at (8, 4).
*   **Expected Output:** No square generated from this pair. The expected output for Example 2 reflects this.

    description: Each selected input pair (color C, top-left (R, C)) maps directly to a 2x2 output square of color C with its top-left corner at (R, C).
  - type: Uniqueness
    description: Using a set for filtered pairs ensures that even if multiple input pairs map to the same output 2x2 square location (e.g., a 2x2 input square at an even coordinate), the square is conceptually considered only once for drawing.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Create an empty set called `squares_to_draw` to store unique tuples `(color, row, column)` representing the 2x2 squares to be placed in the output.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid. Let `current_color` be the color at `input_grid[r, c]`.
4.  If `current_color` is not the background color (0):
    a.  **Check Right:** If `c + 1` is within the grid bounds AND `input_grid[r, c + 1]` equals `current_color`:
        i.  This is a horizontal pair. The top-left coordinate is `(r, c)`.
        ii. If `r` is even AND `c` is even, add `(current_color, r, c)` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
    b.  **Check Down:** If `r + 1` is within the grid bounds AND `input_grid[r + 1, c]` equals `current_color`:
        i.  This is a vertical pair. The top-left coordinate is `(r, c)`.
        ii. If `r` is even AND `c` is even, add `(current_color, r, c)` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
5.  After checking all cells in the input grid, iterate through each `(color, r, c)` tuple stored in the `squares_to_draw` set.
6.  For each tuple, verify that the 2x2 square fits within the grid (i.e., `r + 1` is less than height and `c + 1` is less than width).
7.  If it fits, color the 2x2 block in the `output_grid` starting at `(r, c)` with the specified `color`. That is, set `output_grid[r:r+2, c:c+2] = color`.
8.  Return the final `output_grid`.
