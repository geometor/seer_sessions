task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - size: Variable (up to 30x30), typically 10x10 in examples
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Input Objects
    description: Adjacent pairs of pixels (sharing a full edge, horizontally or vertically) having the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The color C (1-9) of the two pixels in the pair.
      - top_left_coordinate: The coordinate (r, c) of the pixel in the pair with the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index.
  - element: Filtering Criterion
    description: A condition applied to the top_left_coordinate (r, c) of each identified Input Object (pair).
    properties:
      - condition: Both the row index 'r' and the column index 'c' must be even numbers (divisible by 2).
  - element: Output Objects
    description: 2x2 squares of solid color placed on the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: Matches the color C of the input pair that generated it.
      - top_left_coordinate: Matches the top_left_coordinate (r, c) of the input pair that generated it.
      - size: Always 2x2 pixels.
  - element: Transformation Action
    description: Identifying, filtering, and replacing specific input patterns.
    steps:
      - Find all horizontal and vertical adjacent pairs of same-colored non-background pixels in the input.
      - Determine the top-left coordinate (r, c) for each pair.
      - Select only those pairs where both r and c are even.
      - Create a unique set of the selected (color, r, c) tuples. (Ensures that if multiple pairs point to the same output square location, it's only generated once).
      - Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
      - For each unique (color, r, c) tuple selected, draw a 2x2 square of that 'color' onto the output grid starting at position (r, c).
relationships:
  - type: Selection
    description: Only adjacent pairs whose top-left (r,c) coordinates satisfy `r % 2 == 0 AND c % 2 == 0` are selected from the input.
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each selected input pair (defined by its color C and top-left coordinate (r, c)) maps to a 2x2 square of color C at coordinate (r, c) in the output.
  - type: Composition
    description: The output grid is composed of the background color plus the 2x2 output squares generated from the filtered input pairs.
