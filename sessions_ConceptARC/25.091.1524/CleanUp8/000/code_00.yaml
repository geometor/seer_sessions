task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-background color. Relevant objects in this task are specifically pairs of adjacent pixels of the same color (forming 1x2 or 2x1 rectangles).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the pair (1-9)
      - location: Coordinates of the two pixels comprising the pair.
      - top_left_coordinate: The coordinate (row, col) with the minimum row and minimum column index for the pair.
  - element: Transformation
    description: A filtering and replacement process.
    steps:
      - step: Identify all pairs of adjacent (sharing an edge), same-colored pixels in the input grid.
      - step: Filter these pairs based on their top-left coordinate (r, c). Keep only pairs where both 'r' and 'c' are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...).
      - step: Create a new output grid initialized with the background color (white).
      - step: For each filtered pair, draw a 2x2 square of the pair's color onto the output grid, starting at the pair's top-left coordinate.
relationships:
  - type: Selection
    description: Only pairs of adjacent, same-colored pixels whose top-left coordinates (r, c) have both r and c as even numbers are selected from the input.
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each selected input pair maps to a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid.
  - type: Positional_Conservation
    description: The top-left coordinate of the output 2x2 square is identical to the top-left coordinate of the corresponding input pair.
