Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic from the input to the output grid based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids contain various small colored shapes (single pixels, 1x2 rectangles, 2x1 rectangles) scattered across a white background (color 0).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are much sparser, containing only 2x2 squares of solid color on a white background.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying specific structures in the input, filtering them based on certain criteria, and then replacing those selected structures with larger 2x2 squares in the output. All other elements from the input are discarded.
4.  **Identifying Structures:** The structures that seem relevant are pairs of adjacent pixels (sharing an edge, forming 1x2 or 2x1 rectangles) of the same color. Single pixels or larger shapes are ignored.
5.  **Filtering Criteria:** Not all pairs are transformed. By comparing the pairs present in the input with the squares in the output, a pattern emerges related to the coordinates. Specifically, only pairs whose top-left pixel (the one with the minimum row and minimum column index) resides at a location where *both* the row index and the column index are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...) are selected for transformation.
6.  **Replacement:** Each selected pair is replaced by a 2x2 square of the *same* color. The top-left corner of the 2x2 square in the output corresponds exactly to the top-left corner coordinate of the original pair in the input.
7.  **Output Construction:** The final output grid is initialized as white, and then the 2x2 squares derived from the filtered input pairs are drawn onto it.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: Objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-background color. Relevant objects in this task are specifically pairs of adjacent pixels of the same color (forming 1x2 or 2x1 rectangles).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the pair (1-9)
      - location: Coordinates of the two pixels comprising the pair.
      - top_left_coordinate: The coordinate (row, col) with the minimum row and minimum column index for the pair.
  - element: Transformation
    description: A filtering and replacement process.
    steps:
      - step: Identify all pairs of adjacent (sharing an edge), same-colored pixels in the input grid.
      - step: Filter these pairs based on their top-left coordinate (r, c). Keep only pairs where both 'r' and 'c' are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...).
      - step: Create a new output grid initialized with the background color (white).
      - step: For each filtered pair, draw a 2x2 square of the pair's color onto the output grid, starting at the pair's top-left coordinate.
relationships:
  - type: Selection
    description: Only pairs of adjacent, same-colored pixels whose top-left coordinates (r, c) have both r and c as even numbers are selected from the input.
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each selected input pair maps to a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid.
  - type: Positional_Conservation
    description: The top-left coordinate of the output 2x2 square is identical to the top-left coordinate of the corresponding input pair.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
3.  For each non-background pixel at (r, c) with color `C`:
    a.  Check its right neighbor at (r, c+1). If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a horizontal pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).
    b.  Check its bottom neighbor at (r+1, c). If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a vertical pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).
4.  Create a list of all unique pairs found, storing their color `C` and their top-left coordinate (r, c). Ensure each pair is only counted once (e.g., don't count the pair starting at (r, c+1) if you already counted the one starting at (r, c)).
5.  Filter this list of pairs: Keep only those pairs whose top-left coordinate (r, c) satisfies the condition that both `r` is an even number AND `c` is an even number.
6.  For each pair (color `C`, top-left coordinate (r, c)) remaining after filtering:
    a.  Paint a 2x2 square of color `C` onto the output grid, starting at position (r, c). Specifically, set the pixels at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1) to color `C`. Handle boundary conditions if the grid is too small for a full 2x2 square (although example dimensions suggest this won't happen).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
