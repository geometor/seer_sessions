All other elements from the input are discarded.\n4.  **Identifying Structures:** The structures that seem relevant are pairs of adjacent pixels (sharing an edge, forming 1x2 or 2x1 rectangles) of the same color. Single pixels or larger shapes are ignored.\n5.  **Filtering Criteria:** Not all pairs are transformed. By comparing the pairs present in the input with the squares in the output, a pattern emerges related to the coordinates. Specifically, only pairs whose top-left pixel (the one with the minimum row and minimum column index) resides at a location where *both* the row index and the column index are even numbers (0, 2, 4, ...) are selected for transformation.\n6.  **Replacement:** Each selected pair is replaced by a 2x2 square of the *same* color. The top-left corner of the 2x2 square in the output corresponds exactly to the top-left corner coordinate of the original pair in the input.\n7.  **Output Construction:** The final output grid is initialized as white, and then the 2x2 squares derived from the filtered input pairs are drawn onto it.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a horizontal pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).\n    b.  Check its bottom neighbor at (r+1, c). If it exists and also has color `C`, this forms a vertical pair. The top-left coordinate is (r, c).\n4.  Create a list of all unique pairs found, storing their color `C` and their top-left coordinate (r, c). Ensure each pair is only counted once (e.g., don't count the pair starting at (r, c+1) if you already counted the one starting at (r, c)).\n5.  Filter this list of pairs: Keep only those pairs whose top-left coordinate (r, c) satisfies the condition that both `r` is an even number AND `c` is an even number.\n6.  For each pair (color `C`, top-left coordinate (r, c)) remaining after filtering:\n    a.  Paint a 2x2 square of color `C` onto the output grid, starting at position (r, c). Specifically, set the pixels at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1) to color `C`. Handle boundary conditions if the grid is too small for a full 2x2 square (although example dimensions suggest this won't happen).\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
