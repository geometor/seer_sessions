Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the code execution results.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code implemented a hypothesis where 2x2 blocks were examined starting at even coordinates, and *any* adjacent pair within that block would trigger the output square. This worked for Example 1 but failed for Example 2, specifically by incorrectly generating a yellow (4) square at (8, 4).

The failure occurred because the input pair of 4s was at (9, 4) and (9, 5). While this pair existed within the input block `input_grid[8:10, 4:6]`, its own top-left coordinate (9, 4) has an odd row index (9).

Comparing the successful outputs with the inputs suggests the original hypothesis (stated in the first natural language program but not implemented in the first code attempt) was correct:
1.  Identify *all* adjacent (horizontal/vertical), same-colored pairs in the input.
2.  Determine the top-left coordinate (r, c) for *each* identified pair.
3.  Filter these pairs, keeping only those where *both r and c are even*.
4.  For each filtered pair, draw a 2x2 square of the pair's color in the output, starting at (r, c).

The strategy is to reimplement the code following this refined logic. We need to iterate through the grid, find all pairs, check the evenness of *their specific* top-left coordinates, store the valid `(color, r, c)` tuples (using a set to handle potential overlaps), and then draw the 2x2 squares based on this set.

## Metrics

No code execution needed for metrics at this stage. The critical observation is the handling of the input pair of 4s at `(9, 4), (9, 5)` in Example 2.
*   **Input Pair:** Yellow (4) at (9, 4) and (9, 5).
*   **Pair's Top-Left Coordinate:** (9, 4).
*   **Evenness Check:** Row 9 is odd.
*   **Correct Logic:** This pair should *not* generate an output square because its top-left row coordinate is odd.
*   **Previous Code Logic:** The code checked the 2x2 *block* starting at (8, 4), found this pair within it, and *incorrectly* generated an output square at (8, 4).
*   **Expected Output:** No square generated from this pair. The expected output for Example 2 reflects this.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: Object
    description: A pair of adjacent pixels (sharing a non-diagonal edge) having the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The color C (1-9) of the two pixels.
      - location: The coordinates of the two pixels, e.g., (r, c) and (r, c+1) for horizontal, or (r, c) and (r+1, c) for vertical.
      - top_left_coordinate: The coordinate (R, C) of the pixel within the pair that has the minimum row index, and minimum column index in case of a tie (which only occurs for horizontal pairs where R=r, C=c).
  - element: Target_Structure
    description: A 2x2 square of solid color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: Inherited from the input object (pair) that generated it.
      - top_left_coordinate: Inherited from the input object (pair) that generated it. Must have both row and column indices as even numbers.
actions:
  - action: Find_Pairs
    description: Iterate through the input grid to identify all horizontal and vertical pairs of adjacent, same-colored, non-background pixels. Record each pair's color and top-left coordinate.
  - action: Filter_Pairs
    description: Select only those pairs whose top-left coordinate (R, C) has both R % 2 == 0 and C % 2 == 0. Create a unique set of these filtered pairs, represented by (color, R, C).
  - action: Generate_Output
    description: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initialized to the background color (0).
  - action: Draw_Squares
    description: For each unique (color, R, C) tuple from the filtered set, draw a 2x2 square of that color onto the output grid, starting at position (R, C). Handle boundary conditions (ensure R+1 < height and C+1 < width).
relationships:
  - type: Selection
    description: An input pair is selected if and only if its top-left coordinate (R, C) satisfies R % 2 == 0 and C % 2 == 0.
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each selected input pair (color C, top-left (R, C)) maps directly to a 2x2 output square of color C with its top-left corner at (R, C).
  - type: Uniqueness
    description: Using a set for filtered pairs ensures that even if multiple input pairs map to the same output 2x2 square location (e.g., a 2x2 input square at an even coordinate), the square is conceptually considered only once for drawing.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Create an empty set called `squares_to_draw` to store unique tuples `(color, row, column)` representing the 2x2 squares to be placed in the output.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid. Let `current_color` be the color at `input_grid[r, c]`.
4.  If `current_color` is not the background color (0):
    a.  **Check Right:** If `c + 1` is within the grid bounds AND `input_grid[r, c + 1]` equals `current_color`:
        i.  This is a horizontal pair. The top-left coordinate is `(r, c)`.
        ii. If `r` is even AND `c` is even, add `(current_color, r, c)` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
    b.  **Check Down:** If `r + 1` is within the grid bounds AND `input_grid[r + 1, c]` equals `current_color`:
        i.  This is a vertical pair. The top-left coordinate is `(r, c)`.
        ii. If `r` is even AND `c` is even, add `(current_color, r, c)` to the `squares_to_draw` set.
5.  After checking all cells in the input grid, iterate through each `(color, r, c)` tuple stored in the `squares_to_draw` set.
6.  For each tuple, verify that the 2x2 square fits within the grid (i.e., `r + 1` is less than height and `c + 1` is less than width).
7.  If it fits, color the 2x2 block in the `output_grid` starting at `(r, c)` with the specified `color`. That is, set `output_grid[r:r+2, c:c+2] = color`.
8.  Return the final `output_grid`.
