            "text": "Okay, let's refine the analysis based on the code execution results.\n\n## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code implemented a hypothesis where 2x2 blocks were examined starting at even coordinates, and *any* adjacent pair within that block would trigger the output square. This worked for Example 1 but failed for Example 2, specifically by incorrectly generating a yellow (4) square at (8, 4).\n\nThe failure occurred because the input pair of 4s was at (9, 4) and (9, 5). While this pair existed within the input block `input_grid[8:10, 4:6]`, its own top-left coordinate (9, 4) has an odd row index (9).\n\nComparing the successful outputs with the inputs suggests the original hypothesis (stated in the first natural language program but not implemented in the first code attempt) was correct:\n1.  Identify *all* adjacent (horizontal/vertical), same-colored pairs in the input.\n2.  Determine the top-left coordinate (r, c) for *each* identified pair.\n3.  Filter these pairs, keeping only those where *both r and c are even*.\n4.  For each filtered pair, draw a 2x2 square of the pair's color in the output, starting at (r, c).\n\nThe strategy is to reimplement the code following this refined logic. We need to iterate through the grid, find all pairs, check the evenness of *their specific* top-left coordinates, store the valid `(color, r, c)` tuples (using a set to handle potential overlaps), and then draw the 2x2 squares based on this set.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo code execution needed for metrics at this stage. The critical observation is the handling of the input pair of 4s at `(9, 4), (9, 5)` in Example 2.\n*   **Input Pair:** Yellow (4) at (9, 4) and (9, 5).\n*   **Pair's Top-Left Coordinate:** (9, 4).\n*   **Evenness Check:** Row 9 is odd.\n*   **Correct Logic:** This pair should *not* generate an output square because its top-left row coordinate is odd.\n*   **Previous Code Logic:** The code checked the 2x2 *block* starting at (8, 4), found this pair within it, and *incorrectly* generated an output square at (8, 4).\n*   **Expected Output:** No square generated from this pair. The expected output for Example 2 reflects this.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
