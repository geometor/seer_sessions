task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: height x width (up to 30x30)
  - element: Object
    description: A pair of adjacent pixels (sharing a non-diagonal edge) having the same non-background color.
    properties:
      - color: The color C (1-9) of the two pixels.
      - location: The coordinates of the two pixels, e.g., (r, c) and (r, c+1) for horizontal, or (r, c) and (r+1, c) for vertical.
      - top_left_coordinate: The coordinate (R, C) of the pixel within the pair that has the minimum row index, and minimum column index in case of a tie (which only occurs for horizontal pairs where R=r, C=c).
  - element: Target_Structure
    description: A 2x2 square of solid color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: Inherited from the input object (pair) that generated it.
      - top_left_coordinate: Inherited from the input object (pair) that generated it. Must have both row and column indices as even numbers.
actions:
  - action: Find_Pairs
    description: Iterate through the input grid to identify all horizontal and vertical pairs of adjacent, same-colored, non-background pixels. Record each pair's color and top-left coordinate.
  - action: Filter_Pairs
    description: Select only those pairs whose top-left coordinate (R, C) has both R % 2 == 0 and C % 2 == 0. Create a unique set of these filtered pairs, represented by (color, R, C).
  - action: Generate_Output
    description: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initialized to the background color (0).
  - action: Draw_Squares
    description: For each unique (color, R, C) tuple from the filtered set, draw a 2x2 square of that color onto the output grid, starting at position (R, C). Handle boundary conditions (ensure R+1 < height and C+1 < width).
relationships:
  - type: Selection
    description: An input pair is selected if and only if its top-left coordinate (R, C) satisfies R % 2 == 0 and C % 2 == 0.
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each selected input pair (color C, top-left (R, C)) maps directly to a 2x2 output square of color C with its top-left corner at (R, C).
  - type: Uniqueness
    description: Using a set for filtered pairs ensures that even if multiple input pairs map to the same output 2x2 square location (e.g., a 2x2 input square at an even coordinate), the square is conceptually considered only once for drawing.
