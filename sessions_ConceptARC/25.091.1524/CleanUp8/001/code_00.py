"""
Identifies pairs of adjacent pixels (horizontal or vertical) of the same non-background color in the input grid. 
Filters these pairs, keeping only those whose top-left coordinate (r, c) has both r and c as even numbers.
For each filtered pair, draws a 2x2 square of the same color onto the output grid, starting at the pair's top-left coordinate.
The output grid is initialized with the background color (white, 0).
