"""
Identifies connected components (objects) of non-background pixels in the input grid.
Removes objects (changes their pixels to the background color 0) if their size (number of pixels) is less than or equal to 2.
Preserves objects with a size strictly greater than 2.
Connectivity is defined by 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
The background color is assumed to be 0 (white).
