Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The background color appears to be white (0).
2.  **Color Presence:**
    *   `train_1`: Input has white (0), blue (1), and green (3). Output has only white (0) and green (3).
    *   `train_2`: Input has white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8). Output has only white (0) and magenta (6).
3.  **Transformation Observation:** In both examples, some colored pixels from the input are removed (changed to white) in the output, while others are kept. Specifically, all blue (1) and azure (8) pixels are removed. Some green (3) pixels are removed in `train_1`, while all magenta (6) pixels are kept in `train_2`.
4.  **Object Analysis:** Let's consider contiguous blocks of the same non-white color as objects.
    *   `train_1`:
        *   Input contains several green objects. Two are large (size > 2), and four are single pixels (size 1).
        *   Input contains several blue objects. Four are single pixels (size 1), and one consists of two adjacent pixels (size 2).
        *   Output contains only the two large green objects from the input. All single green pixels, single blue pixels, and the two-pixel blue object are removed (turned white).
    *   `train_2`:
        *   Input contains two large magenta objects (size > 2).
        *   Input contains nine single azure pixels (size 1).
        *   Output contains only the two large magenta objects. All single azure pixels are removed (turned white).
5.  **Hypothesis:** The transformation rule seems to involve identifying contiguous objects of any non-background color. Objects with a size (pixel count) of 1 or 2 are considered "noise" and are removed (replaced by the background color). Objects with a size strictly greater than 2 are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Noise removal based on object size.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous pixels of the same non-background color
  properties:
    - color: the color of the pixels in the object
    - size: the number of pixels in the object
    - pixels: list of coordinates for pixels in the object
  relationships:
    - adjacency: uses 8-way connectivity (sides and diagonals) to define contiguous objects
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the input grid.
  - calculate_size: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified object.
  - filter_objects: Select objects based on a size threshold.
  - generate_output: Create the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve objects whose size is strictly greater than 2.
  - Remove objects (replace their pixels with the background color) whose size is 1 or 2.
  - Background pixels remain unchanged.
examples:
  train_1:
    - input_colors: [0, 1, 3]
    - output_colors: [0, 3]
    - removed_objects:
        - color: 3, size: 1 (4 instances)
        - color: 1, size: 1 (4 instances)
        - color: 1, size: 2 (1 instance)
    - kept_objects:
        - color: 3, size: 8 (1 instance)
        - color: 3, size: 8 (1 instance)
  train_2:
    - input_colors: [0, 6, 8]
    - output_colors: [0, 6]
    - removed_objects:
        - color: 8, size: 1 (9 instances)
    - kept_objects:
        - color: 6, size: 14 (1 instance)
        - color: 6, size: 19 (1 instance)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color, which is assumed to be the most frequent color, likely white (0).
3.  Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid consisting of pixels with the same non-background color. Use 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) to determine connectivity.
4.  For each identified object:
    a.  Count the number of pixels in the object (its size).
    b.  If the object's size is less than or equal to 2:
        i.  Iterate through all pixel coordinates belonging to this object.
        ii. Change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
