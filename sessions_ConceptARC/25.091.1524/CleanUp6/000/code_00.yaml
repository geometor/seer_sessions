task_description: Noise removal based on object size.
background_color: 0 (white)
objects:
  - type: contiguous pixels of the same non-background color
  properties:
    - color: the color of the pixels in the object
    - size: the number of pixels in the object
    - pixels: list of coordinates for pixels in the object
  relationships:
    - adjacency: uses 8-way connectivity (sides and diagonals) to define contiguous objects
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the input grid.
  - calculate_size: Determine the number of pixels (size) for each identified object.
  - filter_objects: Select objects based on a size threshold.
  - generate_output: Create the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  - Preserve objects whose size is strictly greater than 2.
  - Remove objects (replace their pixels with the background color) whose size is 1 or 2.
  - Background pixels remain unchanged.
examples:
  train_1:
    - input_colors: [0, 1, 3]
    - output_colors: [0, 3]
    - removed_objects:
        - color: 3, size: 1 (4 instances)
        - color: 1, size: 1 (4 instances)
        - color: 1, size: 2 (1 instance)
    - kept_objects:
        - color: 3, size: 8 (1 instance)
        - color: 3, size: 8 (1 instance)
  train_2:
    - input_colors: [0, 6, 8]
    - output_colors: [0, 6]
    - removed_objects:
        - color: 8, size: 1 (9 instances)
    - kept_objects:
        - color: 6, size: 14 (1 instance)
        - color: 6, size: 19 (1 instance)
