## General Assessment

The initial hypothesis, implemented in the previous code, was that only azure (8) pixels are removed (changed to white). The execution results clearly show this is incorrect. In all three training examples, the expected output removes not only the azure (8) pixels but also other non-white pixels that are adjacent (including diagonally) to the original azure pixels.

The strategy to resolve these errors is to refine the transformation rule to include the removal of these adjacent pixels. The revised rule should be:
1. Identify all pixels with the color azure (8).
2. Identify all pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8), but are adjacent (including diagonals, i.e., 8-connectivity) to at least one azure (8) pixel identified in step 1.
3. Change the color of all pixels identified in steps 1 and 2 to white (0).
4. Leave all other pixels unchanged.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the differences more formally for the first example.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
*   **Input:** Contains azure (8) pixels and green (3) pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** Azure (8) pixels are gone. Green (3) pixels at `(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, and `(5, 6)` are also gone (changed to white).
*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Only azure (8) pixels were removed. The green pixels at `(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, and `(5, 6)` remained.
*   **Observation:** The green pixels removed in the Expected Output (`(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 6)`) are all adjacent (diagonally or cardinally) to the original azure (8) pixels.
