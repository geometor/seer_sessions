## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of pixels with different colors. The size of the grid remains constant between input and output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), and azure (8). White seems to be the background color.
3.  **Key Color:** The color azure (8) appears in all input examples but is completely absent in the corresponding output examples.
4.  **Affected Colors:** In each example, pixels of *another* color (green in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, magenta in ex 3) that are adjacent (including diagonals) to the azure pixels in the input are also removed (changed to white) in the output.
5.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that are not azure (8) and are not adjacent to any azure pixel retain their original color in the output. White (0) pixels also seem unaffected unless they replace a removed pixel.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying all azure (8) pixels and all non-white pixels adjacent to them, and then replacing all these identified pixels with white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create two sets to store the coordinates of pixels to be changed to white: `azure_coords` and `adjacent_coords`.
3.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
4.  If a pixel's color is azure (8), add its coordinates (row, col) to the `azure_coords` set.
5.  After identifying all azure pixels, iterate through each pixel of the input grid again.
6.  For each pixel that is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8):
    a.  Check its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
    b.  If any neighbor's coordinates are present in the `azure_coords` set, add the current pixel's coordinates (row, col) to the `adjacent_coords` set.
7.  Combine the coordinates from `azure_coords` and `adjacent_coords` into a single set of `pixels_to_remove`.
8.  Iterate through all coordinates in the `pixels_to_remove` set. For each coordinate (row, col), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
9.  Return the modified output grid.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified azure (8) as the key color being removed. However, the hypothesis that adjacent non-white pixels were *also* removed was incorrect. The results clearly show that in all three training examples, the `Transformed Output` incorrectly removed non-white pixels that were adjacent to azure pixels, while the `Expected Output` retained them.

The consistent pattern of error across all examples points to a simpler transformation rule: only the azure (8) pixels themselves are targeted for removal and replaced with white (0). All other pixels, regardless of their color or proximity to azure pixels, remain unchanged.

The strategy is to revise the natural language program and the underlying logic to reflect this simpler rule: identify all azure pixels and change only those pixels to white.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's verify the number of azure pixels in the input and compare it to the number of pixels changed between input and expected output.

    azure_pixels_count = np.sum(input_grid == 8)
    changed_pixels = input_grid != output_grid
    changed_pixels_count = np.sum(changed_pixels)
    
    # Verify that only azure pixels were changed to white
    pixels_that_changed = input_grid[changed_pixels]
    all_were_azure = np.all(pixels_that_changed == 8)
    
    pixels_after_change = output_grid[changed_pixels]
    all_became_white = np.all(pixels_after_change == 0)

```
Example 1 Metrics: {'azure_pixels_count': 9, 'changed_pixels_count': 9, 'all_changed_were_azure': True, 'all_changed_became_white': True}
Example 2 Metrics: {'azure_pixels_count': 15, 'changed_pixels_count': 15, 'all_changed_were_azure': True, 'all_changed_became_white': True}
Example 3 Metrics: {'azure_pixels_count': 18, 'changed_pixels_count': 18, 'all_changed_were_azure': True, 'all_changed_became_white': True}

```
The metrics confirm the revised hypothesis:
1.  In each example, the number of azure (8) pixels in the input exactly matches the number of pixels that changed between the input and the expected output.
2.  All pixels that changed were originally azure (8).
3.  All pixels that changed became white (0).

This strongly supports the conclusion that the transformation rule is simply to replace all azure pixels with white pixels.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: "Replace all azure (8) pixels with white (0) pixels."
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: True # Grid dimensions do not change.
  - background_color: 0 # White is the default/background color.
objects:
  - type: target
    color: 8 # azure
    description: "The only pixels affected by the transformation."
actions:
  - name: identify_target_pixels
    target: pixels with color 8
    result: set of coordinates for all azure pixels.
  - name: replace_pixels
    target_coordinates: coordinates identified in 'identify_target_pixels'
    action: change pixel color to 0 (white).
  - name: preserve_pixels
    target: pixels with color other than 8
    action: keep original pixel color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the color of the current pixel is azure (8), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
4.  If the color of the current pixel is not azure (8), keep its color unchanged in the output grid (this happens implicitly by copying).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
