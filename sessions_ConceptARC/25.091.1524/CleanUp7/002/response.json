            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified azure (8) as the key color being removed. However, the hypothesis that adjacent non-white pixels were *also* removed was incorrect. The results clearly show that in all three training examples, the `Transformed Output` incorrectly removed non-white pixels that were adjacent to azure pixels, while the `Expected Output` retained them.\n\nThe consistent pattern of error across all examples points to a simpler transformation rule: only the azure (8) pixels themselves are targeted for removal and replaced with white (0). All other pixels, regardless of their color or proximity to azure pixels, remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the natural language program and the underlying logic to reflect this simpler rule: identify all azure pixels and change only those pixels to white.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's verify the number of azure pixels in the input and compare it to the number of pixels changed between input and expected output.\n\n"
