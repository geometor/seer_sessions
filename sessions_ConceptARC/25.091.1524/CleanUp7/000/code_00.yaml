task_description: "Identify and remove azure (8) pixels and any non-white pixels adjacent (including diagonals) to them, replacing them with white (0)."
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: True # Grid dimensions do not change.
  - background_color: 0 # White is the default/background color.
objects:
  - type: primary_target
    color: 8 # azure
    description: "The main object/color to be removed."
  - type: secondary_target
    color: non-zero # Any color other than white (0) and azure (8).
    description: "Pixels of these colors are potentially affected if adjacent to the primary target."
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    scope: 8-connectivity # Includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.
    condition: "A secondary target pixel is adjacent to a primary target pixel."
actions:
  - name: identify_primary
    target: pixels with color 8
    result: set of coordinates for all azure pixels.
  - name: identify_adjacent_secondary
    target: pixels with non-zero, non-8 color
    condition: adjacent (8-connectivity) to any pixel identified in 'identify_primary'
    result: set of coordinates for adjacent non-white, non-azure pixels.
  - name: remove_pixels
    target_coordinates: union of coordinates from 'identify_primary' and 'identify_adjacent_secondary'
    action: change pixel color to 0 (white).
  - name: preserve_pixels
    target_coordinates: all coordinates not in 'remove_pixels' target set.
    action: keep original pixel color.
