The size of the grid remains constant between input and output.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), and azure (8). White seems to be the background color.\n3.  **Key Color:** The color azure (8) appears in all input examples but is completely absent in the corresponding output examples.\n4.  **Affected Colors:** In each example, pixels of *another* color (green in ex 1, yellow in ex 2, magenta in ex 3) that are adjacent (including diagonals) to the azure pixels in the input are also removed (changed to white) in the output.\n5.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that are not azure (8) and are not adjacent to any azure pixel retain their original color in the output. White (0) pixels also seem unaffected unless they replace a removed pixel.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying all azure (8) pixels and all non-white pixels adjacent to them, and then replacing all these identified pixels with white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each coordinate (row, col), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
