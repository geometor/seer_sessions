Okay, let's break down these examples.

**Perception**

*   **Example 1 (`train_1`)**: The input grid features horizontal stripes: rows of all yellow (4) alternating with rows primarily composed of green (3), but occasionally interrupted by magenta (6) pixels. The output grid removes the magenta (6) pixels, replacing them with green (3), resulting in solid yellow (4) rows alternating with solid green (3) rows. The core transformation seems to be replacing the "noise" color (magenta) with the dominant color of the row it appears in (green).
*   **Example 2 (`train_2`)**: The input grid features vertical stripes: columns of all orange (7) alternating with columns of all red (2). This pattern is interrupted by sporadic gray (5) pixels. The output grid removes the gray (5) pixels, replacing them with the color appropriate for that column's stripe (orange for even columns, red for odd columns, 0-indexed). The transformation involves identifying the dominant column pattern and replacing the "noise" color (gray) with the pattern's color for that specific column.

**General Observation**: In both examples, there's a clear underlying pattern (alternating rows or columns of two colors) that is disrupted by a third "noise" color. The transformation involves identifying this noise color and replacing it with the color that *should* be present according to the underlying pattern at that location.

**Facts**

  train_1:
    input_grid_size: [8, 8]
    output_grid_size: [8, 8]

    output_colors: [yellow (4), green (3)]

      colors: [yellow (4), green (3)]

    transformation:
      action: replace_color
      target_color: magenta (6)
      replacement_rule: replace with the dominant color of the row (green (3))
  train_2:
    input_grid_size: [12, 13]
    output_grid_size: [12, 13]
    input_colors: [orange (7), red (2), gray (5)]
    output_colors: [orange (7), red (2)]
    pattern:
      type: column-based_alternating
      colors: [orange (7), red (2)] # starting with orange in column 0
      noise_color: gray (5)
    transformation:
      action: replace_color
      target_color: gray (5)
      replacement_rule: replace with the dominant color of the column (orange (7) for even columns, red (2) for odd columns)

common_elements:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Each input contains a dominant two-color alternating pattern (either row-wise or column-wise).
  - Each input contains a third "noise" color that deviates from the pattern.
  - The transformation removes the noise color by replacing it with the color expected by the background pattern at that cell's location.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid to identify the primary background pattern. Determine if it's based on alternating colors row-by-row or column-by-column. Note the two colors involved in this pattern.
2.  Identify the third color present in the grid that acts as "noise" or an anomaly disrupting the pattern.
3.  Create a new grid identical in size to the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.
5.  For the current cell:
    a.  Check if its color is the identified "noise" color.
    b.  If it *is* the noise color:
        i.  Determine the color that *should* be in this cell based on the row/column index and the background pattern identified in step 1 (e.g., if it's a row pattern, check the row index; if it's a column pattern, check the column index).
        ii. Assign this determined background pattern color to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
    c.  If it is *not* the noise color:
        i.  Copy the original color from the input grid cell to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
6.  The completed new grid is the output.
