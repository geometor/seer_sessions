The output grid removes the magenta (6) pixels, replacing them with green (3), resulting in solid yellow (4) rows alternating with solid green (3) rows. The core transformation seems to be replacing the \"noise\" color (magenta) with the dominant color of the row it appears in (green).\n*   **Example 2 (`train_2`)**: The input grid features vertical stripes: columns of all orange (7) alternating with columns of all red (2). This pattern is interrupted by sporadic gray (5) pixels. The output grid removes the gray (5) pixels, replacing them with the color appropriate for that column's stripe (orange for even columns, red for odd columns, 0-indexed). The transformation involves identifying the dominant column pattern and replacing the \"noise\" color (gray) with the pattern's color for that specific column.\n\n**General Observation**: In both examples, there's a clear underlying pattern (alternating rows or columns of two colors) that is disrupted by a third \"noise\" color. The transformation involves identifying this noise color and replacing it with the color that *should* be present according to the underlying pattern at that location.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
