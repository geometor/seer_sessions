def get_dominant_color(arr, ignore_color=None):
    """
    Finds the most frequent color in a 1D numpy array, optionally ignoring one color.
    
    Args:
        arr (np.array): 1D numpy array of colors (integers).
        ignore_color (int, optional): A color value to ignore when counting. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        int: The most frequent color in the array (after potentially ignoring one).
             Returns -1 if the array is empty after ignoring the specified color, 
             or if the input array itself was empty or None.
             In case of a tie for the most frequent color, returns one of the tied colors
             (specifically, the one encountered first by Counter).

    Identifies a grid pattern primarily composed of two colors, potentially arranged
    in alternating rows or columns, which is disrupted by a third 'noise' color
    (assumed to be the least frequent). Replaces the noise color pixels with the
    locally dominant pattern color from the corresponding row or column, depending
    on the identified overall pattern orientation (row-based or column-based).
