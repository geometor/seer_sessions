Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. In all examples, the input grid contains a few pixels of certain colors scattered within larger areas of other colors. The output grid looks like the input grid but with these scattered "noise" pixels removed or replaced. The replacement color seems to be determined by the colors of the pixels immediately surrounding the noise pixel.

*   **Example 1:** The input has a green background with scattered yellow pixels. The output is entirely green.
*   **Example 2:** The input has a magenta background with scattered azure and green pixels. The output is entirely magenta.
*   **Example 3:** The input has areas of white and red, with scattered gray pixels. In the output, the gray pixels are replaced by either white or red, depending on their neighbors.

The core operation appears to be identifying the least frequent color(s) in the grid and replacing pixels of those colors based on their local neighborhood.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, representing the input and output states.
    properties:
      - height: Integer number of rows.
      - width: Integer number of columns.
      - pixels: Collection of pixel objects.
      - color_frequencies: A map of color values to their counts in the grid.

  - role: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - position: Coordinates (row, column).
      - color: An integer value from 0 to 9.
      - neighbours: Set of cardinally adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).

  - role: noise_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is one of the least frequent colors present in the entire input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Belongs to the set of minimum frequency colors.

  - role: non_noise_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is *not* one of the least frequent colors in the input grid.

process:
  - action: identify_noise_colors
    description: Calculate the frequency of each color in the input grid and identify the color(s) with the minimum frequency (count > 0).
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - set_of_noise_colors

  - action: analyze_neighborhood
    description: For a given noise pixel, find its cardinal neighbors and filter out any neighbors that are also noise pixels.
    inputs:
      - noise_pixel
      - input_grid
      - set_of_noise_colors
    outputs:
      - set_of_non_noise_neighbors

  - action: determine_replacement_color
    description: >
      Based on the non-noise neighbors of a noise pixel, determine the color that
      should replace the noise pixel. This is the most frequent color among the
      non-noise neighbors. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the
      highest numerical value among the tied colors is chosen.
    inputs:
      - set_of_non_noise_neighbors
    outputs:
      - replacement_color

  - action: replace_pixel_color
    description: Update the color of a specific pixel in a target grid (initially a copy of the input grid).
    inputs:
      - pixel_to_replace
      - replacement_color
      - target_grid
    outputs:
      - updated_target_grid

transformation:
  - goal: Transform the input grid into the output grid by replacing noise pixels.
  - steps:
      - Create a copy of the input grid (target_grid).
      - Perform `identify_noise_colors` on the input grid.
      - Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
      - If the current pixel is a `noise_pixel` (its color is in the `set_of_noise_colors`):
          - Perform `analyze_neighborhood` for this pixel.
          - Perform `determine_replacement_color` using the resulting non-noise neighbors.
          - Perform `replace_pixel_color` on the `target_grid` at the current pixel's position using the determined `replacement_color`.
      - Return the final `target_grid`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Color Frequencies:** Count the occurrences of each color (0-9) in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Noise Colors:** Determine the color(s) that appear least frequently in the grid (must appear at least once). These are designated as "noise" colors.
3.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid identical to the input grid. This will be modified to become the output.
4.  **Iterate and Replace:** Go through each pixel of the input grid, checking its color:
    *   **If the pixel's color is a noise color:**
        a.  **Examine Neighbors:** Identify the colors of its cardinal neighbors (pixels directly above, below, left, and right, staying within the grid boundaries).
        b.  **Filter Neighbors:** Ignore any neighbors whose colors are also noise colors. Consider only the "non-noise" neighbors.
        c.  **Find Majority Neighbor Color:** Count the occurrences of each color among the non-noise neighbors. Identify the color(s) that appear most frequently.
        d.  **Resolve Ties:** If only one color is most frequent, select that color. If there's a tie (multiple colors share the highest frequency), select the color with the largest numerical value among the tied colors.
        e.  **Update Output:** Change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the selected replacement color.
    *   **If the pixel's color is not a noise color:** Keep its color unchanged in the output grid.
5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid, after checking and potentially replacing all noise pixels, is the final output.
