            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. In all examples, the input grid contains a few pixels of certain colors scattered within larger areas of other colors. The output grid looks like the input grid but with these scattered \"noise\" pixels removed or replaced. The replacement color seems to be determined by the colors of the pixels immediately surrounding the noise pixel.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The input has a green background with scattered yellow pixels. The output is entirely green.\n*   **Example 2:** The input has a magenta background with scattered azure and green pixels. The output is entirely magenta.\n*   **Example 3:** The input has areas of white and red, with scattered gray pixels. In the output, the gray pixels are replaced by either white or red, depending on their neighbors.\n\nThe core operation appears to be identifying the least frequent color(s) in the grid and replacing pixels of those colors based on their local neighborhood.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
