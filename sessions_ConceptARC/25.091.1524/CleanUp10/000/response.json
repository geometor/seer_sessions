            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions (6x6 in these examples).\n2.  **Colors**: Only two colors are present: white (0) and red (2). White appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Input Features**: The input grids contain scattered red pixels, potentially forming larger shapes or lines. Notably, some inputs contain complete horizontal or vertical lines made entirely of red pixels, spanning the full width or height of the grid.\n4.  **Output Features**: The output grids are much sparser than the inputs. They only contain red pixels where the input grid had a complete horizontal line of red pixels or a complete vertical line of red pixels. All other pixels are white.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation identifies complete horizontal and vertical lines of red pixels in the input. These lines are preserved in their original positions in the output grid. All other red pixels from the input are changed to white in the output. The output is essentially the union of the complete horizontal and vertical red lines found in the input, overlaid on a white background.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
