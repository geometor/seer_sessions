task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - value_range: Pixels values are integers 0 (white) and 2 (red).
  background_color: White (0) seems to be the default or background color.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or red (2)
  - object_type: line
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - completeness: A line is 'complete' if it spans the entire width (horizontal) or height (vertical) of the grid without interruption (i.e., all pixels in the line are red).
relationships:
  - relationship_type: composition
    description: Lines are composed of contiguous red pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: complete horizontal red lines in the input grid.
  - action: identify
    target: complete vertical red lines in the input grid.
  - action: create
    target: output grid, initialized with all white pixels, matching input dimensions.
  - action: transfer
    source: identified complete horizontal red lines from input
    destination: corresponding rows in the output grid.
  - action: transfer
    source: identified complete vertical red lines from input
    destination: corresponding columns in the output grid.
  - action: ignore/remove
    target: any red pixel in the input that is not part of a complete horizontal or vertical line. These become white in the output.
transformation_goal: Preserve only the complete horizontal and vertical red lines from the input grid onto an otherwise white output grid of the same size.
