  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: White (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    colors: [Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4)] # Non-background colors observed across examples
    attributes:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: integer value (e.g., 2, 3, 4)
      - neighborhood: 8 adjacent pixels (Moore neighborhood)
      - isolated: Boolean flag (True if all neighbors are White(0)) # Relevant only for Case 2
relationships:
  - type: color_frequency
    description: Non-white colors have different counts within each input grid.
    property: count
  - type: distinct_color_count
    description: The number of unique non-background colors present in the grid.
    property: count
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: Pixels have neighbors (up, down, left, right, diagonals).
    property: Moore neighborhood

      - name: identify_min_frequency_colors
        description: Find the non-background color(s) with the minimum frequency.
        inputs: [input_grid]
        outputs: [target_colors] # Set of one or more colors
      - name: remove_all_target_pixels
        description: Change *all* pixels matching any target_color to the background color (White 0).
        inputs: [input_grid, target_colors]
        outputs: [output_grid]
  - condition: Number of distinct non-background colors == 1
    actions:
      - name: identify_single_color
        description: Identify the only non-background color present.
        inputs: [input_grid]
        outputs: [target_color] # Single color
      - name: remove_isolated_target_pixels
        description: For each pixel of the target_color, check its 8 neighbors. If all neighbors are background (White 0), change the pixel to background. Otherwise, keep it.
        inputs: [input_grid, target_color]

  - condition: Number of distinct non-background colors == 0
    actions:
      - name: no_change
        description: The grid remains unchanged.
        inputs: [input_grid]
        outputs: [output_grid] # Identical to input_grid
