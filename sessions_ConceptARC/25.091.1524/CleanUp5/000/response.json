            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both examples involve input and output grids of the same dimensions. The grids contain pixels of different colors, primarily a White (0) background with scattered pixels of other colors (Red (2) and Green (3) in the first example, Yellow (4) in the second).\n*   **Colors:** The colors present are White (0), Red (2), Green (3), and Yellow (4). White appears to be the background color.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. The core change involves removing *some* of the non-White pixels by changing them to the White background color.\n*   **Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1`, all Green (3) pixels are removed (turned White), while all Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_2`, *some* Yellow (4) pixels are removed (turned White), while others remain. The Yellow pixels that are removed appear to be those that have no adjacent neighbors (including diagonals) of *any* non-White color. The Yellow pixels that remain have at least one non-White neighbor.\n*   **Inference:** Combining these observations, the rule seems to target specific colors for potential removal. In `train_1`, Green is targeted and removed because all its instances are isolated from other non-White pixels. Red is not targeted. In `train_2`, Yellow is targeted, and only its isolated instances are removed. This suggests a rule based on color properties (perhaps which color is least frequent?) and connectivity/isolation. The least frequent non-White color seems to be the target. If a pixel of the target color is isolated (all 8 neighbors are White), it is removed (changed to White). Other pixels are unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

After checking all pixels, the final state of the output grid is the result of the transformation."
