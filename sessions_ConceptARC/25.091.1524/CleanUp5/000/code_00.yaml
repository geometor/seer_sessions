grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: White (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    colors: [Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4)] # Non-background colors observed
    attributes:
      - position: (row, column)
      - color: integer value (2, 3, or 4)
      - neighborhood: 8 adjacent pixels (Moore neighborhood)
      - isolated: Boolean flag (True if all neighbors are White(0))
relationships:
  - type: color_frequency
    description: Non-white colors have different counts within each input grid.
    property: count
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: Pixels have neighbors (up, down, left, right, diagonals).
    property: Moore neighborhood
actions:
  - name: identify_target_color
    description: Find the non-White color with the minimum frequency in the input grid.
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [target_color]
  - name: check_isolation
    description: Determine if a pixel of the target color has only White neighbors.
    inputs: [pixel_position, input_grid]
    outputs: [is_isolated]
  - name: modify_pixel
    description: Change the color of isolated target pixels to White.
    inputs: [pixel_position, target_color, is_isolated]
    outputs: [modified_pixel_color]
    condition: pixel color == target_color AND is_isolated == True
transformation_rule:
  - description: Pixels of the least frequent non-White color are removed if they are isolated.
  - input: input_grid
  - steps:
      - Count frequencies of all non-White colors.
      - Identify the color(s) with the minimum frequency (target_color(s)).
      - Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
      - For each pixel in the input grid:
          - If the pixel's color is one of the target_colors:
              - Check its 8 neighbors in the *input* grid.
              - If all neighbors are White (0):
                  - Set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to White (0).
              - Else (pixel is not isolated):
                  - Keep the original color in the output grid (already copied).
          - Else (pixel color is not a target_color):
              - Keep the original color in the output grid (already copied).
  - output: output_grid
