Green is less frequent. The expected output removes *all* Green pixels, regardless of isolation. The code, however, applied the isolation rule derived from Example 2, incorrectly leaving some non-isolated Green pixels.\n*   **Example 2 Success:** The input has only one non-background color (Yellow=4). The expected output removes only the *isolated* Yellow pixels. The code correctly implemented this specific case.\n\nThe strategy needs refinement to incorporate this conditional logic: apply a different rule depending on whether there is one unique non-background color or multiple.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
