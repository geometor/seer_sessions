These objects vary in shape (lines, rectangles, single pixels) and position. The output grid is smaller than the input and contains only one of the two colored objects from the input. The key transformation seems to be selecting one of the two objects based on a positional criterion and then cropping the grid to the minimal bounding box of the selected object. By comparing the objects' positions across examples, the object whose top-most pixel appears highest in the grid (minimum row index) is selected for the output. If both objects started on the same row (not shown in examples, but a logical consideration), the one starting further to the left (minimum column index) would likely be chosen. The output grid perfectly frames the selected object.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
