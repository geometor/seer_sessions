The object's shape varies (square, rectangle, pyramid-like).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid. The background remains white. The non-white object is mostly the same color as in the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs in the topmost row occupied by the non-white object. All pixels belonging to the object *in that specific row* are changed to red (2). Pixels below this topmost row retain their original color.\n4.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and extent of the object are preserved, only the color of its top row changes.\n5.  **Color Independence:** The original color of the object (yellow, orange, green) does not seem to affect the transformation outcome, other than identifying which pixels belong to the object. The target color for the top row is consistently red (2).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
