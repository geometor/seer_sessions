Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single contiguous object made of pixels of another color (yellow=4, orange=7, green=3). The object's shape varies (square, rectangle, pyramid-like).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid. The background remains white. The non-white object is mostly the same color as in the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs in the topmost row occupied by the non-white object. All pixels belonging to the object *in that specific row* are changed to red (2). Pixels below this topmost row retain their original color.
4.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and extent of the object are preserved, only the color of its top row changes.
5.  **Color Independence:** The original color of the object (yellow, orange, green) does not seem to affect the transformation outcome, other than identifying which pixels belong to the object. The target color for the top row is consistently red (2).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid Size: 8x8
      Background Color: white (0)
      Objects:
        - Shape: square (3x3)
          Color: yellow (4)
          Location: Starts at row 3, col 1
      Output:
        Grid Size: 8x8
        Background Color: white (0)
        Objects:
          - Shape: modified square (3x3)
            Top Row Color: red (2) at row 3
            Remaining Rows Color: yellow (4) at rows 4, 5
            Location: Starts at row 3, col 1
  - Input:
      Grid Size: 10x10
      Background Color: white (0)
      Objects:
        - Shape: rectangle (5x8)
          Color: orange (7)
          Location: Starts at row 2, col 1
      Output:
        Grid Size: 10x10
        Background Color: white (0)
        Objects:
          - Shape: modified rectangle (5x8)
            Top Row Color: red (2) at row 2
            Remaining Rows Color: orange (7) at rows 3, 4, 5, 6
            Location: Starts at row 2, col 1
  - Input:
      Grid Size: 8x8
      Background Color: white (0)
      Objects:
        - Shape: pyramid/triangle-like
          Color: green (3)
          Location: Starts at row 1, col 3 (topmost pixel)
      Output:
        Grid Size: 8x8
        Background Color: white (0)
        Objects:
          - Shape: modified pyramid/triangle-like
            Top Row Color: red (2) at row 1
            Remaining Rows Color: green (3) at rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
            Location: Starts at row 1, col 3
Transformation:
  Action: Color Change
  Target: Topmost row of the non-white object
  Condition: Pixels must belong to the non-white object.
  New Color: red (2)
  Other Pixels: Remain unchanged from the input.
Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The location of the object remains the same.
  - The transformation identifies the object based on its color being non-white.
  - The transformation identifies the target row based on the minimum row index containing a non-white pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. These constitute the "object".
3.  Find the minimum row index among all the identified non-white pixels. This is the "topmost row" of the object.
4.  Iterate through each column of the identified topmost row in the input grid.
5.  For each pixel in this row, check if its color is non-white (i.e., it belongs to the object).
6.  If a pixel in the topmost row belongs to the object, change its color in the output grid to red (2).
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid (including pixels in the topmost row that were originally white, and all pixels in other rows) unchanged from their initial copied state.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
