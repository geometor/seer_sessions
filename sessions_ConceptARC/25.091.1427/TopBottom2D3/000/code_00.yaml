Transformation:
  Action: Color Change
  Target: Topmost row of the non-white object
  Condition: Pixels must belong to the non-white object.
  New Color: red (2)
  Other Pixels: Remain unchanged from the input.
Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The location of the object remains the same.
  - The transformation identifies the object based on its color being non-white.
  - The transformation identifies the target row based on the minimum row index containing a non-white pixel.
