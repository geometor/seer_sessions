task_description: Identify and keep only the object(s) that extend to the lowest row(s) in the grid, removing all other objects.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
    properties:
      - height: Integer (number of rows)
      - width: Integer (number of columns)
      - pixels: Values from 0 (white) to 9.

  - element: object
    description: A contiguous group of non-white pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer (1-9)
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - lowest_row_index: The maximum row index occupied by any pixel of the object.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are located at different positions within the grid. Their relative vertical position is key.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_objects

  - action: find_lowest_extent
    description: For each identified object, determine its lowest_row_index.
    inputs: object
    outputs: lowest_row_index

  - action: find_maximum_lowest_extent
    description: Find the maximum value among the lowest_row_indices of all objects.
    inputs: list_of_lowest_row_indices
    outputs: max_lowest_row

  - action: filter_objects
    description: Select objects whose lowest_row_index equals the max_lowest_row.
    inputs: list_of_objects, max_lowest_row
    outputs: list_of_kept_objects

  - action: generate_output
    description: Create an output grid containing only the pixels of the kept_objects, with all other pixels set to white (0).
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions, list_of_kept_objects
    outputs: output_grid
