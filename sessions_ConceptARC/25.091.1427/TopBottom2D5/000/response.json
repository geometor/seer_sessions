            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors (represented by integers 0-9). White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct, connected shapes or \"objects\". In each example, the input grid contains multiple objects of various colors and shapes.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively removing some objects from the input grid to produce the output grid. The objects that remain in the output retain their original color, shape, and position relative to the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the objects present in the input and output across the examples, a pattern emerges related to their vertical position.\n    *   In `train_1`, the blue and red objects in the upper part are removed, while the magenta object in the lower part is kept.\n    *   In `train_2`, the green, orange, and azure objects are removed, while the red object, which occupies the lowest rows, is kept.\n    *   In `train_3`, the yellow and azure objects are removed, while the two green objects, which occupy the lowest rows, are kept.\n5.  **Rule:** The rule appears to be: identify all distinct objects in the input. Find the object(s) that extend furthest down (i.e., have pixels in the row with the highest index). Keep only these lowest object(s); remove all others by changing their pixels to white. If multiple objects share the same lowest row extent, all of them are kept.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
