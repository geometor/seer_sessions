task_structure:
  - description: Input grid contains a white background (0) and exactly two distinct non-white objects.
  - examples: 4 pairs provided.
  - goal: Select one of the two objects based on its vertical position and output it cropped to its bounding box.

object_properties:
  - object: A contiguous area of pixels with the same non-white color, where contiguity is defined by 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals).
  - attributes:
      - color: The pixel value (e.g., 3 for green, 4 for yellow).
      - pixels: A list of (row, col) coordinates belonging to the object.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) containing all the object's pixels.
      - top_row_index: The minimum row index among all pixels of the object.

relationships_and_actions:
  - count: There are always exactly two non-white objects (using 8-way connectivity) in the input.
  - comparison: The top_row_index of the two objects is compared.
  - selection: The object with the smaller top_row_index (the higher object) is selected.
  - transformation: The selected object is extracted.
  - output_generation: The output grid consists of the selected object, cropped to its bounding box. Pixels within the bounding box that are not part of the selected object are filled with the background color (white, 0).

assumptions:
  - There will always be exactly two non-white objects when using 8-way connectivity.
  - The two objects will always have different minimum row indices (no ties).
