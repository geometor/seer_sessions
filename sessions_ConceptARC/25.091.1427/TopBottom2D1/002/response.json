            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code failed on `train_4` because the `find_objects` function used 4-directional connectivity to identify contiguous pixels. In `train_4`, the yellow shape requires 8-directional (including diagonals) connectivity to be recognized as a single object. Using 4-directional connectivity resulted in the yellow shape being split into multiple objects, causing the `len(objects) != 2` check to fail and return an empty grid.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the object identification logic to use 8-directional connectivity. We will then re-verify that this updated logic correctly identifies exactly two objects in all training examples and that the rule of selecting the object with the minimum top row index holds for all cases.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution assuming 8-way connectivity for object definition:\n"
