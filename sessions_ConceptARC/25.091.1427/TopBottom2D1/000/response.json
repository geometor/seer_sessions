The objects have different colors (yellow and green in the examples) and varying shapes. The output grid contains only one of these objects, cropped to its minimal bounding box. The core task is to identify the rule used to select which of the two objects is kept for the output. Comparing the examples, the selection criterion appears to be based on the vertical position of the objects: the object that appears higher up (i.e., has the minimum row index for any of its pixels) is the one selected.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Populate the output grid by copying the pixels corresponding to the selected object from the input grid, adjusting their coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box.
