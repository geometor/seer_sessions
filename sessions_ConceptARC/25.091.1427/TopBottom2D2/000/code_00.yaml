task_description: Extracts the bounding box of the lowest object in the input grid.
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - background_color: white (0).
  - objects:
    - definition: Contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
    - properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9).
      - pixels: Set of (row, col) coordinates.
      - vertical_extent: Maximum row index occupied by any pixel of the object.
      - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle containing all pixels of the object (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - multiple_objects: Typically two distinct colored objects per input grid.
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - content: Contains only the selected object and potentially some original background pixels within its bounding box.
  - size: Determined by the bounding box of the selected object.
transformation:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  - determine_lowest_object: For each object, find its maximum row index. Select the object with the highest maximum row index overall.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Compute the minimum and maximum row and column indices for the selected (lowest) object.
  - extract_subgrid: Create the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid within the calculated bounding box of the selected object.
relationship: The output is a subgrid of the input, defined by the bounding box of the object that appears lowest vertically in the input grid.
