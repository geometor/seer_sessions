The objects have various shapes (rectangles, T-shapes, L-shapes, etc.). The output grid is always smaller than the input grid and contains only one of the objects present in the input. The key transformation seems to involve identifying which object from the input should be preserved in the output and then extracting the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) containing that specific object. The selection criterion appears to be based on the vertical position of the objects; the object that extends furthest down (has the largest maximum row index) is the one selected.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Treat each contiguous block of the same color as a single object.\n2.  For each identified object, determine the set of coordinates `(row, column)` occupied by its pixels.\n3.  Find the maximum `row` index among the coordinates for each object. This represents how far down the grid the object extends.\n4.  Compare the maximum `row` indices of all objects found in step 1. Select the object that has the largest maximum `row` index (i.e., the object that extends furthest down the grid).\n5.  Once the target object is selected, determine its bounding box: find the minimum `row`, maximum `row`, minimum `column`, and maximum `column` among all coordinates belonging to this specific object.\n6.  Construct the output grid by extracting the rectangular subgrid from the input grid defined by these bounding box coordinates (from `min_row` to `max_row` inclusive, and from `min_col` to `max_col` inclusive)."
