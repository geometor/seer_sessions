*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying a specific "target" color from the input grid and then changing the color of all other non-background objects to match this target color. The shapes and positions of the objects remain unchanged. The target color is determined by the non-white pixel located at the bottom-most, right-most position in the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Examples:
      - Example: train_1
        Input: Contains a green hollow rectangle and a red hollow rectangle on a white background.
        Output: The green rectangle changes to red. The red rectangle remains red.
        TargetColorDetermination: The red object is at the bottom-right. Target color is red (2).
        Transformation: All non-red objects change to red.
      - Example: train_2
        Input: Contains yellow, blue, green, and gray 'L' shapes on a white background.
        Output: The yellow, blue, and green shapes change to gray. The gray shape remains gray.
        TargetColorDetermination: The gray object contains the bottom-most pixels. Target color is gray (5).
        Transformation: All non-gray objects change to gray.
      - Example: train_3
        Input: Contains magenta, blue, and azure scattered shapes on a white background.
        Output: The magenta and blue shapes change to azure. The azure shape remains azure.
        TargetColorDetermination: The azure object contains the bottom-most, right-most non-white pixel. Target color is azure (8).
        Transformation: All non-azure objects change to azure.
    GridProperties:
      - Size: Constant between input and output.
      - Background: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
    Objects:
      - Definition: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels (though contiguity isn't strictly necessary for the rule, just color identification).
      - Shape: Unchanged between input and output.
      - Position: Unchanged between input and output.
      - Color: Changes based on the transformation rule.
    TransformationRule:
      - Identify Target Color: Find all non-white pixels. Among these, find the one(s) with the maximum row index. Among those, find the one(s) with the maximum column index. The color of this pixel is the target color.
      - Apply Color Change: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is non-white and its color is not the target color, change its color to the target color in the output grid. Otherwise, keep the original color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (color 0).
    2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all these non-white pixels.
    3.  Find the maximum row index among these non-white pixels.
    4.  Filter the non-white pixels to keep only those located at the maximum row index.
    5.  Among the filtered pixels, find the maximum column index.
    6.  Identify the pixel located at the maximum row index and maximum column index found in the previous steps. Determine its color; this is the "target color".
    7.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    8.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    9.  If the current pixel's color is not white (0) and is not equal to the target color, change the corresponding pixel's color in the output grid to the target color.
    10. If the current pixel's color is white (0) or is equal to the target color, keep its color unchanged in the output grid.
    11. The modified grid is the final output.
