The red rectangle remains red.\n        TargetColorDetermination: The red object is at the bottom-right. Target color is red (2).\n        Transformation: All non-red objects change to red.\n      - Example: train_2\n        Input: Contains yellow, blue, green, and gray 'L' shapes on a white background.\n        Output: The yellow, blue, and green shapes change to gray. The gray shape remains gray.\n        TargetColorDetermination: The gray object contains the bottom-most pixels. Target color is gray (5).\n        Transformation: All non-gray objects change to gray.\n      - Example: train_3\n        Input: Contains magenta, blue, and azure scattered shapes on a white background.\n        Output: The magenta and blue shapes change to azure. The azure shape remains azure.\n        TargetColorDetermination: The azure object contains the bottom-most, right-most non-white pixel.

Among these, find the one(s) with the maximum row index. Among those, find the one(s) with the maximum column index. The color of this pixel is the target color.\n      - Apply Color Change: Iterate through the input grid.
