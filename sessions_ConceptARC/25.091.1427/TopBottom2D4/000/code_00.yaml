Task: Selectively keep colored objects from the input grid based on quantity and properties.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
    - Properties:
      - Color: The integer value (1-9).
      - Pixels: Set of (row, col) coordinates.
      - Area: Count of pixels in the object.
      - Position: Min/Max row and column indices.
      - Touches_Top_Border: True if any pixel has row index 0.
      - Touches_Bottom_Border: True if any pixel has row index (grid_height - 1).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Content: Subset of input objects, or only the largest object(s), placed on a white background.

Derived_Features:
  - Object_Count: Total number of distinct colored objects in the input grid.
  - Max_Object_Area: The maximum area among all objects in the input grid.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Condition: Based on Object_Count.
  - Case_1 (Object_Count <= 3):
    - Action: Identify objects with Max_Object_Area.
    - Result: Keep only these largest objects; replace all other pixels with white.
  - Case_2 (Object_Count > 3):
    - Action: Identify objects where Touches_Top_Border is True OR Touches_Bottom_Border is True.
    - Result: Remove these border-touching objects (replace their pixels with white); keep all other objects unchanged.
