            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are grids containing a white background (color 0) and several distinct, contiguous objects made of single non-white colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are grids of the same dimensions as the corresponding inputs. They also contain a white background and some of the objects from the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be selective removal of objects based on their position within the grid.\n4.  **Object Identification:** Objects are contiguous areas of the same non-white color.\n5.  **Key Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs, objects that touch either the top edge (row 0) or the bottom edge (the last row) of the grid appear to be removed (replaced by white pixels) in the output. Objects that do not touch the top or bottom edges remain unchanged in the output.\n6.  **Example 1 Analysis:** The green object touches the top edge. The orange object does *not* touch the bottom edge (it ends at row 11, grid height 14). The yellow object touches neither top nor bottom edge. The output removes the green object (touching top) and the orange object (??). Ah, let's re-examine example 1.\n    *   Input 1: Green (rows 0-2), Yellow (rows 4-7), Orange (rows 9-11). Height = 14 (rows 0-13).\n    *   Output 1: Only Yellow (rows 4-7).\n    *   Green touches row 0. Orange does *not* touch row 13. Yellow touches neither. Why is Orange removed? Maybe the rule is slightly different.\n7.  **Example 2 Analysis:** Blue (rows 0-1) touches top. Green (rows 14-15) touches bottom. Height = 16 (rows 0-15). The other objects (Orange, Azure, Magenta, Gray) do not touch the top or bottom edges. The output removes Blue and Green, keeping the others. This fits the top/bottom touch rule.\n8.  **Example 3 Analysis:** Red (rows 0-2) touches top. Yellow (rows 10-12) touches bottom. Height = 13 (rows 0-12). Maroon (rows 5-8) touches neither. The output removes Red and Yellow, keeping Maroon. This also fits the top/bottom touch rule.\n\n**Revisiting Example 1 & Hypothesis Refinement:**\n\nExample 1 seems inconsistent with the simple \"remove if touching top or bottom border\" rule because the orange object, which doesn't touch the bottom border, is also removed.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"largest object\" idea from the scratchpad, but maybe combined with position.\n\n*   Example 1: Areas: Green (9), Yellow (12), Orange (9). Max area = 12 (Yellow). Output keeps Yellow.\n*   Example 2: Areas: Blue (4), Orange (24), Azure (4), Magenta (24), Gray (12), Green (4). Max area = 24 (Orange, Magenta). Output keeps Orange, Azure, Magenta, Gray. This definitely isn't \"keep only max area\".\n*   Example 3: Areas: Red (5), Maroon (16), Yellow (5). Max area = 16 (Maroon). Output keeps Maroon.\n\nExamples 1 and 3 follow a \"keep only the object(s) with the largest area\" rule. Example 2 does not. This suggests there might be two different conditions or the rule is more complex.\n\nCould it be related to the *number* of distinct objects?\n*   Ex 1: 3 objects -> Keep 1 (Largest)\n*   Ex 2: 6 objects -> Keep 4\n*   Ex 3: 3 objects -> Keep 1 (Largest)\n\nWhat if the rule is: \"If there are 3 or fewer distinct colored objects, keep only the object(s) with the largest area. Otherwise (if there are more than 3 objects), remove objects touching the top or bottom border\"?\n\nLet's test this combined hypothesis:\n*   **Example 1:** 3 objects. Max area is 12 (Yellow). Keep Yellow. -> Matches output.\n*   **Example 2:** 6 objects (> 3). Remove objects touching top/bottom borders. Blue touches top, Green touches bottom. Remove Blue and Green. Keep Orange, Azure, Magenta, Gray. -> Matches output.\n*   **Example 3:** 3 objects. Max area is 16 (Maroon). Keep Maroon. -> Matches output.\n\nThis combined hypothesis seems to fit all three examples.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
