The modification appears to be localized to a specific region of the grid. In all examples, changes occur only within the top-left 3x3 subgrid. Specifically, any non-white pixel (colors 1, 2, 4, 8 in the examples) found within this 3x3 area is changed to gray (color 5). White pixels (color 0) within this area, and all pixels outside this area, remain unchanged.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
