## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves modifying a 6x6 input grid to produce a 6x6 output grid. The modification appears to be localized to a specific region of the grid. In all examples, changes occur only within the top-left 3x3 subgrid. Specifically, any non-white pixel (colors 1, 2, 4, 8 in the examples) found within this 3x3 area is changed to gray (color 5). White pixels (color 0) within this area, and all pixels outside this area, remain unchanged.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_description: Modify pixels within a specific region based on their color.
grid_properties:
  size: 6x6 (consistent across all examples)
background_color: white (0)
target_region:
  type: Subgrid
  location: Top-left corner
  dimensions: 3x3
  coordinates: rows 0-2, columns 0-2
transformation_rule:
  condition: Pixel is within the target_region AND pixel color is NOT white (0).
  action: Change the pixel color to gray (5).
  otherwise: Pixel color remains unchanged.
unaffected_elements:
  - White pixels within the target_region.
  - All pixels outside the target_region.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input grid (rows 0, 1, 2 and columns 0, 1, 2).
2.  Iterate through each pixel within this 3x3 subgrid.
3.  For each pixel in the subgrid, check if its color is not white (0).
4.  If the pixel's color is not white, change its color to gray (5) in the output grid.
5.  If the pixel's color is white, keep its color unchanged in the output grid.
6.  Copy all pixels located outside the top-left 3x3 subgrid directly from the input grid to the output grid without any modification.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Modify pixels within the top-left 3x3 subgrid based on their color.
If a pixel within this 3x3 region is not white (0), change its color to gray (5).
Pixels outside this region, and white pixels inside this region, remain unchanged.
"""

def transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Applies a transformation to the input grid: changes non-white pixels
    in the top-left 3x3 subgrid to gray (5).

    Args:
        input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A numpy array representing the transformed output grid.
    """
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify
    # This ensures pixels outside the target region are preserved
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    region_width = 3

    # Iterate through each pixel within the top-left 3x3 subgrid

                # output_grid was initialized as a copy of input_grid.

    # Return the modified grid
