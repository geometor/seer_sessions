            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input grids consist of a white background (color 0) with several distinct, solid, horizontal rectangular blocks of different colors stacked vertically. The blocks may have different heights and widths and might not be perfectly aligned horizontally.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are the same size as the corresponding input grids and also contain a white background with the same set of colored rectangular blocks.\n3.  **Key Change:** The primary change between input and output is the vertical arrangement of these colored blocks.\n4.  **Pattern Observation (Example 1):**\n    *   Input Order (Top to Bottom): Green (rows 1-2), Red (3-4), Yellow (5-6), Blue (7-8).\n    *   Output Order (Top to Bottom): Blue (1-2), Red (3-4), Yellow (5-6), Green (7-8).\n    *   Observation: The top block (Green) and the bottom block (Blue) have swapped vertical positions. The middle blocks (Red, Yellow) retain their positions relative to each other and the overall structure.\n5.  **Pattern Observation (Example 2):**\n    *   Input Order (Top to Bottom): Orange (rows 0-1), Red (2-3), Magenta (4-7), Green (8-11).\n    *   Output Order (Top to Bottom): Green (0-3), Red (4-5), Magenta (6-9), Orange (10-11).\n    *   Observation: Again, the top block (Orange) and the bottom block (Green) have swapped their positions in the vertical sequence. The intermediate blocks (Red, Magenta) maintain their relative order but shift vertically to accommodate the swapped blocks. The entire stack seems to be reconstructed based on the new top/bottom swap.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
