task_description: Swaps the vertical positions of the top-most and bottom-most colored rectangular blocks within their vertical stack, reconstructing the stack accordingly.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  object: A maximal, contiguous, horizontal rectangle of a single non-background color.

    input_objects:
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 3}
        position: {top_row: 1, left_col: 3}
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 3}
        position: {top_row: 3, left_col: 3}
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 3}
        position: {top_row: 5, left_col: 3}
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 3}
        position: {top_row: 7, left_col: 3}
    vertical_stack:
      order: [green, red, yellow, blue]
      top_row: 1
      bottom_row: 8
    output_stack:
      order: [blue, red, yellow, green] # Swap first and last
      reconstruction: blue(1-2), red(3-4), yellow(5-6), green(7-8) # Based on original heights

  example_2:
    input_objects:
      - color: 7 (orange)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 2}
        position: {top_row: 0, left_col: 4}
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: {height: 2, width: 4}
        position: {top_row: 2, left_col: 3}
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        shape: {height: 4, width: 6}
        position: {top_row: 4, left_col: 2}
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: {height: 4, width: 8}
        position: {top_row: 8, left_col: 1}
    vertical_stack:
      order: [orange, red, magenta, green]
      top_row: 0
      bottom_row: 11
    output_stack:
      order: [green, red, magenta, orange] # Swap first and last
      reconstruction: green(0-3), red(4-5), magenta(6-9), orange(10-11) # Based on original heights

transformation:
  - Identify all distinct colored rectangular blocks.
  - Determine their vertical order based on top row index.
  - Identify the overall vertical extent (top-most row to bottom-most row) of the stack of blocks.
  - Identify the top block (first in the vertical order) and the bottom block (last in the vertical order).
  - Swap these two blocks in the order sequence.
  - Reconstruct the stack vertically in the output grid:
    - Start at the original top row of the stack.
    - Place each block from the (potentially modified) sequence one below the other, using its original shape (height, width), color, and horizontal position (left column).
    - Ensure the background color fills the rest of the grid.
