            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves identifying distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color) within an input grid. It appears there are typically multiple objects of different colors. The output grid seems to be a subgrid extracted from the input, containing only one of the original objects. The core logic seems to involve selecting one specific object from the input based on its position and then cropping the grid to the bounding box of that selected object.\n\n*   In `train_1`, there's a red 'H' shape and a yellow 'H' shape. The yellow 'H' is selected, and its bounding box becomes the output.\n*   In `train_2`, there's an azure 'T' shape and an orange 'L' shape. The orange 'L' is selected, and its bounding box becomes the output.\n*   In `train_3`, there's a green 'T' shape and an azure 'H' shape. The azure 'H' is selected, and its bounding box becomes the output.\n*   In `train_4`, there's a single blue pixel and a single gray pixel. The gray pixel is selected, and its bounding box (1x1) becomes the output.\n\nComparing the positions of the selected objects versus the non-selected ones, the selected object consistently appears lower down in the input grid. Specifically, the topmost row occupied by the selected object seems to be the lowest (highest row index) among all objects present.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Each object has a single color.\n\nOutput:\n  - Grid: A subgrid derived from the input.\n  - Contains: Exactly one of the objects from the input grid, cropped to its minimal bounding box.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Identify_Objects: Find all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n  - Determine_Topmost_Row: For each identified object, find the minimum row index occupied by any of its pixels.\n  - Select_Lowest_Object: Compare the topmost row indices of all objects. Select the object whose topmost row index is the maximum (i.e., the object that starts lowest down in the grid). If there's a tie (multiple objects start on the same lowest row), the examples don't explicitly cover this, but assume any one of the tied objects could be selected (or perhaps there's a secondary rule not yet revealed). However, in the given examples, there are no ties for the lowest starting row.\n  - Extract_Bounding_Box: Determine the minimal bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) that encloses all pixels of the selected object.\n  - Generate_Output: Create a new grid corresponding to the calculated bounding box, containing only the pixels of the selected object (maintaining their relative positions) and potentially white background pixels within that box if the object is not rectangular itself (though the examples show extraction without padding, just the object pixels within the box). The examples seem to show just the object pixels relative to the top-left corner of their bounding box. Let's refine: The output grid dimensions match the bounding box size, and the pixel values are copied from the input grid within that bounding box, relative to the box's top-left corner.\n```"
