Identify the most frequent non-white color (dominant color) in the input grid.
Determine the bounding box enclosing all pixels of the dominant color.
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel's color is non-white, is not the dominant color, 
and its location falls within the calculated bounding box, copy its color to the 
corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, the output grid pixel remains white (0).
