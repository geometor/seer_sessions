The grids contain pixels of various colors (represented by integers 0-9), with white (0) being the background.\n2.  **Color Filtering:** The output grid contains significantly fewer colored pixels than the input grid. Specifically, only a subset of the original non-white colors and pixels remains.\n3.  **Dominant Color:** In both examples, one non-white color appears more frequently than others in the input grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, yellow (4) is the most frequent non-white color.\n    *   In `train_2`, magenta (6) is the most frequent non-white color.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The pixels that *remain* in the output grid seem to be related spatially to the locations of the *dominant* color pixels in the input grid.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** The locations of the dominant color pixels define a rectangular area (a bounding box).\n6.  **Filtering Logic:** It appears the transformation identifies the most frequent non-white color (dominant color). It then determines the bounding box containing all pixels of this dominant color. Finally, it keeps only those pixels from the *other* non-white colors that fall *within* this bounding box. All pixels of the dominant color are removed, and all pixels outside the bounding box are removed (turned white).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Analyze the input grid to count the occurrences of each non-white color.\n3.  Identify the 'dominant color', which is the non-white color with the highest pixel count. (If there's a tie, the behavior isn't defined by these examples, but assume one color will have the strictly highest count).\n4.  Find all locations (row, column pairs) in the input grid where the dominant color appears.\n5.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all these locations. This gives you the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column containing the dominant color.\n6.  Iterate through every pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row (`r`) and column (`c`).\n7.  For each input pixel, check the following conditions:\n    a.  Is the pixel's color *not* white (0)?\n    b.  Is the pixel's color *not* the dominant color identified in step 3?\n    c.  Is the pixel's row (`r`) greater than or equal to the minimum row and less than or equal to the maximum row of the bounding box found in step 5?\n    d.  Is the pixel's column (`c`) greater than or equal to the minimum column and less than or equal to the maximum column of the bounding box found in step 5?\n8.  If *all* conditions (7a, 7b, 7c, 7d) are true, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to be the same as the color of the input pixel at (`r`, `c`).\n9.  If any condition in step 7 is false, the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains white (0).\n10. After checking all input pixels, the output grid contains the final result."
