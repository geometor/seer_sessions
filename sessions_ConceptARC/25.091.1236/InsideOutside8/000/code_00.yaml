    rule: |
      Keep only input pixels that meet all conditions:
      1. Color is not white (0).
      2. Color is not the dominant_color_value.
      3. Pixel location (row, col) is within the bounding_box (inclusive).
    otherwise: Pixel becomes white (0) in the output.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: Pixels retained in the output must lie within the bounding box defined by the most frequent color in the input.
  - type: color_exclusion
    description: The most frequent color itself is always excluded from the output.
