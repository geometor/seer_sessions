One of these non-background colors appears to form larger shapes or patterns, while the other(s) appear as scattered, often single, pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain the dimensions of the input grids. The background color (white, 0) and the scattered/less frequent non-background color(s) are preserved. The pixels belonging to the most frequent non-background color in the input are changed to the background color (white, 0) in the output.\n3.  **Transformation Identification:** The core transformation seems to be identifying the most frequent non-background color in the input grid and removing it by replacing its pixels with the background color (white, 0). All other pixels retain their original colors.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
