## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid based on the frequency of non-background colors.

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and at least two other colors. One of these non-background colors appears to form larger shapes or patterns, while the other(s) appear as scattered, often single, pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain the dimensions of the input grids. The background color (white, 0) and the scattered/less frequent non-background color(s) are preserved. The pixels belonging to the most frequent non-background color in the input are changed to the background color (white, 0) in the output.
3.  **Transformation Identification:** The core transformation seems to be identifying the most frequent non-background color in the input grid and removing it by replacing its pixels with the background color (white, 0). All other pixels retain their original colors.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Identify the most frequent non-background color in the input grid and replace all instances of that color with the background color (white, 0). Preserve all other colors.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
    properties:
      - height: The number of rows in the grid.
      - width: The number of columns in the grid.
      - colors: A set of unique integer values present in the grid.

  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer value from 0-9 representing the pixel's color.
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - is_background: Boolean, true if color is white (0), false otherwise.

relationships:
  - type: frequency
    description: The count of occurrences of each non-background color within the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The non-background color being counted.
      - count: The total number of pixels with that color.
  - type: most_frequent_non_background
    description: The non-background color with the highest count in the input grid. If there's a tie, further clarification might be needed, but the examples suggest a unique most frequent color.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find all unique colors present in the input grid.
  - action: count_colors
    description: Count the occurrences of each non-background color.
  - action: find_most_frequent
    description: Determine which non-background color has the highest count.
  - action: replace_color
    description: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel's color matches the most frequent non-background color, change its color to the background color (white, 0) in the output grid. Otherwise, copy the pixel's color directly to the output grid.

constants:
  - name: BACKGROUND_COLOR
    value: 0
    description: The integer value representing the background color (white).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-background (not white, 0) colors present in the input grid.
3.  Count the number of pixels for each unique non-background color identified in step 2.
4.  Determine the non-background color that has the highest count (the most frequent non-background color).
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's color matches the most frequent non-background color identified in step 4, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (white, 0).
    *   Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
