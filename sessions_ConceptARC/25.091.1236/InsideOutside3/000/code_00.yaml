task_description: Preserve either the single yellow pixel or all red pixels based on their spatial relationship.

components:
  - item: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - colors: white (0), red (2), yellow (4)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - item: Yellow Pixel
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - count: exactly 1 per input grid
      - location: (row, col) coordinates
  - item: Red Pixels
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - count: variable (one or more) per input grid
      - location: set of (row, col) coordinates

relationships_and_conditions:
  - relationship: Sharing Row/Column
    definition: A red pixel shares a row/column with the yellow pixel if its row index or column index matches the yellow pixel's.
    variable: sharing_red_pixels (set of red pixels satisfying this)
  - condition: Isolation Check
    check: Is the set 'sharing_red_pixels' empty?
    outcome_if_true: Keep Yellow Pixel Only
    outcome_if_false: Proceed to Directionality Check
  - condition: Directionality Check (applies only if 'sharing_red_pixels' is not empty)
    check: Are ALL pixels in 'sharing_red_pixels' located strictly East of the yellow pixel? (pixel.row == yellow.row AND pixel.col > yellow.col)
    outcome_if_true: Keep Yellow Pixel Only
    outcome_if_false: Keep All Red Pixels Only

actions:
  - name: Keep Yellow Pixel Only
    effect: Output grid contains only the yellow pixel at its original location; all other cells are background color.
  - name: Keep All Red Pixels Only
    effect: Output grid contains all original red pixels at their original locations; the position of the original yellow pixel becomes background color, as do all other non-red cells.
