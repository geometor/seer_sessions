White serves as the background color.\n2.  **Input Composition:** Each input grid contains exactly one yellow pixel and multiple red pixels scattered across the grid.\n3.  **Output Composition:** The output grid contains *either* only the original yellow pixel *or* all the original red pixels, with the remaining pixels being white (background). The pixel(s) that are kept retain their original positions.\n4.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves deciding whether to preserve the yellow pixel or the set of red pixels based on the spatial relationship between the yellow pixel and the red pixels.\n5.  **Identifying the Condition:** The decision hinges on whether any red pixels share the same row or column as the single yellow pixel.\n    *   If the yellow pixel is \"isolated\" (no red pixels in its row or column), the yellow pixel is kept, and all red pixels are removed. (Seen in train_1)\n    *   If the yellow pixel shares a row or column with one or more red pixels, a secondary condition applies based on the *relative direction* of these sharing red pixels.\n6.  **Secondary Condition (Directionality):**\n    *   If *all* red pixels sharing a row or column with the yellow pixel are located strictly to the *east* (same row, greater column index) of the yellow pixel, then only the yellow pixel is kept. (Seen in train_3)\n    *   If *any* red pixel sharing a row or column with the yellow pixel is located North, South, or West of it, or if there are sharing red pixels in multiple directions (e.g., one East, one West), then all original red pixels are kept, and the yellow pixel is removed.
