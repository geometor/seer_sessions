"""
Identify the background color (white, 0).
Find the largest connected object whose color is not the background color. This object is the 'frame'. Determine the minimum bounding box containing this frame.
Identify all pixels whose color is neither the background color nor the frame's color. These are the 'scattered pixels'.
Count how many of these 'scattered pixels' lie strictly outside the bounding box of the frame. Let this count be N.
Generate the output grid as an N x 1 grid (a vertical column N pixels high and 1 pixel wide) filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
