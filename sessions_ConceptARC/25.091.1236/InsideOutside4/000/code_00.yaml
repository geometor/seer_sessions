task_description: Analyze the input grid to find a single magenta pixel and determine if its enclosing shape's color dictates a change.
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9
      - location: (row, column)
  - element: target_pixel
    description: A single pixel with magenta color (6).
    location: Unique within the grid.
  - element: enclosing_shape
    description: The contiguous shape of non-white, non-magenta pixels directly bordering the white area containing the target_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the shape's pixels.
relationships:
  - relationship: containment
    description: The target_pixel (magenta) is located within a contiguous area of white pixels (0), which is in turn contained within the enclosing_shape.
actions:
  - action: find_target_pixel
    input: grid
    output: location of the magenta pixel (color 6).
  - action: find_enclosing_shape_color
    input: grid, location of target_pixel
    output: color of the shape directly enclosing the white area containing the target pixel.
    steps:
      - Start a flood fill (or similar connectivity analysis) from the target_pixel, traversing only through adjacent white pixels (0).
      - Identify all non-white pixels adjacent to the filled white area.
      - Determine the color of these adjacent pixels (assuming it's uniform for the immediate enclosure).
  - action: conditionally_change_pixel
    input: grid, location of target_pixel, color of enclosing_shape
    output: modified grid
    condition: If the enclosing_shape_color is blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4).
    effect: Change the pixel at target_pixel location to white (0).
    alternative_effect: If condition is not met, the grid remains unchanged.
