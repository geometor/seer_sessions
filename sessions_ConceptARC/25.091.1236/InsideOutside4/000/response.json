            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Key Pixel:** Each input grid contains exactly one magenta pixel (color 6). All other pixels are part of larger structures or background.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The only change observed between input and output grids occurs at the location of the magenta pixel. In some examples (train\\_2, train\\_4), it changes to white (color 0), while in others (train\\_1, train\\_3), it remains unchanged.\n4.  **Context Dependency:** The transformation (or lack thereof) seems dependent on the context surrounding the magenta pixel, specifically the color of the shape immediately enclosing the region where the magenta pixel resides.\n5.  **Enclosing Shape:** The magenta pixel is always located within a region of white pixels (color 0), which is itself enclosed by a shape of a different color. This colored shape appears to be the determining factor.\n6.  **Color Condition:** The change from magenta to white happens when the enclosing shape's color is blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4). No change occurs when the enclosing shape's color is green (3) or orange (7).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
