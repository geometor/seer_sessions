task_description: Correlate frame objects with counts of specific inner pixels.
components:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - Contains background pixels (white, 0).
      - Contains multiple distinct non-background objects.
      - Key objects are 'frames' (e.g., rectangular, L-shaped) made of a single color (e.g., blue, green).
      - Contains 'inner pixels' of a different color located within the area enclosed by the frames.
      - The 'inner pixel' color is consistent within one example but varies between examples.
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - Always has a height of 1.
      - Contains pixels whose colors match the 'frame' colors from the input.
      - The quantity of each color corresponds to the count of 'inner pixels' found inside the respective frame in the input.
relationship:
  - type: counting
    description: The number of times a frame's color appears in the output equals the number of 'inner pixels' of a specific target color found inside that frame in the input.
  - type: filtering
    description: Only counts from frames containing one or more 'inner pixels' contribute to the output. Frames with zero inner pixels are ignored.
  - type: ordering
    description: The sequence of colors in the output corresponds to the order of the frames in the input (e.g., by color index or spatial position, blue before green in examples).
actions:
  - identify_frames: Locate distinct contiguous non-background objects representing frames.
  - identify_inner_color: Determine the color of the pixels located inside the frames, excluding the frame color and background.
  - define_interior: For each frame, determine the spatial region considered 'inside'.
  - count_inner_pixels: For each frame, count the number of 'inner color' pixels within its interior.
  - construct_output: Create a 1D grid by concatenating repetitions of each frame's color according to its corresponding inner pixel count, maintaining order.
