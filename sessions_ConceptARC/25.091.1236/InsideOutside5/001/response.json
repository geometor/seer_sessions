Identify all distinct non-white objects (connected components of the same color) in the input grid.\n2. For each object, determine if it is contained within another object. An object 'A' is considered contained within object 'B' if all pixels of 'A' are within the bounding box of 'B', and no pixel of 'A' is adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel of 'B'.\n3. Identify objects that are contained within at least one other object.\n4. Identify objects that contain at least one other object.\n5. Select only those objects that are contained but do not themselves contain any other object (i.e., the innermost contained objects).\n6. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).\n7. Draw the selected innermost objects onto the output grid in their original positions and colors. Discard all other objects.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\" Get 8-connectivity neighbors within grid bounds \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef _find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\" Finds all connected components (objects) of non-background colors. \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    object_id_counter = 0\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    obj_coords.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, curr_r)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, curr_c)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, curr_r)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, curr_c)\n\n                    # Find neighbors of the same color using 4-connectivity for object definition\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                         nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                         if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                            not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                objects.append({\n                    'id': object_id_counter,\n                    'color': color,\n                    'coords': obj_coords,\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                })\n                object_id_counter += 1\n    return objects\n\ndef _is_strictly_contained(obj_a, obj_b, grid_shape):\n    \"\"\" Checks if obj_a is strictly contained within obj_b without touching. \"\"\"\n    coords_a = obj_a['coords']\n    coords_b = obj_b['coords']\n    bbox_a = obj_a['bbox']\n    bbox_b = obj_b['bbox']\n    rows, cols = grid_shape\n\n    # 1.
