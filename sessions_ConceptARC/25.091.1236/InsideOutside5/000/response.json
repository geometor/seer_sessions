            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct shapes or objects, each composed of pixels of a single color, set against a white background (color 0).\n2.  **Object Types:** Many objects appear to be hollow rectangular frames or closed loops (e.g., the red, green, magenta frames in train_1; gray, orange, maroon, green frames in train_2 and train_3). Other objects are solid shapes found *inside* these frames (e.g., yellow 'C' in train_1; green rectangle in train_2; green cross and azure 'T' in train_3). Some objects are neither frames nor inside frames (e.g., magenta 'L', yellow 'C', orange block in train_2).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. It contains only a subset of the objects present in the input, placed in their original positions. All other pixels, including the background and removed objects, are white (color 0).\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying objects that are enclosed or contained within other objects (specifically, the frame-like objects). Crucially, only the *innermost* contained objects are preserved in the output. The containing objects (frames) themselves are removed, as are any objects not contained within another.\n5.  **Containment Definition:** An object appears to be \"contained\" if it resides entirely within the boundary of a frame object without touching the frame's pixels. In cases of nested containment (like the green cross inside the azure frame inside the orange frame in train_3), only the object that is contained but does not itself contain another object is kept.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Find all connected components (objects) of non-background-colored pixels in the input grid. Record each object's color, pixel coordinates, and bounding box.\n3.

Check if Object A is strictly geometrically contained within the bounding box of Object B.\n    b.  Check if Object A's pixels are not adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel *outside* the bounding box of Object B (this helps confirm it's truly \"inside\" and not just touching an edge of B that coincides with the grid boundary).\n    c.  Check if Object A's pixels are not adjacent (including diagonally) to any of Object B's pixels.\n    d.  If all conditions (a, b, c) are met, consider Object A to be contained by Object B. Add Object A to the `contained_objects` list and Object B to the `containing_objects` list.\n5.  Identify the set of \"innermost\" objects: These are the objects present in the `contained_objects` list but *not* present in the `containing_objects` list.\n6.  For each identified \"innermost\" object:\n    a.  Retrieve its original color and pixel coordinates.\n    b.  Draw these pixels onto the output grid using their original color.\n7.
