task_elements:
  - object_type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object_type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9. White (0) typically represents the background.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
  - object_type: Object
    description: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing all pixels of the object.
    relationships:
      - spatial_relation: Can be contained within another object.
      - spatial_relation: Can contain another object.
      - spatial_relation: Can be adjacent to another object.
  - object_type: Frame
    description: A specific type of object, often appearing as a hollow shape or closed loop, capable of enclosing other objects.
    properties: Inherits properties from Object.
  - object_type: Content
    description: An object that can potentially be located inside a Frame.
    properties: Inherits properties from Object.

actions:
  - name: Identify Objects
    description: Segment the input grid into distinct, contiguous non-white objects.
  - name: Determine Containment
    description: For each pair of objects (A, B), determine if object A is fully contained within object B without touching it. This might involve checking bounding boxes and spatial relationships, potentially considering the area enclosed by frame-like objects.
  - name: Filter Objects
    description: Select only those objects that meet specific criteria based on containment relationships.
  - name: Construct Output
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially all white. Place the selected/filtered objects onto this grid in their original positions and colors.

transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify all distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
  - step: For each object, determine if it contains any other object(s) within its boundaries.
  - step: For each object, determine if it is contained within another object.
  - step: Retain only those objects that are contained within another object *but* do not themselves contain any other object (i.e., the innermost contained objects).
  - step: Generate the output grid by placing the retained objects at their original positions on a white background of the same size as the input grid. Discard all other objects (including frames and objects not contained).
