Identify all distinct non-white objects (connected components using 4-connectivity).\n2. Determine all pairs of objects (A, B) where A is strictly contained within B.\n   Strict containment requires:\n   - A's bounding box must be within or identical to B's bounding box.\n   - No pixel of A can be adjacent (8-way connectivity) to any pixel of B.\n   - A flood fill starting from any pixel of A, moving only onto background (0) or other pixels of A, must not be able to reach the grid boundary without crossing object B or any other object.\n3. Check if any Azure (color 8) object is involved in any such containment relationship found in step 2 (either as the container 'B' or the contained object 'A').\n4. **Conditional Output Generation:**\n   a. **If any Azure object was involved in containment:** The output grid contains *only* those Azure (8) objects that were identified as being part of a containment relationship (either containing or being contained). All other pixels are background (0).\n   b. **If NO Azure object was involved in containment:** The output grid contains only the \"innermost\" objects. An object is innermost if it is contained by at least one other object, but does not itself contain any other object. All other pixels are background (0).\n5. Draw the selected objects onto the output grid in their original positions and colors.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols, connectivity=8):\n    \"\"\" Get neighbors within grid bounds based on connectivity. \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    if connectivity == 8:\n        deltas = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n    else: # 4-connectivity\n        deltas = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    for dr, dc in deltas:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef _find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\" Finds all connected components (objects) of non-background colors using 4-connectivity. \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    object_id_counter = 0\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If pixel is non-background and not yet visited as part of an object\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                obj_coords = set()\n                # Use BFS to find all connected pixels of the same color (4-connectivity)\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True # Mark as visited for the main loop\n                component_visited = set([(r,c)]) # Track visited for this specific component BFS\n\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    obj_coords.add((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    # Update bounding box\n                    min_r = min(min_r, curr_r)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, curr_c)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, curr_r)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, curr_c)\n\n                    # Explore 4-connected neighbors\n                    for nr, nc in _get_neighbors(curr_r, curr_c, rows, cols, connectivity=4):\n                         # Check if neighbor is within bounds, same color, and not visited for this component\n                         if (nr, nc) not in component_visited and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True # Mark globally visited\n                            component_visited.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Store the found object if it has coordinates\n                if obj_coords:\n                    objects.append({\n                        'id': object_id_counter,\n                        'color': color,\n                        'coords': obj_coords,\n                        'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) # Store as (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)\n                    })\n                    object_id_counter += 1\n    return objects\n\ndef _is_strictly_contained(obj_a, obj_b, grid):\n    \"\"\" Checks if obj_a is strictly contained within obj_b without touching, using flood fill reachability. \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    coords_a = obj_a['coords']\n    coords_b = obj_b['coords']\n    bbox_a = obj_a['bbox']\n    bbox_b = obj_b['bbox']\n    color_a = obj_a['color']\n\n    # --- Quick Checks ---\n    # 1.
