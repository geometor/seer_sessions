            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids filled primarily with white pixels (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The significant objects are individual pixels of red (2) and yellow (4). There are always multiple red pixels (specifically, two in all examples) and one yellow pixel in the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selective removal of *either* all red pixels *or* the yellow pixel, changing them to white. The other color pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Determining Factor:** The key is to figure out the condition that decides whether red or yellow pixels are removed. Comparing the examples:\n    *   `train_1`: Two red pixels and one yellow pixel, all in the same row. Yellow is removed.\n    *   `train_2`: Two red pixels and one yellow pixel, all in the same column. Red pixels are removed.\n    *   `train_3`: Two red pixels and one yellow pixel, all aligned diagonally (`r-c` is constant). Red pixels are removed.\n    *   `train_4`: Two red pixels and one yellow pixel, not aligned by row, column, or diagonal. Yellow is removed.\n5.  **Hypothesis:** The decision seems based on the geometric alignment of *all* the red and yellow pixels combined.\n    *   If all colored pixels are in the same row, remove yellow.\n    *   If all colored pixels are in the same column, remove red.\n    *   If all colored pixels are on the same diagonal, remove red.\n    *   Otherwise (no specific alignment), remove yellow.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Check if `row + column` is constant for all locations OR if `row - column` is constant for all locations. If YES, proceed to step 7 (remove red).\n    d.  If none of the conditions (a, b, c) are met, proceed to step 6 (remove yellow).\n6.  **Remove Yellow:** Iterate through the locations identified in step 3 (yellow pixels).
