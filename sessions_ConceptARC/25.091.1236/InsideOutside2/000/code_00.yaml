task_description: "Selectively remove either all red (2) or all yellow (4) pixels based on the geometric alignment of all colored pixels."

elements:
  - element: "grid"
    description: "A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors."
  - element: "pixel"
    description: "A single cell within the grid."
    properties:
      - color: "Integer 0-9 (0=white, 2=red, 4=yellow observed)"
      - position: "(row, column) coordinates"

objects:
  - object: "red_pixels"
    description: "The set of all pixels with color 2 in the input grid."
    properties:
      - count: "Number of red pixels (observed: 2)"
      - positions: "List of (row, column) coordinates"
  - object: "yellow_pixels"
    description: "The set of all pixels with color 4 in the input grid."
    properties:
      - count: "Number of yellow pixels (observed: 1)"
      - positions: "List of (row, column) coordinates"
  - object: "combined_colored_pixels"
    description: "The union of red_pixels and yellow_pixels."
    properties:
      - positions: "List of all (row, column) coordinates of red or yellow pixels"

relationships:
  - relationship: "alignment"
    description: "Geometric collinearity or diagonality of the combined_colored_pixels."
    types:
      - "row_alignment": "All combined colored pixels share the same row index."
      - "column_alignment": "All combined colored pixels share the same column index."
      - "diagonal_alignment": "All combined colored pixels lie on a line where row+column is constant OR row-column is constant."
      - "no_alignment": "None of the above alignments hold true."

actions:
  - action: "identify_pixels"
    description: "Find the coordinates of all pixels of a specific color (red or yellow)."
  - action: "check_alignment"
    description: "Determine if the set of combined_colored_pixels exhibits row, column, or diagonal alignment."
  - action: "remove_pixels"
    description: "Change the color of a specified set of pixels (either all red or all yellow) to white (0)."
  - action: "select_removal_target"
    description: >
      Based on the alignment type, decide which color group (red or yellow) to remove.
      - If row_alignment or no_alignment: Remove yellow.
      - If column_alignment or diagonal_alignment: Remove red.

transformation_logic: "Identify red and yellow pixels. Check their combined alignment. If they are row-aligned or not aligned in any specific way, remove the yellow pixel(s). If they are column-aligned or diagonally-aligned, remove the red pixels."
