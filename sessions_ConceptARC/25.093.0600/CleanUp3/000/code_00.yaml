task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
  cell_type: integer (representing color)
  background_color: 0
objects:
  - type: regions
    properties:
      color: non-zero integer
      shape: contiguous or near-contiguous areas of the same color
special_colors:
  - color: 0
    role: background
  - color: 8
    role: noise/artifact to be removed
transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: fill_background_cells
    input: original input grid
    output: intermediate grid
    conditions:
      - target_cell_color: 0
      - neighbor_analysis:
          - connectivity: 8 neighbors (including diagonals)
          - considered_neighbor_colors: all colors except 0 and 8
          - rule: find the most frequent color (C) among considered neighbors
          - threshold: count of color C must be >= 3
    effect: change target cell color from 0 to C if conditions met
  - step: 2
    action: remove_noise_color
    input: intermediate grid from step 1
    output: final output grid
    conditions:
      - target_cell_color: 8
    effect: change target cell color from 8 to 0
relationships:
  - The filling decision for a cell depends on the colors and frequency of its neighbors in the original input grid.
  - The removal of color 8 is unconditional for any cell containing it after the filling step (if any).
order: The filling step (based on input) logically precedes the noise removal step.
