Fill background cells (color 0): Iterate through each cell in the input grid. If a cell has color 0, examine its 8 neighbors (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) in the *original input grid*. Count the occurrences of each neighbor color, excluding colors 0 and 8. If any single color appears 3 or more times among these valid neighbors, change the cell's color in an intermediate grid to that majority color.\n2. Remove noise color (color 8): Iterate through the intermediate grid resulting from step 1. Change any cell with color 8 to color 0. The final grid after this step is the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the fill and noise removal transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n    intermediate_grid = np.copy(input_array) # Start intermediate grid as copy of input\n\n    # Step 1: Fill background cells based on neighbors in the original input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell in the *input* is a background cell (0)\n            if input_array[r, c] == 0:\n                neighbor_colors = []\n                # Iterate over the 8 potential neighbors\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        # Skip the cell itself\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue\n                        \n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        \n                        # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                            neighbor_color = input_array[nr, nc]\n                            # Consider only non-background (0) and non-noise (8) neighbors\n                            if neighbor_color != 0 and neighbor_color != 8:\n                                neighbor_colors.append(neighbor_color)\n\n                # If there are any valid neighbors to consider\n                if neighbor_colors:\n                    # Count the frequency of each neighbor color\n                    color_counts = Counter(neighbor_colors)\n                    # Find the most common color and its count\n                    most_common = color_counts.most_common(1)\n                    if most_common:\n                        majority_color, count = most_common[0]\n                        # If the most common color appears 3 or more times\n                        if count >= 3:\n                            # Update the cell in the intermediate grid\n                            intermediate_grid[r, c] = majority_color\n\n    # Step 2: Remove noise color (8) from the intermediate grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(intermediate_grid) # Start output grid from intermediate\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # If a cell in the intermediate grid is 8, set it to 0 in the output\n            if intermediate_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 0\n                \n    # Convert back to list of lists for the required output format\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n```"
