The background color is consistently '0'.\n2.  **Input Objects:** The non-zero elements in the input form distinct structures. Each structure appears to consist of:\n    *   A horizontal line segment of a specific color (let's call it color L).\n    *   A single cell of a different color (let's call it color S), located one row above the horizontal line.\n3.  **Output Objects:** The output grid retains the background and parts of the input structures but modifies them. Specifically:\n    *   The original single cell (color S) disappears from its input location.\n    *   A new vertical line segment of color S appears. This vertical line is three cells high.\n    *   The vertical line (color S) is positioned such that its middle cell overwrites the center cell of the original horizontal line (color L). The vertical line extends one cell above and one cell below the original horizontal line's row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
