task_description: "Modify input grid structures based on relative positions of elements."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - background_color: 0
  - object: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: L (e.g., 3 in train_1, 4 in train_2)
      - orientation: horizontal
      - length: variable (9 in train_1, 3 and 5 in train_2)
      - row_index: r_l
      - column_range: [c_start, c_end]
  - object: single_cell
    properties:
      - color: S (e.g., 2 in train_1, 8 in train_2)
      - position: (r_s, c_s)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: single_cell (S)
    object: horizontal_line (L)
    details: The single_cell S is located one row above the horizontal_line L (r_s = r_l - 1). The column c_s may or may not align with the line.
actions:
  - action: find_structures
    input: input_grid
    output: list of structures, each containing a horizontal_line (L) and its associated single_cell (S)
  - action: calculate_center
    input: horizontal_line (L)
    output: center_column_index (c_center)
    method: c_center = c_start + (length - 1) // 2
  - action: modify_grid
    input: input_grid, structure (S, L), center_column_index (c_center)
    output: modified_grid
    steps:
      - remove single_cell S from its original position (r_s, c_s) by setting it to background_color 0.
      - draw vertical_line of color S at column c_center, spanning rows r_l-1, r_l, and r_l+1.
transformation:
  - input: grid
  - find all pairs of (single_cell S, horizontal_line L) where S is one row above L.
  - for each pair:
      - calculate the center column (c_center) of L.
      - remove the original S cell.
      - draw a 3-cell vertical line of color S centered at (r_l, c_center).
  - output: modified grid
