A horizontal line segment of a specific color (L).\n   b. A single cell of a different color (S), located exactly one row above the row of the horizontal line L. The column position of S relative to L does not affect the output placement.\n\n2. For each identified structure (S, L):\n   a. Find the center column (c_center) of the horizontal line L.\n      - If the line has length 'len', the start column 'c_start', the center is at c_start + (len - 1) // 2.\n   b. Erase the original single cell S from the grid (set its value to 0).\n   c. Draw a vertical line segment of color S, three cells high, centered vertically on the original row of line L, and horizontally at the calculated center column c_center. The vertical line occupies cells (r_l - 1, c_center), (r_l, c_center), and (r_l + 1, c_center), where r_l is the row index of the horizontal line L.\n\n3. The output grid contains the modified structures along with any unchanged parts of the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_horizontal_lines(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all horizontal line segments in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a line\n        and contains 'color', 'row', 'start_col', 'end_col'.\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                start_col = c\n                end_col = c\n                # Explore horizontally to the right\n                while end_col + 1 < cols and grid[r, end_col + 1] == color and not visited[r, end_col+1] :\n                    end_col += 1\n                \n                # Check if it's truly horizontal (no same-color neighbors vertically)\n                # And length > 1 \n                is_line = True\n                # Actually, the examples show lines of length 1 are possible if associated with a marker.\n                # The critical factor is the marker *above* it.
