task_description: Fill the bounding box of the most frequent non-zero color with that color.
grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - size_preservation: True (input and output grids have the same dimensions)
  - background_color: 0
objects:
  - object: Color Blob
    description: A set of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color value.
    properties:
      - color_value: Integer representing the color.
      - cell_coordinates: List of (row, column) tuples where the color appears.
      - frequency: Count of cells with this color.
      - bounding_box: Minimum rectangle (defined by min/max row/col) enclosing all cells of this color.
relationships:
  - relationship: Frequency Comparison
    description: Non-zero colors are compared based on their frequency.
    type: comparative (most frequent)
  - relationship: Spatial Enclosure
    description: A bounding box is determined based on the spatial extent of the most frequent color's cells.
actions:
  - action: Identify Most Frequent Color
    description: Count occurrences of each non-zero color and find the one with the maximum count.
    input: Input grid
    output: Dominant color value
  - action: Determine Bounding Box
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices for all cells containing the dominant color.
    input: Input grid, Dominant color value
    output: Bounding box coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
  - action: Fill Bounding Box
    description: Modify the grid by setting the color of all cells within the specified bounding box to the dominant color.
    input: Input grid, Bounding box coordinates, Dominant color value
    output: Output grid
