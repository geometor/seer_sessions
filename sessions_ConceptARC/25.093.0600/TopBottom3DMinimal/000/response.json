The grid dimensions remain constant (8x8 in these examples).\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use different integer values to represent colors. The background color appears to be 0. Other colors like 2, 3, 6, and 7 are used to form shapes or regions.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying a specific color based on its frequency and then modifying a rectangular region related to that color. Specifically, a rectangular area seems to be entirely filled with the most frequent non-background color.\n4.  **Dominant Color:** In each example, one non-zero color appears more frequently than others.\n    *   `train_1`: Color 3 (20 occurrences) is more frequent than color 2 (19 occurrences).\n    *   `train_2`: Color 6 (14 occurrences) is more frequent than color 7 (13 occurrences).\n5.  **Bounding Box:** The transformation targets the minimum bounding box that encloses all cells of the dominant color found in the input.\n6.  **Filling Action:** The identified bounding box in the output grid is completely filled with the dominant color, overwriting any previous colors within that rectangle. Cells outside this bounding box remain unchanged from the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
