These lines act as boundaries or \"walls\".\n4.  **Marker:** There is always a single, unique non-zero digit present in the input grid that is different from the \"wall\" digit. This digit acts as a \"marker\".\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the \"marker\" digit to a new location within the grid. The original position of the marker becomes '0'. The \"walls\" and other '0' cells remain unchanged.\n6.  **Movement Logic:** The marker moves either horizontally or vertically, depending on the orientation of the walls.\n    *   If the walls are **vertical** (columns `c1` and `c2`), the marker moves horizontally within its original row to the column calculated as the integer average of the wall columns: `new_col = (c1 + c2) // 2`.\n    *   If the walls are **horizontal** (rows `r1` and `r2`), the marker moves vertically within its original column to the row calculated as the integer average of the wall rows: `new_row = (r1 + r2) // 2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Record this digit as the `wall_value`, the orientation (`horizontal` or `vertical`), and the indices of the two lines (e.g., `r1`, `r2` for horizontal or `c1`, `c2` for vertical).\n3.  **Identify Marker:** Scan the grid to find the single cell containing a non-zero digit that is *not* the `wall_value`. Record this digit as the `marker_value` and its position as (`row_in`, `col_in`).\n4.  **Calculate Target Position:**\n    *   If the walls are `horizontal` at rows `r1` and `r2`, the target position is (`(r1 + r2) // 2`, `col_in`).\n    *   If the walls are `vertical` at columns `c1` and `c2`, the target position is (`row_in`, `(c1 + c2) // 2`). Let this be (`row_target`, `col_target`).\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid identical to the input grid.\n6.  **Move Marker:** In the new grid, set the cell value at the original marker position (`row_in`, `col_in`) to 0. Then, set the cell value at the calculated target position (`row_target`, `col_target`) to the `marker_value`.\n7.  **Finalize:** The modified new grid is the output."
