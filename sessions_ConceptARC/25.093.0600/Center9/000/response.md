Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Background:** The digit '0' appears to represent the background or empty space.
3.  **Walls:** Each grid features two parallel lines (either horizontal or vertical) composed of the same non-zero digit. These lines act as boundaries or "walls".
4.  **Marker:** There is always a single, unique non-zero digit present in the input grid that is different from the "wall" digit. This digit acts as a "marker".
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the "marker" digit to a new location within the grid. The original position of the marker becomes '0'. The "walls" and other '0' cells remain unchanged.
6.  **Movement Logic:** The marker moves either horizontally or vertically, depending on the orientation of the walls.
    *   If the walls are **vertical** (columns `c1` and `c2`), the marker moves horizontally within its original row to the column calculated as the integer average of the wall columns: `new_col = (c1 + c2) // 2`.
    *   If the walls are **horizontal** (rows `r1` and `r2`), the marker moves vertically within its original column to the row calculated as the integer average of the wall rows: `new_row = (r1 + r2) // 2`.

**YAML Facts:**

    description: The marker is located between the two wall lines.
  - type: spatial
    description: Walls are either horizontal or vertical lines.

actions:
  - action: identify_walls
    input: grid
    output: wall_value, wall_orientation (horizontal/vertical), wall_indices (r1, r2 or c1, c2)
  - action: identify_marker
    input: grid, wall_value
    output: marker_value, marker_position (row_in, col_in)
  - action: calculate_target_position
    input: wall_orientation, wall_indices, marker_position
    output: target_position (row_target, col_target)
    logic:
      - if wall_orientation is horizontal (rows r1, r2):
          - row_target = (r1 + r2) // 2
          - col_target = col_in
      - if wall_orientation is vertical (columns c1, c2):
          - row_target = row_in
          - col_target = (c1 + c2) // 2
  - action: update_grid
    input: grid, marker_value, marker_position, target_position
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Set the value at marker_position (row_in, col_in) to 0.
      - Set the value at target_position (row_target, col_target) to marker_value.

constraints:
  - Exactly one marker exists.
  - Exactly two parallel walls exist.
  - Marker value is different from wall value and 0.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Identify Walls:** Scan the grid to find the two parallel lines (either horizontal rows or vertical columns) made of the same non-zero digit. Record this digit as the `wall_value`, the orientation (`horizontal` or `vertical`), and the indices of the two lines (e.g., `r1`, `r2` for horizontal or `c1`, `c2` for vertical).
3.  **Identify Marker:** Scan the grid to find the single cell containing a non-zero digit that is *not* the `wall_value`. Record this digit as the `marker_value` and its position as (`row_in`, `col_in`).
4.  **Calculate Target Position:**
    *   If the walls are `horizontal` at rows `r1` and `r2`, the target position is (`(r1 + r2) // 2`, `col_in`).
    *   If the walls are `vertical` at columns `c1` and `c2`, the target position is (`row_in`, `(c1 + c2) // 2`). Let this be (`row_target`, `col_target`).
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
6.  **Move Marker:** In the new grid, set the cell value at the original marker position (`row_in`, `col_in`) to 0. Then, set the cell value at the calculated target position (`row_target`, `col_target`) to the `marker_value`.
7.  **Finalize:** The modified new grid is the output.
