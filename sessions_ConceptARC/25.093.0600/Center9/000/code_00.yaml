task_description: Move a unique marker digit within a grid towards the midpoint between two parallel wall lines.

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: background, walls, marker
  - object: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space
  - object: walls
    properties:
      - role: boundaries
      - structure: two parallel lines (horizontal or vertical)
      - value: identical non-zero integer (constant within a grid)
  - object: marker
    properties:
      - role: element to be moved
      - structure: single cell
      - value: unique non-zero integer (different from wall value)
      - initial_position: (row_in, col_in)
      - final_position: (row_out, col_out)

relationships:
  - type: containment
    source: grid
    target: [background, walls, marker]
  - type: spatial
    description: The marker is located between the two wall lines.
  - type: spatial
    description: Walls are either horizontal or vertical lines.

actions:
  - action: identify_walls
    input: grid
    output: wall_value, wall_orientation (horizontal/vertical), wall_indices (r1, r2 or c1, c2)
  - action: identify_marker
    input: grid, wall_value
    output: marker_value, marker_position (row_in, col_in)
  - action: calculate_target_position
    input: wall_orientation, wall_indices, marker_position
    output: target_position (row_target, col_target)
    logic:
      - if wall_orientation is horizontal (rows r1, r2):
          - row_target = (r1 + r2) // 2
          - col_target = col_in
      - if wall_orientation is vertical (columns c1, c2):
          - row_target = row_in
          - col_target = (c1 + c2) // 2
  - action: update_grid
    input: grid, marker_value, marker_position, target_position
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Set the value at marker_position (row_in, col_in) to 0.
      - Set the value at target_position (row_target, col_target) to marker_value.

constraints:
  - Exactly one marker exists.
  - Exactly two parallel walls exist.
  - Marker value is different from wall value and 0.
