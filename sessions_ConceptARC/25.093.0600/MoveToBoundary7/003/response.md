"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying the two distinct non-zero colored objects. 
The object with the smaller number of pixels (the 'mover') is moved towards the 
other object (the 'target') along the axis (horizontal or vertical) where their 
initial bounding box separation is smallest. The movement stops when the bounding 
boxes are adjacent, separated by exactly one pixel of background (0). The target 
object remains stationary. Assumes exactly two objects exist.
