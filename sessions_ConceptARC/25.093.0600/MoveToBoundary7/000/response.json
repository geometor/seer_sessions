            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids containing numerical values. The value `0` appears to represent the background.\n2.  **Objects:** Non-zero values form distinct connected shapes or objects within the grid. In `train_1`, there's an object made of `3`s and another made of `2`s. In `train_2`, there are two objects, both made of `4`s but spatially distinct.\n3.  **Object Characteristics:** Some objects seem entirely surrounded by the background `0` (e.g., the 'C' shape in `train_1`, the small rectangle in `train_2`), while others touch or are very close to the grid boundaries (e.g., the 'L' shape in `train_1`, the 'U' shape in `train_2`).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving one of the objects while the other(s) remain stationary.\n5.  **Movement Rule:** The object that moves appears to be the one fully enclosed by the background. It moves towards the stationary object until their bounding boxes are adjacent (separated by one unit of background space along the axis of movement). The movement occurs only along one primary axis (either horizontally or vertically), specifically the axis where the initial gap between the objects' bounding boxes is smallest.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For each object, determine its color, the coordinates of its pixels, and its bounding box.\n2.  Classify each object: An object is `enclosed` if all cells immediately adjacent to it (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that are not part of the object itself are the background color (0). Otherwise, the object is `static`. Assume exactly one object will be classified as `enclosed` (the `mover`) and at least one as `static`.\n3.  If multiple `static` objects exist, identify the `target` static object whose bounding box is closest to the `mover`'s bounding box (using the minimum distance between any two points of the boxes, or edge-to-edge distance). If there's only one `static` object, it is the `target`.\n4.  Determine the primary axis of movement by calculating the horizontal and vertical separation between the bounding boxes of the `mover` and the `target`. The axis with the smaller separation is the primary axis.\n    *   Calculate horizontal separation: `min(target_box.col_max, mover_box.col_max) - max(target_box.col_min, mover_box.col_min) - 1` (or similar logic for edge distance).\n    *   Calculate vertical separation: `min(target_box.row_max, mover_box.row_max) - max(target_box.row_min, mover_box.row_min) - 1`.\n5.  Calculate the shift distance required along the primary axis to make the separation between the bounding boxes equal to 1.\n    *   If moving horizontally: `shift_dx = target_box.col_min - mover_box.col_max - 1` (if mover is left) or `shift_dx = target_box.col_max - mover_box.col_min + 1` (if mover is right). Set `shift_dy = 0`.\n    *   If moving vertically: `shift_dy = target_box.row_min - mover_box.row_max - 1` (if mover is above) or `shift_dy = target_box.row_max - mover_box.row_min + 1` (if mover is below). Set `shift_dx = 0`.\n6.  Generate the output grid: Start with a copy of the input grid. Set the pixels corresponding to the `mover`'s original position to the background color (0). Then, draw the `mover` object (using its original color) at its new position, shifted by `(shift_dx, shift_dy)`.\n7.  Return the final output grid."
