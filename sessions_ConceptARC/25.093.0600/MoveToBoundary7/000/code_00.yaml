task_description: Move one object adjacent to another based on enclosure and proximity.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - background_color: 0
  - element: object
    properties:
      - type: connected component of non-zero integers
      - color: the integer value making up the object
      - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle containing the object
      - position: coordinates of the object's pixels
      - is_enclosed: boolean, true if all adjacent cells outside the object are background_color (0)
      - is_static: boolean, true if not is_enclosed (typically touches grid edge or its bounding box does)
      - is_moving: boolean, true if is_enclosed

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: grid
    outputs: list of objects with their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box)
  - action: classify_objects
    inputs: list of objects, grid dimensions
    outputs: updated list of objects with is_enclosed, is_static, is_moving flags set
  - action: find_target_object
    description: Find the static object closest to the moving object.
    inputs: moving_object, list of static_objects
    outputs: target_static_object
  - action: calculate_movement
    description: Determine the axis and distance to move the moving object so its bounding box is adjacent to the target static object's bounding box along the axis of the smallest initial gap.
    inputs: moving_object, target_static_object
    outputs: movement_vector (dx, dy)
  - action: apply_movement
    description: Create the output grid by erasing the moving object from its original position and drawing it at the new position defined by the movement_vector. Static objects remain unchanged.
    inputs: input_grid, moving_object, static_objects, movement_vector
    outputs: output_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The moving object is shifted until its bounding box is one unit away from the target static object's bounding box along the primary movement axis.
  - relationship: selection_criteria
    description: The object selected for movement is the one that is 'is_enclosed'. The target object is the closest 'is_static' object.
  - relationship: movement_axis
    description: Movement occurs along the axis (horizontal or vertical) with the smallest initial distance between the bounding boxes of the moving and target objects.

assumptions:
  - There is exactly one 'is_enclosed' (moving) object in the input grid.
  - There is at least one 'is_static' (target) object in the input grid. (In the examples, there is exactly one).
