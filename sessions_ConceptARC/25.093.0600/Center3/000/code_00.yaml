task_description: Extract a specific rectangular subgrid from a larger input grid based on properties of the shapes within the grid.

elements:
  - object: grid
     Mapped to: input, output
     properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: cells with digit values (0-9)
  - object: region
    description: Contiguous area of cells with the same non-zero digit value within the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: the digit value shared by cells in the region
      - shape: geometric form (can be irregular or rectangular)
      - location: position within the input grid (row, column indices)
      - size: number of cells or bounding box area
  - object: border
    description: An outermost region, often framing other regions.
    properties:
      - color: the digit value of the border region
      - usually_non_zero: true
  - object: target_rectangle
    description: The specific solid rectangular region to be extracted.
    properties:
      - color: a single non-zero digit
      - shape: solid rectangle (no holes of other colors within its bounds)
      - location: its top-left and bottom-right coordinates in the input grid
      - criteria_for_selection:
          - largest_area: Must have the maximal area among qualifying rectangles.
          - avoids_border: Must not touch the outermost border region (if one exists).
          - tie_breaker: If multiple rectangles meet criteria and have the same max area, select the one with the top-most, then left-most starting coordinate.

actions:
  - action: identify_border
    description: Find the color and extent of the outermost non-zero region.
  - action: find_solid_rectangles
    description: Locate all solid rectangular blocks composed of a single non-zero color within the input.
  - action: filter_rectangles
    description: Remove rectangles that touch the identified border.
  - action: select_target
    description: Choose the rectangle with the largest area from the filtered set, using top-left position as a tie-breaker.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Copy the selected rectangular region from the input grid to form the output grid.
