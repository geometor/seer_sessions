The output grid is always a subgrid of the input grid.\n2.  **Structure:** The input grids contain various shapes or regions formed by contiguous non-zero numbers. Often, there's an outer border or frame made of a specific number (e.g., '1' in train_1, '2' in train_2, outer '4' in train_3). Inside, there are other distinct regions formed by different numbers.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The output corresponds to a specific rectangular region found within the input grid. This region seems to be selected based on certain criteria related to its shape, color, size, and position relative to other elements (like the border).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify and extract this specific rectangular subgrid from the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Note its color.\n2.  **Find Candidate Rectangles:** Scan the input grid to find all possible solid rectangular blocks where every cell within the block has the same non-zero color. Record the color, top-left corner coordinates, width, and height for each found rectangle.\n3.  **Filter by Border Contact:** If a border was identified in step 1, remove any candidate rectangle from the list if any part of it touches (is adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to) a cell belonging to the border region.\n4.  **Select Largest Rectangle:** From the remaining list of candidate rectangles, calculate the area (width * height) for each. Find the maximum area among them.\n5.  **Apply Tie-Breaker:** If only one rectangle has the maximum area, select it. If multiple rectangles share the maximum area, select the one whose top-left corner has the smallest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one among those with the smallest column index.\n6.  **Extract Output:** Define the boundaries of the selected rectangle using its top-left coordinates, width, and height. Extract the subgrid corresponding to these boundaries from the input grid. This extracted subgrid is the final output."
