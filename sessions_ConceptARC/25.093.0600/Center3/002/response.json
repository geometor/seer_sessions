            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the largest solid rectangle that did not touch the grid's border. The results show this hypothesis was incorrect, as the code failed on all examples, often selecting the border itself or an incorrect shape based on flawed rectangle detection or border interaction logic.\n\nThe new strategy involves re-evaluating the relationship between the input shapes and the output subgrid across all examples. Key observations suggest the selection criteria might relate to the properties of connected regions (components) of the same color rather than just simple rectangular blocks. Specifically, the concept of \"solidity\" (ratio of region pixels to bounding box area) combined with a tie-breaker based on proximity to the grid center appears promising and consistent with the examples.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Implement robust methods for finding connected components (regions) and their bounding boxes.\n2.  Calculate solidity for each region.\n3.  Implement the selection logic based on maximum solidity, using distance to the grid center as the primary tie-breaker, followed by top-left coordinate if needed.\n4.  Extract the content of the selected region's bounding box.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nTo verify the \"maximum solidity / closest to center\" hypothesis, let's analyze a complex case like Test 2. We need functions to find regions, bounding boxes, calculate solidity, and distances.\n\n"
