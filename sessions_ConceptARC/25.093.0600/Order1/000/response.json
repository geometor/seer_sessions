The non-zero values appear to form distinct \"objects\" or \"blobs\", where each object consists of connected cells of the same number (color). The background is represented by zeros.\n\nThe core transformation involves rearranging these objects within the grid. The rearrangement happens along a primary axis, either horizontal or vertical.\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The first step is to identify all distinct connected components of non-zero cells having the same value. Each such component is an \"object\".\n2.  **Axis Determination:** The overall spatial layout of these objects determines the axis of rearrangement. If the bounding box containing all non-zero cells is wider than it is tall, the rearrangement occurs horizontally. Otherwise (if taller or square), it occurs vertically.\n3.  **Gap Identification:** The empty space (rows or columns of zeros) between adjacent objects along the primary axis in the input grid is identified. These gaps are preserved in the output.\n4.  **Sorting:** The objects are reordered based on a rule that depends on the determined axis:\n    *   **Vertical Axis:** Objects are sorted based on their topmost row index (minimum row index) in descending order. The object starting in the lowest row comes first in the output.\n    *   **Horizontal Axis:** Objects are sorted based on their color value in descending order, *except* for the object that is rightmost in the input (the one with the largest minimum column index). This rightmost object retains its position as the last object in the sequence after the others are sorted.\n5.  **Reconstruction:** The output grid is constructed by placing the objects in their new sorted order, maintaining the original gaps (in terms of width or height) between them along the primary axis. The placement starts from the top (for vertical) or left (for horizontal) edge of the grid, potentially including an initial gap if one existed before the first object in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each object, record its color, its cell coordinates, and its bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column).\n2.  Determine the overall bounding box encompassing all identified objects. Calculate the height and width of this overall bounding box.\n3.  Determine the primary axis of rearrangement: if the overall width is greater than the overall height, the axis is 'horizontal'; otherwise, the axis is 'vertical'.\n4.  Identify the sequence of objects based on their position along the primary axis in the input grid (top-to-bottom for vertical, left-to-right for horizontal).\n5.  Calculate the size of the gaps (number of zero rows for vertical axis, number of zero columns for horizontal axis) between consecutive objects in the input sequence along the primary axis. Also, note any gap before the first object.\n6.  Determine the target order of the objects based on the primary axis:\n    a.  If the axis is 'vertical', sort the list of identified objects based on their minimum row index in descending order.\n    b.  If the axis is 'horizontal', identify the object with the maximum minimum column index (the \"rightmost\" object). Remove this object temporarily. Sort the remaining objects based on their color value in descending order. Append the \"rightmost\" object to the end of this sorted list.\n7.  Create a new empty grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n8.  Iterate through the newly sorted list of objects and the identified gap sizes. Place the objects and gaps sequentially onto the new grid along the primary axis, starting from the top-left (row 0, col 0). Maintain the original content and relative positions of cells within each object. Ensure the gaps placed between objects have the correct sizes as identified in step 5. Fill any remaining space with zeros.\n9.  Return the reconstructed grid as the output."
