*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
    *   The output is a single integer.
    *   The transformation involves analyzing the frequency of each number in the input sequence.
    *   Specifically, it focuses on identifying numbers that appear exactly once (unique numbers).
    *   The position (index) of these unique numbers in the original sequence is important.
    *   The final output is the unique number located at the median index among all indices where unique numbers appear.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
    3.  Create a list containing the 0-based indices of all integers that appear exactly once in the original list.
    4.  Determine the median index from this list of indices. If there is an even number of such indices, use the index corresponding to the lower-median position (equivalent to `floor((length - 1) / 2)` of the sorted indices list, which effectively selects the middle element's index directly since the indices are already collected in order).
    5.  Retrieve the integer from the original list located at this calculated median index.
    6.  Output the retrieved integer.
