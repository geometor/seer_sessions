      - example_1: {3:1, 1:1, 4:1, 2:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1}
      - example_2: {8:1, 3:6, 7:1, 4:1}
      - example_3: {4:2, 3:2, 1:1}
  - object: unique_numbers
    properties:
      - description: Numbers from input_list with a count of exactly 1
      - derived_from: number_counts
      - example_1: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9] # Note: Order might depend on implementation
      - example_2: [8, 7, 4]
      - example_3: [1]
  - object: unique_number_indices
    properties:
      - description: List of 0-based indices where unique numbers appear in the original input_list, preserving original order.
      - derived_from: input_list and number_counts
      - example_1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      - example_2: [0, 4, 8] # Index of 8 is 0, index of 7 is 4, index of 4 is 8
      - example_3: [2]     # Index of 1 is 2
  - object: median_index_position
    properties:
      - description: The index representing the median position within the unique_number_indices list. Calculated as floor((length - 1) / 2).
      - calculated_from: unique_number_indices list length
      - example_1: 3 # (7 - 1) // 2
      - example_2: 1 # (3 - 1) // 2
      - example_3: 0 # (1 - 1) // 2
  - object: target_index
    properties:
      - description: The actual index from the original input_list. This index is retrieved from the unique_number_indices list at the median_index_position.
      - derived_from: unique_number_indices and median_index_position
      - example_1: 3 # unique_number_indices[3]
      - example_2: 4 # unique_number_indices[1]
      - example_3: 2 # unique_number_indices[0]
  - object: output_integer
    properties:
      - description: The element in the original input_list located at the target_index.
      - derived_from: input_list and target_index
      - example_1: 2 # input_list[3]
      - example_2: 7 # input_list[4]
      - example_3: 1 # input_list[2]

relationships:
  - number_counts are derived from input_list
  - unique_number_indices are identified by iterating through input_list and checking number_counts
  - median_index_position is calculated based on the length of unique_number_indices
  - target_index is the value within unique_number_indices at the median_index_position
  - output_integer is the element from input_list at the target_index
