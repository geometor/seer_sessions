"""
Transforms an input sequence of items convertible to integers based on the frequency of its elements.
1. Converts the input sequence into a list of standard Python integers.
2. Counts the occurrences of each integer in the list.
3. Identifies the indices of integers that appear exactly once (unique numbers).
4. Finds the median index among the list of indices corresponding to these unique numbers. 
   If there's an even number of unique indices, the lower-median position is used 
   (index floor((n-1)/2) in the list of unique indices).
5. Returns the integer from the original (converted) list located at this median index.
