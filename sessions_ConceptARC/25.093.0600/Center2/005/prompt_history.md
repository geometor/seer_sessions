*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
    *   The output is a single integer.
    *   The transformation involves analyzing the frequency of each number in the input sequence.
    *   Specifically, it focuses on identifying numbers that appear exactly once (unique numbers).
    *   The position (index) of these unique numbers in the original sequence is important.
    *   The final output is the unique number located at the median index among all indices where unique numbers appear.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided Python code failed during execution in the test environment due to a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'`. This error occurs within the `find_unique_indices` function, specifically when `collections.Counter(int_list)` is called. `collections.Counter` requires its input elements to be hashable (like integers, strings, tuples) to use them as dictionary keys for counting. The error indicates that the elements within the `int_list` provided by the test environment were NumPy arrays, which are mutable and therefore not hashable.

This contrasts with the initial analysis which assumed the input was either a space-separated string (parsed into integers) or a simple list of integers. The core logic derived from the examples (counting elements, finding indices of unique elements, calculating the median index, retrieving the element at that index) appears sound and matches the input/output pairs.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Adaptation:** The primary issue is adapting to the input format provided by the execution environment. The `transform` function needs to ensure that it operates on a list of hashable elements (integers). If the input is indeed a sequence of NumPy arrays (e.g., `[np.array(3), np.array(1), ...]`), each element needs to be converted to a standard Python integer before being processed by `collections.Counter`.
2.  **Verification:** Re-verify the core algorithm logic against the examples, assuming the input elements are correctly converted to integers.
3.  **Refinement:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the potential need for input type conversion and to accurately describe the verified algorithm.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's re-verify the logic with the provided examples, assuming the input is correctly handled as a list of integers.

```
The simulation confirms the core logic correctly reproduces the outputs for all training examples when operating on lists of integers. The median index calculation `(n - 1) // 2` correctly identifies the index *within the `unique_indices` list*, and the value at that position gives the target index in the original list.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence. If the elements are not standard Python integers (e.g., they are NumPy array elements), convert each element to an integer to form an `integer_list`.
2.  Count the frequency of each integer in the `integer_list`.
3.  Identify all integers that appear exactly once (unique integers).
4.  Create a list, `unique_element_indices`, containing the 0-based indices of these unique integers as they appear in the original `integer_list`. Maintain the order of appearance.
5.  Calculate the median position index within the `unique_element_indices` list. This is done using the formula `floor((N - 1) / 2)`, where `N` is the number of unique elements (the length of `unique_element_indices`).
6.  Retrieve the value stored at this median position index within the `unique_element_indices` list. This value represents the `target_index` in the original `integer_list`.
7.  Extract the integer element from the original `integer_list` located at the `target_index`.
8.  Output the extracted integer.
