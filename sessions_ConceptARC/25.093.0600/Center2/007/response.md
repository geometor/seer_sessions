"""
Transforms an input sequence of number-like items convertible to integers.
The transformation involves:
1. Converting the input sequence into a list of standard Python integers.
2. Counting the frequency of each integer in the list.
3. Identifying the 0-based indices where integers appearing exactly once (unique integers) are located.
4. Finding the median index from this list of unique indices. If the list has an even number of indices, the lower-median position (floor((n-1)/2)) is used.
5. Retrieving the integer from the original (converted) list that resides at this median index.
6. Returning the retrieved integer.
