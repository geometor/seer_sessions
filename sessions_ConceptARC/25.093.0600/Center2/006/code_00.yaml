      - contains: Items convertible to integers
      - example_1: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9] # Representation after potential environment loading
      - example_2: [8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]
      - example_3: [4, 3, 1, 3, 4]
  - object: integer_list
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_sequence by converting elements to standard Python integers
      - example_1: [3, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9]
      - example_2: [8, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4]
      - example_3: [4, 3, 1, 3, 4]
  - object: number_counts
    properties:
      - derived_from: integer_list by counting occurrences of each integer
      - example_1: {3:1, 1:1, 4:1, 2:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1}
      - example_2: {8:1, 3:6, 7:1, 4:1}
      - example_3: {4:2, 3:2, 1:1}
  - object: unique_number_indices
    properties:
      - description: List of 0-based indices where integers appearing exactly once are located in the integer_list. The order corresponds to their appearance in integer_list.
      - derived_from: integer_list and number_counts
      - example_1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      - example_2: [0, 4, 8]
      - example_3: [2]
  - object: median_unique_index_position
    properties:
      - description: The index representing the median position within the unique_number_indices list. Calculated as floor((length - 1) / 2).
      - calculated_from: unique_number_indices list length
      - example_1: 3 # (7 - 1) // 2
      - example_2: 1 # (3 - 1) // 2
      - example_3: 0 # (1 - 1) // 2
  - object: target_index
    properties:
      - description: The actual index from the original integer_list, found by retrieving the element at the median_unique_index_position within the unique_number_indices list.
      - derived_from: unique_number_indices and median_unique_index_position
      - example_1: 3 # unique_number_indices[3]
      - example_2: 4 # unique_number_indices[1]
      - example_3: 2 # unique_number_indices[0]
  - object: output_integer
    properties:
      - derived_from: The element in the integer_list located at the target_index.
      - example_1: 2 # integer_list[3]
      - example_2: 7 # integer_list[4]
      - example_3: 1 # integer_list[2]

relationships:
  - input_sequence is converted into integer_list
  - number_counts are derived from integer_list
  - unique_number_indices are identified using integer_list and number_counts
  - median_unique_index_position is calculated based on the length of unique_number_indices
  - target_index is determined by accessing unique_number_indices at the median_unique_index_position
  - output_integer is the element from integer_list at the target_index
