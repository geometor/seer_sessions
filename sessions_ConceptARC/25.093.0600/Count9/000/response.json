            "text": "*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 2D grid containing numerical values. Zero appears to represent the background color. Non-zero values represent different colors or types, forming distinct shapes or regions within the grid. The output is a smaller 1D grid (a single row) filled entirely with zeros. The size (number of columns) of the output grid varies between examples.\n\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the content of the output grid (all zeros) doesn't directly map from the input values. However, the *size* of the output grid seems related to the structure of the input. Specifically, the number of columns in the output grid consistently matches the number of distinct, connected components (objects) formed by non-zero cells in the input grid. Objects are defined as groups of adjacent cells (sharing an edge, not just a corner) having the same non-zero value. Different colors form different objects, even if they touch.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation counts the number of unique connected components (objects) of non-zero values in the input grid. The output is a 1xN grid of zeros, where N is the total count of these objects.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   `train_1`: Objects are made of 5s (1), 2s (1), 4s (1), 3s (1). Total = 4 objects. Output is 1x4. Matches.\n    *   `train_2`: Objects are made of 6s (1), the top-right 4s group (1), the bottom-left 4s group (1). Total = 3 objects. Output is 1x3. Matches.\n    *   `train_3`: Objects are made of 4s (1), 8s (1), 3s (1), 7s (1). Total = 4 objects. Output is 1x4. Matches.\n\nThe hypothesis holds across all examples.\n\n"
