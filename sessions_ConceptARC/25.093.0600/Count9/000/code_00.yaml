facts:
  - input_type: 2D grid of integers
  - output_type: 1D grid (row vector) of integers
  - background_value: 0
  - object_definition: A connected component of cells sharing the same non-zero integer value.
  - connectivity: Adjacent cells (sharing an edge - up, down, left, right). Diagonal adjacency does not constitute connectivity.
  - output_content: Always filled with the integer 0.
  - output_size_determination: The number of columns in the output grid is equal to the total count of distinct non-zero objects found in the input grid.
