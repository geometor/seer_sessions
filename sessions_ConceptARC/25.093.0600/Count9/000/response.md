*   **Perception:** The input consists of a 2D grid containing numerical values. Zero appears to represent the background color. Non-zero values represent different colors or types, forming distinct shapes or regions within the grid. The output is a smaller 1D grid (a single row) filled entirely with zeros. The size (number of columns) of the output grid varies between examples.

*   **Analysis:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the content of the output grid (all zeros) doesn't directly map from the input values. However, the *size* of the output grid seems related to the structure of the input. Specifically, the number of columns in the output grid consistently matches the number of distinct, connected components (objects) formed by non-zero cells in the input grid. Objects are defined as groups of adjacent cells (sharing an edge, not just a corner) having the same non-zero value. Different colors form different objects, even if they touch.

*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation counts the number of unique connected components (objects) of non-zero values in the input grid. The output is a 1xN grid of zeros, where N is the total count of these objects.

*   **Verification:**
    *   `train_1`: Objects are made of 5s (1), 2s (1), 4s (1), 3s (1). Total = 4 objects. Output is 1x4. Matches.
    *   `train_2`: Objects are made of 6s (1), the top-right 4s group (1), the bottom-left 4s group (1). Total = 3 objects. Output is 1x3. Matches.
    *   `train_3`: Objects are made of 4s (1), 8s (1), 3s (1), 7s (1). Total = 4 objects. Output is 1x4. Matches.

The hypothesis holds across all examples.


```yaml
facts:
  - input_type: 2D grid of integers
  - output_type: 1D grid (row vector) of integers
  - background_value: 0
  - object_definition: A connected component of cells sharing the same non-zero integer value.
  - connectivity: Adjacent cells (sharing an edge - up, down, left, right). Diagonal adjacency does not constitute connectivity.
  - output_content: Always filled with the integer 0.
  - output_size_determination: The number of columns in the output grid is equal to the total count of distinct non-zero objects found in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all non-zero cells.
2.  For each non-zero cell that hasn't been visited yet:
    a.  Identify the connected component (object) it belongs to by finding all adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells with the same non-zero value, and recursively finding their neighbours with the same value. Mark all cells belonging to this object as visited.
    b.  Increment a counter for the total number of objects found.
3.  Determine the final count (`N`) of distinct objects identified in step 2.
4.  Construct an output grid consisting of 1 row and `N` columns.
5.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the value 0.
