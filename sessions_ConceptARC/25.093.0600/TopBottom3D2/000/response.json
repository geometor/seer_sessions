            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**1. Perception of Task Elements**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are grids (represented as 2D arrays or lists of lists) containing single-digit non-negative integers. The grid dimensions appear consistent within each example (7x7).\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. The modification seems localized and value-dependent.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   The changes involve setting specific non-zero digits to zero.\n    *   The changes seem to be concentrated within a single column in each example.\n    *   The identity of the column being changed varies between examples (column 3 in train\\_1 & train\\_3, column 1 in train\\_2).\n    *   The digit being changed to zero also varies (2 in train\\_1, 4 in train\\_2, 9 in train\\_3).\n    *   There's often a pattern of rows or columns dominated by a single non-zero digit.\n    *   The transformation appears to identify a specific column based on the mixture of digits it contains, particularly in relation to digits dominant in certain rows.\n\n**2. Fact Extraction (YAML)**\n\n"
