task_description: Modifying a grid by zeroing out specific digits in one column based on digit interactions.

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: consistent within an example (e.g., 7x7)
      - content: single-digit non-negative integers (0-9)
  - object: column
    properties:
      - index: position within the grid
      - values: list of digits in that column
      - distinct_non_zero_digits: set of unique digits > 0 in the column
  - object: row
    properties:
      - index: position within the grid
      - values: list of digits in that row
      - distinct_non_zero_digits: set of unique digits > 0 in the row
      - is_uniform: boolean (true if contains exactly one distinct non-zero digit)
      - uniform_digit: integer (the single distinct non-zero digit if is_uniform is true)

actions:
  - action: identify_target_column
    description: Find the unique column containing exactly two distinct non-zero digits, where one digit corresponds to a 'uniform_digit' found in some rows, and the other digit does not.
    inputs: grid
    outputs: target_column_index, digit_to_remove
  - action: zero_out_digit
    description: Replace all occurrences of a specific digit within a specific column with 0.
    inputs: grid, column_index, digit_value
    outputs: modified_grid

relationships:
  - relationship: column_digit_mix
    description: A column can contain zero, one, or multiple distinct non-zero digits.
    entities: [column, distinct_non_zero_digits]
  - relationship: row_uniformity
    description: Some rows may be 'uniform', characterized by a single distinct non-zero digit.
    entities: [row, is_uniform, uniform_digit]
  - relationship: target_column_identification_logic
    description: The column to be modified is identified by containing a specific mix of two non-zero digits, one of which is a 'uniform_digit' from certain rows, and the other is the one to be removed.
    entities: [column, row, uniform_digit]
