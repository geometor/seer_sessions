Grid:
  Type: 2D Array of Integers
  BackgroundValue: 0
Objects:
  Type: Non-zero integer cells
  Properties:
    - value (color)
    - position (row, column)
Relationships:
  - Relative Position: Cells can be located at edges (first/last column, last-but-one row) or internally.
  - Proximity: For diagonal fills, the position relative to *other* non-zero cells matters.
Actions:
  - Identify Triggers: Locate non-zero cells based on specific positions (last column, second-last row, first column).
  - Fill: Propagate the trigger cell's value into adjacent background cells according to specific rules.
    - Fill Directions:
      - Horizontal Left (from last column)
      - Vertical Up (from second-last row)
      - Diagonal Up-Right (from first column)
    - Fill Stopping Conditions:
      - Boundary Hit (edge of grid)
      - Collision (encountering a non-zero cell from the input grid)
      - Proximity Constraint (specific condition for diagonal fill related to other objects)
      - Row Constraint (specific condition for vertical fill related to non-empty rows above)
Transformation:
  Rule: Apply fill actions originating from all identified trigger cells onto a copy of the input grid.
  InputPreservation: Original non-zero cells from the input are preserved in the output.
  OutputComposition: The final output is the initial grid state modified by all triggered fill operations.
