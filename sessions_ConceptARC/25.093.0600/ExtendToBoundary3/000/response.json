            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers. The value `0` represents the background. Non-zero integers represent distinct objects or markers.\n2.  **Core Task:** The transformation involves selectively \"painting\" or \"filling\" areas of the grid based on the location and value of specific non-zero cells in the input. The original non-zero cells seem to remain unchanged.\n3.  **Trigger Locations & Actions:** There appear to be three distinct trigger conditions based on the location of a non-zero cell in the input grid:\n    *   **Right Edge:** A non-zero cell in the last column triggers a horizontal fill leftwards in the same row.\n    *   **Second-to-Last Row:** A non-zero cell in the second-to-last row triggers a vertical fill upwards in the same column.\n    *   **Left Edge:** A non-zero cell in the first column triggers a diagonal fill upwards and rightwards.\n4.  **Fill Color:** The fill operation uses the color (integer value) of the trigger cell.\n5.  **Stopping Conditions:** The fill operations do not overwrite existing non-zero cells from the input. Each fill type has specific conditions that stop its propagation:\n    *   **Horizontal Fill (Leftwards):** Stops upon encountering any non-zero cell in the same row to its left.\n    *   **Vertical Fill (Upwards):** Stops upon encountering a non-zero cell in the same column above it, OR stops just before reaching a row that contains *any* non-zero cell.\n    *   **Diagonal Fill (Up-Right):** Stops upon encountering any non-zero cell on its diagonal path, OR stops if the current fill position `(nr, nc)` satisfies `nr <= R` and `nc >= C` for any *other* non-zero cell `(R, C)` present in the original input. It also stops if it goes out of the grid boundaries.\n6.  **Independence:** Each trigger cell initiates its fill independently based on the *input* grid state. The resulting fills are combined in the output grid.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
