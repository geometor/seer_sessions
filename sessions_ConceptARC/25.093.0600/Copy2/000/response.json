This acts as a \"frame\".\n    *   The other pattern varies between examples (a plus shape with '2's and '4' in `train_1`, a diamond shape with '6's and '1's in `train_2`). This is the \"content\" pattern.\n    *   The output grid modifies the input by placing a copy of the \"content\" pattern inside the hollow area of the \"frame\" pattern.\n    *   The original positions of the \"frame\" and \"content\" patterns (outside the frame) remain unchanged in the output, except for the area within the frame which is overwritten.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
