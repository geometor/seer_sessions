            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code based on a simple flood fill using an \"inner color\" failed significantly across multiple examples. The key issues appear to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Fill Logic:** The transformation is not a simple flood fill of all background cells within the boundary. Instead, it seems to involve replicating or tiling a pattern derived from the \"inner\" shape(s) onto the background cells within the boundary.\n2.  **Boundary/Fill Color Identification:** The logic to distinguish boundary and fill colors might be insufficient, especially highlighted by Test Example 3 where the boundary and the \"inner\" structure share the same color. The concept should shift from just an \"inner color\" to an \"inner pattern\".\n3.  **Fill Area Definition:** While identifying cells inside the boundary (not reachable from the edge) seems conceptually correct, the application of the fill color/pattern was incorrect. Only the background ('0') cells *inside* the boundary should be candidates for modification, and the modification depends on the tiling pattern.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define \"boundary shape\" and \"inner pattern\". The inner pattern is the shape/structure enclosed by the boundary, defined by its non-zero cells and potentially internal background cells within its bounding box.\n2.  **Develop Tiling Logic:** Implement a mechanism to tile the identified inner pattern across the background ('0') cells enclosed by the boundary. This involves:\n    *   Finding the bounding box of the inner pattern.\n    *   Using modulo arithmetic based on the pattern's dimensions to determine which pattern cell corresponds to each internal background cell.\n    *   Replacing the background cell with the corresponding pattern cell's color *only if* the pattern cell is non-zero.\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure the logic correctly handles cases like Test 3 where the inner pattern has the same color as the boundary, and cases where the inner pattern might contain background ('0') cells itself.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nWe will calculate metrics for each example to better understand the transformation characteristics.\n\n"
