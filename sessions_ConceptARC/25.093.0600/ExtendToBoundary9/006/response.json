            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis involves identifying a boundary color, finding the enclosed background ('0') cells, extracting an inner pattern from the enclosed region, and tiling this pattern onto the enclosed background cells. The provided code attempts this but fails on all examples, indicating flaws in one or more steps: boundary identification, enclosed cell identification, pattern extraction, or the tiling process.\n\nSpecifically:\n-   **Train 1 & Test 1:** The code appears to fill the entire enclosed area with a single color derived from the pattern (color 2 and 4 respectively), instead of tiling the actual pattern (which includes 0s in Train 1, and is 2x2 in Test 1). The original pattern cells are also overwritten.\n-   **Train 2 & Test 2:** Similar issues. The code seems to fail to identify the correct pattern or apply it correctly. Test 2 fails completely, suggesting the pattern extraction or boundary finding failed.\n-   **Train 3 & Test 3:** These are significantly different. The \"pattern\" in Train 3 (color 7) is tiled correctly in the expected output. In Test 3, the pattern is part of the boundary itself (color 7), and the code fails entirely, filling the whole inside with the boundary color.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the definitions of \"boundary,\" \"enclosed background,\" \"inner pattern,\" and the \"tiling\" mechanism. The pattern seems to be the content within the bounding box of *all* non-background elements strictly inside the boundary, extracted from the input grid. The tiling should only affect the enclosed background cells.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze each example using code execution. We'll reuse parts of the provided code's logic to simulate its internal state for analysis.\n\n"
