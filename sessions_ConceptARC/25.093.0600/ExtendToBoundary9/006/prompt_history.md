Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers, representing colors or states. '0' typically represents the background.
2.  **Key Colors:** In each example, there are two primary non-zero colors involved.
    *   One color forms a closed boundary shape (e.g., '3' in ex1, '4' in ex2, '6' in ex3).
    *   Another color exists as one or more smaller shapes or pixels *inside* this boundary (e.g., '2' in ex1, '5' in ex2, '7' in ex3).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a "fill" operation. The area enclosed by the boundary shape, which is initially '0' (background), gets filled with the color of the inner shape(s).
4.  **Preservation:** The original boundary shape and the original inner shape(s) are preserved in the output grid. Only the '0' cells *inside* the boundary are changed.
5.  **Defining "Inside":** A '0' cell is considered "inside" if it cannot reach the outer edge of the grid by moving horizontally or vertically without crossing a cell containing the boundary color.

**YAML Fact Document:**

    type: 2D array of integers

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Colors:**
    *   Determine the `boundary_color`, which is the color forming the main closed shape in the input grid.
    *   Determine the `fill_color`, which is the *other* non-zero color found located spatially inside the boundary shape.
3.  **Identify Fillable Cells:** Find all cells in the input grid that have the background color '0'.
4.  **Determine "Inside":** For each '0' cell identified in step 3, check if it lies within the region enclosed by the `boundary_color`. This can be done using a test like flood fill: start a flood fill from the '0' cell, restricted to only '0' cells. If the fill reaches the edge of the grid, the starting cell is outside; otherwise, it is inside.
5.  **Apply Fill:** For every '0' cell determined to be *inside* the boundary in step 4, change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to the `fill_color`.
6.  **Return Output:** The modified output grid is the result.
```python
import numpy as np
import collections

"""
Identifies a closed boundary shape of one color and an 'inner' element of another color within the input grid.
It then performs a flood fill operation, changing the color of all background (0) cells enclosed by the boundary shape to the color of the inner element.
The boundary shape and the original inner element(s) retain their colors.

1. Identify the two distinct non-zero colors present in the grid.
2. Determine which color forms the boundary and which color is the 'fill' color (the one initially inside). This is done by tentatively assuming one color is the boundary, finding the enclosed '0' cells, and checking if the other color is adjacent to any of these enclosed cells.
3. Identify all '0' cells reachable from the grid edges without crossing the determined boundary color. These are 'outside' cells.
4. All '0' cells not reachable from the edges are considered 'inside'.
5. Change the color of all 'inside' '0' cells to the determined fill color in the output grid.

"""
The transformation identifies a primary closed boundary shape of one color. 
Inside this boundary, there exists at least one 'pattern' element, potentially consisting of multiple cells of a different color (or sometimes the same color as the boundary).
The core operation involves tiling this inner 'pattern' onto all background (color 0) cells that are strictly enclosed by the boundary shape.

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Boundary Color:** Find the color forming the outermost closed loop. This is typically the color surrounding the largest contiguous area of '0's that cannot reach the grid edge.
3.  **Identify Enclosed Background Cells:** Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all '0' cells on the grid's edges. Mark all reachable '0' cells. Any '0' cell *not* marked is considered enclosed by the boundary.
4.  **Identify Inner Pattern:**
    *   Find all non-zero cells adjacent to the enclosed background cells identified in step 3. These form the potential inner pattern elements. Filter out cells that have the boundary color if they are part of the main boundary structure itself (e.g., check if they are adjacent to outside '0's).
    *   Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col) of these inner pattern cells.
    *   Extract the pattern: create a small 2D array representing the content within the bounding box, relative to the top-left corner (min_row, min_col) of the box. This pattern includes the identified inner pattern cells and any original '0's within that bounding box.
5.  **Tile Pattern:**
    *   Iterate through each enclosed background cell (from step 3) in the `output_grid`.
    *   Calculate the cell's position relative to the top-left corner of the pattern's bounding box: `rel_row = row - min_row`, `rel_col = col - min_col`.
    *   Determine the corresponding cell in the pattern using the modulo operator: `pattern_row = rel_row % pattern_height`, `pattern_col = rel_col % pattern_width`.
    *   Get the color from the `pattern[pattern_row, pattern_col]`.
    *   If the pattern color is not the background color (0), update the `output_grid` at `(row, col)` with this pattern color.

"""
The transformation identifies a primary closed boundary shape of one color. 
Inside this boundary, there exists a 'pattern' element (potentially multi-colored and including background 0s), defined by the content within the bounding box of specific non-boundary elements found inside.
The core operation involves tiling this inner 'pattern' onto all background (color 0) cells that are strictly enclosed by the boundary shape. The original boundary and pattern elements remain unchanged.

1.  Initialize: Create a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify Boundary Color: Find the non-zero color that partitions the grid such that the largest connected component of '0' cells is not reachable from the grid edges without crossing this color.
3.  Identify Enclosed Background Cells: Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all '0' cells on the grid's edges. Mark all reachable '0' cells, without crossing the boundary color. Any '0' cell *not* marked is considered enclosed.
4.  Extract Inner Pattern:
    a. Identify all non-zero cells located within the region enclosed by the boundary (i.e., not reachable from the edge without crossing the boundary).
    b. Determine the minimal bounding box containing these enclosed non-zero cells.
    c. Extract the rectangular subgrid defined by this bounding box from the *original input grid*. This is the `pattern_array`.
    d. Record the top-left coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) of the bounding box as the `pattern_origin`.
5.  Tile Pattern:
    a. Iterate through each enclosed background cell coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b. Calculate corresponding indices `(pattern_row, pattern_col)` within the `pattern_array` using modulo arithmetic relative to the `pattern_origin`.
    c. Retrieve the `pattern_color` from `pattern_array[pattern_row, pattern_col]`.
    d. If `pattern_color` is not '0', update the cell in the *output grid* at `(r, c)` to this `pattern_color`.
6.  Return: The modified output grid.
