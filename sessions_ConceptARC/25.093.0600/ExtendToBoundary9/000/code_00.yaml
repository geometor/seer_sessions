task_elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    role: input/output canvas
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - color: integer (0 for background, non-zero for objects)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: boundary_shape
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer (e.g., 3, 4, 6)
      - topology: forms a closed loop
      - role: defines an enclosed region
  - object: inner_element
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer, different from boundary_color (e.g., 2, 5, 7)
      - position: located within the region enclosed by boundary_shape
      - role: determines the fill color
  - object: enclosed_region
    definition: The set of background (color 0) cells that are inside the boundary_shape.
    determination: A background cell is inside if a path to the grid edge necessarily crosses the boundary_shape.
  - action: identify_boundary_color
    description: Find the color forming the outermost closed loop.
  - action: identify_fill_color
    description: Find the non-zero color present inside the boundary_shape (distinct from boundary_color).
  - action: fill_enclosed_region
    input: grid, boundary_color, fill_color
    output: modified grid
    description: Change the color of all background cells within the enclosed_region to the fill_color.
    constraints: Does not modify cells with boundary_color or original fill_color.
relationships:
  - boundary_shape encloses inner_element
  - boundary_shape encloses enclosed_region
  - fill_color is the color of inner_element
