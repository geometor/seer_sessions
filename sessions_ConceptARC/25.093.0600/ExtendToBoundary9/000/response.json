'0' typically represents the background.\n2.  **Key Colors:** In each example, there are two primary non-zero colors involved.\n    *   One color forms a closed boundary shape (e.g., '3' in ex1, '4' in ex2, '6' in ex3).\n    *   Another color exists as one or more smaller shapes or pixels *inside* this boundary (e.g., '2' in ex1, '5' in ex2, '7' in ex3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a \"fill\" operation. The area enclosed by the boundary shape, which is initially '0' (background), gets filled with the color of the inner shape(s).\n4.  **Preservation:** The original boundary shape and the original inner shape(s) are preserved in the output grid. Only the '0' cells *inside* the boundary are changed.\n5.  **Defining \"Inside\":** A '0' cell is considered \"inside\" if it cannot reach the outer edge of the grid by moving horizontally or vertically without crossing a cell containing the boundary color.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

This can be done using a test like flood fill: start a flood fill from the '0' cell, restricted to only '0' cells. If the fill reaches the edge of the grid, the starting cell is outside; otherwise, it is inside.\n5.  **Apply Fill:** For every '0' cell determined to be *inside* the boundary in step 4, change the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to the `fill_color`.\n6.  **Return Output:** The modified output grid is the result."
