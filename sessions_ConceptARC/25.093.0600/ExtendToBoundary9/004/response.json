            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed because it implemented a simple flood fill with a single color, whereas the task requires tiling a *pattern* found inside the boundary onto the enclosed background area. The results clearly show repeating patterns in the filled areas that correspond to the shapes and colors of the elements originally found inside the boundary.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Boundary Identification:** Keep the existing approach. Identify the color that encloses the largest area of '0' cells (background) that cannot reach the grid edge. This color is the `boundary_color`.\n2.  **Enclosed Area Identification:** Keep the existing approach. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar flood-fill algorithm starting from all '0' cells on the grid edges. Mark all reachable '0' cells. Any '0' cell *not* marked is considered enclosed.\n3.  **Pattern Extraction:** This is the crucial new step.\n    *   Identify all non-zero cells that are *inside* the enclosed area or immediately adjacent to an enclosed '0' cell.\n    *   Filter out cells belonging to the main `boundary_color` structure, focusing on the distinct element(s) inside. This might involve checking adjacency to non-enclosed '0's or simply finding the bounding box of non-boundary colors within the enclosed region. The examples suggest the pattern elements are contiguous or close together.\n    *   Determine the bounding box (min/max row and column) of these identified pattern elements.\n    *   Extract the rectangular region defined by this bounding box from the *original input grid*. This region is the `pattern`.\n4.  **Pattern Tiling:**\n    *   Determine the top-left coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) of the extracted `pattern`.\n    *   Iterate through all the enclosed '0' cells identified in step 2.\n    *   For each enclosed cell at `(r, c)`, calculate its corresponding position in the pattern using modulo arithmetic relative to the pattern's origin:\n        *   `pattern_row = (r - min_row) % pattern_height`\n        *   `pattern_col = (c - min_col) % pattern_width`\n    *   Get the `pattern_color` from `pattern[pattern_row, pattern_col]`.\n    *   If `pattern_color` is not '0' (background), update the output grid at `(r, c)` with `pattern_color`.\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.\n\nThis strategy addresses the core failure of the previous attempt by incorporating the pattern extraction and tiling mechanism observed in the examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nWe will use code execution to gather specific details about the boundary, enclosed area, and pattern for each example.\n\n"

It incorrectly identified the boundary color in Train Example 1 and Test Example 1, choosing the *inner* color instead of the outer frame.

The boundary identification needs to be more robust, possibly by checking connectivity or looking for the color that forms a closed loop separating inner '0's from the edge.\n*   **Pattern Identification Issue:** The logic for finding `potential_pattern_coords` needs adjustment. In Train 1, the '2's should be the pattern. In Test 1, the '4's. In Test 3, the inner '7's should be the pattern. The filtering based on adjacency and reachability needs revision, especially for cases where the pattern color is the same as the boundary color (Test 3).\n\nLet's manually verify the expected patterns based on visual inspection and the previous code's output:\n\n*   Train 1: Boundary=3, Pattern=`[[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]` at (3, 7)\n*   Train 2: Boundary=4, Pattern=`[[5, 5], [5, 5]]` at (8, 10)\n*   Train 3: Boundary=6, Pattern=`[[7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]` at (5, 6)\n*   Test 1: Boundary=8, Pattern=`[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` at (6, 6)\n*   Test 2: Boundary=2, Pattern=`[[3, 3], [3, 3]]` at (6, 5)\n*   Test 3: Boundary=7, Pattern=`[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` at (5, 2) (Pattern extracted from inside the boundary)\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

This is the non-zero color that forms a closed loop separating the largest region of background ('0') cells from the grid edges.\n3.  **Identify Enclosed Background Cells:** Find all background ('0') cells that cannot reach any edge of the grid by moving horizontally or vertically without crossing a cell with the `boundary_color`. Store these coordinates.\n4.  **Extract Inner Pattern:**\n    a.  Identify all non-zero cells within the enclosed region (not reachable from the edge) or adjacent to the enclosed background cells found in step 3.\n    b.  Filter these candidates to isolate the core pattern element(s), removing cells that are part of the main outer boundary structure. This involves identifying the set of connected non-zero cells (potentially including boundary-colored cells if they are internal) that are spatially within the boundary.\n    c.  Determine the minimal bounding box (min/max row/col) containing these core pattern cells.\n    d.  Extract the rectangular subgrid defined by this bounding box from the *original input grid*. This subgrid is the `pattern_array`.\n    e.  Record the top-left coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`) of the bounding box as the `pattern_origin`. Record the `pattern_height` and `pattern_width`.\n5.  **Tile Pattern:**\n    a.  Iterate through each enclosed background cell coordinate `(r, c)` identified in step 3.\n    b.  Calculate the corresponding indices within the `pattern_array` using the `pattern_origin` and dimensions:\n        *   `pattern_row = (r - min_row) % pattern_height`\n        *   `pattern_col = (c - min_col) % pattern_width`\n    c.  Retrieve the `pattern_color` from `pattern_array[pattern_row, pattern_col]`.\n    d.  If the `pattern_color` is not '0', update the cell in the *output grid* at `(r, c)` to this `pattern_color`.\n6.  **Return Output:** The modified output grid is the result."
