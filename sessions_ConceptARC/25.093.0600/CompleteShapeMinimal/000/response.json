Each grid contains a background color (0) and a primary foreground shape defined by a single non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 6, or 3). This foreground shape may contain internal 'holes' represented by the background color (0). The transformation identifies these internal holes within the main shape and fills them with the foreground color, effectively making the shape solid. The background surrounding the main shape remains unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML:**\n    "
