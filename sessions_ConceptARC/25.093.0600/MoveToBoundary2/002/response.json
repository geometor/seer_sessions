            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on `train_1`, identified a \"column gravity\" rule where '7's fall to the bottom of their respective columns. This worked for `train_1`, `train_3`, and `test_2`. However, the code implementing this failed on `train_2`, `test_1`, and `test_3`. Analysis of these failures revealed that in these cases, the '7's actually moved horizontally to the *right* within their respective *rows*, stacking up against the right edge.\n\nThe key difference between the two sets of examples appears to be the maximum density of '7's along rows versus columns. Examples requiring column gravity have a higher maximum count of '7's in at least one column compared to the maximum count in any row. Conversely, examples requiring row gravity (push right) have a maximum row count greater than or equal to the maximum column count.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Calculate the maximum number of '7's in any single row (`max_row_sevens`).\n2.  Calculate the maximum number of '7's in any single column (`max_col_sevens`).\n3.  Compare these two maximums.\n4.  If `max_col_sevens > max_row_sevens`, apply the \"column gravity\" transformation.\n5.  Otherwise (if `max_row_sevens >= max_col_sevens`), apply the \"row gravity\" (push right) transformation.\n6.  Update the YAML and natural language program to reflect this conditional logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
