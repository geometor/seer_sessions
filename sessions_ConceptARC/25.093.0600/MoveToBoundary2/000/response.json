The transformation seems to rearrange the positions of the '7's within the grid while keeping the '0's. Observing the examples, it appears that the '7's within each column \"fall\" downwards, stacking up at the bottom of the column. The relative horizontal positions (columns) of the '7's are preserved, but their vertical positions change based on how many '7's are in that specific column. The operation is column-independent; the movement of '7's in one column does not affect other columns. It's like applying gravity to the '7's within each column separately.\n\n**YAML block documenting facts:**\n\n"
