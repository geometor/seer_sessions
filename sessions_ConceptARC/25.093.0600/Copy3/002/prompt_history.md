Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids containing single digits (integers 0-9).
2.  **Dimensions:** The output grid always has the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
    *   `train_1`: 11 rows, 16 columns.
    *   `train_2`: 15 rows, 13 columns.
3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves rearranging or copying parts of the input grid to create the output grid. It's not a simple element-wise mapping or a global filter. It appears to be a structural copy/paste operation.
4.  **Example 1 (train\_1):** The input grid has width 16 (even). The output grid is formed by taking the left half of the input grid (columns 0-7) and placing it side-by-side, forming both the left (0-7) and right (8-15) halves of the output. The original right half of the input is discarded. This looks like a mirroring or duplication of the left half.
5.  **Example 2 (train\_2):** The input grid has width 13 (odd). The transformation is more complex.
    *   The output grid initially seems to retain some structure from the input, particularly the leftmost columns.
    *   A specific pattern `6 6` appears at `input[3, 6:8]`.
    *   A block of data from the input `input[2:9, 0:6]` (rows 2-8, columns 0-5) seems to be identified as a "source" block.
    *   This source block is copied into the output grid, starting at position `(5, 6)`.
    *   The destination position `(5, 6)` seems derived from the source position `(2, 0)` and the marker position `(3, 6)`: `dest_row = src_row + marker_row = 2 + 3 = 5`, `dest_col = src_col + marker_col = 0 + 6 = 6`.
    *   The mirroring operation seen in `train_1` seems to be the default behavior, which is then partially overwritten by this specific block copy operation triggered by the `6 6` marker.
6.  **General Logic:** The task likely involves a default transformation (mirroring the left half) and an optional, overriding transformation (block copy) triggered by specific patterns (like `6 6`) within the input grid. The parameters for the block copy (source block, destination position) are derived from the position of the trigger pattern and potentially the structure around it.
