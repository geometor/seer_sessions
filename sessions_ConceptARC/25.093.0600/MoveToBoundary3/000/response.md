*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a 2D grid containing a pattern made of the digit '2' against a background of '0's. The core operation is translating the entire pattern horizontally to the right. The amount of translation is determined by the initial position of the pattern relative to the right edge of the grid. The shape and composition of the pattern itself remain unchanged during the transformation.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid:
      type: 2D array
      element_type: integer
      background_value: 0
      dimensions: 10x10 (in examples)
    object:
      definition: collection of cells with value 2
      properties:
        - shape: invariant
        - color/value: 2 (invariant)
        - position: changes
      relationships:
        - composed_of: cells with value 2
        - exists_on: grid
    action:
      type: horizontal translation (shift right)
      target: object
      parameter: shift_amount
      determinant_of_parameter: distance from the object's rightmost edge to the grid's right edge
    transformation:
      - identify the object (all cells with value 2).
      - determine the maximum column index (max_col) occupied by any part of the object.
      - determine the grid width (num_cols). The rightmost column index is num_cols - 1.
      - calculate the shift amount: shift = (num_cols - 1) - max_col.
      - create a new grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background value (0).
      - for each cell (r, c) in the input grid containing the object's value (2):
          - place the value 2 at position (r, c + shift) in the new grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the pattern formed by all cells with the value '2' in the input grid.
    2.  Find the column index of the rightmost cell belonging to this pattern.
    3.  Calculate the horizontal distance (number of columns) between this rightmost cell and the right edge of the grid.
    4.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with '0's.
    5.  For every cell containing a '2' at position (row, column) in the input grid, place a '2' at position (row, column + calculated\_distance) in the output grid.
