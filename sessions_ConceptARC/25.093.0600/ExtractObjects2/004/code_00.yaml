task_type: grid_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D grid of integers.
    properties:
      - contains_zeros: True (can be background or target)
      - contains_non_zeros: True (can be target or noise within target bbox)
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A subgrid extracted from the input, potentially filtered.
transformation:
  action: extract_and_filter_subgrid
  selection_criteria:
    target: integer_value (can be 0)
    method: find all occurrences of each unique integer value present in the input grid.
    metric: density = (count_of_occurrences) / (area_of_minimal_bounding_box_enclosing_occurrences)
    rule: choose the integer value with the highest density.
    tie_breaking:
        - 1st: highest count of occurrences
        - 2nd: smallest bounding box area
        - 3rd: smallest integer value (arbitrary but consistent)
  subgrid_definition:
    type: bounding_box
    description: Minimal rectangular area enclosing all occurrences of the selected target integer value.
  filtering:
    action: mask_subgrid
    source: extracted subgrid based on bounding_box
    mask_condition: keep cells if the corresponding cell in the original input grid (at the same absolute coordinates) contained the selected target integer value.
    replacement_value: 0 (for cells not matching the mask condition)
relationships:
  - output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the selected target value's occurrences.
  - output grid content is a filtered version of the input grid within the bounding box, keeping only the target value and replacing others with 0.
