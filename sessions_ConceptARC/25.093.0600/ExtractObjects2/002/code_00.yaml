task_type: grid_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D grid of integers, likely represented as a NumPy array in the execution environment.
    properties:
      - contains_zeros: True (background)
      - contains_non_zeros: True (form distinct connected components)
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A subgrid extracted from the input, expected as a list of lists.
transformation:
  action: extract_subgrid
  target_object:
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - composed_of_single_non_zero_value: True
      - criteria_for_selection: largest_area (maximum number of cells, using 4-way connectivity)
  subgrid_definition:
    type: bounding_box
    description: Minimal rectangular area enclosing all cells of the target connected component.
relationships:
  - output is a sub-section of the input grid.
  - the content of the output grid directly corresponds to the content of the input grid within the identified bounding box.
execution_context_notes:
  - The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" suggests the input grid is passed as a NumPy array, while the provided code primarily uses list operations. Comparisons or boolean checks involving arrays might require explicit handling (e.g., using .any() or .all(), though less likely for direct element comparison). The code needs modification to handle NumPy arrays gracefully, potentially converting the final output to list-of-lists if required.
