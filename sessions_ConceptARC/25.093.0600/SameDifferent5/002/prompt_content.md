1. Scan the input grid to identify all distinct connected components (objects) formed by non-zero numbers.
2. For each identified object, determine its primary constituent number (the 'main number').
3. Check if the object encloses one or more cells containing a single, different non-zero number (the 'internal number'). Only consider objects that have such an internal number.
4. From the set of objects identified in step 3, find the minimum 'main number'.
5. Identify all objects from step 3 whose 'main number' is equal to this minimum value.
6. Collect the 'internal number'(s) from these specific objects found in step 5.
7. The final output is the maximum value among the collected 'internal number'(s).
