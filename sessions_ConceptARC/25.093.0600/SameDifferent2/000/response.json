            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (colors) based on the spatial relationships between connected components of the same color (objects). The transformation rule appears complex, involving multiple conditions based on object color, isolation, and contact with objects of different colors.\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of integers, representing colors. 0 is the background.\n2.  **Objects:** Connected components (sharing an edge, not just diagonally) of the same non-zero integer value form distinct objects.\n3.  **Transformation:** Some objects from the input grid are removed (pixels turned to 0) in the output grid, while others are kept.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The primary factor determining removal seems to be whether an object touches (is adjacent to) another object of a *different* color. However, not all such interactions lead to removal, and the outcome depends on the specific colors involved.\n5.  **Color Categories:** There appears to be a distinction between colors {1, 3, 7} and {2, 4, 8, 9}. Objects with colors {1, 3, 7} seem more likely to be removed when interacting with other colors.\n6.  **Special Cases for Color 1:** Objects of color 1 have unique behavior: they are removed if isolated or if they only touch other objects of color 1 (Example 4).\n7.  **Inconsistent Interaction Outcomes:**\n    *   7 touches 1 -> 7 removed, 1 kept (Ex 1).\n    *   1 touches 8 -> 1 removed, 8 kept (Ex 2).\n    *   3 touches 2 -> 3 removed, 2 kept (Ex 2).\n    *   2 touches 8 -> Both kept (Ex 2).\n    *   7 touches 3 -> Both kept (Ex 4).\n8.  **Single Color Exception:** Example 3, containing only color 4, shows removal patterns (parts of a single large object are removed) that don't fit the interaction rules observed in the multi-color examples. This suggests a separate rule or modification might apply when only one non-zero color is present, or this specific example might follow a different logic.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
