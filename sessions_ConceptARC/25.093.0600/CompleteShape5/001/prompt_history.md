Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 6x6 grids.
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain integer values: 0 (representing empty or background), 3, and 4.
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation is localized; only a few cells change value from input to output. Specifically, some 0s become either 3 or 4. The existing 3s and 4s remain unchanged.
4.  **Pattern Focus:** The changes seem dependent on the neighboring cells. The values 3 and 4 appear to influence the placement of each other in previously empty (0) cells.
5.  **Neighbor Influence:** The critical pattern involves a specific configuration of three neighboring cells having the same value (either three 3s or three 4s) around a cell with value 0.
6.  **L-Shape Pattern:** The configuration of the three influencing neighbors forms an "L" shape (three cells occupying a 2x2 area, excluding one corner). The target 0 cell is the missing corner needed to complete the 2x2 block.
7.  **Value Inversion:** When a 0 cell is surrounded by an L-shape of three 4s, it becomes 3. When surrounded by an L-shape of three 3s, it becomes 4.
