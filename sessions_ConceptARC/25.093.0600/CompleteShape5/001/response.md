"""
Identify cells with value 0 in the input grid. For each such cell, examine its 
neighbors. If three neighbors form an 'L' shape around the cell (i.e., the 
three cells occupy a 2x2 area excluding the cell itself) and all three 
neighbors have the same value 'v', then change the value of the center cell (0) 
in the output grid. If the neighbors' value 'v' is 3, the cell becomes 4. 
If the neighbors' value 'v' is 4, the cell becomes 3. If a cell is not 0, or 
if the L-shape condition is not met, its value remains unchanged in the output grid.
