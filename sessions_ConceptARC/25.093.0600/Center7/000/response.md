Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a multi-line string representing a grid (matrix) of single-digit integers. The numbers are separated by spaces within each line. The grids in the examples are square (5x5, 5x5, 9x9). Each grid seems to primarily contain zeros and one other distinct non-zero integer (1, 2, or 4 in the examples). The non-zero numbers form noticeable patterns (triangles).
2.  **Output:** The output is always a single line string containing integers separated by spaces. The integer repeated in the output is the same as the dominant non-zero integer found in the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The core task appears to be identifying the dominant non-zero number from the input grid and determining how many times it should be repeated in the output string. The number of repetitions seems linked to the structure of the input grid, specifically the content of its central row.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions (rows, columns)
      - elements (integers, including 0)
      - contains a unique non-zero integer (value)
      - has a center row
  - name: output_list
    type: 1D array/string of integers
    properties:
      - elements (integers)
      - length

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: input_string
    output: input_grid
  - name: identify_non_zero_value
    input: input_grid
    output: value (the unique non-zero integer)
  - name: find_center_row
    input: input_grid
    output: center_row (1D array of integers)
  - name: count_occurrences
    input: 
      - value
      - center_row
    output: count (integer)
  - name: generate_output
    input:
      - value
      - count
    output: output_list (formatted as a space-separated string)

relationships:
  - The integer used in the 'output_list' is the 'value' identified from the 'input_grid'.
  - The 'length' of the 'output_list' (number of repetitions) is determined by the 'count' of the 'value' in the 'center_row' of the 'input_grid'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and parse it into a grid (2D array) of integers.
2.  Scan the grid to find the unique non-zero integer; let this be `target_value`.
3.  Determine the number of rows in the grid.
4.  Identify the middle row of the grid (if the grid has `R` rows, the middle row is at index `floor(R/2)`, using 0-based indexing).
5.  Count how many times `target_value` appears in this middle row; let this be `repeat_count`.
6.  Construct the output string by repeating `target_value` exactly `repeat_count` times, with each instance separated by a single space.
