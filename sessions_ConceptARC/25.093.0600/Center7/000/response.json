The numbers are separated by spaces within each line. The grids in the examples are square (5x5, 5x5, 9x9). Each grid seems to primarily contain zeros and one other distinct non-zero integer (1, 2, or 4 in the examples). The non-zero numbers form noticeable patterns (triangles).\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a single line string containing integers separated by spaces. The integer repeated in the output is the same as the dominant non-zero integer found in the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task appears to be identifying the dominant non-zero number from the input grid and determining how many times it should be repeated in the output string. The number of repetitions seems linked to the structure of the input grid, specifically the content of its central row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
