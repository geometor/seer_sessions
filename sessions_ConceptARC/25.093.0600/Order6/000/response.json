The blocks themselves (their digit, shape, and internal structure) remain unchanged. Their horizontal positions (leftmost column) also appear unchanged relative to the grid width.\n4.  **Reordering Pattern:** The vertical rearrangement is not random. In `train_1`, the blocks seem to be re-stacked based on their height (1x1 block 5, then 2x2 block 2, then 3x3 block 4, then 4x4 block 3). In `train_2`, all blocks have the same height (3 rows), and the reordering seems based on their width (3x4 block 1, then 3x6 block 6, then 3x8 block 4, then 3x10 block 7). This suggests a primary sort by height and a secondary sort by width.\n5.  **Anchoring:** The entire stack of reordered blocks seems to be positioned vertically such that the bottom edge of the lowest block in the final stack aligns with the bottom-most extent of *any* block in the original input grid. The sorted blocks are then stacked contiguously upwards from this bottom anchor.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks composed of the same non-zero digit. For each block found, record its digit value, its height, its width, and the column index of its leftmost edge (`left_col`).\n3.  Determine the overall bottom-most row index (`anchor_bottom_row`) occupied by any non-zero cell in the input grid.\n4.  Create a list of the identified blocks.\n5.  Sort this list of blocks primarily in ascending order based on their height. If two blocks have the same height, sort them secondarily in ascending order based on their width.\n6.  Iterate through the *sorted* list of blocks, starting from the *last* block (the one with the greatest height/width) and moving towards the *first* block. Maintain a `current_bottom_row` variable, initially set to the `anchor_bottom_row`.\n7.  For the current block being processed:\n    a. Calculate its required `top_row` as `current_bottom_row - height + 1`.\n    b. Place the block (using its digit value) into the output grid, spanning from `top_row` to `current_bottom_row` vertically, and starting horizontally at its original `left_col` for its calculated `width`.\n    c. Update `current_bottom_row` to `top_row - 1` to prepare for placing the next block immediately above the current one.\n8.  After processing all blocks, the output grid is complete."
