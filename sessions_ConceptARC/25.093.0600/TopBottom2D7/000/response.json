            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** An 8x8 grid containing integers 0, 1, and 3. Zero appears to be a background color. The non-zero numbers (1 and 3) form contiguous blocks, either horizontally, vertically, or as single cells. There can be multiple blocks of 1s and multiple blocks of 3s within the same input grid.\n*   **Output:** A potentially smaller grid containing only the cells from *one type* of block (either all the 1s or all the 3s) present in the input. The spatial arrangement of the selected blocks relative to each other seems preserved, cropped to their bounding box.\n*   **Transformation:** The core task is to select *which* number (1 or 3) should be preserved in the output, and then extract all blocks of that selected number from the input grid.\n\n**Identifying the Selection Criterion:**\n\nComparing the input and output across the examples, the selection seems based on position:\n\n1.  **train_1:** The block of '1's starts at row 0. The block of '3's starts at row 4. The output contains the '1's block (the top-most block).\n2.  **train_2:** The block of '3's starts at row 2. The block of '1's starts at row 3. The output contains the '3's block (the top-most block).\n3.  **train_3:** The block of '1's starts at row 3. The block of '3's starts at row 5. The output contains the '1's block (the top-most block).\n4.  **train_4:** A block of '3's starts at row 0. Another block of '3's starts at row 1. Blocks of '1's start at rows 4 and 5. The output contains both blocks of '3's (belonging to the top-most block type).\n5.  **train_5:** The block of '1' starts at row 2. The block of '3' starts at row 5. The output contains the '1' block (the top-most block).\n\nThe rule appears to be: find the non-zero block(s) that appear highest up in the grid (minimum row index). If there's a tie for the highest row index (e.g., multiple blocks start on the same top-most row), the left-most block (minimum column index among those tied) determines the number to select. Once the number (1 or 3) is selected based on this top-left-most block, *all* blocks of that number from the input are included in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
