task_elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 3]
      - background_value: 0
      - contains: NonZeroBlocks
  - object: NonZeroBlock
    properties:
      - type: contiguous group of cells
      - value: [1, 3]
      - location: defined by cell coordinates (row, column)
      - bounding_box: defines spatial extent
      - top_row_index: minimum row index of any cell in the block
      - left_col_index: minimum column index of any cell in the block
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: variable (cropped)
      - cell_values: [1] or [3] (mutually exclusive per example)
      - derived_from: a subset of NonZeroBlocks from InputGrid

relationships:
  - type: selection
    subject: NonZeroBlock value (1 or 3)
    rule: >
      Identify the block(s) with the minimum top_row_index.
      If multiple blocks share the minimum top_row_index,
      select the one among them with the minimum left_col_index.
      The value of this top-left-most block determines the selected value.
  - type: extraction
    subject: OutputGrid
    source: InputGrid
    rule: >
      Include all NonZeroBlocks from the InputGrid whose value matches
      the selected value. Preserve their relative spatial arrangement.
      Crop the output to the bounding box containing all selected blocks.
