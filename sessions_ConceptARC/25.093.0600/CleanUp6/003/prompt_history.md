*   **Perception:**
    *   The task operates on 2D grids containing numerical values (colors). The background is typically color 0.
    *   Each input grid contains, besides the background color 0, two other distinct non-zero colors.
    *   One non-zero color appears significantly more frequently than the other in the input grid. This suggests identifying a 'dominant' non-zero color based on count.
    *   The other non-zero color(s) act as 'minority' colors.
    *   The transformation rule involves filtering the grid based on color dominance and spatial relationships (connectivity).
    *   Specifically, all minority colors are removed (replaced by 0).
    *   The dominant color is kept only if a cell containing it is orthogonally adjacent (shares a side - up, down, left, or right) to at least one other cell also containing the dominant color. Isolated cells of the dominant color are also removed (replaced by 0).

*   **Facts:**

            - check orthogonal neighbors (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) within grid bounds

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-zero colors present.
    2.  Count the frequency of occurrence for each unique non-zero color.
    3.  Determine the 'dominant' color, which is the non-zero color with the highest frequency. All other non-zero colors are 'minority' colors.
    4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (0).
    5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at location (row, column).
    6.  Let the color in the current input cell be `current_color`.
    7.  If `current_color` is the identified dominant color:
        a.  Examine its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        b.  Check if at least one of these orthogonal neighbors in the *input* grid also contains the dominant color.
        c.  If such a neighbor exists (i.e., the current cell is not isolated), set the cell at (row, column) in the *output* grid to the dominant color.
    8.  If the `current_color` is not the dominant color (i.e., it's a minority color or the background color 0), or if it is the dominant color but is isolated (no orthogonal neighbors with the dominant color), the corresponding cell in the output grid retains its initial background color (0).
    9.  Return the completed output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

*   **Initial Hypothesis:** The first attempt correctly identified a pattern involving a "dominant" color (most frequent non-zero) and connectivity. The code aimed to keep only connected components of this single dominant color, removing minority colors and isolated dominant cells.
*   **Successes:** This worked perfectly for `train_1` and `test_1`, where there was a clear single dominant color and the rule applied cleanly.
*   **Failures & Discrepancies:**
    *   `train_2` and `test_2`: The provided `Transformed Output` in the prompt did *not* match the `Expected Output` and also seemed inconsistent with the provided code's logic (which should have matched the `Expected Output` based on the initial hypothesis). This suggests the example execution trace might have been faulty, but the underlying rule (keep connected components of the single most frequent color) likely holds for these cases.
    *   `test_3`: This example is crucial. It revealed that:
        *   There isn't always a *single* most frequent color (tie between 3, 5, 6, 7).
        *   Not all tied colors are kept (6 was removed, 3, 5, 7 were kept).
        *   A tie-breaking rule is needed, likely based on the spatial properties (connectivity, component size) of the tied colors in the input.
*   **Revised Strategy:**
    1.  Confirm the rule for single dominant colors: Keep cells with the dominant color if they are orthogonally connected to at least one other cell of the same dominant color in the input. Remove all minority colors and isolated dominant cells.
    2.  Develop a tie-breaking rule for cases with multiple colors sharing the highest frequency. Observation suggests keeping tied colors that form connected components larger than a single cell.
    3.  Combine these into a single algorithm: Find candidate colors (highest frequency). Apply the tie-breaking rule if needed to get the final "kept" colors. Filter the grid based on the connectivity rule, applied only to the "kept" colors.

**2. Metrics and Observations**

Let's gather metrics using `tool_code`. We need frequency counts and potentially connectivity info (though complex connectivity requires libraries not available, we inferred it manually for test_3).
