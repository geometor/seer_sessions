The background is typically color 0.\n    *   Each input grid contains, besides the background color 0, two other distinct non-zero colors.\n    *   One non-zero color appears significantly more frequently than the other in the input grid. This suggests identifying a 'dominant' non-zero color based on count.\n    *   The other non-zero color(s) act as 'minority' colors.\n    *   The transformation rule involves filtering the grid based on color dominance and spatial relationships (connectivity).\n    *   Specifically, all minority colors are removed (replaced by 0).\n    *   The dominant color is kept only if a cell containing it is orthogonally adjacent (shares a side - up, down, left, or right) to at least one other cell also containing the dominant color. Isolated cells of the dominant color are also removed (replaced by 0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
