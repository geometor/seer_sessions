The input grids contain distinct regions of non-zero colors, typically with one color region partially or fully surrounding another. The transformation replaces the \"inner\" color with the \"outer\" color, effectively filling the inner region with the color of the surrounding region. The background color (0) remains unchanged. The key is identifying which non-zero color is \"inner\" (doesn't touch the background) and which is \"outer\" (touches the background).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
