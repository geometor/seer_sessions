            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers.\n2.  **Colors/Numbers:** The integers represent different colors or states. The integer 0 consistently appears as a background color, remaining unchanged in the periphery and sometimes within internal areas. Non-zero integers represent distinct colored regions or objects within the grid.\n3.  **Objects/Regions:** The non-zero numbers form contiguous or separated regions (shapes). For instance, in `train_1`, there's a region of 1s and 2s, and a region of 3s. In `train_2`, there are regions of 8s, 4s, and 6s.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation modifies the colors of *some* non-zero cells. The background (0) cells seem unaffected. The core shapes generally persist, but boundaries or internal colors change.\n5.  **Key Change Pattern:** In both examples, a specific color seems to \"expand\" or \"influence\" its neighbors.\n    *   In `train_1`, cells colored 1 or 2 that are adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to a cell colored 3 in the *input* grid become color 3 in the *output* grid.\n    *   In `train_2`, cells colored 8 or 4 that are adjacent to a cell colored 6 in the *input* grid become color 6 in the *output* grid.\n6.  **Identifying the Influencing Color:** The color causing the change (3 in `train_1`, 6 in `train_2`) appears to be the most frequent non-zero color in the respective input grid.\n    *   `train_1`: Frequencies (approx): '3' occurs most often.\n    *   `train_2`: Frequencies (approx): '6' occurs most often.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
