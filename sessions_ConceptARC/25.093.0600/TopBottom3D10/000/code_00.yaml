Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
Cells:
  Properties:
    - color: integer value
    - position: [row, column]
    - is_background: true if color == 0 else false
Relationships:
  - Orthogonal Adjacency: Cells sharing an edge are neighbors.
Colors:
  - Background: 0
  - Foreground: non-zero integers
  - Dominant Color: The non-zero color with the highest frequency in the input grid.
Transformation:
  Name: Neighbor Influence / Color Spreading
  Input: Grid
  Output: Grid
  Rule: Non-zero cells in the input grid change their color to the Dominant Color if they are orthogonally adjacent to a cell that had the Dominant Color in the input grid.
  Invariants:
    - Background cells (color 0) remain unchanged.
    - Cells with the Dominant Color remain unchanged.
    - Non-zero cells not adjacent to the Dominant Color remain unchanged.
