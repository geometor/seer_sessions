The size appears constant (10x10 in the examples).\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation modifies the input grid row by row, but the logic seems to depend on pairs of consecutive rows.\n3.  **Row Pairing:** The grid is processed in pairs of adjacent rows: (row 0, row 1), (row 2, row 3), (row 4, row 5), and so on.\n4.  **Pattern Selection:** Within each pair, one of the two rows is chosen as a 'pattern' row.\n5.  **Selection Criterion:** The selection appears based on the number of non-zero elements in each row within the pair. The row with fewer non-zero elements is selected.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** If both rows in a pair have the same count of non-zero elements, the first row of the pair (the one with the even index) is selected as the pattern.\n7.  **Output Generation:** Once the pattern row is selected for a pair, *both* corresponding rows in the output grid become identical copies of that selected pattern row.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
