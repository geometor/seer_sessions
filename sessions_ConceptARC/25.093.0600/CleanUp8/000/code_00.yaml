Task: Grid Transformation by Row Pair Sparsity Comparison

Objects:
  - InputGrid: A 2D array of integers.
  - OutputGrid: A 2D array of integers, derived from InputGrid.
  - Row: A 1D array of integers representing a horizontal line in the grid.
  - RowPair: Two consecutive rows from the InputGrid (e.g., Row 2k and Row 2k+1).
  - Cell: An individual element within a Row/Grid containing an integer value.

Properties:
  - Row:
    - index: The vertical position (0-indexed).
    - values: The sequence of integers in the row.
    - non_zero_count: The number of cells in the row with a value not equal to 0.
  - RowPair:
    - first_row: The row with the even index (2k).
    - second_row: The row with the odd index (2k+1).
    - pattern_row: The selected row from the pair based on the comparison rule.

Actions:
  - Iterate: Process the InputGrid row pairs sequentially.
  - CountNonZeros: Calculate the non_zero_count for a given Row.
  - CompareCounts: Compare the non_zero_count of the first_row and second_row in a RowPair.
  - SelectPattern: Choose one row from the RowPair based on the comparison result (fewer non-zeros wins; first row wins ties).
  - CopyRow: Duplicate the values of the selected pattern_row.
  - AssignOutput: Set both corresponding rows in the OutputGrid to be copies of the pattern_row for that pair.

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions are the same as InputGrid dimensions.
  - OutputGrid rows at indices 2k and 2k+1 are both determined solely by the InputGrid rows at indices 2k and 2k+1.
  - The pattern_row is selected based on having the minimum non_zero_count within the RowPair (with tie-breaking favoring the first_row).
