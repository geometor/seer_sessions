```python
"""
Processes a 2D integer grid by iterating through pairs of consecutive rows (0&1, 2&3, etc.).
For each pair, it counts the non-zero elements in both rows.
The row with the fewer non-zero elements is selected as the 'pattern' row.
If the counts are equal, the first row of the pair (the one with the even index) is chosen.
Both rows in the output grid corresponding to the pair are then replaced with copies of this selected pattern row.
