            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the pairing of rows (0&1, 2&3, etc.) and the basic idea of selecting one row from the pair to influence the output. However, the comparison metric (simple non-zero count) and the method of generating the output row were inaccurate, leading to mismatches in all examples except for pairs where the correct output happened to be identical to one of the input rows that also had the minimum non-zero count (e.g., `train_1` pairs 0&1, 4&5).\n\nThe errors consistently show that the output row for a pair is a *modified* version of one of the input rows from that pair. The modification involves zeroing out certain elements. The key is to determine:\n1.  Which row of the pair (the 'candidate') serves as the basis for the output?\n2.  What rule determines which elements of the candidate row are kept and which are zeroed out?\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the input pair (Row A, Row B) and the corresponding output pair (which are identical rows, let's call the template Output Row O).\n2.  Confirm the selection rule for the 'candidate' row (Row A or Row B) that forms the basis for Output Row O. The previous hypothesis (minimum non-zero count, tie goes to the first row) appears correct for *selecting the candidate*.\n3.  Determine the filtering rule. The crucial insight seems to be comparing the *candidate* row with the *other* row in the pair (the 'comparison' row). An element in the candidate row is kept *only if* the corresponding element in the comparison row is *also non-zero*. Otherwise, the element in the output row is set to zero.\n4.  Use `tool_code` to systematically verify this refined hypothesis across all examples by calculating non-zero counts, identifying candidate/comparison rows, applying the filtering rule, and comparing the result to the expected output.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using tool\\_code):**\n"
