The initial hypothesis that the \"target\" element was the least frequent non-zero number worked for most examples but failed critically on Test Example 2, where only one non-zero number was present.\n\nThe evaluation results showing `Match: False` despite the correct sequence of numbers (`4`s followed by `0`s) appear to stem from a format mismatch between the expected output (represented as a multi-line string/column vector in the problem description) and the generated output (a single list/row vector). The core logic of the *revised* hypothesis (below) correctly determines the *number* of '4's needed for each example.\n\nThe key insight gained from analyzing the failures, particularly Test Example 2, is that the distinction between \"boundary\" and \"target\" elements is based on spatial properties (adjacency to the outermost background) rather than frequency or numerical value difference.\n\nThe strategy is to redefine the transformation based on identifying:\n1.  The \"Outer Background\": All 0-valued cells connected to the grid border.\n2.  \"Boundary Cells\": Non-zero cells adjacent to the Outer Background.\n3.  \"Target Cells\": All other non-zero cells (i.e., those not adjacent to the Outer Background).\nThe final output is derived by counting these Target Cells.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics gathered by analyzing inputs and expected outputs, confirmed by code execution (`"
