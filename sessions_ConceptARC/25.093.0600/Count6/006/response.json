            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the core logic for identifying and counting the \"target\" cells. The calculated counts (`train_1`: 2, `train_2`: 5, `test_1`: 3, `test_2`: 4, `test_3`: 2) perfectly match the number of '4's required in the expected output for all provided examples.\n\nThe discrepancy (\"Match: False\", \"Size Correct: False\") stems solely from the output format. The code generated a single list of integers (e.g., `[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), while the evaluation framework expects the output as a sequence of individual items, likely interpreted as one number per line, matching the multi-line format shown in the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe resolution involves modifying only the final output generation step. The process of identifying outer background, boundary cells, and counting target cells remains valid. The change required is to ensure the `transform` function returns a data structure that the evaluator interprets as a sequence of individual numbers (e.g., a list of integers where each integer corresponds to one line of the expected output), rather than a single list containing those numbers.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following table summarizes key metrics derived from analyzing the examples using the previously established logic:\n\n| Example   | Input Grid Dim | Outer Background Cells Identified | Boundary Cell Coordinates Count | Target Cell Count (Calculated) | Expected Output ('4's count) | Previous Code ('4's count) |\n| :-------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| `train_1` | 12x12          | Yes                               | 36                              | 2                              | 2                            | 2                           |\n| `train_2` | 7x11           | Yes                               | 28                              | 5                              | 5                            | 5                           |\n| `test_1`  | 15x15          | Yes                               | 52                              | 3                              | 3                            | 3                           |\n| `test_2`  | 11x9           | Yes                               | 30                              | 4                              | 4                            | 4                           |\n| `test_3`  | 6x6            | Yes                               | 16                              | 2                              | 2                            | 2                           |\n\n*Note: The target cell counts were confirmed via code execution.*\n"
