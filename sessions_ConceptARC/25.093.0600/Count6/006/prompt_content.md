"""
Identify non-zero 'target' cells within an input grid based on their spatial 
position: target cells are non-zero cells that are not directly adjacent 
(4-way connectivity) to the outermost layer of background (0-valued) cells 
connected to the grid edges. Count these target cells. Generate an output list 
containing the digit '4' for each target cell found. Pad this list with '0's 
at the end until it reaches a fixed length of 7.
