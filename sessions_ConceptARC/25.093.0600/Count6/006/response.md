## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully implemented the core logic for identifying and counting the "target" cells. The calculated counts (`train_1`: 2, `train_2`: 5, `test_1`: 3, `test_2`: 4, `test_3`: 2) perfectly match the number of '4's required in the expected output for all provided examples.

The discrepancy ("Match: False", "Size Correct: False") stems solely from the output format. The code generated a single list of integers (e.g., `[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), while the evaluation framework expects the output as a sequence of individual items, likely interpreted as one number per line, matching the multi-line format shown in the examples.

**Strategy:**

The resolution involves modifying only the final output generation step. The process of identifying outer background, boundary cells, and counting target cells remains valid. The change required is to ensure the `transform` function returns a data structure that the evaluator interprets as a sequence of individual numbers (e.g., a list of integers where each integer corresponds to one line of the expected output), rather than a single list containing those numbers.

## Metrics

The following table summarizes key metrics derived from analyzing the examples using the previously established logic:

| Example   | Input Grid Dim | Outer Background Cells Identified | Boundary Cell Coordinates Count | Target Cell Count (Calculated) | Expected Output ('4's count) | Previous Code ('4's count) |

| `test_2`  | 11x9           | Yes                               | 30                              | 4                              | 4                            | 4                           |
| `test_3`  | 6x6            | Yes                               | 16                              | 2                              | 2                            | 2                           |

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: >
  Identify specific non-zero 'target' cells within a 2D input grid based on their spatial relationship to the background and boundary.
  Represent each identified target cell with the digit '4'. Produce a fixed-size output sequence (length 7) containing these '4's, padded with '0's.
  Each digit in the sequence corresponds to a distinct item/line in the final output.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array (list of lists or numpy array) of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable rows and columns.
      - cell_values: Integers.

  - type: Cell_Value_Definition
    description: Defines roles based on value and spatial position.
    subtypes:
      - type: Background
        value: 0
        role: Represents empty space. Includes 'outer background'.
      - type: Outer_Background
        value: 0
        role: Background cells connected (4-way) to the grid edge, identified via BFS/DFS from edge zeros.
      - type: Boundary_Cell
        value: Non-zero integer
        role: Any non-zero cell directly adjacent (4-way) to at least one Outer_Background cell.
      - type: Target_Cell
        value: Non-zero integer
        role: Any non-zero cell that is *not* a Boundary_Cell. These are counted.

output_elements:
  - type: Sequence
    description: A fixed-length sequence (list) of individual integer digits.
    properties:
      - fixed_length: 7
      - element_values:
          - 4: Represents one identified 'Target_Cell'.
          - 0: Represents padding.
      - generation_rule: Contains 'N' instances of the digit 4, where N is the count of Target_Cells (capped at 7), followed by (7 - N) instances of the digit 0.
      - interpretation: Each integer in the sequence corresponds to one line/item in the expected output format.

relationships:
  - Spatial adjacency (4-way connectivity) determines if a non-zero cell is a Boundary_Cell (if adjacent to Outer_Background) or potentially a Target_Cell (if not adjacent to Outer_Background).

transformation:
  - action: Identify Outer Background Coordinates
    tool: BFS/DFS search
    input: Grid
    start_nodes: All cells with value 0 located on the grid edges (row 0, last row, col 0, last col).
    output: Set of (row, col) tuples for all connected outer background cells.
  - action: Identify Boundary Cell Coordinates
    input: Grid, Set of Outer Background Coordinates
    process: Iterate through all non-zero cells in the grid. For each, check its 4 neighbors. If any neighbor's coordinates are in the Outer Background set, mark the current cell's coordinates as boundary.
    output: Set of (row, col) tuples for all boundary cells.
  - action: Count Target Cells
    input: Grid, Set of Boundary Cell Coordinates
    process: Iterate through all cells. Increment count if cell value is non-zero AND its coordinates are *not* in the Boundary Cell set.
    output: Integer count of Target Cells.
  - action: Generate Output Sequence
    input: Target Cell Count
    process:
      1. Create an empty list.
      2. Append the integer `4` to the list `min(Target Cell Count, 7)` times.
      3. Append the integer `0` to the list until the list length is exactly 7.
    output: List of 7 integers.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Input:** Take the 2D grid of integers as input.
2.  **Find Outer Background:** Identify all cells with value 0 that are connected to the grid's border (top, bottom, left, or right edge) through a path of adjacent 0-valued cells. Store the coordinates of these "outer background" cells.
3.  **Find Boundary Cells:** Identify all cells that contain a non-zero value and are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one of the "outer background" cells found in step 2. Store the coordinates of these "boundary" cells.
4.  **Count Target Cells:** Initialize a counter to zero. Examine every cell in the grid. If a cell contains a non-zero value AND its coordinates were *not* stored as a "boundary" cell coordinate in step 3, increment the counter. This counter now holds the total number of "target" cells.
5.  **Prepare Output List:** Create an empty list to store the output sequence.
6.  **Add '4's:** Add the integer `4` to the output list, repeating this addition for each "target" cell counted in step 4. However, stop adding `4`s if the list already contains 7 elements.
7.  **Add Padding '0's:** If the output list currently has fewer than 7 elements, append the integer `0` repeatedly until the list contains exactly 7 elements.
8.  **Output:** Return the generated list of 7 integers.
