There are also other non-zero values forming distinct patterns.\n3.  **Patterns:** In both examples, there's a larger shape (rectangle) made of one non-zero value (3 in `train_1`, 5 in `train_2`) that encloses an inner area. This inner area contains background '0's and one or more instances of another distinct non-zero value (1 in `train_1`, 7 in `train_2`).\n4.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are 1D lists (arrays) of single digits.\n5.  **Output Values:** The outputs contain the digit '4' followed by '0's. The number of '4's seems to correspond to the count of the innermost non-zero digits (1s in `train_1`, 7s in `train_2`).\n6.  **Output Length:** The output lists in both examples have a fixed length of 7. The lists are padded with '0's if the count of the relevant input feature is less than 7.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
