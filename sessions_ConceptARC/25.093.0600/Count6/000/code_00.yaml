task_description: Identify specific 'target' numbers within a grid and represent each instance with the digit '4' in a fixed-length output list.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 12x12, 11x7)
      - cell_values: integers

  - type: Number
    description: Values within the grid cells.
    subtypes:
      - Background:
          value: 0
          role: Represents empty space or the outermost area.
      - Boundary:
          value: non-zero integer (e.g., 3, 5)
          role: Forms a shape enclosing an inner area, usually adjacent to the background.
      - Target:
          value: non-zero integer distinct from the boundary value (e.g., 1, 7)
          role: Located within the area enclosed by the boundary number. These are the primary objects of interest for the output.

output_elements:
  - type: List
    description: A 1D array of integers.
    properties:
      - fixed_length: 7 (based on examples)
      - element_values:
          - 4: Represents one instance of a detected 'Target' number in the input grid.
          - 0: Used as padding to fill the list to its fixed length.

relationships:
  - description: Target numbers are spatially enclosed within the shape formed by Boundary numbers.
  - description: Boundary numbers form a shape adjacent to the Background numbers.

transformation:
  action: Count occurrences
  input_object: Target numbers in the grid
  output_representation: Each occurrence is represented by the digit '4'.
  output_structure: Results are placed in a list, padded with '0's to a fixed length (7).
