Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing integer values.
2.  **Grid Values:** The grids contain primarily the value '0', representing a background. There are also other non-zero values forming distinct patterns.
3.  **Patterns:** In both examples, there's a larger shape (rectangle) made of one non-zero value (3 in `train_1`, 5 in `train_2`) that encloses an inner area. This inner area contains background '0's and one or more instances of another distinct non-zero value (1 in `train_1`, 7 in `train_2`).
4.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are 1D lists (arrays) of single digits.
5.  **Output Values:** The outputs contain the digit '4' followed by '0's. The number of '4's seems to correspond to the count of the innermost non-zero digits (1s in `train_1`, 7s in `train_2`).
6.  **Output Length:** The output lists in both examples have a fixed length of 7. The lists are padded with '0's if the count of the relevant input feature is less than 7.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify specific 'target' numbers within a grid and represent each instance with the digit '4' in a fixed-length output list.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 12x12, 11x7)
      - cell_values: integers

  - type: Number
    description: Values within the grid cells.
    subtypes:
      - Background:
          value: 0
          role: Represents empty space or the outermost area.
      - Boundary:
          value: non-zero integer (e.g., 3, 5)
          role: Forms a shape enclosing an inner area, usually adjacent to the background.
      - Target:
          value: non-zero integer distinct from the boundary value (e.g., 1, 7)
          role: Located within the area enclosed by the boundary number. These are the primary objects of interest for the output.

output_elements:
  - type: List
    description: A 1D array of integers.
    properties:
      - fixed_length: 7 (based on examples)
      - element_values:
          - 4: Represents one instance of a detected 'Target' number in the input grid.
          - 0: Used as padding to fill the list to its fixed length.

relationships:
  - description: Target numbers are spatially enclosed within the shape formed by Boundary numbers.
  - description: Boundary numbers form a shape adjacent to the Background numbers.

transformation:
  action: Count occurrences
  input_object: Target numbers in the grid
  output_representation: Each occurrence is represented by the digit '4'.
  output_structure: Results are placed in a list, padded with '0's to a fixed length (7).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_list`.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify the distinct non-zero numbers present.
3.  Determine the 'boundary' number. This is typically the non-zero number that forms the main enclosing shape directly adjacent to the background '0's.
4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
5.  For each cell, check if its value is non-zero and *not* equal to the identified 'boundary' number. If both conditions are true, this cell contains a 'target' number.
6.  For every 'target' number found, append the digit '4' to the `output_list`.
7.  After checking all cells, determine the required fixed length for the output (which is 7 based on the provided examples).
8.  While the current length of `output_list` is less than the fixed length (7), append the digit '0' to `output_list`.
9.  Return the final `output_list`.
