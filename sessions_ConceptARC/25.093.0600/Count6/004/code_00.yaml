task_description: Identify specific 'target' cells within a grid based on their spatial position relative to the outer background and boundary, count them, and represent the count in a fixed-length output list.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 12x12, 7x11, 15x15, 11x9, 6x6)
      - cell_values: integers

  - type: Number (within Grid Cell)
    description: Values within the grid cells.
    subtypes:
      - Background:
          value: 0
          role: Represents empty space.
      - NonZero:
          value: Any integer != 0
          role: Represents significant elements within the grid.

spatial_regions:
  - type: OuterBackground
    description: The set of all background (0) cells connected to the edges of the grid (using 4-way adjacency).
  - type: BoundaryCells
    description: The set of all non-zero cells that are directly adjacent (using 4-way adjacency) to at least one cell belonging to the OuterBackground.
  - type: TargetCells
    description: The set of all non-zero cells that are *not* BoundaryCells. These are the cells of interest to be counted.

output_elements:
  - type: List
    description: A 1D array of integers representing the count of TargetCells.
    properties:
      - fixed_length: 7 (based on examples)
      - element_values:
          - 4: Represents one instance of a detected TargetCell in the input grid. Added to the list for each TargetCell found.
          - 0: Used as padding to fill the list to its fixed length after all '4's have been added.

relationships:
  - description: BoundaryCells separate the OuterBackground from the TargetCells (and potentially from inner background cells).
  - description: TargetCells are spatially located "inside" the layer formed by BoundaryCells.
  - description: The numerical value of a cell does not determine if it's a BoundaryCell or TargetCell; only its position relative to the OuterBackground matters.

transformation:
  action: Identify and Count
  input_object_definition: A cell is a TargetCell if its value is non-zero AND it is not adjacent (4-way) to any OuterBackground cell.
  output_representation: Each identified TargetCell contributes one '4' to the beginning of the output list.
  output_structure: The list is padded with '0's at the end to reach a fixed total length of 7.
