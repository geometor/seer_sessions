            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code successfully processed examples where the 'target' number had a different value than the 'boundary' number (Train 1, Train 2, Test 1, Test 3). The core logic correctly identified the boundary value by checking adjacency to the outer background and then counted occurrences of other non-zero values.\n\nHowever, the code failed significantly on Test Example 2, where the 'target' elements (inner '2's) had the same numerical value as the 'boundary' elements (outer '2's). This revealed a flaw in the assumption that target cells could be identified solely by having a different value than the boundary.\n\nThe results indicate that the defining characteristic of a 'target' cell is not its numerical value relative to the boundary, but its spatial position. Specifically, target cells appear to be non-zero cells that are *not* directly adjacent to the outermost layer of background ('0') cells. The boundary cells are those non-zero cells that *are* adjacent to the outer background.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to redefine the identification logic:\n1.  Identify the set of coordinates corresponding to the background ('0') cells connected to the grid edges (outer background).\n2.  Identify the set of coordinates corresponding to non-zero cells that are direct neighbors (4-connectivity) of any cell in the outer background set. These are the 'boundary' cells.\n3.  Count all non-zero cells whose coordinates are *not* in the 'boundary' set. These are the 'target' cells.\n4.  Construct the output list based on this count.\n\nThe output format difference (list vs. column) is noted but considered a formatting issue separate from the core transformation logic error. The fixed output length of 7 remains consistent across examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nWe will use code execution to verify the counts based on the revised spatial hypothesis.\n\n"
