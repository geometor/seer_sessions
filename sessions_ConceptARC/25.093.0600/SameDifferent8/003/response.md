"""
The transformation rule operates on a grid divided into two subgrids (Sub1, Sub2) by a single separator row or column composed entirely of zeros. 

1.  Identify the zero separator (row or column) and split the grid.
2.  Analyze each subgrid:
    a.  Determine the background color (bg), which is the most frequent color in that subgrid.
    b.  Identify all cells that are *not* the background color; these form the pattern.
    c.  If a pattern exists, calculate its minimal bounding box (bbox) and the relative coordinates of the pattern cells within that bbox (the shape).
3.  Compare the shapes (relative patterns) of Sub1 (Shape1) and Sub2 (Shape2).
4.  If Shape1 exists and is identical to Shape2:
    a.  Extract the portion of Sub1 corresponding to its bounding box (bbox1).
    b.  Create the output grid by taking this extracted portion and replacing all occurrences of Sub1's background color (bg1) with 0, keeping other pattern colors as they are.
5.  Otherwise (if Shape1 doesn't exist, or if Shape1 is different from Shape2):
    a.  The output is a 1x1 grid containing 0, represented as [[0]].
