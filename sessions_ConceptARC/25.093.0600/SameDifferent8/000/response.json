            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input consists of a grid of numbers. A defining feature is a horizontal separator line composed entirely of zeros, dividing the input into two distinct sub-grids: an upper grid (`grid1`) and a lower grid (`grid2`).\n2.  **Grid Contents:** Both `grid1` and `grid2` contain numerical values. Within each sub-grid, there appears to be a primary \"background\" color (the most frequent non-zero digit) and a secondary \"foreground\" color forming a specific shape or pattern.\n3.  **Foreground Shapes:** The core task seems to revolve around identifying and comparing the shapes formed by the foreground colors in `grid1` and `grid2`.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is either a smaller grid or a single digit `0`.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems conditional based on the comparison of the foreground shapes in `grid1` and `grid2`.\n    *   If the shapes (relative patterns, ignoring position and background color) are identical, the output is derived from the shape in `grid1`.\n    *   If the shapes are different, the output depends on a property of the shape in `grid1`: whether its bounding box also contains cells of `grid1`'s background color. If it does, the output is derived from `grid1`'s shape; otherwise, the output is `0`.\n6.  **Output Generation:** When the output is derived from `grid1`'s shape, it consists of the shape's bounding box. The cells corresponding to `grid1`'s foreground shape retain their color, while all other cells within the bounding box (including any original background cells) become `0`.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Identify the background color (`bg1`), which is the most frequent non-zero digit in `grid1`.\n    b.  Identify the foreground color (`fg1`), which is the non-zero digit in `grid1` that is not `bg1`.\n    c.  Determine the locations of all cells containing `fg1`.\n    d.  Calculate the minimal bounding box (`bbox1`) that encloses all `fg1` cells.\n    e.  Extract the relative pattern (`shape1`) of `fg1` cells within `bbox1` (e.g., as a set of coordinates relative to the top-left of `bbox1`).\n3.  **Analyze Grid2:**\n    a.  Identify the background color (`bg2`), which is the most frequent non-zero digit in `grid2`.\n    b.  Identify the foreground color (`fg2`), which is the non-zero digit in `grid2` that is not `bg2`.\n    c.  Determine the locations of all cells containing `fg2`.\n    d.  Calculate the minimal bounding box (`bbox2`) that encloses all `fg2` cells.\n    e.

Check if any cell within `bbox1` in the original `grid1` contains the background color `bg1`.\n        ii. **If** any such `bg1` cell exists within `bbox1`:\n            1. Create a new grid with the dimensions of `bbox1`.\n            2. Fill the cells corresponding to the `fg1` locations (relative to `bbox1`) with the color `fg1`.\n            3.
