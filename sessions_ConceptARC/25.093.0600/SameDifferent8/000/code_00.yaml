task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains numerical digits.
      - Always includes at least one row composed entirely of zeros acting as a separator.
  - name: Grid Separator
    type: Row Property
    properties:
      - Consists solely of the digit 0.
      - Divides the input grid into two sub-grids (Grid1 and Grid2).
  - name: Grid1 (Upper Sub-grid)
    type: Sub-Grid
    properties:
      - Located above the zero separator.
      - Contains a background color (most frequent non-zero digit).
      - Contains a foreground color (another non-zero digit) forming Shape1.
  - name: Grid2 (Lower Sub-grid)
    type: Sub-Grid
    properties:
      - Located below the zero separator.
      - Contains a background color (most frequent non-zero digit, can differ from Grid1's).
      - Contains a foreground color (another non-zero digit, can be same or different from Grid1's) forming Shape2.
  - name: Shape1
    type: Pattern
    properties:
      - Located within Grid1.
      - Defined by the cells containing the foreground color of Grid1.
      - Has a minimal bounding box.
      - Has a relative pattern of foreground cells within its bounding box.
      - May or may not contain cells of Grid1's background color within its bounding box.
  - name: Shape2
    type: Pattern
    properties:
      - Located within Grid2.
      - Defined by the cells containing the foreground color of Grid2.
      - Has a minimal bounding box.
      - Has a relative pattern of foreground cells within its bounding box.
  - name: Output
    type: Grid or Scalar
    properties:
      - Can be a grid derived from Shape1.
      - Can be the single digit 0.

relationships:
  - type: Comparison
    between: [Shape1, Shape2]
    based_on: Relative pattern of foreground cells (ignoring position, background color, and foreground color value).
  - type: Condition
    if: Shape1 pattern equals Shape2 pattern
    then: Output is derived from Shape1.
  - type: Condition
    if: Shape1 pattern differs from Shape2 pattern
    then: Output depends on whether Shape1's bounding box contains Grid1's background color.
      - if_contains_background: Output is derived from Shape1.
      - if_not_contains_background: Output is 0.
  - type: Transformation (Output Generation from Shape1)
    input: Shape1 (bounding box, foreground color, locations of foreground cells)
    output_grid:
      - Dimensions match Shape1's bounding box.
      - Cells corresponding to Shape1's foreground locations retain Shape1's foreground color.
      - All other cells within the bounding box become 0.

actions:
  - Identify the zero separator row(s).
  - Split the input into Grid1 and Grid2.
  - For Grid1: Determine background color, foreground color, and locate Shape1.
  - For Grid2: Determine background color, foreground color, and locate Shape2.
  - Extract the relative pattern of Shape1.
  - Extract the relative pattern of Shape2.
  - Compare the relative patterns.
  - Based on comparison result and properties of Shape1, decide the output type (Shape1-derived grid or 0).
  - If generating Shape1-derived grid: Determine bounding box, map foreground color, fill remaining with 0.
