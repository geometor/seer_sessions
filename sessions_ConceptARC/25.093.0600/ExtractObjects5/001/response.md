"""
Identifies rectangular patterns (either hollow or solid) in the input grid.
If hollow rectangles (colored border, zero interior) are found:
  - Extracts their color, dimensions (height h, width w), and position (top-left r, c).
  - Sorts these identified hollow rectangles based on their color value (ascending).
  - Constructs the output grid by creating solid rectangles of the same color and dimensions (h, w) as the found hollow ones.
  - Arranges these solid rectangles horizontally in the order determined by the color sort.
If no hollow rectangles are found:
  - Identifies maximal solid, monochromatic, non-zero rectangles.
  - Extracts their color, dimensions (h, w), and position (top-left r, c).
  - Sorts these identified solid rectangles based on their top-left position (column index `c` first, then row index `r`, ascending).
  - Constructs the output grid by creating solid rectangles of the same color and dimensions (h, w).
  - Arranges these solid rectangles horizontally in the order determined by the position sort.
Assumes that all relevant rectangles (either all hollow or all solid) identified in a single input grid share the same height, which determines the height of the output grid.
