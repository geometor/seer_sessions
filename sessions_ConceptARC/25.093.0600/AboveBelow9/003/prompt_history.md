## Perception

The input and output are grids of numbers. The number `0` appears to represent the background. Each input grid contains various shapes or patterns formed by non-zero digits (e.g., `3` in the first example, `7` in the second). A distinct feature in both input grids is a single row composed entirely of the digit `4`. This row acts as a horizontal divider.

Observing the transformation, the row of `4`s remains unchanged in the output. All rows *above* the row of `4`s also remain unchanged. However, all rows *below* the row of `4`s are replaced entirely with `0`s in the output. The specific non-zero digits (like `3` or `7`) above the `4`s row seem irrelevant to the transformation rule itself, other than being preserved. The core operation is contingent on the location of the solid row of `4`s.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains digits, including 0, 4, and others (e.g., 3, 7)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - derived from input_grid
  - name: boundary_row
    type: row
    properties:
      - located within input_grid
      - consists entirely of the digit 4
Relationships:
  - The output_grid retains all rows from the input_grid up to and including the boundary_row.
  - Rows in the output_grid below the index of the boundary_row are replaced with 0s.
Actions:
  - Identify the index of the first row in the input_grid that consists entirely of the digit 4.
  - Copy all rows from the input_grid from the beginning up to and including this identified boundary_row to the output_grid.
  - Fill all subsequent rows in the output_grid (below the boundary_row) with the digit 0.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through the rows of the input grid from top to bottom.
2.  Identify the first row that consists entirely of the digit `4`. Let the index of this row be `boundary_index`.
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Copy all rows from the input grid from index `0` up to and including `boundary_index` to the corresponding rows in the output grid.
5.  For all rows in the output grid with an index greater than `boundary_index`, fill them entirely with the digit `0`.
6.  Return the resulting output grid.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 2:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

## Example 3:
Error: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
## General Assessment

The previous attempt correctly identified the core logic: locate a horizontal boundary row composed entirely of the digit `4` and replace all rows below it with rows of `0`s, while keeping the rows above and including the boundary row unchanged.

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" indicates that the input grids are likely being processed as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists of lists, within the execution environment. The error occurs when a condition implicitly tries to evaluate the truthiness of an entire array (row) instead of checking its elements individually or using specific array methods (`.any()` or `.all()`). The `find_boundary_row_index` function in the previous attempt correctly used a loop to check each element (`cell != 4`), so the error might stem from an implicit conversion or comparison elsewhere, or perhaps the way the test harness calls the function.

The strategy is to refine the implementation details within the natural language program to explicitly handle element-wise comparison for identifying the boundary row, assuming the input might be array-like. We will verify the presence and characteristics of the boundary row in the examples.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's examine the structure and find the boundary row index for each training example.

```
The metrics confirm the initial observations:
-   `train_1`: Input is 10x12. The boundary row (all `4`s) is at index 2.
-   `train_2`: Input is 13x15. The boundary row (all `4`s) is at index 6.

The code execution successfully identified the boundary rows using `np.all(row == 4)`, which explicitly checks if all elements in the (NumPy array) row equal `4`. This confirms the logic and suggests the implementation should use or mimic this element-wise check.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid (potentially NumPy array)
    properties:
      - contains integer digits (0, 4, and others like 3, 7)
      - variable dimensions (rows x columns)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid (same dimensions as input_grid)

  - name: boundary_row
    type: row
    properties:
      - located within input_grid
      - consists entirely of the digit 4 across all its columns
  - name: boundary_index
    type: integer
    properties:
      - row index of the first occurrence of the boundary_row in input_grid
Relationships:
  - The output_grid consists of rows copied from the input_grid from index 0 up to and including the boundary_index.
  - All rows in the output_grid with indices greater than boundary_index are replaced with rows containing only the digit 0.
  - The dimensions of the output_grid are identical to the input_grid.
Actions:
  - Scan the input_grid row by row, starting from the top (index 0).
  - For each row, check if *all* elements in that row are equal to the digit 4.
  - Identify the index (boundary_index) of the *first* row that meets this condition.
  - Create a new output_grid of the same dimensions as the input_grid.
  - Copy rows from index 0 to boundary_index (inclusive) from the input_grid to the output_grid.
  - Fill all rows in the output_grid from index (boundary_index + 1) to the last row with the digit 0.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid. Determine its dimensions (number of rows and columns).
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, starting from the first row (index 0).
3.  For the current row, examine every element. Check if *all* elements in this row are equal to the integer `4`.
4.  Identify the index of the *first* row where all elements are `4`. Store this index as `boundary_index`.
5.  Create a new output grid with the same number of rows and columns as the input grid.
6.  Copy the rows from the input grid, starting from index `0` up to and including `boundary_index`, into the corresponding rows of the output grid.
7.  For every row index *after* `boundary_index` (i.e., from `boundary_index + 1` up to the last row), fill the corresponding row in the output grid entirely with the integer `0`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
