Each input grid contains various shapes or patterns formed by non-zero digits (e.g., `3` in the first example, `7` in the second). A distinct feature in both input grids is a single row composed entirely of the digit `4`. This row acts as a horizontal divider.\n\nObserving the transformation, the row of `4`s remains unchanged in the output. All rows *above* the row of `4`s also remain unchanged. However, all rows *below* the row of `4`s are replaced entirely with `0`s in the output. The specific non-zero digits (like `3` or `7`) above the `4`s row seem irrelevant to the transformation rule itself, other than being preserved. The core operation is contingent on the location of the solid row of `4`s.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
