Objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains digits, including 0, 4, and others (e.g., 3, 7)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - derived from input_grid
  - name: boundary_row
    type: row
    properties:
      - located within input_grid
      - consists entirely of the digit 4
Relationships:
  - The output_grid retains all rows from the input_grid up to and including the boundary_row.
  - Rows in the output_grid below the index of the boundary_row are replaced with 0s.
Actions:
  - Identify the index of the first row in the input_grid that consists entirely of the digit 4.
  - Copy all rows from the input_grid from the beginning up to and including this identified boundary_row to the output_grid.
  - Fill all subsequent rows in the output_grid (below the boundary_row) with the digit 0.
