            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core logic: locate a horizontal boundary row composed entirely of the digit `4` and replace all rows below it with rows of `0`s, while keeping the rows above and including the boundary row unchanged.\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" indicates that the input grids are likely being processed as NumPy arrays, not standard Python lists of lists, within the execution environment. The error occurs when a condition implicitly tries to evaluate the truthiness of an entire array (row) instead of checking its elements individually or using specific array methods (`.any()` or `.all()`). The `find_boundary_row_index` function in the previous attempt correctly used a loop to check each element (`cell != 4`), so the error might stem from an implicit conversion or comparison elsewhere, or perhaps the way the test harness calls the function.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the implementation details within the natural language program to explicitly handle element-wise comparison for identifying the boundary row, assuming the input might be array-like. We will verify the presence and characteristics of the boundary row in the examples.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's examine the structure and find the boundary row index for each training example.\n\n"
