Objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid (potentially NumPy array)
    properties:
      - contains integer digits (0, 4, and others like 3, 7)
      - variable dimensions (rows x columns)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid (same dimensions as input_grid)
    properties:
      - derived from input_grid based on boundary_row location
  - name: boundary_row
    type: row
    properties:
      - located within input_grid
      - consists entirely of the digit 4 across all its columns
  - name: boundary_index
    type: integer
    properties:
      - row index of the first occurrence of the boundary_row in input_grid
Relationships:
  - The output_grid consists of rows copied from the input_grid from index 0 up to and including the boundary_index.
  - All rows in the output_grid with indices greater than boundary_index are replaced with rows containing only the digit 0.
  - The dimensions of the output_grid are identical to the input_grid.
Actions:
  - Scan the input_grid row by row, starting from the top (index 0).
  - For each row, check if *all* elements in that row are equal to the digit 4.
  - Identify the index (boundary_index) of the *first* row that meets this condition.
  - Create a new output_grid of the same dimensions as the input_grid.
  - Copy rows from index 0 to boundary_index (inclusive) from the input_grid to the output_grid.
  - Fill all rows in the output_grid from index (boundary_index + 1) to the last row with the digit 0.
