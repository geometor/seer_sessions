Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers. The integer '0' represents the background color. Non-zero integers represent different foreground colors/parts of objects.
2.  **Objects:** The non-zero cells form distinct shapes or objects within the grid.
3.  **Object Composition:** Some objects appear nested; one shape (defined by one color) surrounds or encloses another shape (defined by a different color). For example, in `train_1`, the shape made of '3's encloses the shape made of '2's. In `train_2`, the '4's enclose the '1's.
4.  **Isolated Objects:** Inputs can contain multiple separate objects. Some might be simple (one color), while others are composite (enclosing/enclosed).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies one specific composite object (the enclosing one) from the input, copies it entirely (including the enclosed parts), and places the copy adjacent to the original in the output grid. Other isolated objects present in the input are discarded in the output.
6.  **Copy Placement:** The placement of the copy (either to the right or below the original) and the size of the gap (number of zero rows/columns) between the original and the copy seem dependent on the properties of the selected object.

**YAML Fact Document:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input grid to identify all distinct connected objects formed by non-zero cells.
2.  Identify the specific "target" object which consists of an outer shape of one color enclosing an inner shape of a different color. Disregard any other objects in the input grid.
3.  Determine the bounding box of this target object (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its cells). Note its dimensions: width (W) and height (H).
4.  Identify the color of the *inner*, enclosed shape within the target object. Let this color value be `inner_color`.
5.  Calculate the gap size to be used between the original object and its copy: `gap = inner_color`.
6.  Determine the placement direction for the copy:
    *   If the target object's height (H) is greater than its width (W), the copy will be placed *below* the original.
    *   Otherwise (if width W is greater than or equal to height H), the copy will be placed to the *right* of the original.
7.  Calculate the top-left coordinate for placing the copy:
    *   If placing below: `copy_row = original_bottom_row + 1 + gap`, `copy_col = original_left_col`.
    *   If placing right: `copy_row = original_top_row`, `copy_col = original_right_col + 1 + gap`.
8.  Create the output grid, initially containing only the identified target object from the input grid (all other input objects are removed, replaced by the background color 0).
9.  Copy the pattern of the target object (defined by its bounding box) and paste this pattern into the output grid starting at the calculated top-left coordinate for the copy.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Identifies a composite object (an outer shape enclosing an inner shape of a different color) in the input grid.
Duplicates this object and places the copy adjacent to the original.
The gap between the original and the copy is determined by the color of the inner shape.
The placement direction (right or below) depends on the object's aspect ratio (width vs. height).
All other objects in the input are discarded. The output grid size is adjusted to fit the original and the copy.

Workflow:
1. Find all connected components (objects) of non-zero cells in the input grid.
2. Identify the 'target' object: the one whose bounding box contains exactly two distinct non-zero colors.
3. Determine the properties of the target object: bounding box, width, height, and the two colors.
4. Identify the 'inner' color (the minimum of the two non-zero colors).
5. Calculate the gap size between the original and copy (gap = inner_color).
6. Determine the placement direction: 'right' if width >= height, 'below' otherwise.
7. Calculate the top-left coordinates for the copied object based on direction and gap.
8. Extract the pattern (subgrid) of the target object from the input.
9. Determine the required dimensions for the output grid to hold the original and the copy.
10. Create the output grid, initialized with zeros.
11. Place the original object pattern into the output grid.
12. Place the copied object pattern into the output grid at the calculated position.
13. Return the output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully implemented the core idea of identifying a composite object, duplicating it, and placing the copy. However, the results show inaccuracies in:

1.  **Discarding Non-Target Objects:** The code failed to remove other objects present in the input grid (e.g., `train_2`, `test_1`, `test_2`, `test_3`). The output grid should only contain the target object and its copy against a background of 0s.
2.  **Output Grid Sizing:** The calculation of the output grid dimensions was sometimes incorrect, leading to truncated or overly large grids.
3.  **Gap Calculation:** The initial hypothesis (`gap = inner_color`) failed for `test_1` and `test_2`.
4.  **Placement Direction:** The initial hypothesis (`H > W` -> Below, else Right, based on target bounding box) failed for `test_2`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Target Object Handling:** Ensure the code explicitly creates a new output grid of the correct dimensions, initialized with the background color (0), and *only* pastes the identified target object and its calculated copy. This addresses point 1.
2.  **Refine Output Sizing:** Recalculate the required output rows and columns based *only* on the target object's position, dimensions, the calculated gap, and placement direction. This addresses point 2.
3.  **Re-evaluate Gap and Placement Rules:** Analyze the properties of the target object and its constituent colors/shapes across all examples to find consistent rules for the gap size and placement direction. Use `tool_code` to extract relevant metrics (bounding boxes, colors, dimensions) for systematic comparison. Prioritize rules that explain the majority of cases, noting any potential exceptions.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather data for each example based on the "Simplest Rules" hypothesis: Find target (component with 2 colors in BBox), identify inner color (not on BBox edge), placement (Target H > W -> Below), gap (Inner Color).
