            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the core idea of identifying a composite object, duplicating it, and placing the copy. However, the results show inaccuracies in:\n\n1.  **Discarding Non-Target Objects:** The code failed to remove other objects present in the input grid (e.g., `train_2`, `test_1`, `test_2`, `test_3`). The output grid should only contain the target object and its copy against a background of 0s.\n2.  **Output Grid Sizing:** The calculation of the output grid dimensions was sometimes incorrect, leading to truncated or overly large grids.\n3.  **Gap Calculation:** The initial hypothesis (`gap = inner_color`) failed for `test_1` and `test_2`.\n4.  **Placement Direction:** The initial hypothesis (`H > W` -> Below, else Right, based on target bounding box) failed for `test_2`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Target Object Handling:** Ensure the code explicitly creates a new output grid of the correct dimensions, initialized with the background color (0), and *only* pastes the identified target object and its calculated copy. This addresses point 1.\n2.  **Refine Output Sizing:** Recalculate the required output rows and columns based *only* on the target object's position, dimensions, the calculated gap, and placement direction. This addresses point 2.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Gap and Placement Rules:** Analyze the properties of the target object and its constituent colors/shapes across all examples to find consistent rules for the gap size and placement direction. Use `tool_code` to extract relevant metrics (bounding boxes, colors, dimensions) for systematic comparison. Prioritize rules that explain the majority of cases, noting any potential exceptions.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's gather data for each example based on the \"Simplest Rules\" hypothesis: Find target (component with 2 colors in BBox), identify inner color (not on BBox edge), placement (Target H > W -> Below), gap (Inner Color).\n\n"
