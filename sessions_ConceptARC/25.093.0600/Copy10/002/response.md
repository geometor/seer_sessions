## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully implemented the core idea of identifying a composite object, duplicating it, and placing the copy. However, the results show inaccuracies in:

1.  **Discarding Non-Target Objects:** The code failed to remove other objects present in the input grid (e.g., `train_2`, `test_1`, `test_2`, `test_3`). The output grid should only contain the target object and its copy against a background of 0s.
2.  **Output Grid Sizing:** The calculation of the output grid dimensions was sometimes incorrect, leading to truncated or overly large grids.
3.  **Gap Calculation:** The initial hypothesis (`gap = inner_color`) failed for `test_1` and `test_2`.
4.  **Placement Direction:** The initial hypothesis (`H > W` -> Below, else Right, based on target bounding box) failed for `test_2`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Target Object Handling:** Ensure the code explicitly creates a new output grid of the correct dimensions, initialized with the background color (0), and *only* pastes the identified target object and its calculated copy. This addresses point 1.
2.  **Refine Output Sizing:** Recalculate the required output rows and columns based *only* on the target object's position, dimensions, the calculated gap, and placement direction. This addresses point 2.
3.  **Re-evaluate Gap and Placement Rules:** Analyze the properties of the target object and its constituent colors/shapes across all examples to find consistent rules for the gap size and placement direction. Use `tool_code` to extract relevant metrics (bounding boxes, colors, dimensions) for systematic comparison. Prioritize rules that explain the majority of cases, noting any potential exceptions.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather data for each example based on the "Simplest Rules" hypothesis: Find target (component with 2 colors in BBox), identify inner color (not on BBox edge), placement (Target H > W -> Below), gap (Inner Color).
