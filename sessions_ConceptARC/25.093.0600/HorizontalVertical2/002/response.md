## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial hypothesis (keep the block with the maximum sum) correctly predicted the outcome for `train_2` but failed for `train_1`, `test_1`, and `test_2`. The analysis of the failures and calculation of block metrics (sum, size, bounding box) revealed a more complex set of rules:

1.  A special case exists for grids with exactly two blocks of identical size, resulting in an empty output (`test_2`).
2.  The selection process involves considering blocks that maximize *either* sum *or* size.
3.  When multiple candidate blocks arise from the sum/size maximization, a tie-breaker based on vertical position (preferring the bottommost blocks) is used (`train_1`, `test_1`).

The strategy is to define the transformation rule incorporating these findings: handle the two-block equal-size case first, then identify candidate blocks based on max sum OR max size, and finally filter these candidates by selecting only those that extend furthest down the grid.

## Metrics

Metrics were calculated for the blocks in the failing examples using `tool_code`:


```
--- Train 1 Info ---
Block ID: 0, Sum: 84, Size: 36, BBox: (0, 0, 5, 5)  // Top-Left
Block ID: 1, Sum: 84, Size: 36, BBox: (2, 7, 7, 12) // Right
Block ID: 2, Sum: 48, Size: 20, BBox: (7, 1, 10, 5) // Bottom-Left
* Max Sum = 84 (Blocks 0, 1)
* Max Size = 36 (Blocks 0, 1)
* Expected Output: Block 1

--- Test 1 Info ---
Block ID: 0, Sum: 60, Size: 24, BBox: (0, 10, 5, 13) // Top-Right
Block ID: 1, Sum: 100, Size: 25, BBox: (3, 1, 7, 5)  // Top-Left
Block ID: 2, Sum: 120, Size: 24, BBox: (8, 10, 13, 13)// Bottom-Right
Block ID: 3, Sum: 102, Size: 30, BBox: (9, 2, 13, 7)  // Bottom-Left
* Max Sum = 120 (Block 2)
* Max Size = 30 (Block 3)
* Expected Output: Blocks 2, 3

--- Test 2 Info ---
Block ID: 0, Sum: 66, Size: 36, BBox: (2, 1, 7, 6)   // Top
Block ID: 1, Sum: 156, Size: 36, BBox: (10, 5, 15, 10)// Bottom
* Max Sum = 156 (Block 1)
* Max Size = 36 (Blocks 0, 1)
* Special Condition: 2 blocks, equal size (36).
* Expected Output: Empty Grid
