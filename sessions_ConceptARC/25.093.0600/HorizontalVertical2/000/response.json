Within this background, there are distinct rectangular blocks composed of non-zero digits. In each example, there appear to be two such blocks separated by at least one column of zeros. The transformation involves selecting one of these blocks and discarding the other, replacing the discarded block's area with zeros. The selection criteria seem to be based on the properties of the blocks themselves. In `train_1`, the right block is kept; in `train_2`, the left block is kept. Comparing the two examples, the block with the larger sum of its constituent digits is retained in the output, while the other block is removed.\n\n*   **facts**:\n    "
