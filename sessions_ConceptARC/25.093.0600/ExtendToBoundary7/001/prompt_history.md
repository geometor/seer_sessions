Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

### Perception of the Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain predominantly zeros (0), representing empty space. There are also non-zero integers. Specifically, the number 5 seems to play a special role, acting as a barrier or boundary. Other non-zero numbers (3 and 4 in the examples) appear to be 'sources' that spread.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the 'source' numbers (3 or 4) expanding or "filling" adjacent empty cells (0s).
4.  **Barrier Interaction:** The expansion of source numbers seems directed towards the barrier cells (5) and stops upon reaching them. The barrier cells themselves remain unchanged.
5.  **Directionality:** The direction of spread appears constrained:
    *   In `train_1`, the barrier (5) forms a vertical line. The sources (4) spread horizontally towards this line.
    *   In `train_2`, the barrier (5) forms a horizontal line. The sources (3) spread vertically towards this line.
6.  **Rule:** It seems that if a source cell has a barrier cell in the same row, it spreads horizontally towards that barrier. If it has a barrier cell in the same column, it spreads vertically towards that barrier. The spread fills only the zero cells along the direct path between the source and the barrier.

### Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array representing the input and output space.
  - Cell: An individual element within the Grid, having properties like position (row, column) and value.
  - SourceCell: A Cell with a value other than 0 or 5 in the input grid.
  - BarrierCell: A Cell with the value 5 in the input grid.
  - EmptyCell: A Cell with the value 0 in the input grid.

Properties:
  - value: The integer contained within a Cell.
  - position: The (row, column) coordinates of a Cell.
  - path: The sequence of EmptyCells between a SourceCell and a BarrierCell in the same row or column.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate SourceCells and BarrierCells in the input grid.
  - DeterminePath: For each SourceCell, find the path of EmptyCells leading towards the nearest BarrierCell in the same row or column.
  - Fill: Change the value of EmptyCells along the determined path to the value of the corresponding SourceCell.

Relationships:
  - Adjacent: Cells sharing an edge (horizontally or vertically).
  - Alignment: A SourceCell and a BarrierCell can be aligned horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column).
  - Blocking: BarrierCells prevent the spread of SourceCells beyond their position.
  - Between: EmptyCells located on the straight line segment connecting a SourceCell and an aligned BarrierCell.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all 'SourceCells' (cells with values other than 0 and 5) and 'BarrierCells' (cells with value 5) in the input grid.
3.  For each identified 'SourceCell' (with value `S` at position `(sr, sc)`):
    a.  Check if there is a 'BarrierCell' in the same row (`sr`). If yes:
        i.  Find the 'BarrierCell' in row `sr` closest to column `sc`. Let its position be `(sr, bc)`.
        ii. If `bc > sc` (barrier is to the right), iterate through columns `c` from `sc + 1` to `bc - 1`. If the cell `(sr, c)` in the *output* grid is 0, change its value to `S`.
        iii. If `bc < sc` (barrier is to the left), iterate through columns `c` from `sc - 1` down to `bc + 1`. If the cell `(sr, c)` in the *output* grid is 0, change its value to `S`.
    b.  Else (if no barrier in the same row), check if there is a 'BarrierCell' in the same column (`sc`). If yes:
        i.  Find the 'BarrierCell' in column `sc` closest to row `sr`. Let its position be `(br, sc)`.
        ii. If `br > sr` (barrier is below), iterate through rows `r` from `sr + 1` to `br - 1`. If the cell `(r, sc)` in the *output* grid is 0, change its value to `S`.
        iii. If `br < sr` (barrier is above), iterate through rows `r` from `sr - 1` down to `br + 1`. If the cell `(r, sc)` in the *output* grid is 0, change its value to `S`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
