Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array representing the input and output space.
  - Cell: An individual element within the Grid, having properties like position (row, column) and value.
  - SourceCell: A Cell with a value other than 0 or 5 in the input grid.
  - BarrierCell: A Cell with the value 5 in the input grid.
  - EmptyCell: A Cell with the value 0 in the input grid.

Properties:
  - value: The integer contained within a Cell.
  - position: The (row, column) coordinates of a Cell.
  - path: The sequence of EmptyCells between a SourceCell and a BarrierCell in the same row or column.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate SourceCells and BarrierCells in the input grid.
  - DeterminePath: For each SourceCell, find the path of EmptyCells leading towards the nearest BarrierCell in the same row or column.
  - Fill: Change the value of EmptyCells along the determined path to the value of the corresponding SourceCell.

Relationships:
  - Adjacent: Cells sharing an edge (horizontally or vertically).
  - Alignment: A SourceCell and a BarrierCell can be aligned horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column).
  - Blocking: BarrierCells prevent the spread of SourceCells beyond their position.
  - Between: EmptyCells located on the straight line segment connecting a SourceCell and an aligned BarrierCell.
