            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n### Perception of the Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of integers.\n2.  **Cell Values:** The grids contain predominantly zeros (0), representing empty space. There are also non-zero integers. Specifically, the number 5 seems to play a special role, acting as a barrier or boundary. Other non-zero numbers (3 and 4 in the examples) appear to be 'sources' that spread.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the 'source' numbers (3 or 4) expanding or \"filling\" adjacent empty cells (0s).\n4.  **Barrier Interaction:** The expansion of source numbers seems directed towards the barrier cells (5) and stops upon reaching them. The barrier cells themselves remain unchanged.\n5.  **Directionality:** The direction of spread appears constrained:\n    *   In `train_1`, the barrier (5) forms a vertical line. The sources (4) spread horizontally towards this line.\n    *   In `train_2`, the barrier (5) forms a horizontal line. The sources (3) spread vertically towards this line.\n6.  **Rule:** It seems that if a source cell has a barrier cell in the same row, it spreads horizontally towards that barrier. If it has a barrier cell in the same column, it spreads vertically towards that barrier. The spread fills only the zero cells along the direct path between the source and the barrier.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
