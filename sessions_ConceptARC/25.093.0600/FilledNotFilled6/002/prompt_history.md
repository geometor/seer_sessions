Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of integers. The value '0' appears to represent the background.
2.  **Objects:** The non-zero values form distinct connected regions or shapes. In the input, we can identify four primary shapes:
    *   A hollow square/frame made of '4's in the top-left.
    *   A solid rectangle made of '5's in the top-right.
    *   A hollow square/frame made of '3's in the bottom-left.
    *   A solid square made of '4's in the bottom-right.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to depend on whether a shape is "solid" or "hollow" in the input.
    *   Shapes that are initially "hollow" (containing background '0' cells enclosed within their structure) are "filled" in the output – the enclosed '0's are replaced by the shape's color.
    *   Shapes that are initially "solid" (no enclosed '0's) are "hollowed out" in the output – their interior cells are replaced by '0's, leaving only the border cells intact.
4.  **Color Preservation:** The color (the specific non-zero integer) of the shapes' borders is preserved during the transformation. Filling uses the shape's existing color. Hollowing replaces the interior with the background color '0'.
5.  **Locality:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each distinct shape.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array of Integers
  BackgroundValue: 0

Objects:
  Type: Connected components of non-zero integers
  Identification: Based on connectivity (e.g., 4-way or 8-way) and same integer value.
  Properties:
    - Color: The integer value (e.g., 3, 4, 5)
    - Cells: List of coordinates belonging to the object.
    - BoundingBox: Minimum and maximum row/column defining a rectangle enclosing the object.
    - Solidity: Categorical property (Solid or Hollow)
      - Hollow: Contains background cells (0) fully enclosed within the object's boundary in the input grid.
      - Solid: Does not contain any enclosed background cells in the input grid.
    - BorderCells: Cells of the object adjacent (4-connectivity) to a background (0) cell in the input.
    - InteriorCells: Cells of the object that are not BorderCells.
    - EnclosedBackgroundCells: Background (0) cells within the object's bounding box that are completely surrounded by the object's cells (or other enclosed background cells).

Transformation:
  Action: Modify the grid based on object properties.
  Rule:
    - For each identified object:
      - Determine its Solidity.
      - If Solidity is Hollow:
        - Action: Fill
        - TargetCells: EnclosedBackgroundCells associated with the object.
        - NewValue: Object's Color.
      - If Solidity is Solid:
        - Action: HollowOut
        - TargetCells: InteriorCells of the object.
        - NewValue: BackgroundValue (0).
  Output: A new grid reflecting these modifications.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components (objects) composed of the same non-zero color in the `input_grid`.
3.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine the object's color, C.
    b.  Find all cells belonging to the object.
    c.  Determine the object's bounding box.
    d.  Identify all background (0) cells located within the object's bounding box.
    e.  Determine which of these background cells are "enclosed" (i.e., cannot reach the edge of the grid by moving only through background cells). These are the `EnclosedBackgroundCells`.
    f.  Check if any `EnclosedBackgroundCells` were found for this object.
        i.  **If yes (object is hollow):** Iterate through the `EnclosedBackgroundCells` associated with this object and change their value in the `output_grid` to the object's color, C.
        ii. **If no (object is solid):**
            1.  Identify the `InteriorCells` of the object (object cells that are not adjacent to any background cell in the `input_grid`).
            2.  Iterate through these `InteriorCells` and change their value in the `output_grid` to the background color, 0.
4.  Return the `output_grid`.

"""
The transformation identifies distinct connected objects of non-zero colors in the input grid.
For each object, it determines if it's "hollow" (contains enclosed background '0' cells) or "solid" (does not).
If an object is hollow in the input, the transformation fills the enclosed background cells with the object's color in the output.
If an object is solid in the input, the transformation hollows it out in the output by changing its interior cells (cells not on the border) to the background color '0', leaving only the border intact.
