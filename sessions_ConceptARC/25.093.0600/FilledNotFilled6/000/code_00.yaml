Grid:
  Type: 2D Array of Integers
  BackgroundValue: 0

Objects:
  Type: Connected components of non-zero integers
  Identification: Based on connectivity (e.g., 4-way or 8-way) and same integer value.
  Properties:
    - Color: The integer value (e.g., 3, 4, 5)
    - Cells: List of coordinates belonging to the object.
    - BoundingBox: Minimum and maximum row/column defining a rectangle enclosing the object.
    - Solidity: Categorical property (Solid or Hollow)
      - Hollow: Contains background cells (0) fully enclosed within the object's boundary in the input grid.
      - Solid: Does not contain any enclosed background cells in the input grid.
    - BorderCells: Cells of the object adjacent (4-connectivity) to a background (0) cell in the input.
    - InteriorCells: Cells of the object that are not BorderCells.
    - EnclosedBackgroundCells: Background (0) cells within the object's bounding box that are completely surrounded by the object's cells (or other enclosed background cells).

Transformation:
  Action: Modify the grid based on object properties.
  Rule:
    - For each identified object:
      - Determine its Solidity.
      - If Solidity is Hollow:
        - Action: Fill
        - TargetCells: EnclosedBackgroundCells associated with the object.
        - NewValue: Object's Color.
      - If Solidity is Solid:
        - Action: HollowOut
        - TargetCells: InteriorCells of the object.
        - NewValue: BackgroundValue (0).
  Output: A new grid reflecting these modifications.
