            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of integers. The value '0' appears to represent the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-zero values form distinct connected regions or shapes. In the input, we can identify four primary shapes:\n    *   A hollow square/frame made of '4's in the top-left.\n    *   A solid rectangle made of '5's in the top-right.\n    *   A hollow square/frame made of '3's in the bottom-left.\n    *   A solid square made of '4's in the bottom-right.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to depend on whether a shape is \"solid\" or \"hollow\" in the input.\n    *   Shapes that are initially \"hollow\" (containing background '0' cells enclosed within their structure) are \"filled\" in the output \u2013 the enclosed '0's are replaced by the shape's color.\n    *   Shapes that are initially \"solid\" (no enclosed '0's) are \"hollowed out\" in the output \u2013 their interior cells are replaced by '0's, leaving only the border cells intact.\n4.  **Color Preservation:** The color (the specific non-zero integer) of the shapes' borders is preserved during the transformation. Filling uses the shape's existing color. Hollowing replaces the interior with the background color '0'.\n5.  **Locality:** The transformation appears to operate independently on each distinct shape.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
