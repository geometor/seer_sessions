"""
Identifies connected components (objects) of non-zero cells in the input grid.
Calculates the area and number of distinct neighboring objects for each object.
Filters the objects based on two criteria:
1. Keep objects whose area is equal to the maximum area found among all objects.
2. Keep objects that touch more than one other distinct object (neighbor count > 1).
All other objects are removed (replaced by the background color 0).
Adjacency for connectivity within an object is horizontal/vertical.
Adjacency for determining neighbors between objects includes diagonals.
