Data:
  Type: Grid (2D Array of Integers)
  Background_Color: 0
Objects:
  Definition: Connected components of cells with the same non-zero color (horizontal/vertical adjacency).
  Properties:
    - color: Integer (1-9)
    - area: Integer (count of cells)
    - neighbors: List of other objects it touches (shares an edge or corner with)
    - neighbor_count: Integer (number of distinct neighbors)
  Relationships:
    - touches: An object touches another if any cell of the first object is adjacent (including diagonals) to any cell of the second object.
Grid_Properties:
  - max_object_area: The maximum area among all objects in the input grid.
Action:
  - Filter objects from the input grid to produce the output grid.
Filter_Criteria:
  - Keep an object if:
      - its area equals the max_object_area
      - OR its neighbor_count is greater than 1.
  - Remove all other objects (replace their cells with the Background_Color).
