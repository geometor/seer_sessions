Objects:
  - Grid: An 8x8 matrix of integer values.
  - Cell: A single position (row, column) within the grid, holding an integer value.
  - Shape: A connected component of cells sharing the same non-zero integer value. Connectivity is likely 4-directional (up, down, left, right).
  - Background: Cells with the value 0.

Properties:
  - Cell:
    - position: (row, column) coordinates.
    - value: Integer digit (0-9).
  - Shape:
    - value: The non-zero integer shared by all cells in the shape.
    - cells: A set of coordinates representing the cells belonging to the shape.
    - bounding_box: (Optional) Min/max row/column occupied by the shape.

Actions:
  - Identify Shapes: Find all connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid.
  - Check Horizontal Adjacency: For each cell (r, c), check its right neighbor (r, c+1).
  - Compare Values: If cell (r, c) has value V1 > 0 and cell (r, c+1) has value V2 > 0, compare V1 and V2.
  - Determine Minimum Value Shape: If V1 != V2, identify the shape associated with min(V1, V2).
  - Mark for Shifting: Mark the identified minimum value shape for a leftward shift.
  - Shift Shape Left:
    - Clear Original Positions: Set the value of the original cells of the shifted shape to 0 in the output grid.
    - Set New Positions: Set the value of the cells one column to the left of the original positions to the shape's value in the output grid, overwriting existing values.
  - Copy Unchanged: Transfer cells not involved in shifts or overwriting from input to output.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells are adjacent horizontally if they are in the same row and adjacent columns.
  - Belonging: A cell belongs to a specific shape if it has the shape's value and is connected to other cells of that shape.
  - Comparison: Values of adjacent non-zero cells are compared (V1 vs V2).
  - Trigger: The condition V1 > 0, V2 > 0, V1 != V2 between horizontally adjacent cells triggers a potential shift.
  - Shift Target: The shape with the minimum value (min(V1, V2)) is the target for the leftward shift.
