These non-zero digits often form connected components or shapes.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves spatial rearrangement of some colored shapes based on their interaction with horizontally adjacent shapes of different colors.\n4.  **Interaction Rule:** The key interaction occurs between horizontally adjacent cells with different non-zero values. Let `V1` be the value of a cell `(r, c)` and `V2` be the value of its right neighbor `(r, c+1)`. If `V1 > 0`, `V2 > 0`, and `V1 != V2`, an interaction occurs.\n5.  **Movement Trigger:** The interaction triggers a movement (shift) of the entire connected component associated with the *smaller* value between `V1` and `V2`.\n6.  **Movement Direction:** The triggered movement is always one step to the *left*.\n7.  **Overwriting:** When a shape shifts left, its constituent cells overwrite the contents of the destination cells in the grid. The original positions of the shifted shape become empty (0), unless overwritten by another shape.\n8.  **Simultaneity:** The decision of which shapes to move seems based on all relevant adjacencies present in the *input* grid. All identified shifts are then applied to generate the output grid. A shape might be involved in multiple adjacencies (e.g., Example 4, the '1' is adjacent to '5' on both left and right), but the outcome (shifting the component with the minimum value left) remains consistent.\n9.  **Stability:** Shapes that are not identified for movement remain in their original positions, unless overwritten by a moving shape. Background cells (0) also remain unchanged unless overwritten.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
