*   **Perception:** The task involves processing a 2D grid of numbers. The transformation rule appears to be conditional based on the presence of a specific number, '6'. In examples where '6' is present in the input (train_2, train_4), it is replaced by '0' in the output. In examples where '6' is not present (train_1, train_3), the input grid is identical to the output grid. All other numbers besides '6' remain unchanged in their positions and values across all examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_dimensions: variable (consistent between input and output per example)
    background_color: 0 (most frequent value, often bordering shapes)
    objects:
      - type: grid_cell
        properties:
          - value: integer (0-7 observed)
          - position: (row, column)
    action:
      - type: conditional_replacement
        condition: cell value equals 6
        replacement_value: 0
      - type: copy
        condition: cell value is not 6
        source: input_cell
        target: output_cell
    relationship: output grid is derived from input grid by applying the action to each cell.
    key_element: The number 6 triggers the transformation.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell (row, column) of the input grid.
    3.  Read the value of the current input cell.
    4.  If the value of the input cell is 6, set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0.
    5.  Otherwise (if the value is not 6), copy the value from the input cell to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
    6.  After iterating through all cells, the output grid represents the final result.
