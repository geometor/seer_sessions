In examples where '6' is present in the input (train_2, train_4), it is replaced by '0' in the output. In examples where '6' is not present (train_1, train_3), the input grid is identical to the output grid. All other numbers besides '6' remain unchanged in their positions and values across all examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
