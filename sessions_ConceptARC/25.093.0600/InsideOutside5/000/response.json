The value 0 consistently represents the background. Non-zero values represent distinct foreground elements.\n3.  **Objects:** Connected components of the same non-zero integer value form distinct \"objects\" or shapes within the grid. Connectivity appears to be based on adjacency (including diagonals, i.e., 8-way connectivity).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation selectively filters the objects from the input grid to produce the output grid. The output grid retains only certain objects from the input, while the rest are replaced by the background color (0).\n5.  **Core Logic:** The key criterion for retaining an object seems to be **enclosure**. An object is kept in the output if it is completely surrounded or enclosed by the cells of exactly one *other* object. Objects touching the background (0) or objects of multiple different colors are removed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Cells adjacent to the background (0) disqualify an object from being enclosed.\n\nTransformation:\n  - Action: Identify all distinct non-zero objects in the input grid.\n  - Action: For each object, examine its adjacent cells.\n  - Condition: Check if all adjacent cells (not belonging to the object itself) belong to exactly one *other* distinct non-zero object.\n  - Action: Construct the output grid.\n  - Rule: Populate the output grid only with the cells of objects that satisfy the enclosure condition. All other cells become 0.\n```"

Identify all distinct connected objects formed by non-zero cells in the input grid. For each object, record its color (value) and the coordinates of all its cells.\n3.  For each identified object (let's call it `current_object`):\n    a.  Find all unique neighboring cells adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any cell of `current_object`, ensuring these neighboring cells are *not* part of `current_object` itself.\n    b.  Check the values (colors) present in these neighboring cells.\n    c.  Determine if *all* these neighboring cells meet two conditions:\n        i.  None of the neighboring cells have the background value (0).\n        ii. All neighboring cells belong to *exactly one* other distinct object (i.e., they all share the same non-zero color, and this color is different from `current_object`'s color).\n    d.  If both conditions (c.i and c.ii) are true, then `current_object` is considered \"enclosed\".\n4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the input grid. If cell `(r, c)` belongs to an object that was determined to be \"enclosed\" in step 3d, copy the value from `input[r, c]` to `output[r, c]`.\n5.  Return the final output grid."
