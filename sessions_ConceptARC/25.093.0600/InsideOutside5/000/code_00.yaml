Task: Filter grid objects based on spatial enclosure.

Grid:
  - Type: 2D Matrix
  - CellType: Non-negative Integer
  - BackgroundValue: 0
  - ForegroundValues: Non-zero integers (1-9 observed)

Objects:
  - Definition: Connected components of identical non-zero values.
  - Connectivity: Assumed 8-way (including diagonals).
  - Property: Color (the integer value of the cells).
  - Property: Location (set of cell coordinates).

Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial Adjacency
    - Definition: Cells sharing an edge or corner.
  - Type: Enclosure
    - Definition: An object 'A' is enclosed if every cell adjacent to 'A' (but not part of 'A') belongs to exactly one other single object 'B'. Cells adjacent to the background (0) disqualify an object from being enclosed.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify all distinct non-zero objects in the input grid.
  - Action: For each object, examine its adjacent cells.
  - Condition: Check if all adjacent cells (not belonging to the object itself) belong to exactly one *other* distinct non-zero object.
  - Action: Construct the output grid.
  - Rule: Populate the output grid only with the cells of objects that satisfy the enclosure condition. All other cells become 0.
