*   **Perception:** The task involves analyzing a grid of digits. The grid contains distinct shapes formed by connected cells of the same non-zero digit. Some shapes appear solid, while others act as frames or boundaries enclosing a different digit or a pattern of digits (potentially zeros). The output seems to be directly related to the content enclosed by one of these boundary shapes. If a shape made of digit 'D' encloses a single digit 'X', the output is 'X'. If it encloses a small grid pattern, the output is that pattern. Shapes that do not enclose anything (solid shapes) seem irrelevant to the output.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify shapes in a grid that enclose a distinct inner region and output the content of that region.

    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 10x10 matrix of digits (0-9).
      - element: shape
        description: A connected component of identical non-zero digits within the grid.
        properties:
          - digit: The digit forming the shape.
          - connectivity: Cells are considered connected if they share an edge (4-connectivity).
          - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing the shape.
      - element: enclosed_region
        description: A region within the bounding box of a shape, consisting of cells not belonging to the shape itself, and fully surrounded by the shape's cells.
        properties:
          - content: The digit(s) or pattern within the enclosed region.
          - size: Can be a single cell or a subgrid.
      - element: output
        description: The content of the enclosed region found within the input grid.
        properties:
          - type: Can be a single digit or a grid of digits.

    relationships:
      - relationship: enclosure
        subject: shape
        object: enclosed_region
        description: A shape forms a boundary around an enclosed_region if all cells adjacent to the enclosed_region are either part of the shape or part of the enclosed_region itself.

    transformation:
      - action: find_shapes
        input: grid
        output: list of shapes
        description: Identify all connected components of non-zero digits.
      - action: check_enclosure
        input: shape
        output: enclosed_region or null
        description: Determine if a shape encloses a region distinct from the shape's digit.
      - action: extract_content
        input: enclosed_region
        output: output (single digit or grid)
        description: Get the content of the identified enclosed region.

    rule_priority:
      - condition: Multiple enclosing shapes found.
        resolution: Based on the examples, it appears only one enclosing shape determines the output per grid. The specific selection criteria (e.g., first found, specific digit priority) are not fully determined but the process stops once one is found and processed.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct connected components (shapes) formed by identical non-zero digits. Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right) to determine connectivity.
    2.  For each identified shape:
        a.  Determine its bounding box.
        b.  Identify all cells within this bounding box that are *not* part of the shape. Call this potential enclosed region `R`.
        c.  Verify if the shape truly encloses `R`: check that every cell in `R` is adjacent only to cells belonging to the shape or other cells within `R`.
        d.  If such an enclosed region `R` is found:
            i.  Extract the content of region `R`.
            ii. If `R` consists of a single cell containing digit `X`, the final output is `X`.
            iii. If `R` consists of multiple cells, form a subgrid representing `R`. This subgrid is the final output.
            iv. Stop the process and return the determined output.
    3.  If no shape is found to enclose a region after checking all shapes, the output is undefined based on the provided examples (assume a default behavior like returning an empty grid or a specific value might be needed if such cases exist).
