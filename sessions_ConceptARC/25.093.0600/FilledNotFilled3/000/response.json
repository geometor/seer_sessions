Some shapes appear solid, while others act as frames or boundaries enclosing a different digit or a pattern of digits (potentially zeros). The output seems to be directly related to the content enclosed by one of these boundary shapes. If a shape made of digit 'D' encloses a single digit 'X', the output is 'X'. If it encloses a small grid pattern, the output is that pattern. Shapes that do not enclose anything (solid shapes) seem irrelevant to the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
