task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - background_color: 0
  - element: Object
    properties:
      - definition: A connected component of non-zero cells in the grid (using 4-way or 8-way connectivity, typically 8-way in ARC).
      - composition: Can be composed of one or more distinct non-zero colors (digits).
      - location: Occupies a specific set of coordinates within the grid.
  - element: Target Removal Color
    properties:
      - definition: A specific non-zero color C.
      - role: Determines which objects are removed.
      - identification: Found by observing which color C, when present in an input object, leads to that object's complete removal in the output, while objects lacking color C remain.
relationships:
  - relationship: Object Membership
    involved_elements: [Grid, Object]
    description: Objects are subsets of cells within the Grid.
  - relationship: Color Presence
    involved_elements: [Object, Target Removal Color]
    description: An object either contains the Target Removal Color or it does not.
actions:
  - action: Identify Objects
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of Objects (each defined by its constituent cells and colors)
    description: Use connectivity analysis (e.g., flood fill or similar) on non-zero cells to find distinct components.
  - action: Determine Target Removal Color
    input: Input Grid, Output Grid
    output: Target Removal Color C
    description: Find a non-zero color C present in some input objects such that all objects containing C are absent (replaced by 0) in the output, while at least one object not containing C persists.
  - action: Filter Objects
    input: Set of Objects, Target Removal Color C
    output: Set of Objects to Keep
    description: Select objects that do *not* contain the Target Removal Color C.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    input: Input Grid Dimensions, Set of Objects to Keep, Background Color (0)
    output: Output Grid
    description: Create a new grid filled with the background color, then draw the cells of the "Objects to Keep" onto it using their original colors and positions.
