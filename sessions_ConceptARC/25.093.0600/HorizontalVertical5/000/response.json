The transformation preserves the original grid content (the 0s and 4s) but adds a line of cells with color 3. This line is either the entire first row (row index 0) or the entire last column (column index 9). The decision of whether to fill the first row or the last column depends on the properties of the bounding box surrounding the shape formed by the color 4 cells.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
