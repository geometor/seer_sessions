"""
The transformation identifies the dominant color (C) based on the largest contiguous block (S) of a single non-zero color in the input grid. 
The final output grid is constructed as follows:
1. Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
2. Identify the largest contiguous block (S) of a single non-zero color and determine its color (C).
3. Identify all cells in the input grid that have the dominant color C. This includes the primary block (S) and any other disconnected cells with color C (D). Let the set of coordinates for all these cells be `dominant_locations`.
4. Identify 'noise' cells (N): Iterate through the input grid. A cell (r, c) is considered a noise cell to be assimilated if:
    a. Its color is non-zero and *not* equal to the dominant color C.
    b. It is orthogonally adjacent to at least two cells whose coordinates are in `dominant_locations`.
5. Populate the output grid: For every coordinate (r_out, c_out) belonging to either `dominant_locations` or the set of assimilated noise cells (N), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the dominant color C.
6. Return the final output grid.
