*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid of integers into an output grid. The core transformation appears to be the identification of a specific diagonal or anti-diagonal line segment in the input grid and "copying" or "projecting" this line segment to a different location within the grid, shifted horizontally by a fixed offset. The number composing the source line segment overwrites the values in the cells of the projected target line segment.

```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        properties:
          - structure: 2D array of integers
          - dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x13, 10x10)
          - content: integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)
      - object: line_segment
        properties:
          - type: diagonal or anti-diagonal
          - composition: consists of a single, repeated non-zero integer (source_number)
          - location: typically found in one region of the grid (e.g., left side)
          - coordinates: list of (row, column) pairs defining the segment (source_coords)
      - object: projection
        properties:
          - type: horizontal shift
          - offset: a fixed integer value representing the number of columns to shift (e.g., 7)
          - target_coords: coordinates resulting from applying the offset to source_coords
      - action: identify_source_line
        description: Find the specific diagonal or anti-diagonal line segment composed of a single non-zero number.
      - action: calculate_target_coords
        description: Apply the horizontal offset to the source_coords to determine the target coordinates.
      - action: overwrite_target_cells
        description: Modify the grid by setting the values at the target_coords to the source_number.
    relationships:
      - type: projection_mapping
        description: The source_line_segment is mapped to the target_coords via the horizontal offset.
      - type: value_transfer
        description: The source_number from the source_line_segment determines the value written into the cells at the target_coords.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Identify the primary diagonal or anti-diagonal line segment within the input grid that is composed of a single, repeated non-zero integer (`source_number`). Let the coordinates of this segment be `source_coords`.
    3.  Define a fixed horizontal column `offset` (observed as 7 in the examples).
    4.  Iterate through each coordinate `(row, col_source)` in `source_coords`.
    5.  Calculate the corresponding target column `col_target = col_source + offset`.
    6.  Check if the calculated target coordinate `(row, col_target)` lies within the bounds of the grid.
    7.  If the target coordinate is within bounds, update the output grid by setting the value at `output_grid[row][col_target]` to the `source_number`.
    8.  Return the final modified output grid.
