task_type: object_extraction_and_transformation
input_domain: 2D_grid_of_integers
output_domain: 2D_grid_of_integers
elements:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - cells: contain non-negative integers (colors)
      - background_color: 0
  - name: object
    type: connected_component_of_cells
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer
      - shape: varies, includes rectangular frames
actions:
  - name: identify_target_object
    description: Find a specific object within the input grid, characterized as a rectangular frame made of a single non-zero color. It appears to be the first such object found.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: target_object_location, target_object_frame_color
  - name: extract_bounding_box
    description: Determine the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the target object.
    inputs: input_grid, target_object_location
    outputs: subgrid
  - name: transform_colors
    description: Modify the colors within the extracted subgrid based on the target object's frame color.
    inputs: subgrid, target_object_frame_color
    outputs: transformed_subgrid
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the final output grid from the transformed subgrid.
    inputs: transformed_subgrid
    outputs: output_grid
relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the identified target object in the input grid.
  - The output grid's cell values are derived from the corresponding input grid cells within the bounding box.
  - Cells in the output corresponding to the target object's frame color retain that color.
  - Cells in the output corresponding to any other color *inside* the frame in the input are changed to the background color (0).
