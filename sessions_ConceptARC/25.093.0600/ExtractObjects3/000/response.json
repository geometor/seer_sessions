The color of the frame itself is preserved, while the color(s) *inside* the frame in the input are replaced with the background color (0) in the output.\n*   The dimensions of the output grid match the bounding box of the identified frame structure in the input.\n*   The specific frame structure chosen seems to be the first one encountered (potentially scanning top-left).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
