            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers (0-9). The digit '0' consistently represents the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The core objects are \"regions\" or \"blobs\" of connected cells sharing the same non-zero digit. Connectivity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).\n3.  **Properties:**\n    *   Each region has a specific color (the digit value).\n    *   Each region has a shape and size (number of cells).\n    *   Each region has a position within the grid.\n    *   A key property seems to be whether any part of the region touches the outer border/edge of the grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively removing entire regions based on a specific property. Regions that are removed are replaced by the background color '0'. Regions that are not removed remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Underlying Rule:** Based on the examples, the rule appears to be: Identify all connected regions of non-zero colors. If *any* cell belonging to a region is located on the grid's outermost border (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column), then the *entire* region is removed (set to '0'). If a region is entirely contained within the grid and does not touch any border, it is preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
