task_description: Remove connected regions of color if they touch the grid border.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 10x10, 8x8, 9x9)
      - cell_values: integers 0-9
      - background_color: 0

  - element: region
    properties:
      - type: connected component of non-zero cells
      - connectivity: horizontal and vertical adjacency
      - color: the integer value (1-9) shared by cells in the region
      - location: set of coordinates (row, col) occupied by the region
      - border_touching: boolean (true if any cell in the region is in row 0, last row, col 0, or last col)

actions:
  - action: identify_regions
    input: input grid
    output: list of regions (each with color, coordinates, border_touching property)
    description: Finds all connected components of non-zero cells. For each component, determine its color, cell coordinates, and whether it touches the grid border.

  - action: filter_regions
    input: list of regions
    output: list of regions_to_keep
    description: Selects only those regions where the 'border_touching' property is false.

  - action: generate_output_grid
    input:
      - input grid dimensions
      - list of regions_to_keep
    output: output grid
    description: Creates a new grid filled with the background color ('0'). Then, for each region in 'regions_to_keep', place its color value at its corresponding coordinates in the new grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: border_determines_removal
    subject: region
    object: grid border
    description: A region's 'border_touching' status determines if it is kept or removed in the output grid. Removal applies to the entire region if any part touches the border.
