objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer (number of rows)
      - columns: integer (number of columns)
      - cells: list of lists containing numerical values (0 or 2)
  - name: row
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - values: list of numerical values
      - is_solid: boolean (true if all values are 2)
  - name: column
    properties:
      - index: integer
      - values: list of numerical values
      - count_of_twos: integer
      - is_dense: boolean (true if it has the maximum count_of_twos among all columns)

  - type: containment
    from: grid
    to: column
  - type: correspondence
    description: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: preservation
    description: The solid row from the input grid appears identically in the output grid at the same row index.
  - type: projection
    description: The column index identified as dense in the input grid corresponds to a column filled entirely with 2s in the output grid.

actions:
  - name: find_solid_row
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the row where all cell values are 2
  - name: find_dense_column
    input: input_grid
    output: index of the column with the maximum count of cells with value 2
  - name: initialize_output_grid
    input: dimensions (rows, columns)
    output: grid filled with 0s
  - name: copy_row
    input: source_grid, target_grid, row_index
    action: Copies the row at row_index from source_grid to target_grid.
  - name: fill_column
    input: target_grid, column_index, value (2)
    action: Sets all cells in the specified column of target_grid to the given value.
