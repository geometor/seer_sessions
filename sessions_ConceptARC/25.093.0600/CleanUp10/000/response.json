The transformation appears to identify specific structural features in the input grid (a row composed entirely of '2's and a column with the highest density of '2's) and uses these features to construct the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified representation highlighting these identified features against a background of '0's.\n\n1.  **Identify Constant Feature:** There is always one row in the input grid that consists entirely of the digit '2'. This row is preserved exactly in the same position in the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Dominant Feature:** There is one column in the input grid that contains the maximum number of '2's compared to other columns.\n3.  **Construct Output:** The output grid is initially composed entirely of '0's. Then, the identified constant row (all '2's) from the input is copied over. Finally, the column corresponding to the identified dominant column index is filled entirely with '2's.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
