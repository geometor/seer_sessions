            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are 2D grids of integers.\n*   The integer `0` represents the background.\n*   Non-zero integers represent distinct \"colors\" or types of objects.\n*   In each example, there are exactly two distinct non-zero colors present in the input.\n*   These non-zero colors form contiguous or semi-contiguous shapes/objects within the grid.\n*   One object is positioned vertically above the other object in the input grid.\n*   The transformation involves changing the vertical positions of these two objects relative to each other.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation (Example 1):**\n\n*   Object 1: Color 4, occupies row 3.\n*   Object 2: Color 3, occupies rows 4 through 8.\n*   Object 1 (color 4) is above Object 2 (color 3).\n*   In the output, Object 2 (color 3) remains in rows 4 through 8.\n*   Object 1 (color 4) moves to row 9, which is immediately below the original position of Object 2.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation (Example 2):**\n\n*   Object 1: Color 8, occupies rows 0 through 2 (min_row=0, max_row=2).\n*   Object 2: Color 2, occupies rows 3 through 8 (min_row=3, max_row=8).\n*   Object 1 (color 8) is above Object 2 (color 2).\n*   In the output, Object 2 (color 2) remains in rows 3 through 8.\n*   Object 1 (color 8) moves to rows 9 through 11. The new top row (9) is immediately below the original bottom row of Object 2 (row 8). The relative shape of object 1 is preserved.\n\n**Conclusion on Transformation:**\n\nThe transformation identifies the two distinct non-zero colored objects in the grid. It determines which object is vertically higher (top object) and which is lower (bottom object). The bottom object remains in its original position in the output. The top object is moved vertically downwards so that its new top edge is positioned one row below the original bottom edge of the bottom object. The internal structure and horizontal positions of both objects are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the two distinct non-zero colors present in the input grid. Call them `ColorA` and `ColorB`.\n3.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` where the input grid contains `ColorA`. Store these as `CoordsA`.\n4.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` where the input grid contains `ColorB`. Store these as `CoordsB`.\n5.  Determine the minimum row (`min_rowA`) and maximum row (`max_rowA`) from `CoordsA`.\n6.  Determine the minimum row (`min_rowB`) and maximum row (`max_rowB`) from `CoordsB`.\n7.  Identify the \"Top Object\" and \"Bottom Object\":\n    *   If `min_rowA < min_rowB`, then the Top Object has `ColorA` and `CoordsA`, and the Bottom Object has `ColorB`, `CoordsB`, and its bottom row is `max_rowB`.\n    *   Else (`min_rowB < min_rowA`), then the Top Object has `ColorB` and `CoordsB`, and the Bottom Object has `ColorA`, `CoordsA`, and its bottom row is `max_rowA`.\n8.  Let `TopColor`, `TopCoords`, `min_rowTop` refer to the properties of the identified Top Object.\n9.  Let `BottomColor`, `BottomCoords`, `max_rowBottom` refer to the properties of the identified Bottom Object.\n10. Calculate the vertical shift for the Top Object: `shift = (max_rowBottom + 1) - min_rowTop`.\n11. Populate the output grid:\n    *   For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `BottomCoords`, set `output_grid[r][c] = BottomColor`.\n    *   For each coordinate `(r, c)` in `TopCoords`, set `output_grid[r + shift][c] = TopColor`.\n12. Return the final output grid."
