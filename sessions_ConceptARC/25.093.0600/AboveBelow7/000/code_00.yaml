Grid:
  Type: 2D array
  Element: Integer
Background:
  Value: 0
Objects:
  Identification: Contiguous regions of identical non-zero integers
  Count_Per_Grid: 2
  Properties:
    - Color: The non-zero integer value
    - Pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates
    - BoundingBox: min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col
Relationships:
  - Spatial: One object ('Top Object') is located vertically above the other ('Bottom Object') based on min_row comparison.
Action:
  Name: Reposition Top Object
  Rule: Move 'Top Object' vertically downwards.
  Target_Position: The new min_row of 'Top Object' becomes 'Bottom Object'.max_row + 1.
  Invariant: 'Bottom Object' position remains unchanged.
  Invariant: Internal shape and horizontal position of both objects are preserved.
Output_Grid:
  Construction: Start with a background grid, place the 'Bottom Object' at its original location, place the 'Top Object' at its new calculated location.
