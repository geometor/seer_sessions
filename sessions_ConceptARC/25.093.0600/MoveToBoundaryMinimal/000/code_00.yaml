Grid_Dimensions: 10x10
Elements:
  - Type: Background
    Value: 0
  - Type: Blocking_Pattern
    Value: Non-zero digit forming a line (e.g., 4s in a column, 3s in a row)
    Properties:
      - Orientation: Vertical or Horizontal
      - Extends across most of the grid dimension (row or column)
  - Type: Moving_Digit
    Value: A single non-zero digit, distinct from the blocking pattern and background
    Properties:
      - Isolated: Not part of the blocking pattern
      - Initial_Position: (row, column)
      - Final_Position: (row, column)
Relationships:
  - Moving_Digit is initially separated from the Blocking_Pattern by background cells (0s).
  - The final position of the Moving_Digit is adjacent to the Blocking_Pattern.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the Blocking_Pattern and its orientation.
  - Identify: Locate the Moving_Digit and its initial position.
  - Determine_Direction: Set movement direction perpendicular to the Blocking_Pattern's orientation (towards the pattern).
  - Move: Relocate the Moving_Digit along the determined direction.
  - Stop_Condition: Halt movement when the Moving_Digit occupies the cell directly adjacent to the Blocking_Pattern.
  - Update_Grid:
      - Place the Moving_Digit in its final position.
      - Replace the initial position of the Moving_Digit with the Background value (0).
      - Keep the Blocking_Pattern and other Background cells unchanged.
