            "text": "**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 10x10 grid of single digits. In both provided examples, the input grid contains mostly zeros (0), a distinct line pattern (vertical line of 4s in example 1, horizontal line of 3s in example 2), and a single, isolated non-zero digit (3 in example 1, 6 in example 2) located elsewhere in the grid.\n\nThe transformation moves the isolated non-zero digit towards the line pattern. The movement stops when the digit is in the cell immediately adjacent to the line pattern. The direction of movement is perpendicular to the orientation of the line pattern (horizontal movement towards a vertical line, vertical movement towards a horizontal line). The original position of the moved digit is replaced with a zero (0). The line pattern itself and all other zero cells remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify the \"Blocking Pattern\": a line (either a full row or a full column) consisting of identical non-zero digits. Note the digit value, the line's orientation (horizontal/vertical), and its index (row or column number).\n3.  Scan the input grid to identify the \"Moving Digit\": a single, isolated non-zero digit that is not part of the Blocking Pattern. Note its value and initial position (row, column).\n4.  Determine the target position for the Moving Digit:\n    *   If the Blocking Pattern is a vertical line at column `C`: The target position is `(initial_row, C-1)` if the Moving Digit starts left of the line, or `(initial_row, C+1)` if it starts right of the line (assuming movement is always towards the line, the examples suggest movement only stops *before* the line). Based on example 1, the target is `(initial_row, C-1)`.\n    *   If the Blocking Pattern is a horizontal line at row `R`: The target position is `(R-1, initial_column)` if the Moving Digit starts below the line, or `(R+1, initial_column)` if it starts above the line. Based on example 2, the target is `(R+1, initial_column)`.\n5.  Update the output grid:\n    *   Set the cell at the Moving Digit's initial position to 0.\n    *   Set the cell at the calculated target position to the value of the Moving Digit.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
