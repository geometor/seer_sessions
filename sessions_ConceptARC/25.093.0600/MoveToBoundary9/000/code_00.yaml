task_description: "Horizontally shift two distinct non-zero groups to opposite edges of the grid."
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of integers."
  - element: background
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: "The default value for grid cells."
  - element: object
    description: "A collection of grid cells sharing the same non-zero integer value."
    properties:
      - value: "The non-zero integer defining the object."
      - coordinates: "A list of (row, column) pairs for cells belonging to the object."
      - horizontal_position: "Determined by the column indices of its coordinates."
      - extent: "Defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices."
relationships:
  - relationship: "Spatial separation"
    between: [object, object]
    description: "The two non-zero objects are spatially distinct in the input grid, particularly horizontally."
  - relationship: "Left/Right ordering"
    between: [object, object]
    description: "One object can be identified as being 'to the left' of the other based on their minimum column indices."
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: grid
    output: [object1, object2]
    description: "Find all unique non-zero values and group cell coordinates by these values."
  - action: determine_order
    input: [object1, object2]
    output: [left_object, right_object]
    description: "Compare the minimum column indices of the objects to determine which is left and which is right."
  - action: calculate_shifts
    input: [left_object, right_object, grid_width]
    output: [shift_left, shift_right]
    description: >
      Calculate the horizontal shift needed for the left object to align its leftmost point with column 0.
      Calculate the horizontal shift needed for the right object to align its rightmost point with the last column (grid_width - 1).
  - action: apply_shifts
    input: [left_object, right_object, shift_left, shift_right, grid_dimensions]
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Create a new zero-filled grid.
      Place the cells of the left_object at their original rows and shifted columns (column + shift_left).
      Place the cells of the right_object at their original rows and shifted columns (column + shift_right).
