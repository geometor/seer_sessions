Each group uses a unique number (e.g., all 2s form one group, all 1s form another in the first example; all 3s form one group, all 4s form another in the second).\n\nThe transformation involves moving these two groups horizontally. The group initially positioned further to the left in the input grid is moved so that its leftmost element aligns with the first column (column 0) of the output grid. The group initially positioned further to the right is moved so that its rightmost element aligns with the last column of the output grid.\n\nThe internal structure and relative positions of the numbers within each group are preserved. The vertical positions (rows) of all numbers also remain unchanged. The cells that were originally zero remain zero unless overwritten by a moved number.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the two distinct non-zero values present in the input grid.\n3.  For each distinct non-zero value, collect the list of (row, column) coordinates where it appears. These two collections represent the two objects.\n4.  Determine which object is the \"left object\" and which is the \"right object\" by comparing the minimum column index found within each object's coordinates. The object with the smaller minimum column index is the left object.\n5.  Calculate the shift amount for the left object: Find the minimum column index among all coordinates of the left object (`min_col_left`). The required shift is `0 - min_col_left`.\n6.  Calculate the shift amount for the right object: Find the maximum column index among all coordinates of the right object (`max_col_right`). Let the width of the grid be `W`. The required shift is `(W - 1) - max_col_right`.\n7.  Iterate through the coordinates `(r, c)` of the left object. For each coordinate, set the value in the output grid at `(r, c + shift_left)` to the value of the left object.\n8.  Iterate through the coordinates `(r, c)` of the right object. For each coordinate, set the value in the output grid at `(r, c + shift_right)` to the value of the right object.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
