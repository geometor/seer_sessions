task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties: [2D, Integer Digits (0-9)]
  - type: Background
    properties: [Digit 0]
  - type: Cell
    properties: [Row, Column, Digit Value (Color)]
  - type: Cell Property
    name: Neighborhood
    properties: [8 adjacent cells (Moore Neighborhood)]
  - type: Relationship
    name: Adjacency
    properties: [Between cells, Between cell and Background(0)/Edge]
  - type: Derived Pair
    name: Interface Pair
    criteria: [Two adjacent non-zero cells with different colors]
    properties:
      - Outer Color: [The color in the pair that has local adjacency to Background(0)/Edge]
      - Inner Color: [The color in the pair that is not the Outer Color]
      - Validity: [Valid only if exactly one color in the pair is locally adjacent to Background(0)/Edge]
  - type: Cell Condition
    name: Fully Surrounded by Interface Colors
    criteria:
      - Applies to cells whose color matches the Inner Color of a Valid Interface Pair.
      - All 8 neighbors must be within grid boundaries.
      - All 8 neighbors must have a color equal to either the Inner Color or the Outer Color of that specific Valid Interface Pair.

actions:
  - Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the input grid.
  - If `input[r, c]` is an Inner Color derived from a Valid Interface Pair (`C_inner`, `C_outer`):
    - Check if the "Fully Surrounded by Interface Colors" condition holds for `(r, c)` using `C_inner` and `C_outer`.
    - If the condition holds, set `output[r, c]` to `C_inner`.
  - Initialize the output grid with zeros.
  - Construct the output grid based on the cells passing the condition.

relationships:
  - Output grid is derived from Input Grid based on local color interfaces and neighborhood conditions.
  - Only cells identified as "Inner Color" at a valid interface *and* fully surrounded by the interface pair's colors appear in the output.
