            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt (`code_00.py`) used a local interface-based approach to identify inner/outer colors, which proved incorrect. It failed to capture the global property of a blob (whether *any* part of one color touches the background determines its \"outer\" status for the *entire* blob). The errors consistently show colors being kept incorrectly, either because they were misidentified as inner colors or because the \"fully surrounded\" check was flawed or applied to the wrong pairs.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to the initial blob-based analysis, but with a more precise implementation:\n\n1.  **Identify Blobs:** Use `scipy.ndimage.label` with 8-connectivity on non-zero cells.\n2.  **Filter Blobs:** Keep only blobs with exactly two distinct non-zero colors.\n3.  **Determine Global Inner/Outer:** For each two-color blob, check if *any* cell of `color1` is adjacent (8-way) to 0 or the grid edge. Do the same for `color2`. If exactly one color type has such adjacency, it's the `C_outer`, and the other is `C_inner`. If both or neither have adjacency, the blob is ignored.\n4.  **Filter Inner Cells:** Iterate through cells with `C_inner` in the valid blobs. Keep only those where all 8 neighbors are within the grid bounds AND have a color of either `C_inner` or `C_outer`.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid containing only the filtered `C_inner` cells.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's re-analyze `train_1` using the refined strategy to gather metrics.\n\n**Train 1 Input:**\n"
