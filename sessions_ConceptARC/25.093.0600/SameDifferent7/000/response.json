            "text": "*   **Perception of Elements:** The task involves transforming a 2D grid of digits (0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grids contain distinct regions or \"blobs\" formed by connected non-zero digits. The output grids are much sparser, retaining only specific digits from certain input blobs. The digit '0' acts as a background color.\n*   **Analysis:** The transformation focuses on blobs composed of exactly two distinct non-zero digits. Within such blobs, one digit seems to form an outer layer or border ('outer color'), while the other forms an inner core ('inner color'). The transformation rule isolates and retains only those cells of the 'inner color' that are completely surrounded by other cells belonging to the *same* blob (i.e., cells with either the inner or outer color). Blobs with only one non-zero color or more than two non-zero colors are completely removed (replaced by 0s) in the output. The 'outer color' is typically the one that has cells adjacent to the '0' background, while the 'inner color' does not (or does so to a lesser extent).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
