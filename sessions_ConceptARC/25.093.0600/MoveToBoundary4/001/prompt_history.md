*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids (10x10) containing integers.
    *   The grids primarily consist of the value 0 (background).
    *   The value 6 appears as distinct elements within the grid.
    *   The transformation involves repositioning the '6' values within each row.
    *   The '6' values in the output grid appear shifted towards the left compared to the input grid.
    *   The transformation seems to operate independently on each row.
    *   Contiguous horizontal sequences (blocks) of '6's in the input seem to be treated as units.
    *   These blocks are moved to the leftmost available positions in the output row, maintaining their original length and relative order.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - dimensions: 10x10
          - cell_values: [0, 6]
          - background_value: 0
          - foreground_value: 6
      - element: row
        properties:
          - structure: 1D array (slice of the grid)
          - processing_scope: Transformation is applied independently to each row.
      - element: block
        properties:
          - type: contiguous horizontal sequence of foreground_values (6) within a row
          - preservation: length and value (6) are preserved during transformation
          - relative_order: the left-to-right order of blocks within a row is preserved
      - action: shift_left
        properties:
          - target: blocks
          - direction: horizontal, towards column 0
          - constraint: blocks are placed starting from the leftmost available column (column 0), packed together without overlap, maintaining relative order.
      - relationship: input_output
        properties:
          - rule: For each row, identify all contiguous blocks of '6'. Create a new row initialized with '0's. Place the identified blocks into the new row starting from column 0, preserving their relative order and packing them consecutively.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled with the background value (0).
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
    3.  For the current row, identify all contiguous horizontal blocks of the non-zero value (6). Store these blocks (including their length) in the order they appear from left to right.
    4.  Initialize a variable `current_output_column` to 0.
    5.  Iterate through the identified blocks for the current row in their stored order.
    6.  For each block, place its sequence of '6's into the corresponding output row, starting at the `current_output_column`.
    7.  Update the `current_output_column` by adding the length of the block just placed.
    8.  After processing all blocks for the row, the remaining cells in the output row (from `current_output_column` to the end) remain 0.
    9.  Repeat steps 3-8 for all rows.
    10. The final modified grid is the task output.
