Context:
  Input: 2D grid of integers (colors).
  Output: 2D grid of integers (colors).
  Transformation_Goal: Fill internal holes within the largest colored shape.

Objects:
  - Grid:
      Properties:
        - dimensions (rows, columns)
        - cells
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - row_index
        - column_index
        - color (integer value)
        - is_background (color == 0)
        - is_foreground (color != 0)
  - Region: # A connected group of cells with the same non-zero color
      Properties:
        - cells (list of Cell objects)
        - color
        - size (number of cells)
        - is_largest (boolean, compared to other regions)
  - Hole: # A connected group of background (0) cells
      Properties:
        - cells (list of Cell objects)
        - is_internal (boolean, does not touch grid boundary)
        - surrounding_color (color of the region enclosing it)

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Cells can be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, possibly diagonally). Defines connectivity for Regions and Holes.
  - Containment: A Hole can be contained within a Region if all paths from the Hole cells to the grid boundary must pass through cells of that Region's color.
  - Largest: One Region is the largest based on cell count.

Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Find all connected components of non-zero colored cells.
  - Find_Largest_Region: Determine the region with the maximum number of cells.
  - Identify_Background_Regions: Find all connected components of zero-colored cells (potential holes).
  - Check_Boundary_Connection: Determine if a background region touches the grid border.
  - Fill_Hole: Change the color of cells within an internal background region (a hole) to the color of the surrounding largest foreground region.
