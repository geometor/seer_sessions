This shape contains internal \"holes\" filled with the background color (0).\n*   The transformation focuses on modifying the background cells (0) located *inside* the main foreground shape.\n*   Specifically, the background cells that form enclosed regions (holes) within the largest connected foreground shape are filled with the color of that shape.\n*   Background cells outside the main shape or holes within smaller, disconnected shapes remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Consider cells connected if they share an edge (horizontal or vertical adjacency).\n2.  Calculate the size (number of cells) for each foreground region.\n3.  Identify the foreground region with the largest size. If there's a tie, the specific color might matter, but based on the examples, assume there's a unique largest region or the color doesn't matter if sizes are equal (though unlikely given the visual nature). Let the color of this largest region be `C`.\n4.  Identify all connected regions of background cells (color 0).\n5.  For each background region, determine if it touches any cell on the boundary (edge) of the grid.\n6.  If a background region does *not* touch the grid boundary, it is considered an internal hole *relative to the entire grid*.\n7.  Iterate through all cells belonging to these internal background regions (holes). Change the color of each of these cells to `C` (the color of the largest foreground region).\n8.
