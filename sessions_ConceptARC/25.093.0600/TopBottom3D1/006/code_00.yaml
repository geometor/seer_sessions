task_elements:
  - name: Grid
    type: Container
    properties:
      - dimensions: [rows, columns] (constant between input/output)
      - elements: Cells

  - name: Cell
    type: Element
    properties:
      - position: [row, column]
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - state: (derived) background, potential_frame, potential_inner, external_relative_to_frame, internal_relative_to_frame

  - name: Background
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - role: Defines the starting point for reachability checks (external access)

  - name: Potential Frame Color
    type: Color Property
    properties:
      - value: C (a non-zero integer in the input grid)
      - role: Acts as a potential boundary/wall for reachability analysis

  - name: Potential Inner Cell
    type: Cell Property
    properties:
      - color: C_inner (non-zero, different from a Potential Frame Color C_frame)
      - location: Adjacent to a cell with C_frame
      - reachability: Not reachable from Background if C_frame cells are walls

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    properties: [4-connectivity (up, down, left, right)]
  - type: Reachability
    subject: Cell
    object: Background
    condition: Path exists not crossing cells of a specific Potential Frame Color
  - type: Bordering
    subject: Potential Inner Cell
    object: Cell with Potential Frame Color
    condition: Cells are adjacent

actions:
  - name: Initialize Output
    input: Input Grid
    output: Output Grid (identical copy initially)
  - name: Identify Potential Frame Colors
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of unique non-zero colors
  - name: Identify Background Coordinates
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of coordinates where color is 0
  - name: Analyze Each Potential Frame
    input: [Input Grid, Output Grid, Potential Frame Color (C_frame), Background Coordinates]
    output: Updated Output Grid
    steps:
      - name: Determine Relative Externality
        input: [Input Grid, Background Coordinates, C_frame]
        output: Set of coordinates reachable from background treating C_frame as wall (`External_relative_to_C_frame`)
        method: Flood fill (BFS) from Background Coordinates, avoiding C_frame cells.
      - name: Identify and Update Bordering Internal Cells
        input: [Input Grid, Output Grid, C_frame, `External_relative_to_C_frame`]
        output: Modified Output Grid
        method: Iterate through all cells (r, c). If Input Grid cell (r, c) has color `C_inner` (where `C_inner != 0` and `C_inner != C_frame`), AND (r, c) is *not* in `External_relative_to_C_frame`, AND (r, c) is adjacent to a cell with color `C_frame` in the Input Grid, THEN set Output Grid cell (r, c) color to `C_frame`.
  - name: Finalize Output
    input: Output Grid (after all potential frames analyzed)
    output: Final transformed grid.
