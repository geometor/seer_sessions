## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (representing colors). The core operation appears to be a "fill" or "paint bucket" like function, constrained by specific boundaries within the grid.

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions, containing single digits (0-9). '0' consistently represents the background color.
2.  **Colored Regions:** Non-zero numbers form distinct regions or shapes within the grid.
3.  **Boundary/Frame:** In each example, there's a specific non-zero color that acts as a frame or boundary (`C_frame`). This frame partially or fully encloses regions of other non-zero colors.
4.  **Enclosed Area:** The area inside the `C_frame` boundary contains other non-zero colors (`C_inner`).
5.  **External Area:** Areas outside the `C_frame` boundary, including the background (0) and potentially other non-zero colored regions not enclosed by `C_frame`, are considered external.
6.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the `C_frame` color and the region it encloses. All cells within this enclosed region that originally had a `C_inner` color are changed to the `C_frame` color in the output. The `C_frame` cells themselves, the background (0), and any non-zero cells in the external area remain unchanged.

actions:
  - name: Identify Frame Color (C_frame)
    input: Input Grid
    output: C_frame color value
    method: Find the unique non-zero color C such that treating C as a wall isolates other non-zero colors from the background during a flood fill starting from the background.
  - name: Determine Reachability (Flood Fill)
    input: [Input Grid, C_frame]
    output: Set of coordinates for "external" cells
    method: Perform a flood fill starting from all background (0) cells. The fill can propagate to adjacent cells unless the target cell has the C_frame color. Mark all reached cells as external.
  - name: Generate Output Grid
    input: [Input Grid, C_frame, External Cells Set]
    output: Output Grid
    method: Iterate through input grid cells. If a cell's color is C_frame, copy C_frame to output. If a cell is marked external, copy its input color to output. If a cell is not external and not C_frame, set its output color to C_frame.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify** the unique non-zero color (`C_frame`) in the input grid that acts as a boundary, such that if cells of this color were treated as impassable walls, a flood fill starting from the background (color 0) would fail to reach at least one other non-zero colored cell.
2.  **Perform** a flood fill starting from all background cells (color 0) in the input grid. This fill can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) but *cannot* enter cells whose color is `C_frame`.
3.  **Mark** all cells reached by this flood fill as "external". All other cells (including the `C_frame` cells themselves and any unreached non-zero cells) are considered "internal" in terms of reachability, though `C_frame` cells are treated specially.
4.  **Create** a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  **Iterate** through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell `(r, c)` has the color `C_frame`, set the output cell `(r, c)` to `C_frame`.
    b.  Else if the input cell `(r, c)` is marked "external" (from step 3), copy the input cell's color to the output cell `(r, c)`.
    c.  Else (the cell is not `C_frame` and was not marked "external"), set the output cell `(r, c)` to the `C_frame` color.
6.  **Return** the completed output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed across all examples, primarily because it incorrectly assumed a single, global "frame" color and applied a fill logic based solely on reachability from the background, missing the critical condition of local adjacency to the frame color for the transformation. The analysis of test results, especially `test_3`, confirms that multiple colors can simultaneously act as "frames" for different "inner" regions within the same grid.

The correct transformation involves identifying cells with a non-zero color (`C_inner`) that are immediately enclosed by cells of a *different* non-zero color (`C_frame`). A cell `(r, c)` with color `C_inner` is considered enclosed by `C_frame` if:
1.  It cannot reach any background cell (color 0) via 4-connectivity without passing through a cell of color `C_frame`.
2.  It is directly adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least one cell with color `C_frame`.

Cells meeting these conditions change their color to that of the adjacent `C_frame`. This process must be considered for every potential `C_frame` color present in the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-zero colors in the input grid; these are the `potential_frame_colors`.
3.  For each `potential_frame_color` (`Cf`):
    a.  Determine the set of cells reachable from the background (0) without crossing cells of color `Cf`. Call this `External_Cf`.
    b.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.
    c.  If the cell `(r, c)` has color `Ci` (where `Ci` is not 0 and not `Cf`), is *not* in `External_Cf`, and is adjacent to a cell with color `Cf` in the *input* grid, then update the color of cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `Cf`.
4.  Return the final output grid after checking against all `potential_frame_colors`.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis performed using `tool_code`:

*   **Grid Properties:** Dimensions remain constant between input and output. The set of unique non-zero colors present also remains the same. Background cells (0) are preserved.
*   **Transformation Condition:** Changes only occur in grids with at least two distinct non-zero colors.
*   **Changed Cells Summary:**
    *   `train_1`: 15 cells changed from 2 -> 1. (Frame: 1, Inner: 2)
    *   `train_2`: 8 cells changed from 4 -> 3. (Frame: 3, Inner: 4)
    *   `train_3`: 4 cells changed from 6 -> 7. (Frame: 7, Inner: 6)
    *   `test_1`: 2 cells changed from 8 -> 5. (Frame: 5, Inner: 8)
    *   `test_2`: 12 cells changed from 8 -> 2. (Frame: 2, Inner: 8)
    *   `test_3`: 24 cells changed (12 from 3 -> 4, 12 from 4 -> 3). (Frames: 3, 4; Inners: 4, 3)
*   **Key Observation:** The color a cell changes *to* is always the color of an adjacent cell in the input grid. The cells that change are those that are "internal" relative to the frame color they are adjacent to (i.e., not reachable from the background if that frame color is treated as a wall). `test_3` clearly demonstrates that multiple frame/inner relationships can exist and are processed independently.

## Natural Language Program (Revised)

1.  Create an `output_grid` as an identical copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Identify the set of all unique non-zero colors present in the `input_grid`. Call this set `potential_frame_colors`.
3.  Identify the coordinates of all cells in the `input_grid` with color 0. Call this set `background_coords`.
4.  For each `frame_color` currently being considered from the `potential_frame_colors` set:
    a.  Perform a flood fill computation starting from all `background_coords`. This fill explores the `input_grid` using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). The fill cannot enter cells whose color in the `input_grid` is equal to the current `frame_color`.
    b.  Collect all cell coordinates reached by this flood fill into a set named `external_cells_relative_to_frame`.
    c.  Iterate through every cell coordinate `(r, c)` from row 0 to `max_row` and column 0 to `max_col` of the `input_grid`:
        i.  Get the `current_color` of the cell `(r, c)` from the `input_grid`.
        ii. Check if `current_color` is 0 or if `current_color` is equal to the current `frame_color`. If either is true, continue to the next cell `(r, c)`.
        iii. Check if the coordinate `(r, c)` is present in the `external_cells_relative_to_frame` set. If it is present, continue to the next cell `(r, c)`.
        iv. Check the neighbors (up, down, left, right) of cell `(r, c)` in the `input_grid`. Determine if at least one neighbor has the color equal to the current `frame_color`.
        v.  If such a neighbor with the `frame_color` exists (and the checks in steps ii and iii were passed), update the cell at `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` to have the current `frame_color`.
5.  After iterating through all colors in `potential_frame_colors` and performing the associated updates, return the final `output_grid`.
