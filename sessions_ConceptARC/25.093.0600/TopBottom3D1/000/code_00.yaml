task_elements:
  - name: Grid
    type: Container
    properties:
      - dimensions: [rows, columns] (constant between input/output)
      - elements: Cells

  - name: Cell
    type: Element
    properties:
      - position: [row, column]
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - state: (derived) external or internal relative to the frame

  - name: Background
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - state: external

  - name: Frame Region
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: C_frame (specific non-zero integer, e.g., 1, 3, 7 in examples)
      - connectivity: Forms a boundary separating internal and external areas
      - state: external (in the sense that its color is preserved)

  - name: Enclosed Region
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: C_inner (one or more non-zero integers different from C_frame)
      - location: Geometrically inside the Frame Region
      - state: internal

  - name: External Non-Frame Region
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: Non-zero integer (potentially same as C_inner, but located outside)
      - location: Geometrically outside the Frame Region
      - state: external

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    properties: [4-connectivity (up, down, left, right)]
  - type: Enclosure
    subject: Frame Region
    object: Enclosed Region
  - type: Reachability
    description: Cells reachable from the Background without crossing the Frame Region color are external.

actions:
  - name: Identify Frame Color (C_frame)
    input: Input Grid
    output: C_frame color value
    method: Find the unique non-zero color C such that treating C as a wall isolates other non-zero colors from the background during a flood fill starting from the background.
  - name: Determine Reachability (Flood Fill)
    input: [Input Grid, C_frame]
    output: Set of coordinates for "external" cells
    method: Perform a flood fill starting from all background (0) cells. The fill can propagate to adjacent cells unless the target cell has the C_frame color. Mark all reached cells as external.
  - name: Generate Output Grid
    input: [Input Grid, C_frame, External Cells Set]
    output: Output Grid
    method: Iterate through input grid cells. If a cell's color is C_frame, copy C_frame to output. If a cell is marked external, copy its input color to output. If a cell is not external and not C_frame, set its output color to C_frame.
