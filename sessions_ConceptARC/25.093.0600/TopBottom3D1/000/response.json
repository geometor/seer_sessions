            "text": "## Perception of Task Elements\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers (representing colors). The core operation appears to be a \"fill\" or \"paint bucket\" like function, constrained by specific boundaries within the grid.\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions, containing single digits (0-9). '0' consistently represents the background color.\n2.  **Colored Regions:** Non-zero numbers form distinct regions or shapes within the grid.\n3.  **Boundary/Frame:** In each example, there's a specific non-zero color that acts as a frame or boundary (`C_frame`). This frame partially or fully encloses regions of other non-zero colors.\n4.  **Enclosed Area:** The area inside the `C_frame` boundary contains other non-zero colors (`C_inner`).\n5.  **External Area:** Areas outside the `C_frame` boundary, including the background (0) and potentially other non-zero colored regions not enclosed by `C_frame`, are considered external.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the `C_frame` color and the region it encloses. All cells within this enclosed region that originally had a `C_inner` color are changed to the `C_frame` color in the output. The `C_frame` cells themselves, the background (0), and any non-zero cells in the external area remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
