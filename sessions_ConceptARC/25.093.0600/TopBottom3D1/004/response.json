            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed across all examples, primarily because it incorrectly assumed a single, global \"frame\" color and applied a fill logic based solely on reachability from the background, missing the critical condition of local adjacency to the frame color for the transformation. The analysis of test results, especially `test_3`, confirms that multiple colors can simultaneously act as \"frames\" for different \"inner\" regions within the same grid.\n\nThe correct transformation involves identifying cells with a non-zero color (`C_inner`) that are immediately enclosed by cells of a *different* non-zero color (`C_frame`). A cell `(r, c)` with color `C_inner` is considered enclosed by `C_frame` if:\n1.  It cannot reach any background cell (color 0) via 4-connectivity without passing through a cell of color `C_frame`.\n2.  It is directly adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least one cell with color `C_frame`.\n\nCells meeting these conditions change their color to that of the adjacent `C_frame`. This process must be considered for every potential `C_frame` color present in the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify all unique non-zero colors in the input grid; these are the `potential_frame_colors`.\n3.  For each `potential_frame_color` (`Cf`):\n    a.  Determine the set of cells reachable from the background (0) without crossing cells of color `Cf`. Call this `External_Cf`.\n    b.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.\n    c.  If the cell `(r, c)` has color `Ci` (where `Ci` is not 0 and not `Cf`), is *not* in `External_Cf`, and is adjacent to a cell with color `Cf` in the *input* grid, then update the color of cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `Cf`.\n4.  Return the final output grid after checking against all `potential_frame_colors`.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis performed using `tool_code`:\n\n*   **Grid Properties:** Dimensions remain constant between input and output. The set of unique non-zero colors present also remains the same. Background cells (0) are preserved.\n*   **Transformation Condition:** Changes only occur in grids with at least two distinct non-zero colors.\n*   **Changed Cells Summary:**\n    *   `train_1`: 15 cells changed from 2 -> 1. (Frame: 1, Inner: 2)\n    *   `train_2`: 8 cells changed from 4 -> 3. (Frame: 3, Inner: 4)\n    *   `train_3`: 4 cells changed from 6 -> 7. (Frame: 7, Inner: 6)\n    *   `test_1`: 2 cells changed from 8 -> 5. (Frame: 5, Inner: 8)\n    *   `test_2`: 12 cells changed from 8 -> 2. (Frame: 2, Inner: 8)\n    *   `test_3`: 24 cells changed (12 from 3 -> 4, 12 from 4 -> 3). (Frames: 3, 4; Inners: 4, 3)\n*   **Key Observation:** The color a cell changes *to* is always the color of an adjacent cell in the input grid. The cells that change are those that are \"internal\" relative to the frame color they are adjacent to (i.e., not reachable from the background if that frame color is treated as a wall). `test_3` clearly demonstrates that multiple frame/inner relationships can exist and are processed independently.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
