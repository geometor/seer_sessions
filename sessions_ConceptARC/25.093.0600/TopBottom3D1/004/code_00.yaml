task_elements:
  - name: Grid
    type: Container
    properties:
      - dimensions: [rows, columns] (constant)
      - elements: Cells

  - name: Cell
    type: Element
    properties:
      - position: [row, column]
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - state: (derived) background, potential_frame, potential_inner, external_relative_to_frame

  - name: Background
    type: Region
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - role: Defines exterior boundary; source for reachability tests.

  - name: Potential Frame Color (Cf)
    type: Color Property
    properties:
      - value: Non-zero integer C
      - role: Acts as a potential wall in reachability tests; target color for adjacent enclosed cells.

  - name: Potential Inner Color (Ci)
    type: Color Property
    properties:
      - value: Non-zero integer C (different from Cf for a given interaction)
      - role: Color of cells that might be enclosed by Cf.

  - name: External Cells Set (relative to Cf)
    type: Set of Coordinates
    properties:
      - definition: Cells reachable from any Background cell via 4-connectivity without passing through any cell with color Cf in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    properties: [4-connectivity (up, down, left, right)]
  - type: ReachabilityFromBackground
    subject: Cell
    object: Background
    condition: Path exists using 4-connectivity in the input grid without crossing cells of a specific wall color (Cf).
  - name: EnclosureConditionForUpdate
    subject: Cell (r, c) with color Ci in Input Grid
    condition: Must satisfy ALL:
      1. Ci != 0
      2. Ci != Cf
      3. Cell (r, c) is NOT in the External Cells Set relative to Cf.
      4. Cell (r, c) is adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least one cell with color Cf in the Input Grid.

actions:
  - name: Identify Potential Frame Colors
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of unique non-zero colors present in Input Grid.
  - name: Determine Reachability (Flood Fill)
    input: [Input Grid, Set of Background Coords, Wall Color Cf]
    output: Set of coordinates for cells reachable from background without crossing Cf (External Cells Set relative to Cf).
  - name: Generate Output Grid
    input: Input Grid
    output: Output Grid
    method:
      1. Initialize Output Grid as a copy of Input Grid.
      2. Find all unique non-zero colors (Potential Frame Colors) from Input Grid.
      3. Find coordinates of all Background (0) cells in Input Grid.
      4. For each Potential Frame Color Cf:
         a. Calculate the External Cells Set relative to Cf using flood fill from Background cells, avoiding Cf as walls.
         b. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the Input Grid.
         c. Let Ci be the color of the Input Grid at (r, c).
         d. If the EnclosureConditionForUpdate is met for cell (r, c) with respect to Cf and Ci:
              - Set the color of cell (r, c) in the Output Grid to Cf.
      5. Return the final Output Grid.
