"""
Filters a 2D grid of digits. For each non-zero cell in the input grid,
it checks its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood). If at least one neighbor
in the input grid has the same value as the cell, the cell's value is 
kept in the output grid. Otherwise (if the cell value is 0 or if it's 
non-zero but has no neighbors with the same value), the corresponding 
cell in the output grid is set to 0.
