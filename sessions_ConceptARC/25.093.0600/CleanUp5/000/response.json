Other digits (including existing 0s and some non-zero digits) remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1`, all instances of the digit '3' are changed to '0', while all instances of '2' remain unchanged.\n    *   In `train_2`, *some* instances of the digit '4' are changed to '0', while others remain '4'.\n    *   Observing the positions, the non-zero digits that are changed to 0 appear to be those that do not have any adjacent cells (including diagonals - Moore neighborhood) containing the *same* non-zero digit. Conversely, non-zero digits that *do* have at least one neighbor with the same value are preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
