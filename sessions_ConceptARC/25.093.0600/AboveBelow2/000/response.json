An object can sometimes contain cells of different non-zero colors (e.g., train\\_3, bottom object).\n    *   The transformation involves removing some of these objects, replacing their cells with the background color 0.\n    *   The decision to remove an object seems related to its position, specifically its proximity to the top border of the grid. Objects touching the top border are removed. Furthermore, objects directly adjacent (orthogonally) to those touching the top border are also removed. This removal seems contagious; if object A touches the top, it's removed. If object B touches A, B is removed. If object C touches B, C is removed, and so on. Objects that do not touch the top border and are not connected via a chain of adjacency to a top-border-touching object are kept.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
