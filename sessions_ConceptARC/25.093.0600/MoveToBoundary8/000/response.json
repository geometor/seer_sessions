            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing single digits. The background is predominantly '0'.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The non-zero digits seem to form distinct objects or patterns.\n    *   **train_1:** Contains a vertical line of '3's and a horizontal pattern `0 4 0 4 0 4`.\n    *   **train_2:** Contains a solid horizontal line of '2's and three scattered '8's.\n3.  **Transformations:**\n    *   **train_1:** The horizontal '4' pattern shifts horizontally to the right. The amount of shift (+4 columns) is numerically equal to the digit '4'. The vertical '3' line remains unchanged.\n    *   **train_2:** The horizontal '2' line remains unchanged. The scattered '8's disappear from their original locations and reappear in new locations, forming a diagonal pattern starting below the horizontal '2' line and centered relative to it. The number of '8's remains the same (3).\n4.  **Inferred Logic:** The transformation seems to depend on the type and arrangement of non-zero objects.\n    *   A coherent horizontal *pattern* (like the '4's) is treated as a single unit and moved horizontally by a distance equal to its constituent digit.\n    *   *Scattered* digits (like the '8's) are collected and repositioned relative to a primary *solid horizontal line* (like the '2's). Their new positions form a diagonal pattern below and centered on the line.\n    *   Other static objects (like the vertical '3' line or the horizontal '2' line) might act as anchors or remain unchanged if not directly involved in the primary transformation rule applicable to the other elements.\n\n## YAML Documentation of Facts\n\n"

If found:\n    a.  Note the pattern's structure, digit `D`, row `R_D`, start column `C_start`, and end column `C_end`.\n    b.  **Mark:** Mark the cells belonging to this HP as processed to avoid reusing them.\n    c.  **Transform:**\n        i.  Clear the original cells of the HP in the output grid (set to 0).\n        ii. Calculate the new start column: `New_C_start = C_start + D`.\n        iii. Redraw the identified pattern (preserving internal zeros) starting at `(R_D, New_C_start)` in the output grid, overwriting existing values.\n3.  **Identify Horizontal Line (HL):** Scan each row for a contiguous, solid block of a single non-zero digit `L`. If found:\n    a.  Note the digit `L`, row `R_L`, start column `C_start_L`, and end column `C_end_L`.\n    b.  **Mark:** Mark the cells belonging to this HL as processed.\n    c.  Store this HL's properties, as it might be needed as a reference. (The HL itself is typically not modified unless overwritten by a moved HP).\n4.  **Identify Scattered Digits (SD):** Scan the entire grid for any non-zero digit `D` in cells that have *not* been marked as processed (i.e., not part of an identified HP or HL).\n    a.  Group these unprocessed non-zero digits by their value `D`.\n    b.  For each group of scattered digits `D`:\n        i.  Count the number of instances, `N`.\n        ii. Record their original locations.\n        iii. **Check for Reference HL:** Determine if a relevant HL exists (typically the most prominent or only HL identified). Assume for now only one relevant HL exists for SD repositioning.\n        iv. **Transform (if HL exists):**\n            1.  Clear the original locations of these `N` scattered digits `D` in the output grid.\n            2.  Calculate the HL's center column: `Center_Col = (C_start_L + C_end_L) / 2.0`.\n            3.  Calculate the starting column for diagonal placement: `Start_Col_D = ceil(Center_Col) + floor((N-1)/2)`.\n            4.  For `i` from 0 to `N-1`:\n                *   Calculate placement row: `Place_Row = R_L + 1 + 2*i`.\n                *   Calculate placement column: `Place_Col = Start_Col_D - 2*i`.\n                *   If `(Place_Row, Place_Col)` is within grid bounds, set the output grid cell `(Place_Row, Place_Col)` to `D`.\n5.  **Finalize:** Return the modified output grid."
