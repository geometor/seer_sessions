## Perception

The task involves transforming a 2D grid containing mostly zeros and some non-zero digits (which I'll call 'blocks'). The transformation simulates a gravity effect acting vertically within each column independently. The blocks 'fall' downwards in their respective columns until they hit the bottom boundary of the grid or another block that has already settled in that column. The original values (colors) of the blocks are preserved. The final output grid shows the blocks settled at the lowest possible positions within their columns, effectively stacking them from the bottom up.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 10x10 in train_1, 9x10 in train_2)
      - elements: integers
      - background_value: 0
  - name: block
    properties:
      - type: non-zero integer element within the grid
      - value: preserved during transformation (e.g., 4 in train_1, 6 in train_2)
      - position: defined by row and column indices

relationships:
  - blocks are contained within the grid
  - blocks belong to specific columns
  - blocks can stack vertically within the same column

actions:
  - identify: locate all blocks (non-zero elements) in the input grid
  - process_columns: iterate through each column of the grid independently
  - collect_blocks: for a given column, gather all blocks present in that column from top to bottom
  - place_blocks: reposition the collected blocks within the same column in the output grid
  - placement_rule: start placing blocks from the bottom row upwards, maintaining their collected order
  - initialize_output: create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0)

constraints:
  - blocks only move vertically downwards
  - movement stops at the bottom edge of the grid
  - movement stops upon encountering another block already settled in the same column
  - the relative vertical order of blocks within a column is preserved (the block originally higher up will end up higher up after falling)
  - columns are processed independently of each other
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  **Iterate Columns:** Go through each column of the `input_grid` one by one, from left to right (index `col_idx`).
3.  **Collect Blocks:** For the current column (`col_idx`):
    a. Create an empty list to store the blocks found in this column (`column_blocks`).
    b. Scan the column from top row to bottom row (`row_idx`).
    c. If a cell `input_grid[row_idx][col_idx]` contains a non-zero value (a block), add this value to the `column_blocks` list.
4.  **Place Blocks:** For the current column (`col_idx`):
    a. Determine the number of blocks collected (`num_blocks = len(column_blocks)`).
    b. Iterate from `k = 0` up to `num_blocks - 1`.
    c. Place the `k`-th block from the `column_blocks` list into the `output_grid`. The position will be in the current column (`col_idx`) and the row index will be `(grid_height - 1 - k)`, where `grid_height` is the total number of rows in the grid. This places the blocks starting from the bottom row and stacking upwards.
5.  **Finalize:** After processing all columns, the `output_grid` contains the transformed arrangement of blocks. Return the `output_grid`.
```python
import numpy as np
import collections

    2.  **Iterate Columns:** Go through each column of the `input_grid` one by one.

        b. Collect all non-zero values (blocks) into a list, preserving their top-to-bottom order.
    4.  **Place Blocks:** For the current column:
        a. Place the collected blocks into the corresponding column of the `output_grid`, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards. The last block collected (originally lowest) goes into the bottom-most row, the second-to-last block goes into the row above that, and so on.
    5.  **Finalize:** Return the `output_grid`.
