    Applies a vertical gravity effect to non-zero elements within each column of a 2D grid.

    1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, filled entirely with zeros.
    2.  **Iterate Columns:** Go through each column of the `input_grid` one by one.
    3.  **Collect Blocks:** For the current column:
        a. Scan the column from top to bottom.
        b. Collect all non-zero values (blocks) into a list, preserving their top-to-bottom order.
    4.  **Place Blocks:** For the current column:
        a. Place the collected blocks into the corresponding column of the `output_grid`, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards. The last block collected (originally lowest) goes into the bottom-most row, the second-to-last block goes into the row above that, and so on.
    5.  **Finalize:** Return the `output_grid`.
