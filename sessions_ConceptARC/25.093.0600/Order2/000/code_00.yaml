objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 10x10 in train_1, 9x10 in train_2)
      - elements: integers
      - background_value: 0
  - name: block
    properties:
      - type: non-zero integer element within the grid
      - value: preserved during transformation (e.g., 4 in train_1, 6 in train_2)
      - position: defined by row and column indices

relationships:
  - blocks are contained within the grid
  - blocks belong to specific columns
  - blocks can stack vertically within the same column

actions:
  - identify: locate all blocks (non-zero elements) in the input grid
  - process_columns: iterate through each column of the grid independently
  - collect_blocks: for a given column, gather all blocks present in that column from top to bottom
  - place_blocks: reposition the collected blocks within the same column in the output grid
  - placement_rule: start placing blocks from the bottom row upwards, maintaining their collected order
  - initialize_output: create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background value (0)

constraints:
  - blocks only move vertically downwards
  - movement stops at the bottom edge of the grid
  - movement stops upon encountering another block already settled in the same column
  - the relative vertical order of blocks within a column is preserved (the block originally higher up will end up higher up after falling)
  - columns are processed independently of each other
