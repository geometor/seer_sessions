The transformation simulates a gravity effect acting vertically within each column independently. The blocks 'fall' downwards in their respective columns until they hit the bottom boundary of the grid or another block that has already settled in that column. The original values (colors) of the blocks are preserved. The final output grid shows the blocks settled at the lowest possible positions within their columns, effectively stacking them from the bottom up.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create an empty list to store the blocks found in this column (`column_blocks`).\n    b. Scan the column from top row to bottom row (`row_idx`).\n    c. If a cell `input_grid[row_idx][col_idx]` contains a non-zero value (a block), add this value to the `column_blocks` list.\n4.  **Place Blocks:** For the current column (`col_idx`):\n    a. Determine the number of blocks collected (`num_blocks = len(column_blocks)`).\n    b. Iterate from `k = 0` up to `num_blocks - 1`.\n    c. Place the `k`-th block from the `column_blocks` list into the `output_grid`. The position will be in the current column (`col_idx`) and the row index will be `(grid_height - 1 - k)`, where `grid_height` is the total number of rows in the grid. This places the blocks starting from the bottom row and stacking upwards.\n5.  **Finalize:** After processing all columns, the `output_grid` contains the transformed arrangement of blocks. Return the `output_grid`."
