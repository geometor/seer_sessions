task_description: Determine the length of a zero-filled output row based on the spatial distribution of non-zero elements in an input grid.

input_features:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D list of integers
    description: A grid containing non-negative integers, with 0 representing background and non-zero values representing foreground patterns.

output_features:
  - name: output_row
    type: 1D list of integers
    description: A single row grid containing only the value 0. Its length is derived from the input grid.

derived_properties:
  - name: non_zero_row_indices
    description: The set of unique row indices in the input_grid that contain at least one non-zero value.
  - name: count_non_zero_rows
    description: The number of unique rows containing non-zero values.
  - name: non_zero_col_indices
    description: The set of unique column indices in the input_grid that contain at least one non-zero value.
  - name: count_non_zero_cols
    description: The number of unique columns containing non-zero values.
  - name: derived_output_length
    description: The minimum value between count_non_zero_rows and count_non_zero_cols.

relationships:
  - property: output_row.length
    equals: derived_output_length
  - property: output_row.elements
    value: All elements are 0.

actions:
  - Identify all row indices containing non-zero elements.
  - Count the number of unique identified row indices (count_non_zero_rows).
  - Identify all column indices containing non-zero elements.
  - Count the number of unique identified column indices (count_non_zero_cols).
  - Calculate the minimum of count_non_zero_rows and count_non_zero_cols to determine the derived_output_length.
  - Construct the output_row as a list of zeros with the calculated derived_output_length.
