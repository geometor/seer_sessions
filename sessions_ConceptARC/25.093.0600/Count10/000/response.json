Within each grid, there are background cells (value 0) and foreground cells (value > 0). The non-zero values form distinct shapes or patterns. The specific non-zero value (e.g., 2, 3, 4) differs between examples but seems consistent within a single input grid's pattern.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is always a 1D array (a single row) containing only the integer 0. The length of this output row varies between examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task appears to be determining the *length* of the output row based on some property of the input grid's non-zero elements. The *content* of the output row is constant (all zeros). The specific values (2, 3, 4) and the exact shapes they form seem less important than their locations (which rows and columns they occupy). The transformation involves analyzing the spatial distribution of the non-zero elements.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
