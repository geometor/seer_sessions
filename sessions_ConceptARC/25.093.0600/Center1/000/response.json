The grids represent spatial arrangements.\n2.  **Colors/Values:** The grids use primarily 0 (representing the background) and one other non-zero digit (3 in the first example, 4 in the second) representing a shape or pattern.\n3.  **Shapes:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes within the grid. In both examples, these shapes include hollow rectangular structures.\n4.  **Hollow Spaces:** A key feature is the presence of areas filled with 0s completely enclosed by cells of a single non-zero color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core change between input and output is the filling of a single cell within a hollow space. The filled cell takes on the color of the surrounding shape.\n6.  **Target Location:** The cell chosen for filling appears to be the exact center of a specific type of hollow space \u2013 specifically, a 3x3 area where the central '0' is surrounded on all 8 sides by the same non-zero color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
