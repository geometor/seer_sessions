**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids containing numerical values. The grids represent spatial arrangements.
2.  **Colors/Values:** The grids use primarily 0 (representing the background) and one other non-zero digit (3 in the first example, 4 in the second) representing a shape or pattern.
3.  **Shapes:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes within the grid. In both examples, these shapes include hollow rectangular structures.
4.  **Hollow Spaces:** A key feature is the presence of areas filled with 0s completely enclosed by cells of a single non-zero color.
5.  **Transformation:** The core change between input and output is the filling of a single cell within a hollow space. The filled cell takes on the color of the surrounding shape.
6.  **Target Location:** The cell chosen for filling appears to be the exact center of a specific type of hollow space â€“ specifically, a 3x3 area where the central '0' is surrounded on all 8 sides by the same non-zero color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify and fill the center of 3x3 hollow squares within a grid.

grid_elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 7x7, 10x10)
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - value: integer (0 for background, non-zero for shape color)
  - object: Shape
    properties:
      - composed_of: Cells with the same non-zero value
      - structure: Can form various patterns, including hollow rectangles/squares.
  - object: HollowRegion
    properties:
      - composed_of: Cells with value 0
      - relationship: Bounded by Cells of a single non-zero color.
      - specific_type: 3x3 square (1 central '0' cell surrounded by 8 identical non-zero cells)

actions:
  - name: IdentifyHollowCenter
    input: Grid
    condition: Find a cell with value 0 whose 8 immediate neighbors (Moore neighborhood) all have the same non-zero value (C).
    output: Coordinates of the central cell and the bounding color (C).
  - name: FillCell
    input: Grid, Coordinates, Color
    effect: Creates a new grid where the cell at the specified Coordinates has its value changed to the specified Color.

transformation_rule:
  - description: The output grid is identical to the input grid, except where a 3x3 hollow square is identified.
  - detail: If a cell (R, C) has value 0 and all its 8 neighbors have the same non-zero value V, then the cell (R, C) in the output grid is set to V.
  - otherwise: All other cell values remain unchanged from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (R, C) of the input grid, excluding the border cells (as they cannot be the center of a 3x3 region).
3.  For each cell (R, C):
    a.  Check if the value of the input cell `input[R][C]` is 0.
    b.  If it is 0, examine its 8 neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood): `(R-1, C-1)`, `(R-1, C)`, `(R-1, C+1)`, `(R, C-1)`, `(R, C+1)`, `(R+1, C-1)`, `(R+1, C)`, `(R+1, C+1)`.
    c.  Determine the value of the first neighbor, `neighbor_value = input[R-1][C-1]`.
    d.  Check if `neighbor_value` is non-zero.
    e.  If `neighbor_value` is non-zero, check if all other 7 neighbors also have this same value (`neighbor_value`).
    f.  If all 8 neighbors have the identical non-zero value `neighbor_value`, then update the corresponding cell in the output grid: `output[R][C] = neighbor_value`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
