task_description: Identify and fill the center of 3x3 hollow squares within a grid.

grid_elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 7x7, 10x10)
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - value: integer (0 for background, non-zero for shape color)
  - object: Shape
    properties:
      - composed_of: Cells with the same non-zero value
      - structure: Can form various patterns, including hollow rectangles/squares.
  - object: HollowRegion
    properties:
      - composed_of: Cells with value 0
      - relationship: Bounded by Cells of a single non-zero color.
      - specific_type: 3x3 square (1 central '0' cell surrounded by 8 identical non-zero cells)

actions:
  - name: IdentifyHollowCenter
    input: Grid
    condition: Find a cell with value 0 whose 8 immediate neighbors (Moore neighborhood) all have the same non-zero value (C).
    output: Coordinates of the central cell and the bounding color (C).
  - name: FillCell
    input: Grid, Coordinates, Color
    effect: Creates a new grid where the cell at the specified Coordinates has its value changed to the specified Color.

transformation_rule:
  - description: The output grid is identical to the input grid, except where a 3x3 hollow square is identified.
  - detail: If a cell (R, C) has value 0 and all its 8 neighbors have the same non-zero value V, then the cell (R, C) in the output grid is set to V.
  - otherwise: All other cell values remain unchanged from input to output.
