            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n### Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data:** The task takes a 2D grid of integers as input and produces a smaller 2D grid of integers as output.\n2.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids in the examples are all 6x6. They contain various integer values, including 0, which seems to represent a background color. Different non-zero colors form distinct regions or scattered points.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids and are uniformly filled with a single non-zero integer value. The dimensions of the output grid vary between examples (6x2 for ex1, 3x5 for ex2, 3x5 for ex3). The fill color is present in the corresponding input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task appears to be selecting a specific non-zero color from the input grid based on some criteria related to its spatial distribution, determining the dimensions for the output grid based on that color's distribution, and then creating the output grid filled with that color.\n\n### Analysis and Hypothesis Development\n\n*   **Color Selection:** The output color doesn't seem to be simply the most frequent color, nor the color covering the largest contiguous area, nor necessarily the color most frequent on the border.\n*   **Bounding Box:** Let's consider the bounding box for each non-zero color present in the input. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all cells of that color.\n    *   Example 1: Colors 1, 2, 3. BBoxes: 3x4 (1), 2x2 (2), 6x2 (3). Output: 6x2 filled with 3.\n    *   Example 2: Colors 4, 6, 7. BBoxes: 5x3 (4), 3x5 (6), 3x3 (7). Output: 3x5 filled with 6.\n    *   Example 3: Colors 7, 8, 2. BBoxes: 3x5 (7), 3x3 (8), 3x3 (2). Output: 3x5 filled with 7.\n*   **Selection Criterion:** A potential criterion for selecting the target color and its corresponding bounding box is the perimeter of the bounding box (Perimeter = 2 * (Height + Width)).\n    *   Example 1: Perimeters: 14 (1), 8 (2), 16 (3). Max perimeter is 16 (Color 3). This matches the output color and dimensions (6x2).\n    *   Example 2: Perimeters: 16 (4), 16 (6), 12 (7). Max perimeter is 16 (Colors 4 and 6). The output uses Color 6. If there's a tie in perimeter, perhaps the *largest* color value is chosen. (6 > 4). This matches the output color and dimensions (3x5).\n    *   Example 3: Perimeters: 16 (7), 12 (8), 12 (2). Max perimeter is 16 (Color 7). This matches the output color and dimensions (3x5).\n\n*   **Consistent Rule:** The rule seems to be: find the non-zero color whose bounding box has the largest perimeter. In case of a tie in perimeter, choose the color with the largest numerical value. The output grid takes the dimensions of this chosen bounding box and is filled with the chosen color.\n\n### YAML Facts\n\n"
