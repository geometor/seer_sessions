Task: Grid Transformation based on Color Distribution Analysis

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Element: Integer (Color ID)
  Properties:
    - Grid Dimensions (Height, Width)
    - Cell Value (Color)
    - Cell Position (Row, Column)

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Element: Integer (Color ID)
  Properties:
    - Grid Dimensions (Height, Width) derived from input
    - Uniform Fill Value (Single Color ID) derived from input

Core Objects and Concepts:
  - Color: Non-zero integers in the input grid.
  - Cell: Individual element in the grid with a position and color.
  - Bounding Box (BBox): The minimum enclosing rectangle for all cells of a specific color.
    - Properties: Min Row, Max Row, Min Col, Max Col, Height, Width, Perimeter (2*(Height+Width)).
  - Target Color: The specific non-zero color selected based on BBox properties.
  - Target BBox: The BBox corresponding to the Target Color.

Relationships and Actions:
  - Identification: Find all unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
  - Calculation (for each non-zero color):
    - Find all cell positions containing the color.
    - Determine the BBox (min/max row/col).
    - Calculate BBox Height, Width, and Perimeter.
  - Selection (finding the Target Color):
    - Compare Perimeters of all non-zero color BBoxes.
    - Select the color(s) with the maximum Perimeter.
    - If multiple colors tie for maximum Perimeter, select the one with the largest numerical color value.
  - Construction (Output Grid):
    - Get the Height and Width from the Target BBox.
    - Create a new grid with these dimensions.
    - Fill the new grid uniformly with the Target Color.
