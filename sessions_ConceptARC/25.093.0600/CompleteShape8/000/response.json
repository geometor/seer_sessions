            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 10x10 grids containing single digits (0-9).\n2.  **Colors/Objects:** Non-zero digits represent distinct \"colors\" or object types. The digit '0' represents the background.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the patterns and positions of the non-zero digits.\n4.  **Observed Actions (train_1):**\n    *   The '5' colored pixels disappear entirely.\n    *   The scattered '4' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '4's.\n    *   The scattered '6' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '6's.\n5.  **Observed Actions (train_2):**\n    *   The '5' colored pixels disappear entirely.\n    *   The scattered '7' colored pixels transform into a different, more complex shape made of '7's.\n    *   The scattered '6' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '6's.\n6.  **Key Pattern:** A specific color ('5') seems to be consistently removed. Other colors seem to expand or change shape based on their initial configuration, often forming a 3x3 square.\n7.  **Location Calculation:** The position of the resulting 3x3 squares appears related to the center of the original pixels of that color. Specifically, calculating the bounding box of the original pixels and finding its center seems crucial.\n\n**Analysis of the 3x3 Square Formation:**\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that non-'5' colors form a 3x3 square centered around the center of their bounding box in the input.\n\n*   **Center Calculation:** `center_row = (min_row + max_row) // 2`, `center_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`\n*   **Square Definition:** Rows `center_row-1` to `center_row+1`, Cols `center_col-1` to `center_col+1`.\n\n*   **train_1, color 4:** Points (1,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). BBox (rows 1-3, cols 3-5). Center = ( (1+3)//2, (3+5)//2 ) = (2, 4). 3x3 square = rows 1-3, cols 3-5. **Matches output.**\n*   **train_1, color 6:** Points (6,4), (6,5), (8,6). BBox (rows 6-8, cols 4-6). Center = ( (6+8)//2, (4+6)//2 ) = (7, 5). 3x3 square = rows 6-8, cols 4-6. **Matches output.**\n*   **train_2, color 6:** Points (4,6), (6,4). BBox (rows 4-6, cols 4-6). Center = ( (4+6)//2, (4+6)//2 ) = (5, 5). 3x3 square = rows 4-6, cols 4-6. **Matches output.**\n*   **train_2, color 7:** Points (2,1), (3,2), (2,3). BBox (rows 2-3, cols 1-3). Center = ( (2+3)//2, (1+3)//2 ) = (2, 2). 3x3 square = rows 1-3, cols 1-3. **Does NOT match output.** The output for '7' is a different shape within rows 2-4, cols 1-3.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation rule appears to involve filtering out color '5' and replacing other color groups with a 3x3 square centered on their bounding box center (using integer division). However, there is an inconsistency with color '7' in the second example, which results in a different shape. The 3x3 rule is the most consistent pattern observed across the majority of cases.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
