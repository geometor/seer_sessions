Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 10x10
    cells:
      type: array
      items:
        type: integer
        description: 0 represents background, 1-9 represent distinct colors/objects.

Objects:
  type: concept
  description: Groups of connected or scattered cells of the same non-zero color in the input grid.

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  steps:
    - Identify unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
    - Filter/Remove one specific color (color '5' in examples) from consideration for the output.
    - For each remaining unique color:
        - Locate all cells containing this color in the input.
        - Determine the bounding box (min/max row and column) encompassing these cells.
        - Calculate the central point of the bounding box.
        - Generate a new shape (typically a 3x3 square) centered at this point.
        - Place this new shape, filled with the corresponding color, onto the output grid.
  relationships:
    - The output shape for a color depends on the spatial distribution (bounding box, center) of its corresponding input cells.
    - One specific color ('5') is consistently ignored/deleted.
    - The output grid is initially empty (all zeros) before the generated shapes are placed.
