Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 10x10 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Colors/Objects:** Non-zero digits represent distinct "colors" or object types. The digit '0' represents the background.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the patterns and positions of the non-zero digits.
4.  **Observed Actions (train_1):**
    *   The '5' colored pixels disappear entirely.
    *   The scattered '4' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '4's.
    *   The scattered '6' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '6's.
5.  **Observed Actions (train_2):**
    *   The '5' colored pixels disappear entirely.
    *   The scattered '7' colored pixels transform into a different, more complex shape made of '7's.
    *   The scattered '6' colored pixels coalesce into a solid 3x3 square of '6's.
6.  **Key Pattern:** A specific color ('5') seems to be consistently removed. Other colors seem to expand or change shape based on their initial configuration, often forming a 3x3 square.
7.  **Location Calculation:** The position of the resulting 3x3 squares appears related to the center of the original pixels of that color. Specifically, calculating the bounding box of the original pixels and finding its center seems crucial.

**Analysis of the 3x3 Square Formation:**

Let's test the hypothesis that non-'5' colors form a 3x3 square centered around the center of their bounding box in the input.

*   **Center Calculation:** `center_row = (min_row + max_row) // 2`, `center_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`
*   **Square Definition:** Rows `center_row-1` to `center_row+1`, Cols `center_col-1` to `center_col+1`.

*   **train_1, color 4:** Points (1,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). BBox (rows 1-3, cols 3-5). Center = ( (1+3)//2, (3+5)//2 ) = (2, 4). 3x3 square = rows 1-3, cols 3-5. **Matches output.**
*   **train_1, color 6:** Points (6,4), (6,5), (8,6). BBox (rows 6-8, cols 4-6). Center = ( (6+8)//2, (4+6)//2 ) = (7, 5). 3x3 square = rows 6-8, cols 4-6. **Matches output.**
*   **train_2, color 6:** Points (4,6), (6,4). BBox (rows 4-6, cols 4-6). Center = ( (4+6)//2, (4+6)//2 ) = (5, 5). 3x3 square = rows 4-6, cols 4-6. **Matches output.**
*   **train_2, color 7:** Points (2,1), (3,2), (2,3). BBox (rows 2-3, cols 1-3). Center = ( (2+3)//2, (1+3)//2 ) = (2, 2). 3x3 square = rows 1-3, cols 1-3. **Does NOT match output.** The output for '7' is a different shape within rows 2-4, cols 1-3.

**Conclusion:** The transformation rule appears to involve filtering out color '5' and replacing other color groups with a 3x3 square centered on their bounding box center (using integer division). However, there is an inconsistency with color '7' in the second example, which results in a different shape. The 3x3 rule is the most consistent pattern observed across the majority of cases.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    size: 10x10
    cells:
      type: array
      items:
        type: integer
        description: 0 represents background, 1-9 represent distinct colors/objects.

Objects:
  type: concept
  description: Groups of connected or scattered cells of the same non-zero color in the input grid.

Transformation:
  type: action
  description: Modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.
  steps:
    - Identify unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
    - Filter/Remove one specific color (color '5' in examples) from consideration for the output.
    - For each remaining unique color:
        - Locate all cells containing this color in the input.
        - Determine the bounding box (min/max row and column) encompassing these cells.
        - Calculate the central point of the bounding box.
        - Generate a new shape (typically a 3x3 square) centered at this point.
        - Place this new shape, filled with the corresponding color, onto the output grid.
  relationships:
    - The output shape for a color depends on the spatial distribution (bounding box, center) of its corresponding input cells.
    - One specific color ('5') is consistently ignored/deleted.
    - The output grid is initially empty (all zeros) before the generated shapes are placed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new empty 10x10 output grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Find all unique non-zero integer values (colors) present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique color found, excluding the color '5':
    a.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all cells in the input grid that contain this color.
    b.  If no cells are found for this color, continue to the next color.
    c.  Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among these coordinates (this defines the bounding box).
    d.  Calculate the center row index: `center_r = (min_r + max_r) // 2`.
    e.  Calculate the center column index: `center_c = (min_c + max_c) // 2`.
    f.  Iterate through the rows from `center_r - 1` to `center_r + 1`.
    g.  For each row index `r` in this range, iterate through the columns from `center_c - 1` to `center_c + 1`.
    h.  For each column index `c` in this range:
        i.  Check if the coordinate (`r`, `c`) is within the bounds of the 10x10 grid (0 <= r < 10 and 0 <= c < 10).
        j.  If it is within bounds, set the value of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to the current color.
4.  Return the final output grid.
