Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (rows, columns)
    - contains Cells
Cell:
  Properties:
    - coordinates (row, column)
    - value (integer)
SourceCell:
  Inherits: Cell
  Properties:
    - value is non-zero
Relationship:
  - Below: Cell A is below Cell B if A.row > B.row
  - LeftOf: Cell A is left of Cell B if A.column < B.column
  - RightOf: Cell A is right of Cell B if A.column > B.column
  - SameColumn: Cell A is in the same column as Cell B if A.column == B.column
PatternDirection:
  Values:
    - DownRight (source cells trend: row increases, column increases)
    - DownLeft (source cells trend: row increases, column decreases)
    - DownVertical (source cells trend: row increases, column stays same) # Hypothetical
Action:
  - FillCell: Set the value of an output grid cell.
TransformationRule:
  - Identify all SourceCells in the input grid.
  - Determine the PatternDirection from the SourceCells' coordinates.
  - Create an output grid initialized with zeros.
  - For each cell (r, c) in the output grid:
    - Check if there exists any SourceCell (r_s, c_s) with value 'v' such that:
      - r >= r_s (cell is below or in the same row as the source)
      - AND a horizontal condition based on PatternDirection is met:
        - If PatternDirection is DownRight: c <= c_s
        - If PatternDirection is DownLeft: c >= c_s
        - If PatternDirection is DownVertical: c == c_s # Assumed
    - If such a SourceCell exists, FillCell(output[r][c], v).
