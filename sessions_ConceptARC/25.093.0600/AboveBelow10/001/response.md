"""
Transforms an input grid based on the pattern of non-zero 'source' cells.

1. Initializes an output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
2. Identifies all 'source cells' (non-zero value) in the input grid, recording their row, column, and value. Assumes a single unique non-zero value exists.
3. Determines the directional trend ('DownRight', 'DownLeft', 'DownVertical') of the source cells by comparing the coordinates of the first two source cells when sorted by row. Defaults to 'DownVertical' if fewer than two source cells exist.
4. Iterates through each cell (r, c) of the output grid.
5. For each output cell (r, c), it checks if there exists any source cell (r_s, c_s) satisfying a condition based on the determined trend:
    - DownRight: r >= r_s AND c <= c_s
    - DownLeft: r >= r_s AND c >= c_s
    - DownVertical: r >= r_s AND c == c_s
6. If such a source cell exists, the output cell output[r][c] is set to the source value.
7. Returns the completed output grid.
