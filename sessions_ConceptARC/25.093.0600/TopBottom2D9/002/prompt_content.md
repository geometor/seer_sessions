"""
1. Identify all distinct groups of connected cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 
   in the input grid that share the same non-zero digit value.
2. Discard any identified groups that consist of only one cell.
3. If no groups remain after discarding single-cell groups, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
4. If groups remain, determine the top-most, left-most cell coordinate (anchor) for each group.
5. Select the group whose anchor cell has the smallest row index. If multiple groups share the same 
   smallest row index, select the one among them whose anchor cell has the smallest column index. 
   This is the target group.
6. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
7. Modify the output grid by changing the value of every cell belonging to the target group to 5.
8. Return the modified grid.
