            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding Python code correctly identified connected blocks (including diagonals) and applied the transformation to change block values to 5. However, the rule for selecting *which* block to modify was incorrect, leading to failures in `train_2` and `test_1`.\n\nThe failures occurred in cases where multiple blocks shared the same minimum anchor row index. The original tie-breaking rule (minimum anchor column index) worked for some examples (`train_1`, `train_3`, `train_4`, `test_2`, `test_3`) but not others (`train_2`, `test_1`).\n\nAnalysis revealed a more complex, multi-stage selection process:\n1.  Prioritize blocks with the minimum anchor row index.\n2.  Among those, prioritize blocks with the minimum size.\n3.  If a tie still exists (same minimum row, same minimum size), use the maximum anchor column index as the final tie-breaker.\n\nThis revised logic successfully explains the expected output for all provided training and testing examples.\n\nThe strategy is to update the natural language program and the `select_target_block` action description to reflect this refined multi-stage selection criterion. The underlying block identification logic remains the same.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's re-verify the key properties (anchor, size) of the relevant blocks for each example, focusing on the selection process.\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Blocks ('1', size>1): Anchor (0,0) size 6; Anchor (2,0) size 6; Anchor (4,0) size 6.\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,0) size 6}.\n    *   Selection: (0,0). Correct.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Blocks ('2', size>1): Anchor (0,0) size 6; Anchor (0,3) size 6.\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,0) size 6, (0,3) size 6}.\n    *   Min size among candidates: 6. Candidates: {(0,0) size 6, (0,3) size 6}.\n    *   Max anchor col among tied candidates: 3. Selection: (0,3). Correct.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Blocks ('4', size>1): Anchor (0,1) size 3; Anchor (0,3) size 18.\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,1) size 3, (0,3) size 18}.\n    *   Min size among candidates: 3. Candidates: {(0,1) size 3}.\n    *   Selection: (0,1). Correct.\n*   **train_4:**\n    *   Blocks ('8', size>1): Anchor (0,1) size 7; Anchor (1,0) size 2; Anchor (2,3) size 3; ...\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,1) size 7}.\n    *   Selection: (0,1). Correct.\n*   **test_1:**\n    *   Blocks ('9', size>1): Anchor (0,0) size 10; Anchor (0,3) size 10.\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,0) size 10, (0,3) size 10}.\n    *   Min size among candidates: 10. Candidates: {(0,0) size 10, (0,3) size 10}.\n    *   Max anchor col among tied candidates: 3. Selection: (0,3). Correct.\n*   **test_2:**\n    *   Blocks ('7', size>1): Anchor (0,3) size 7; Anchor (3,2) size 4; Anchor (4,0) size 3; ...\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,3) size 7}.\n    *   Selection: (0,3). Correct.\n*   **test_3:**\n    *   Blocks (size>1): Anchor (0,2) val 3 size 4; Anchor (0,4) val 5 size 8; Anchor (0,5) val 8 size 11.\n    *   Min anchor row: 0. Candidates: {(0,2) size 4, (0,4) size 8, (0,5) size 11}.\n    *   Min size among candidates: 4. Candidates: {(0,2) size 4}.\n    *   Selection: (0,2). Correct.\n\nThe analysis confirms the proposed selection logic works for all cases.\n\n**Updated Facts**\n\n"
