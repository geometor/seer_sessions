objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - contains: Cells
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - row_index: integer (0-5)
      - column_index: integer (0-5)
      - value: integer (0-9)
  - name: Block
    properties:
      - type: connected component of Cells
      - connection_rule: adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
      - cell_value: common non-zero integer for all cells in the block
      - size: count of cells in the block (> 1)
      - anchor: coordinates (row, col) of the top-most, then left-most cell in the block

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are positioned within the Grid.
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells with the same non-zero value can be connected to form a Block.
  - type: selection_priority
    description: >
      Blocks are compared for selection based on a hierarchy:
      1. Minimum anchor row index.
      2. Minimum block size (among those tied for minimum anchor row).
      3. Maximum anchor column index (among those tied for minimum anchor row and minimum size).

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: >
      Scan the input Grid to find all distinct Blocks of connected non-zero cells.
      Calculate size and anchor (min_row, min_col) for each block.
    inputs: Grid
    outputs: list of Blocks
  - name: filter_blocks_by_size
    description: Remove Blocks with size less than or equal to 1.
    inputs: list of Blocks
    outputs: filtered list of Blocks
  - name: select_target_block
    description: >
      From the filtered list of Blocks (size > 1), select a single target Block using a
      hierarchical comparison:
      1. Find the minimum anchor row index among all blocks.
      2. Filter the list to include only blocks with this minimum anchor row index.
      3. If only one block remains, it is the target.
      4. If multiple blocks remain, find the minimum block size among them.
      5. Filter the current list to include only blocks with this minimum size.
      6. If only one block remains, it is the target.
      7. If multiple blocks still remain (tied on min row and min size), find the maximum
         anchor column index among them.
      8. The block with this maximum anchor column index is the target.
    inputs: filtered list of Blocks
    outputs: target Block (or none if the filtered list was initially empty)
  - name: modify_grid
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input Grid. If a target Block was selected,
      change the value of all cells corresponding to the target Block to 5 in the copied grid.
      Otherwise, return the copied grid unchanged.
    inputs: input Grid, target Block (optional)
    outputs: output Grid
