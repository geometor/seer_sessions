Identify all distinct groups (blocks) of connected cells in the input grid \n   that share the same non-zero digit value. Connectivity includes cells \n   touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way connectivity).\n2. For each identified block, determine its size (number of cells) and its \n   anchor (the coordinates of the top-most, left-most cell within the block).\n3. Discard any blocks with a size of 1.\n4. If no blocks remain after discarding single-cell blocks, the output grid \n   is identical to the input grid.\n5. If blocks remain, select the target block using the following hierarchical criteria:\n    a. Find the minimum anchor row index among all remaining blocks. Consider \n       only blocks having this minimum row index for the next steps.\n    b. Among these selected blocks, find the minimum block size. Consider only \n       blocks having this minimum size for the next step.\n    c. If only one block remains, it is the target block.\n    d. If multiple blocks still remain (i.e., they are tied on minimum anchor \n       row and minimum size), select the one whose anchor has the maximum \n       column index. This is the target block.\n6. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n7. Modify the output grid by changing the value of every cell belonging to the \n   selected target block to 5.\n8.
