objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - contains: Cells
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - row_index: integer (0-5)
      - column_index: integer (0-5)
      - value: integer (0-9)
  - name: Block
    properties:
      - type: connected component of Cells
      - connection_rule: adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
      - cell_value: common non-zero integer for all cells in the block
      - size: count of cells in the block
      - top_left_anchor: coordinates (row, col) of the highest, then leftmost cell in the block

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are positioned within the Grid.
  - type: connectivity
    description: Cells with the same non-zero value can be connected to form a Block.
  - type: selection
    description: Blocks are compared based on size (>1) and the position of their top_left_anchor to select one target Block for modification.

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input Grid to find all distinct Blocks of connected non-zero cells.
    inputs: Grid
    outputs: list of Blocks
  - name: filter_blocks
    description: Remove Blocks with size less than or equal to 1.
    inputs: list of Blocks
    outputs: filtered list of Blocks
  - name: find_top_left_anchors
    description: For each Block, determine its top_left_anchor coordinates.
    inputs: list of Blocks
    outputs: list of Blocks with anchors identified
  - name: select_target_block
    description: >
      From the filtered list of Blocks, select the one whose top_left_anchor
      has the minimum row index, breaking ties by selecting the minimum column index.
    inputs: filtered list of Blocks with anchors
    outputs: target Block (or none if list is empty)
  - name: modify_grid
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input Grid. If a target Block was selected,
      change the value of all cells corresponding to the target Block to 5 in the copied grid.
    inputs: input Grid, target Block (optional)
    outputs: output Grid
