The transformation specifically targets a single connected region (block) of identical non-zero digits within the input grid and changes the digits within that selected block to the value 5. The selection of which block to modify follows specific criteria based on block size and position. Connectivity between cells includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency. Cells with the value 0 are treated as background and do not form blocks, nor do they participate in the connectivity of non-zero blocks.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
