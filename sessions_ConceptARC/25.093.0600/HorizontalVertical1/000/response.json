            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of integers, representing colored pixels. 0 typically represents the background color.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves filling specific areas within the grid. These areas are initially color 0 (background).\n3.  **Shapes:** The non-zero colors form distinct shapes or boundaries in the grid.\n4.  **Enclosed Areas:** The transformation targets areas of color 0 that are completely surrounded or enclosed by a single, uniform non-zero color. These enclosed areas do not touch the boundary of the grid.\n5.  **Filling:** Enclosed areas identified in step 4 are filled with a new color in the output grid.\n6.  **Fill Colors:** The colors used for filling seem to be consistently 3 and 7 across the examples.\n7.  **Fill Color Determination:** The specific fill color (3 or 7) used for an enclosed area depends on the color of the shape enclosing it *and* the overall set of non-zero colors present in the entire input grid. The rule seems to change based on how many distinct non-zero colors are present.\n    *   If only two non-zero colors exist (e.g., {2, 4} in `train_1`), the lower color (2) encloses areas filled with 3, and the higher color (4) encloses areas filled with 7.\n    *   If three non-zero colors exist (e.g., {2, 4, 7} in `train_2`), the lowest color (2) encloses areas filled with 7, the middle color (4) encloses areas filled with 3, and the highest color (7) also encloses areas filled with 3.\n8.  **Integrity:** The original shapes (non-zero colors) and the background cells not part of an enclosed area remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Keep track of visited background cells to avoid redundant checks (e.g., using a boolean grid `visited_zeros`).\n    b.  Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.\n    c.  If `input[r][c]` is 0 and `visited_zeros[r][c]` is false:\n        i.   Start a search (like BFS) from `(r, c)` to find all connected background cells forming a potential region.\n        ii.  During the search, record all cells belonging to this region (`region_cells`), check if any cell touches the grid boundary (`touches_boundary`), and collect all unique non-zero colors adjacent to any cell in the region (`adjacent_colors`). Mark visited background cells in `visited_zeros`.\n        iii. After the search for this connected component is complete: If `touches_boundary` is false and `adjacent_colors` contains exactly one color `b`, then `region_cells` represents an enclosed region.\n        iv.  Retrieve the appropriate fill color `f = color_to_fill[b]`.\n        v.   For every cell `(rr, cc)` in `region_cells`, update the output grid: `output[rr][cc] = f`.\n5.  **Return Result:** Return the modified output grid."
