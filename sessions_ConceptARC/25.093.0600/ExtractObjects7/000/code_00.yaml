Task: Grid Transformation by Region Extraction and Combination

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Elements:
    - Object: Background
      Digit: 0
    - Object: Region
      Properties:
        - Value: Non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
        - Shape: Contiguous area of the same digit
        - Position: Coordinates within the grid
    - Object: Separator
      Inherits: Region
      Properties:
        - Shape: Straight line (horizontal or vertical)
        - Function: Divides other non-zero regions
        - Orientation: (Vertical | Horizontal)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Content: A combination of selected input regions, excluding the separator and background.

Actions:
  1. Identify_Regions: Detect all contiguous non-zero regions in the input grid.
  2. Identify_Separator: Find a region that forms a straight line (horizontal or vertical) and separates other major non-zero regions. Determine its orientation.
  3. Select_Adjacent_Regions: Identify the non-zero regions directly adjacent to the separator (e.g., left/right for vertical, top/bottom for horizontal).
  4. Extract_Regions: Isolate the selected adjacent regions, typically within their minimal bounding boxes.
  5. Combine_Regions:
      - If Separator Orientation is Vertical: Concatenate extracted regions horizontally (left region then right region).
      - If Separator Orientation is Horizontal: Concatenate extracted regions vertically (top region then bottom region).
  6. Filter: Exclude the separator region and background ('0') from the final output.

Relationships:
  - Regions are separated_by the Separator in the input.
  - Extracted Regions are adjacent in the output.
  - Output grid dimensions depend on the combined size of the extracted regions.
