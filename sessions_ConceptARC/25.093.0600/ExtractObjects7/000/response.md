Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are grids of single digits.
2.  **Colors/Digits:** Various digits (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6) appear in the grids. '0' seems to represent a background color.
3.  **Objects:** The non-zero digits form distinct contiguous regions or shapes within the grid.
4.  **Separators:** Certain digits/shapes appear to act as separators between other shapes.
    *   In `train_1`, the vertical line of '3's separates the '1' region from the '4' region.
    *   In `train_2`, the horizontal lines of '6's separate the '3' diamond pattern from the '5' rectangular block.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve:
    *   Identifying key regions/shapes.
    *   Identifying a separator element (line).
    *   Removing the separator element and the background ('0').
    *   Extracting the shapes adjacent to the separator.
    *   Combining the extracted shapes into a new, smaller grid. The combination method (horizontal or vertical) depends on the orientation of the separator.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation by Region Extraction and Combination

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Elements:
    - Object: Background
      Digit: 0
    - Object: Region
      Properties:
        - Value: Non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
        - Shape: Contiguous area of the same digit
        - Position: Coordinates within the grid
    - Object: Separator
      Inherits: Region
      Properties:
        - Shape: Straight line (horizontal or vertical)
        - Function: Divides other non-zero regions
        - Orientation: (Vertical | Horizontal)

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Content: A combination of selected input regions, excluding the separator and background.

Actions:
  1. Identify_Regions: Detect all contiguous non-zero regions in the input grid.
  2. Identify_Separator: Find a region that forms a straight line (horizontal or vertical) and separates other major non-zero regions. Determine its orientation.
  3. Select_Adjacent_Regions: Identify the non-zero regions directly adjacent to the separator (e.g., left/right for vertical, top/bottom for horizontal).
  4. Extract_Regions: Isolate the selected adjacent regions, typically within their minimal bounding boxes.
  5. Combine_Regions:
      - If Separator Orientation is Vertical: Concatenate extracted regions horizontally (left region then right region).
      - If Separator Orientation is Horizontal: Concatenate extracted regions vertically (top region then bottom region).
  6. Filter: Exclude the separator region and background ('0') from the final output.

Relationships:
  - Regions are separated_by the Separator in the input.
  - Extracted Regions are adjacent in the output.
  - Output grid dimensions depend on the combined size of the extracted regions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze** the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous regions of non-zero digits. Also, note the background digit ('0').
2.  **Identify** a "separator" region. This region will consist of a single repeated digit forming a straight line (either fully vertical or fully horizontal) that effectively divides the grid and separates other significant non-zero regions. Note the orientation (vertical or horizontal) of this separator line.
3.  **Select** the primary non-zero regions that are located immediately adjacent to the identified separator line.
    *   If the separator is vertical, select the region(s) to its immediate left and the region(s) to its immediate right.
    *   If the separator is horizontal, select the region(s) immediately above it and the region(s) immediately below it.
4.  **Extract** the content of these selected adjacent regions, preserving their internal structure and relative shapes, typically within their minimal bounding boxes.
5.  **Combine** the extracted regions into a new output grid, removing the original separator and background elements:
    *   If the separator was vertical, place the extracted left region(s) on the left and the extracted right region(s) on the right, adjacent to each other (horizontal concatenation).
    *   If the separator was horizontal, place the extracted top region(s) at the top and the extracted bottom region(s) at the bottom, adjacent to each other (vertical concatenation).
6.  The final **output** is this newly constructed grid containing only the combined adjacent regions.
