'0' seems to represent a background color.\n3.  **Objects:** The non-zero digits form distinct contiguous regions or shapes within the grid.\n4.  **Separators:** Certain digits/shapes appear to act as separators between other shapes.\n    *   In `train_1`, the vertical line of '3's separates the '1' region from the '4' region.\n    *   In `train_2`, the horizontal lines of '6's separate the '3' diamond pattern from the '5' rectangular block.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve:\n    *   Identifying key regions/shapes.\n    *   Identifying a separator element (line).\n    *   Removing the separator element and the background ('0').\n    *   Extracting the shapes adjacent to the separator.\n    *   Combining the extracted shapes into a new, smaller grid. The combination method (horizontal or vertical) depends on the orientation of the separator.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
