*   **Perception:** The task operates on 10x10 grids containing primarily digits 0, 2, and 4. The input grids usually feature multiple instances of the digit 2 and a single instance of the digit 4. The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a conditional rule involving the spatial relationship between the digit 4 and any adjacent digits 2. Specifically, the transformation depends on whether the cell containing the digit 4 has any neighbouring cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that contain the digit 2. If such a neighbour exists, the digit 4 is preserved in the output, and all instances of the digit 2 in the grid are changed to 0. Conversely, if the digit 4 has no adjacent neighbours with the digit 2, then all instances of the digit 2 are preserved in the output, and the digit 4 is changed to 0.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - grid:
          description: A 10x10 matrix of integers.
          properties:
            - dimensions: [10, 10]
            - cells: Contains integer values, primarily 0, 2, and 4.
      - cell:
          description: A single element within the grid.
          properties:
            - position: (row, column) coordinates.
            - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
      - target_digit_4:
          description: The cell containing the value 4. Assumed unique per input grid.
          properties:
            - value: 4
            - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
      - neighbor_digit_2:
          description: Cells containing the value 2.
          properties:
            - value: 2
            - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
    relationships:
      - adjacency:
          description: The spatial relationship between the cell containing 4 and its 8 immediate neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
          condition: Check if any neighbour of the cell with value 4 contains the value 2.
    actions:
      - find_digit_4: Locate the coordinates of the cell containing 4.
      - check_neighbors: Examine the 8 neighbours of the cell containing 4 for the presence of the value 2.
      - conditional_replacement:
          if: A neighbour contains 2.
          then: Keep the value 4 at its position, replace all values 2 in the entire grid with 0.
          else: Replace the value 4 with 0, keep all values 2 at their positions.
      - copy_zeros: All cells with value 0 remain 0.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find the coordinates (row `r4`, column `c4`) of the cell containing the value 4 in the input grid.
    3.  Check the 8 neighbouring cells surrounding (`r4`, `c4`). Determine if any of these neighbours contain the value 2.
    4.  **Condition 1:** If at least one neighbour contains the value 2:
        *   Iterate through all cells in the output grid.
        *   If a cell contains the value 2, change its value to 0.
        *   The cell at (`r4`, `c4`) retains its value 4.
    5.  **Condition 2:** If none of the neighbours contain the value 2:
        *   Change the value of the cell at (`r4`, `c4`) in the output grid to 0.
        *   All cells originally containing 2 retain their value 2.
    6.  All cells originally containing 0 retain their value 0 in both conditions.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis based on the first training example led to a hypothesis about the transformation rule: the fate of the digit `4` and all digits `2` depends on whether the `4` has any immediate neighbours (Moore neighbourhood) with the value `2`. The provided Python code implements this logic.

Testing this code against the full set of examples reveals:
1.  The code correctly predicts the output for `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, `test_1`, `test_2`, and `test_3`.
2.  The code's output matches the logic derived but *differs* from the `Expected Output` for `train_3`.
3.  The `Transformed Output` shown in the execution report for `test_2` was incorrect according to the code's logic and the `Expected Output`; however, the code's logic *does* produce the `Expected Output` for `test_2` based on its input (no `2` neighbours for `4`).

**Conclusion:** The implemented rule ("If `4` has a `2` neighbour, keep `4` & zero `2`s; otherwise zero `4` & keep `2`s") holds true for 6 out of 7 examples. `train_3` appears to be an exception where the `Expected Output` follows the *opposite* outcome (keeps `4`, zeros `2`s despite `4` having no `2` neighbours).

**Strategy:** Maintain the current transformation logic as it explains the vast majority of cases. Document the rule clearly and note the inconsistency observed in `train_3`'s expected output. The provided Python code seems correct based on this prevalent rule.

**Metrics**

Based on code execution to verify neighbour conditions:

**Revised Metrics Analysis:**

The code execution confirms the neighbour check status and compares the rule's prediction (`rule_predicts_keep_4`) with the actual outcome in the original `Expected Output` (`expected_keeps_4`).

*   `train_1`: Match (Neighbour=True, Keep 4=True)
*   `train_2`: Match (Neighbour=False, Keep 4=False)
*   `train_3`: **Mismatch** (Neighbour=False, Rule Predicts Keep 4=False, Expected Keeps 4=True)
*   `train_4`: Match (Neighbour=False, Keep 4=False)
*   `test_1`: Match (Neighbour=False, Keep 4=False)
*   `test_2`: **Mismatch** (Neighbour=False, Rule Predicts Keep 4=False, Expected Keeps 4=True)
*   `test_3`: Match (Neighbour=False, Keep 4=False)

**Refined Conclusion:** The neighbour-based rule fails for **Train Example 3** AND **Test Example 2**. In both failing cases, the `4` has *no* `2` neighbours, but the expected output *keeps* the `4` and zeros the `2`s, contrary to the rule observed in the other 5 examples.

There must be another condition. What is common to Train 3 and Test 2?
*   Train 3: `4` at (5, 5). No `2` neighbours. Kept `4`.
*   Test 2: `4` at (4, 5). No `2` neighbours. Kept `4`.
*   Compare with cases where `4` had no `2` neighbours but was zeroed:
    *   Train 2: `4` at (1, 9). Zeroed `4`.
    *   Train 4: `4` at (6, 6). Zeroed `4`.
    *   Test 1: `4` at (7, 4). Zeroed `4`.
    *   Test 3: `4` at (0, 9). Zeroed `4`.

Is there something about the position of `4` or the distribution of `2`s in Train 3 / Test 2?
Let's reconsider the "Any `2` has `4` as neighbour" hypothesis.
*   Train 3: `4` at (5,5). `2`s at (2,4), (3,6), (4,2), (5,8), (6,0), (7,2), (7,6), (9,4). Manual check earlier showed none have (5,5) as neighbour.
*   Test 2: `4` at (4,5). `2`s at (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (3,3), (3,8), (5,3), (5,8), (7,3), (7,5), (7,7).
    *   Check neighbours of each `2` for (4,5):
        *   (1,4): N include (2,x). No.
        *   (1,6): N include (2,x). No.
        *   (1,8): N include (2,x). No.
        *   (3,3): N include (4,4). No.
        *   (3,8): N include (4,x). No.
        *   (5,3): N include (4,4). No.
        *   (5,8): N include (4,x). No.
        *   (7,3): N include (6,x). No.
        *   (7,5): N include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). No.
        *   (7,7): N include (6,x). No.
    *   This hypothesis still doesn't explain Train 3 and Test 2.

What if the rule involves comparing the number of `2`s that are neighbours vs not neighbours? Or something about the global pattern of `2`s?

Let's stick to the simplest rule that explains the most cases. The neighbour rule works for 5/7. The inconsistencies in Train 3 and Test 2 remain unexplained by simple local rules. It's possible they represent a different condition or are errors in the dataset.

**Final Decision:** Proceed with the "neighbour" rule, acknowledging the two exceptions.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 10x10 matrix of integers.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [10, 10]
        - cells: Contains integer values, primarily 0, 2, and 4. Assumed one '4'.
  - cell:
      description: A single element within the grid.
      properties:
        - position: (row, column) coordinates.
        - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
  - target_digit_4:
      description: The unique cell containing the value 4.
      properties:
        - value: 4
        - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
  - digit_2:
      description: Any cell containing the value 2.
      properties:
        - value: 2
        - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
relationships:
  - adjacency:
      description: The spatial relationship between the cell containing 4 and its 8 immediate neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal - Moore neighbourhood).
      condition: Check if any neighbour of the cell with value 4 contains the value 2.
actions:
  - find_digit_4: Locate the coordinates of the cell containing 4.
  - check_neighbors_of_4: Examine the 8 neighbours of the cell containing 4 for the presence of the value 2.
  - conditional_transformation:
      if: check_neighbors_of_4 finds a value of 2.
      then:
        - preserve_4: Keep the value 4 at its original position.
        - zero_all_2s: Change the value of all cells containing 2 to 0 across the entire grid.
      else: # No neighbour contains 2
        - zero_4: Change the value of the cell containing 4 to 0.
        - preserve_all_2s: Keep the value of all cells containing 2 unchanged.
  - preserve_zeros: All cells with value 0 remain 0.
notes:
  - This rule correctly predicts the transformation for 5 out of the 7 provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_4, test_1, test_3).
  - Examples train_3 and test_2 show an output where the '4' is preserved and '2's are zeroed, despite the '4' having no '2' neighbours, contradicting the derived rule. This suggests either an error in those examples or a more complex rule not yet identified.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row `r4`, column `c4`) of the cell containing the value 4 in the input grid. If no 4 is found, return the copied grid.
3.  Examine the values of the 8 neighbouring cells (Moore neighbourhood) surrounding the cell at (`r4`, `c4`).
4.  Determine if any of these 8 neighbours contain the value 2. Call this condition `found_2_neighbor`.
5.  **If `found_2_neighbor` is TRUE:**
    *   Iterate through all cells in the output grid. If a cell contains the value 2, change its value to 0.
    *   The cell at (`r4`, `c4`) in the output grid retains its value 4 (it was already copied).
6.  **If `found_2_neighbor` is FALSE:**
    *   Change the value of the cell at (`r4`, `c4`) in the output grid to 0.
    *   All cells originally containing 2 retain their value 2 (they were already copied).
7.  All cells originally containing 0 retain their value 0 in both conditions.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
    *(Note: This program implements the rule observed in the majority of examples. It will not produce the provided expected output for train_3 and test_2).*
