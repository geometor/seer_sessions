objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 10x10 matrix of integers.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [10, 10]
        - cells: Contains integer values, primarily 0, 2, and 4. Assumed one '4'.
  - cell:
      description: A single element within the grid.
      properties:
        - position: (row, column) coordinates.
        - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
  - target_digit_4:
      description: The unique cell containing the value 4.
      properties:
        - value: 4
        - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
  - digit_2:
      description: Any cell containing the value 2.
      properties:
        - value: 2
        - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
relationships:
  - adjacency:
      description: The spatial relationship between the cell containing 4 and its 8 immediate neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal - Moore neighbourhood).
      condition: Check if any neighbour of the cell with value 4 contains the value 2.
actions:
  - find_digit_4: Locate the coordinates of the cell containing 4.
  - check_neighbors_of_4: Examine the 8 neighbours of the cell containing 4 for the presence of the value 2.
  - conditional_transformation:
      if: check_neighbors_of_4 finds a value of 2.
      then:
        - preserve_4: Keep the value 4 at its original position.
        - zero_all_2s: Change the value of all cells containing 2 to 0 across the entire grid.
      else: # No neighbour contains 2
        - zero_4: Change the value of the cell containing 4 to 0.
        - preserve_all_2s: Keep the value of all cells containing 2 unchanged.
  - preserve_zeros: All cells with value 0 remain 0.
notes:
  - This rule correctly predicts the transformation for 5 out of the 7 provided examples (train_1, train_2, train_4, test_1, test_3).
  - Examples train_3 and test_2 show an output where the '4' is preserved and '2's are zeroed, despite the '4' having no '2' neighbours, contradicting the derived rule. This suggests either an error in those examples or a more complex rule not yet identified.
