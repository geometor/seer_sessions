*   **Perception:** The task operates on 10x10 grids containing primarily digits 0, 2, and 4. The input grids usually feature multiple instances of the digit 2 and a single instance of the digit 4. The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a conditional rule involving the spatial relationship between the digit 4 and any adjacent digits 2. Specifically, the transformation depends on whether the cell containing the digit 4 has any neighbouring cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that contain the digit 2. If such a neighbour exists, the digit 4 is preserved in the output, and all instances of the digit 2 in the grid are changed to 0. Conversely, if the digit 4 has no adjacent neighbours with the digit 2, then all instances of the digit 2 are preserved in the output, and the digit 4 is changed to 0.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - grid:
          description: A 10x10 matrix of integers.
          properties:
            - dimensions: [10, 10]
            - cells: Contains integer values, primarily 0, 2, and 4.
      - cell:
          description: A single element within the grid.
          properties:
            - position: (row, column) coordinates.
            - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
      - target_digit_4:
          description: The cell containing the value 4. Assumed unique per input grid.
          properties:
            - value: 4
            - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
      - neighbor_digit_2:
          description: Cells containing the value 2.
          properties:
            - value: 2
            - position: Specific (row, column) coordinates.
    relationships:
      - adjacency:
          description: The spatial relationship between the cell containing 4 and its 8 immediate neighbours (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
          condition: Check if any neighbour of the cell with value 4 contains the value 2.
    actions:
      - find_digit_4: Locate the coordinates of the cell containing 4.
      - check_neighbors: Examine the 8 neighbours of the cell containing 4 for the presence of the value 2.
      - conditional_replacement:
          if: A neighbour contains 2.
          then: Keep the value 4 at its position, replace all values 2 in the entire grid with 0.
          else: Replace the value 4 with 0, keep all values 2 at their positions.
      - copy_zeros: All cells with value 0 remain 0.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Find the coordinates (row `r4`, column `c4`) of the cell containing the value 4 in the input grid.
    3.  Check the 8 neighbouring cells surrounding (`r4`, `c4`). Determine if any of these neighbours contain the value 2.
    4.  **Condition 1:** If at least one neighbour contains the value 2:
        *   Iterate through all cells in the output grid.
        *   If a cell contains the value 2, change its value to 0.
        *   The cell at (`r4`, `c4`) retains its value 4.
    5.  **Condition 2:** If none of the neighbours contain the value 2:
        *   Change the value of the cell at (`r4`, `c4`) in the output grid to 0.
        *   All cells originally containing 2 retain their value 2.
    6.  All cells originally containing 0 retain their value 0 in both conditions.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous analysis identified a transformation rule based on the adjacency of the digit '2' to the digit '4'. The Python code implemented this rule. However, testing revealed failures on `train_3` and `test_2`.

1.  **Error Analysis:** The code failed `train_3` and `test_2`. Re-examination using `tool_code` confirmed the neighbor-checking logic in the code was correct: `train_3` has no '2' neighbors, and `test_2` also has no '2' neighbors. The previous code correctly applied the derived rule ("no neighbor -> remove 4, keep 2s") in both cases. The failure occurred because the *expected outputs* for `train_3` and `test_2` followed the *opposite* logic ("no neighbor -> keep 4, remove 2s"), which matched the outcome previously associated only with *having* a '2' neighbor (like in `train_1`).

2.  **Inconsistency:** There is an inconsistency in the provided examples. Five examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, `test_1`, `test_3`) follow a consistent rule based on '2' adjacency to '4'. Two examples (`train_3`, `test_2`) contradict this rule's outcome when no neighbor is present. No simple secondary characteristic (count of '2's, position of '4', presence of '2's in the same row/column) clearly explains why `train_3` and `test_2` behave differently from the other "no neighbor" cases.

3.  **Strategy:** Assume the simplest rule that explains the majority (5 out of 7) of the examples is the intended one. This rule is based solely on the presence or absence of adjacent '2's to the '4'. The natural language program and YAML facts will describe this majority rule, acknowledging the inconsistency presented by `train_3` and `test_2`. The underlying assumption is that these two examples might be outliers or represent a more complex rule not easily discernible from the current data.

## Metrics and Analysis

Metrics were gathered to understand the properties differentiating the examples where the transformation resulted in "Keep 4, Remove 2s" versus "Remove 4, Keep 2s".

Group 'Remove 4, Keep 2s': train_2, train_4, test_1, test_3
  - All have No '2' neighbor.

Conclusion: The presence/absence of a '2' neighbor correctly predicts the outcome for 5/7 examples.
train_3 and test_2 are exceptions where 'Keep 4, Remove 2s' occurs despite *no* '2' neighbors.

objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 10x10 matrix containing integer values 0, 2, and 4.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [10, 10]
        - cells: integers 0, 2, 4.
  - cell:
      description: An element within the grid.
      properties:
        - position: (row, column) tuple.
        - value: Integer (0, 2, or 4).
  - target_cell:
      description: The unique cell containing the value 4.
      properties:
        - value: 4
        - position: (r4, c4)
  - neighbor_cell:
      description: One of the 8 cells immediately surrounding the target_cell (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
      properties:
        - position: (r_neighbor, c_neighbor)
        - value: Integer (0, 2, or 4).
  - digit_2_cell:
      description: Any cell in the grid containing the value 2.
      properties:
        - value: 2
        - position: (r2, c2)

relationships:
  - adjacency_check:
      description: Determine if any neighbor_cell of the target_cell contains the value 2.
      condition_property: has_adjacent_2 (Boolean: True if at least one neighbor is 2, False otherwise)

actions:
  - find_target: Locate the target_cell (containing 4) and record its position (r4, c4).
  - check_neighbors: Evaluate the adjacency_check condition for the target_cell.
  - conditional_transform:
      description: Modify the grid based on the adjacency_check result.
      rule:
        if: has_adjacent_2 is True
        then:
          - preserve_target: Keep the value 4 in the target_cell at (r4, c4).
          - remove_all_2s: Change the value of all digit_2_cells in the grid to 0.
        else: # has_adjacent_2 is False
          - remove_target: Change the value of the target_cell at (r4, c4) to 0.
          - preserve_all_2s: Keep the value 2 in all digit_2_cells.
  - preserve_zeros: All cells with value 0 remain unchanged throughout the process.
  - create_output: Generate the final grid after applying the transformation.

metadata:
  - inconsistency_note: The provided examples `train_3` and `test_2` do not follow the 'else' condition of the conditional_transform rule. They have no adjacent '2' but result in the 'if' outcome (preserving 4, removing 2s). The described rule fits the other 5 examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input 10x10 grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Locate Target:** Find the row and column coordinates (`r4`, `c4`) of the cell containing the value 4 in the input grid. If no cell contains 4, return the unmodified output grid.
3.  **Check Adjacency:** Examine the values of the 8 cells immediately surrounding the cell at (`r4`, `c4`) (i.e., cells at `(r4+dr, c4+dc)` where `dr` and `dc` range from -1 to 1, excluding `dr=0, dc=0`). Determine if any of these neighboring cells contain the value 2. Let the result be `has_adjacent_2` (True or False).
4.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If `has_adjacent_2` is True:** Iterate through the entire output grid. For every cell that contains the value 2, change its value to 0. The cell at (`r4`, `c4`) retains its value 4 (as it was copied initially).
    *   **If `has_adjacent_2` is False:** Change the value of the cell at (`r4`, `c4`) in the output grid to 0. All other cells (including those originally containing 2) retain their copied values.
5.  **Finalize:** Return the modified output grid.

*(Note: This program describes the transformation observed in 5 out of the 7 provided examples. Examples `train_3` and `test_2` are inconsistent with the "If `has_adjacent_2` is False" step, as their expected outputs follow the logic of the "If `has_adjacent_2` is True" step despite having `has_adjacent_2` evaluate to False.)*
