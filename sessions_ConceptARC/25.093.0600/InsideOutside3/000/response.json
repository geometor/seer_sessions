The input grids usually feature multiple instances of the digit 2 and a single instance of the digit 4. The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a conditional rule involving the spatial relationship between the digit 4 and any adjacent digits 2. Specifically, the transformation depends on whether the cell containing the digit 4 has any neighbouring cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that contain the digit 2. If such a neighbour exists, the digit 4 is preserved in the output, and all instances of the digit 2 in the grid are changed to 0. Conversely, if the digit 4 has no adjacent neighbours with the digit 2, then all instances of the digit 2 are preserved in the output, and the digit 4 is changed to 0.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
