            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous analysis identified a transformation rule based on the adjacency of the digit '2' to the digit '4'. The Python code implemented this rule. However, testing revealed failures on `train_3` and `test_2`.\n\n1.  **Error Analysis:** The code failed `train_3` and `test_2`. Re-examination using `tool_code` confirmed the neighbor-checking logic in the code was correct: `train_3` has no '2' neighbors, and `test_2` also has no '2' neighbors. The previous code correctly applied the derived rule (\"no neighbor -> remove 4, keep 2s\") in both cases. The failure occurred because the *expected outputs* for `train_3` and `test_2` followed the *opposite* logic (\"no neighbor -> keep 4, remove 2s\"), which matched the outcome previously associated only with *having* a '2' neighbor (like in `train_1`).\n\n2.  **Inconsistency:** There is an inconsistency in the provided examples. Five examples (`train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, `test_1`, `test_3`) follow a consistent rule based on '2' adjacency to '4'. Two examples (`train_3`, `test_2`) contradict this rule's outcome when no neighbor is present. No simple secondary characteristic (count of '2's, position of '4', presence of '2's in the same row/column) clearly explains why `train_3` and `test_2` behave differently from the other \"no neighbor\" cases.\n\n3.  **Strategy:** Assume the simplest rule that explains the majority (5 out of 7) of the examples is the intended one. This rule is based solely on the presence or absence of adjacent '2's to the '4'. The natural language program and YAML facts will describe this majority rule, acknowledging the inconsistency presented by `train_3` and `test_2`. The underlying assumption is that these two examples might be outliers or represent a more complex rule not easily discernible from the current data.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nMetrics were gathered to understand the properties differentiating the examples where the transformation resulted in \"Keep 4, Remove 2s\" versus \"Remove 4, Keep 2s\".\n\n"
