*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are grids of numbers, specifically 6x6 grids in the examples.
    *   The grids contain integers, primarily 0, 1, and 4 in the input, and 0 and 1 in the output.
    *   There is always exactly one '1' present in the input grid.
    *   The number '4' appears clustered along either the first row or the first column in the input grid.
    *   The output grid consists almost entirely of '0's, with a single '1'.

*   **YAML Block:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          dimensions: 6x6 (observed)
          elements: integers (0, 1, 4 in input; 0, 1 in output)
    elements_properties:
      - element: 1
        property: unique in input grid
      - element: 4
        property: appears clustered along the first row or first column in input
      - element: 0
        property: background filler in input and output
    actions:
      - action: locate
        target: element 1 in input grid
        result: coordinates (row_in, col_in)
      - action: identify_axis
        target: element 4 clusters in input grid
        result: axis ('vertical' if 4s in first column, 'horizontal' if 4s in first row)
      - action: create_output_grid
        properties:
          dimensions: same as input
          initial_value: all 0s
      - action: transform_position
        target: element 1
        based_on: axis identified by 4s
        details:
          if axis is vertical (4s in col 0): output position is (0, col_in)
          if axis is horizontal (4s in row 0): output position is (row_in, grid_width - 1) # assuming 0-indexed width
        result: coordinates (row_out, col_out)
      - action: place_element
        target: output grid
        element: 1
        position: (row_out, col_out)
    relationships:
      - The position of '1' in the output depends on its position in the input and the axis defined by the '4's.
      - The '4's in the input determine the transformation rule for the '1' but do not appear in the output.
      - All input elements other than the single '1' become '0' in the output.
      - The grid dimensions remain constant.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with zeros.
    2.  Find the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the single cell containing the value `1` in the input grid.
    3.  Determine the orientation of the line of `4`s in the input grid:
        *   If the first column (column 0) primarily contains `4`s, the orientation is 'vertical'.
        *   If the first row (row 0) primarily contains `4`s, the orientation is 'horizontal'.
    4.  Calculate the target coordinates (`r_new`, `c_new`) for the `1` in the output grid based on the orientation:
        *   If the orientation is 'vertical', set `r_new` to 0 and `c_new` to the original column `c`.
        *   If the orientation is 'horizontal', set `r_new` to the original row `r` and `c_new` to the last column index (e.g., 5 for a 6-column grid).
    5.  Place the value `1` at the calculated target coordinates (`r_new`, `c_new`) in the output grid.
