            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified by the execution results is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function expected a string representation of the grid and included a `parse_grid` helper function. However, the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array, causing the `.strip()` method call within `parse_grid` to fail. The core transformation logic derived previously (identifying '1', determining orientation from '4's, placing '1' in a new zeroed grid based on orientation) appears consistent with the examples. The strategy is to modify the function signature and internal logic to directly accept and work with a NumPy array (or equivalent grid structure like a list of lists) instead of parsing a string.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    *   **Input Format:** The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` strongly suggests the `transform` function receives a NumPy array as input, not a string.\n    *   **Grid Dimensions:** All training examples use 6x6 grids.\n    *   **Key Elements:**\n        *   Input grids contain exactly one `1`.\n        *   Input grids contain multiple `4`s, always arranged along the first row *or* the first column.\n        *   Output grids contain exactly one `1` and zeros elsewhere.\n    *   **Transformation Rule Confirmation:**\n        *   **Vertical Case (4s in first column):** The `1` at input `(r, c)` moves to `(0, c)` in the output. (Verified in train_1, train_2, train_4).\n        *   **Horizontal Case (4s in first row):** The `1` at input `(r, c)` moves to `(r, width-1)` in the output (where `width` is the number of columns). (Verified in train_3).\n\n*   **YAML Block:**\n    "
