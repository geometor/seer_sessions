"""
Transforms the input grid based on the counts and alignment of non-zero colors (specifically 2 and 4).

1. Identifies the locations and counts of cells with values 2 and 4.
2. Determines which color has the maximum count (`MaxColor`) and which has the minimum count (`MinColor`).
   - Assumes based on examples that counts are unequal, specifically two '2's and one '4'.
3. Finds the positions of all cells containing the `MaxColor`.
4. Checks if all `MaxColor` cells are horizontally aligned (share the same row index).
5. If the `MaxColor` cells are horizontally aligned:
   - Sets the value of the `MinColor` cell(s) to 0 in the output grid.
6. If the `MaxColor` cells are *not* horizontally aligned:
   - Sets the value of the `MaxColor` cells to 0 in the output grid.
7. Returns the modified grid. If counts are equal or only one non-zero color exists, returns the original grid.
