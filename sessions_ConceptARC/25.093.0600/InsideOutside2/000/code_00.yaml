Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: 10x10
    - Content: Cells
Cell:
  Properties:
    - Position: (row, column)
    - Value: Integer (0, 2, or 4 observed)
Color:
  Values: [0, 2, 4] # Observed non-zero colors
  Properties:
    - Count: Number of cells with this color value
    - Positions: List of (row, column) for cells with this color
    - Alignment: Property of the set of positions for a color (Horizontal, Vertical, None)
Transformation:
  Input: Grid
  Output: Grid
  Action: Selective removal of non-zero cells based on counts and alignment.
Rule_Elements:
  - NonZero_Cells: Cells with values != 0
  - Color_Counts: Map of {Color -> Count} for non-zero colors
  - MaxColor: The non-zero color with the highest count (if counts are unequal)
  - MinColor: The non-zero color with the lowest count (if counts are unequal)
  - MaxColor_Positions: List of (row, column) for MaxColor cells
  - MaxColor_Alignment: Check if MaxColor_Positions share the same row or same column.
Relationships:
  - If color counts are unequal:
    - If MaxColor cells share the same row: Remove MinColor cells.
    - Else (If MaxColor cells share the same column OR are not aligned): Remove MaxColor cells.
