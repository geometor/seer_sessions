Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 10x10 grids containing integers.
2.  **Colors/Values:** The relevant values seem to be 0 (background), 2 (blue), and 4 (red). Other values are not present in the examples.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is derived from the input grid by changing some non-zero cells (2s or 4s) to 0. Not all non-zero cells are necessarily changed.
4.  **Core Logic:** The decision of which cells to change appears to depend on the *counts* of each non-zero color (2 and 4) and the *spatial arrangement* (alignment) of the cells having the color with the highest count.

**Analysis Summary:**

In all examples, there are exactly two cells with value 2 and one cell with value 4.
Let's call color 2 the `MaxColor` (since its count is 2) and color 4 the `MinColor` (since its count is 1).

*   **train_1 & train_4:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are horizontally aligned (share the same row). In these cases, the `MinColor` (4) cell is removed (set to 0), and the `MaxColor` cells are kept.
*   **train_2:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are vertically aligned (share the same column). In this case, the `MaxColor` (2) cells are removed, and the `MinColor` (4) cell is kept.
*   **train_3:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are neither horizontally nor vertically aligned. In this case, the `MaxColor` (2) cells are removed, and the `MinColor` (4) cell is kept.

This leads to a consistent rule based on the alignment of the color with the maximum count.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: 10x10
    - Content: Cells
Cell:
  Properties:
    - Position: (row, column)
    - Value: Integer (0, 2, or 4 observed)
Color:
  Values: [0, 2, 4] # Observed non-zero colors
  Properties:
    - Count: Number of cells with this color value
    - Positions: List of (row, column) for cells with this color
    - Alignment: Property of the set of positions for a color (Horizontal, Vertical, None)
Transformation:
  Input: Grid
  Output: Grid
  Action: Selective removal of non-zero cells based on counts and alignment.
Rule_Elements:
  - NonZero_Cells: Cells with values != 0
  - Color_Counts: Map of {Color -> Count} for non-zero colors
  - MaxColor: The non-zero color with the highest count (if counts are unequal)
  - MinColor: The non-zero color with the lowest count (if counts are unequal)
  - MaxColor_Positions: List of (row, column) for MaxColor cells
  - MaxColor_Alignment: Check if MaxColor_Positions share the same row or same column.
Relationships:
  - If color counts are unequal:
    - If MaxColor cells share the same row: Remove MinColor cells.
    - Else (If MaxColor cells share the same column OR are not aligned): Remove MaxColor cells.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero cells in the input grid and record their color (value) and position (row, column).
2.  Count the number of cells for each distinct non-zero color present (e.g., count the number of 2s and 4s).
3.  If there is only one distinct non-zero color, or if all distinct non-zero colors have the same count, make no changes to the grid.
4.  If the counts of the non-zero colors are unequal, determine the color with the maximum count (`MaxColor`) and the color with the minimum count (`MinColor`).
5.  Find the positions (row, column) of all cells containing the `MaxColor`.
6.  Check if all `MaxColor` cells lie in the same row (i.e., share the same row index).
7.  **Decision:**
    *   If all `MaxColor` cells lie in the same row: Modify the grid by setting the value of all cells containing the `MinColor` to 0. Keep the `MaxColor` cells as they are.
    *   If the `MaxColor` cells do *not* all lie in the same row: Modify the grid by setting the value of all cells containing the `MaxColor` to 0. Keep the `MinColor` cells as they are.
8.  The resulting grid is the output.
