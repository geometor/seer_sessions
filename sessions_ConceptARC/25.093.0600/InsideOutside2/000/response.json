Other values are not present in the examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is derived from the input grid by changing some non-zero cells (2s or 4s) to 0. Not all non-zero cells are necessarily changed.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The decision of which cells to change appears to depend on the *counts* of each non-zero color (2 and 4) and the *spatial arrangement* (alignment) of the cells having the color with the highest count.\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n\nIn all examples, there are exactly two cells with value 2 and one cell with value 4.\nLet's call color 2 the `MaxColor` (since its count is 2) and color 4 the `MinColor` (since its count is 1).\n\n*   **train_1 & train_4:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are horizontally aligned (share the same row). In these cases, the `MinColor` (4) cell is removed (set to 0), and the `MaxColor` cells are kept.\n*   **train_2:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are vertically aligned (share the same column). In this case, the `MaxColor` (2) cells are removed, and the `MinColor` (4) cell is kept.\n*   **train_3:** The two `MaxColor` (2) cells are neither horizontally nor vertically aligned. In this case, the `MaxColor` (2) cells are removed, and the `MinColor` (4) cell is kept.\n\nThis leads to a consistent rule based on the alignment of the color with the maximum count.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

If there is only one distinct non-zero color, or if all distinct non-zero colors have the same count, make no changes to the grid.\n4.  If the counts of the non-zero colors are unequal, determine the color with the maximum count (`MaxColor`) and the color with the minimum count (`MinColor`).\n5.  Find the positions (row, column) of all cells containing the `MaxColor`.\n6.  Check if all `MaxColor` cells lie in the same row (i.e., share the same row index).\n7.  **Decision:**\n    *   If all `MaxColor` cells lie in the same row: Modify the grid by setting the value of all cells containing the `MinColor` to 0. Keep the `MaxColor` cells as they are.\n    *   If the `MaxColor` cells do *not* all lie in the same row: Modify the grid by setting the value of all cells containing the `MaxColor` to 0. Keep the `MinColor` cells as they are.\n8.  The resulting grid is the output."
