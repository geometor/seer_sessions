Each grid primarily uses two digits: zero ('0') and a single non-zero digit ('2', '6', or '4' in the examples). The non-zero digit is consistent within each input grid. The zero digit appears to function as a background or separator.\n\nThe input grids exhibit a structure often involving alternating rows of all zeros and rows primarily composed of the non-zero digit. Crucially, some rows contain a mixture of zeros and the non-zero digit, specifically featuring a contiguous block of the non-zero digit bounded by zeros (e.g., `... 0 N N N 0 ...`).\n\nThe output is a smaller, solid rectangular grid composed entirely of the non-zero digit identified from the input. The dimensions of this output grid appear related to the length of the bounded block of non-zero digits found within the mixed rows of the input.\n\nThe transformation involves:\n1.  Identifying the unique non-zero digit (`N`) in the input grid.\n2.  Locating rows containing the pattern of a sequence of `N`s surrounded by `0`s.\n3.  Measuring the length (`W`) of this sequence of `N`s.\n4.  Determining the height (`H`) of the output grid based on `W`. The observed rule is H=W, unless W=4, in which case H=5.\n5.  Generating an `H x W` grid filled with the digit `N`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
