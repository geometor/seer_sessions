elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid (matrix) of digits
      - contains: primarily two digits - zero and one unique non-zero digit (N)
      - structure: rows can be all zeros, mostly N, or contain patterns like '0 N...N 0'
  - object: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - type: digit (e.g., '2', '6', '4')
      - role: foreground color/value
      - uniqueness: only one type per input grid
  - object: zero_digit
    properties:
      - type: digit ('0')
      - role: background color/separator
  - object: pattern_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of non_zero_digits
      - location: found within input grid rows that also contain zero_digits
      - structure: bounded by zero_digits (or grid edges acting as boundaries), e.g., '0 N...N 0'
      - characteristic: length (W)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid (matrix) of digits
      - composition: filled entirely with the non_zero_digit (N) from the input
      - dimensions: H rows x W columns
      - relationship_to_input:
          - W (width) is determined by the length of the pattern_block.
          - H (height) is determined by W (H=W, except if W=4 then H=5).

actions:
  - identify: the unique non_zero_digit (N) in the input_grid.
  - locate: rows in the input_grid containing the pattern_block ('0 N...N 0').
  - measure: the length (W) of the pattern_block.
  - calculate: the output height (H) based on W (H=W, or H=5 if W=4).
  - generate: the output_grid of size H x W, filled with N.

relationships:
  - output_grid width (W) is equal to the pattern_block length (W).
  - output_grid height (H) depends conditionally on the pattern_block length (W).
  - output_grid cell value is the non_zero_digit from the input_grid.
