## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: find the non-zero digit, locate a specific pattern (`0 N...N 0`) to determine width (`W`), calculate height (`H`) based on `W` (with a special case for W=4), and generate a solid output grid.

The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was passed a `numpy.ndarray` object, not the `List[str]` it was designed to expect based on the previous prompt's structure. The function attempted to call `.split()` on rows of the numpy array, which is invalid.

The strategy is to adjust the `transform` function to directly accept a `numpy.ndarray` as input, eliminating the faulty string parsing step. The core logic for identifying the non-zero digit, pattern width, and output dimensions appears sound based on the training examples and will be retained.

## Metrics

Let's analyze each training example based on the proposed logic:

**Train Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 15x15
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 2
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` (Row index 6)
*   Pattern: `0 2 2 2 2 2 0` -> Sequence `2 2 2 2 2`
*   Pattern Width (W): 5
*   Calculated Height (H): H = W = 5 (since W != 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   Expected Output Value: 2
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

**Train Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 14x6
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 6
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 6 6 6 6 0` (Row index 4)
*   Pattern: `0 6 6 6 6 0` -> Sequence `6 6 6 6`
*   Pattern Width (W): 4
*   Calculated Height (H): H = 5 (since W == 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 5x4
*   Expected Output Value: 6
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

**Train Example 3:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 6x16
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 4
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0` (Row index 2)
*   Pattern: `0 4 4 4 0` -> Sequence `4 4 4`
*   Pattern Width (W): 3
*   Calculated Height (H): H = W = 3 (since W != 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 3x3
*   Expected Output Value: 4
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

The logic holds for all training examples. The primary correction needed is handling the input type correctly.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray of integers # Corrected type
      - contains: primarily two digits - zero ('0') and one unique non-zero digit (N)
      - structure: rows can be all zeros, mostly N, or contain patterns like '0 N...N 0'
  - object: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - type: integer (e.g., 2, 6, 4)
      - role: foreground color/value
      - uniqueness: only one type per input grid
  - object: zero_digit
    properties:
      - type: integer (0)
      - role: background color/separator
  - object: pattern_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of non_zero_digits within a row
      - location: found within input grid rows that also contain zero_digits
      - structure: bounded by zero_digits ('0 N...N 0')
      - characteristic: length (W)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: numpy.ndarray of integers # Output type consistency
      - composition: filled entirely with the non_zero_digit (N) from the input
      - dimensions: H rows x W columns
      - relationship_to_input:
          - W (width) is determined by the length of the pattern_block.
          - H (height) is determined by W (H=W, except if W=4 then H=5).

actions:
  - identify: the unique non_zero_digit (N) in the input_grid.
  - locate: rows in the input_grid containing the pattern_block structure '0 N...N 0'.
  - measure: the length (W) of the non_zero_digit sequence within the pattern_block.
  - calculate: the output height (H) based on W (H=W, or H=5 if W=4).
  - generate: the output_grid (numpy.ndarray) of size H x W, filled with N.

relationships:
  - output_grid width (W) is equal to the pattern_block length (W).
  - output_grid height (H) depends conditionally on the pattern_block length (W).
  - output_grid cell value is the non_zero_digit from the input_grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid as a numpy array of integers.
2.  Identify the unique non-zero integer (`N`) present in the input grid.
3.  Scan each row of the input grid:
    *   Convert the row to a string representation.
    *   Search within the string for the pattern `0` followed by one or more occurrences of the digit `N`, followed by `0` (e.g., using regular expressions like `f"0({N}+)0"`).
    *   If the pattern is found, extract the sequence of `N`s and determine its length (`W`). Assume this length is consistent across all rows containing the pattern. Store `W` and stop scanning rows.
4.  If no such pattern is found in any row, raise an error or return an empty grid.
5.  Calculate the height (`H`) for the output grid: if `W` is 4, set `H` to 5; otherwise, set `H` equal to `W`.
6.  Create a new numpy array with `H` rows and `W` columns.
7.  Fill every cell of this new array with the non-zero integer `N`.
8.  Return the newly created numpy array as the output.
