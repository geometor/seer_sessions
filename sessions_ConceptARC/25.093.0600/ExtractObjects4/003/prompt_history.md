## Perception

The input data consists of grids (matrices) containing numerical digits. Each grid primarily uses two digits: zero ('0') and a single non-zero digit ('2', '6', or '4' in the examples). The non-zero digit is consistent within each input grid. The zero digit appears to function as a background or separator.

The input grids exhibit a structure often involving alternating rows of all zeros and rows primarily composed of the non-zero digit. Crucially, some rows contain a mixture of zeros and the non-zero digit, specifically featuring a contiguous block of the non-zero digit bounded by zeros (e.g., `... 0 N N N 0 ...`).

The output is a smaller, solid rectangular grid composed entirely of the non-zero digit identified from the input. The dimensions of this output grid appear related to the length of the bounded block of non-zero digits found within the mixed rows of the input.

The transformation involves:
1.  Identifying the unique non-zero digit (`N`) in the input grid.
2.  Locating rows containing the pattern of a sequence of `N`s surrounded by `0`s.
3.  Measuring the length (`W`) of this sequence of `N`s.
4.  Determining the height (`H`) of the output grid based on `W`. The observed rule is H=W, unless W=4, in which case H=5.
5.  Generating an `H x W` grid filled with the digit `N`.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: find the non-zero digit, locate a specific pattern (`0 N...N 0`) to determine width (`W`), calculate height (`H`) based on `W` (with a special case for W=4), and generate a solid output grid.

The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was passed a `numpy.ndarray` object, not the `List[str]` it was designed to expect based on the previous prompt's structure. The function attempted to call `.split()` on rows of the numpy array, which is invalid.

The strategy is to adjust the `transform` function to directly accept a `numpy.ndarray` as input, eliminating the faulty string parsing step. The core logic for identifying the non-zero digit, pattern width, and output dimensions appears sound based on the training examples and will be retained.

## Metrics

Let's analyze each training example based on the proposed logic:

**Train Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 15x15
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 2
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` (Row index 6)
*   Pattern: `0 2 2 2 2 2 0` -> Sequence `2 2 2 2 2`
*   Pattern Width (W): 5
*   Calculated Height (H): H = W = 5 (since W != 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   Expected Output Value: 2
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

**Train Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 14x6
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 6
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 6 6 6 6 0` (Row index 4)
*   Pattern: `0 6 6 6 6 0` -> Sequence `6 6 6 6`
*   Pattern Width (W): 4
*   Calculated Height (H): H = 5 (since W == 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 5x4
*   Expected Output Value: 6
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

**Train Example 3:**
*   Input Grid Dimensions: 6x16
*   Non-Zero Digit (N): 4
*   Relevant Pattern Row Example: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0` (Row index 2)
*   Pattern: `0 4 4 4 0` -> Sequence `4 4 4`
*   Pattern Width (W): 3
*   Calculated Height (H): H = W = 3 (since W != 4)
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 3x3
*   Expected Output Value: 4
*   Result Matches Expected: Yes

The logic holds for all training examples. The primary correction needed is handling the input type correctly.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid as a numpy array of integers.
2.  Identify the unique non-zero integer (`N`) present in the input grid.
3.  Scan each row of the input grid:
    *   Convert the row to a string representation.
    *   Search within the string for the pattern `0` followed by one or more occurrences of the digit `N`, followed by `0` (e.g., using regular expressions like `f"0({N}+)0"`).
    *   If the pattern is found, extract the sequence of `N`s and determine its length (`W`). Assume this length is consistent across all rows containing the pattern. Store `W` and stop scanning rows.
4.  If no such pattern is found in any row, raise an error or return an empty grid.
5.  Calculate the height (`H`) for the output grid: if `W` is 4, set `H` to 5; otherwise, set `H` equal to `W`.
6.  Create a new numpy array with `H` rows and `W` columns.
7.  Fill every cell of this new array with the non-zero integer `N`.
8.  Return the newly created numpy array as the output.
