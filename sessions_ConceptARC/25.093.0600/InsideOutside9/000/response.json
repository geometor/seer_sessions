The transformation seems to selectively change some '4's to '0's while leaving other '4's and all '0's and '2's unchanged. The key factor determining whether a '4' is preserved appears to be its position relative to the locations of the '2's in the grid. The '2's seem to define boundary lines, either horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
