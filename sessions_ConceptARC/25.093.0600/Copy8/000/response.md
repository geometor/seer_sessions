## Perception

The input and output are 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors (0 being the background). The core transformation involves identifying specific shapes within the input grid and mirroring them horizontally to create the output grid.

Observations across examples:

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output maintain the same dimensions.
2.  **Shape Preservation:** Most shapes and colors from the input are preserved in the output in their original positions.
3.  **Mirroring Action:** A specific subset of the input grid's colored cells (pixels) is mirrored horizontally across the grid's vertical centerline. The mirrored pixels are added to the output grid, overlaying any existing background color (0) but potentially overwriting other colors if the mirrored position already contained a non-zero value (although this doesn't happen in the provided examples).
4.  **Target Selection:** The key is to identify *which* color/shape gets mirrored. Comparing `train_1` (color 2 mirrored, color 1 ignored) and `train_2` (color 3 mirrored, color 4 ignored), the mirrored color is the one that appears *least* frequently among all non-zero colors in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integer values representing cells.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, having a position (row, column) and a color (integer value).
  - Shape: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color value.

Properties:
  - Grid.width: The number of columns in the grid.
  - Grid.height: The number of rows in the grid.
  - Cell.row: The row index of the cell.
  - Cell.column: The column index of the cell.
  - Cell.color: The integer value of the cell.
  - Color.frequency: The total count of cells having a specific non-zero color within the grid.

Relationships:
  - A Grid contains multiple Cells.
  - Cells with the same non-zero color form Shapes (implicitly).

Actions:
  - Identify_Non_Zero_Colors: Find all unique color values in the input grid, excluding 0.
  - Count_Color_Frequency: For each identified non-zero color, count its total occurrences in the input grid.
  - Find_Minimum_Frequency_Color: Determine the non-zero color that has the lowest frequency count.
  - Mirror_Horizontally: For each cell containing the minimum frequency color, calculate its mirrored position across the grid's vertical axis and place its color at that new position in the output grid.
  - Copy_Input: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Mirror_Target_Color: The specific color identified by the Find_Minimum_Frequency_Color action.
  - Mirrored_Column_Index: Calculated as `Grid.width - 1 - Cell.column`.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all unique non-zero color values present in the input grid.
3.  For each unique non-zero color, count how many cells in the input grid contain that color.
4.  Determine the non-zero color that has the minimum frequency count. Let this be the `mirror_target_color`.
5.  Get the width of the grid (`grid_width`).
6.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (`row`, `col`) with color `cell_color`.
7.  If `cell_color` is equal to the `mirror_target_color`:
    a. Calculate the mirrored column index: `mirrored_col = grid_width - 1 - col`.
    b. Set the color of the cell at position (`row`, `mirrored_col`) in the *output* grid to `mirror_target_color`.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
