Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integer values representing cells.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, having a position (row, column) and a color (integer value).
  - Shape: A collection of connected or disconnected cells sharing the same non-zero color value.

Properties:
  - Grid.width: The number of columns in the grid.
  - Grid.height: The number of rows in the grid.
  - Cell.row: The row index of the cell.
  - Cell.column: The column index of the cell.
  - Cell.color: The integer value of the cell.
  - Color.frequency: The total count of cells having a specific non-zero color within the grid.

Relationships:
  - A Grid contains multiple Cells.
  - Cells with the same non-zero color form Shapes (implicitly).

Actions:
  - Identify_Non_Zero_Colors: Find all unique color values in the input grid, excluding 0.
  - Count_Color_Frequency: For each identified non-zero color, count its total occurrences in the input grid.
  - Find_Minimum_Frequency_Color: Determine the non-zero color that has the lowest frequency count.
  - Mirror_Horizontally: For each cell containing the minimum frequency color, calculate its mirrored position across the grid's vertical axis and place its color at that new position in the output grid.
  - Copy_Input: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Mirror_Target_Color: The specific color identified by the Find_Minimum_Frequency_Color action.
  - Mirrored_Column_Index: Calculated as `Grid.width - 1 - Cell.column`.
