The core transformation involves identifying specific shapes within the input grid and mirroring them horizontally to create the output grid.\n\nObservations across examples:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output maintain the same dimensions.\n2.  **Shape Preservation:** Most shapes and colors from the input are preserved in the output in their original positions.\n3.  **Mirroring Action:** A specific subset of the input grid's colored cells (pixels) is mirrored horizontally across the grid's vertical centerline. The mirrored pixels are added to the output grid, overlaying any existing background color (0) but potentially overwriting other colors if the mirrored position already contained a non-zero value (although this doesn't happen in the provided examples).\n4.  **Target Selection:** The key is to identify *which* color/shape gets mirrored. Comparing `train_1` (color 2 mirrored, color 1 ignored) and `train_2` (color 3 mirrored, color 4 ignored), the mirrored color is the one that appears *least* frequently among all non-zero colors in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
