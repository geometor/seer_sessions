task_description: Recolors two distinct shapes based on their relative positions.

elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - background_color: 0
      - contains: Cells, Shapes
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: color (integer)
  - object: Shape
    properties:
      - defined_by: connected non-zero Cells of the same color
      - color: a specific non-zero integer (e.g., 4 or 7 in input)
      - top_left_coordinate: the (row, column) of the uppermost, leftmost cell belonging to the shape

input_specifics:
  - property: Number of distinct non-zero colors
    value: 2
  - property: Specific non-zero colors observed
    value: [4, 7]
  - property: Number of Shapes
    value: 2 (one for each non-zero color)

output_specifics:
  - property: Number of distinct non-zero colors
    value: 1
  - property: Specific non-zero colors observed
    value: [5] or [8]
  - property: Shape structure and position
    value: Identical to input shapes

transformation_rule_summary:
  - action: Identify the two input shape colors (C1, C2) and their corresponding shapes (S1, S2).
  - action: Find the top-left coordinates (P1, P2) for shapes S1 and S2.
  - action: Compare P1 and P2 using row-major order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - logic:
      - If the shape with color 4 has the coordinate that comes first (P_4 < P_7), the output color is 8.
      - If the shape with color 7 has the coordinate that comes first (P_7 < P_4), the output color is 5.
  - action: Recolor all cells originally belonging to C1 or C2 with the determined output color.
