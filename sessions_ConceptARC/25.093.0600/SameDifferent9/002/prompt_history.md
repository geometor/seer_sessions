Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers. The size of the grid appears consistent between input and output for each example (10x10).
2.  **Colors/Values:** The grids use integers to represent colors. Color 0 seems to be the background color. Non-zero colors (specifically 4 and 7 in the training examples) represent distinct objects or shapes.
3.  **Objects/Shapes:** In each input grid, there are exactly two distinct non-zero colors, forming two separate shapes. These shapes look like hollow rectangles or squares.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of the shapes. The positions and structure of the shapes remain identical between input and output. The background (color 0) also remains unchanged.
5.  **Color Mapping Rule:** The key challenge is determining the rule for the output color. In the input, the shapes have colors 4 and 7. In the output, *both* shapes take on a *single* new color, which is either 5 or 8. This output color (5 or 8) seems to depend on the spatial relationship between the input shapes colored 4 and 7. Specifically, it appears to depend on which shape's top-left corner appears "first" when scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

**YAML Fact Document:**

transformation_rule_summary:
  - action: Identify the two input shape colors (C1, C2) and their corresponding shapes (S1, S2).
  - action: Find the top-left coordinates (P1, P2) for shapes S1 and S2.
  - action: Compare P1 and P2 using row-major order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  - logic:
      - If the shape with color 4 has the coordinate that comes first (P_4 < P_7), the output color is 8.
      - If the shape with color 7 has the coordinate that comes first (P_7 < P_4), the output color is 5.
  - action: Recolor all cells originally belonging to C1 or C2 with the determined output color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes and Colors:** Scan the input grid to find all non-zero cells. Identify the two distinct non-zero colors present (let's call them `color_A` and `color_B`). In the provided examples, these are always 4 and 7.
2.  **Find Top-Left Coordinates:**
    a.  For `color_A`, find the cell `(r_A, c_A)` such that `r_A` is the minimum row index among all cells with `color_A`, and `c_A` is the minimum column index among all cells in that minimum row `r_A`. This is the top-left coordinate `pos_A` for the shape with `color_A`.
    b.  Similarly, find the top-left coordinate `pos_B = (r_B, c_B)` for the shape with `color_B`.
3.  **Determine Output Color:**
    a.  Compare `pos_A` and `pos_B`. The coordinate with the smaller row index comes first. If the row indices are equal, the coordinate with the smaller column index comes first.
    b.  Check which color corresponds to the coordinate that comes first.
    c.  If the shape with color 4 comes first (i.e., `pos_4` < `pos_7`), set the `output_color` to 8.
    d.  If the shape with color 7 comes first (i.e., `pos_7` < `pos_4`), set the `output_color` to 5.
4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid:
    a.  If the input cell `input[r][c]` has `color_A` or `color_B`, set the corresponding output cell `output[r][c]` to the determined `output_color`.
    b.  Otherwise (if the input cell is 0), set the output cell `output[r][c]` to 0.
5.  Return the generated output grid.
