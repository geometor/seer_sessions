"""
Transforms an input grid containing two shapes defined by colors 4 and 7. 
It identifies the top-leftmost coordinate of each shape. If the shape with 
color 4 has the top-left coordinate that appears first (scanning top-to-bottom, 
then left-to-right), both shapes are recolored to 8 in the output. If the 
shape with color 7 has the top-left coordinate that appears first, both shapes 
are recolored to 5. The background color (0) remains unchanged.
