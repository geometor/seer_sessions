However, the results show errors in two key areas:\n\n1.  **Marker Identification:** While the \"least frequent non-zero digit\" worked for most single-cell markers, Test 3 revealed that the marker can be a *shape* composed of all instances of the least frequent digit (the 2x2 block of '4's).\n2.  **Target Location:** The target location is not the geometric center of the *entire grid*, but rather the geometric center of the *largest contiguous structure* formed by other non-zero digits in the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the marker identification logic to handle multi-cell shapes formed by the least frequent digit.\n2.  Implement logic to find the largest connected component of non-marker, non-zero digits.\n3.  Calculate the geometric center of this largest component's bounding box.\n4.  Update the transformation to place the identified marker object (potentially a shape) centered at the target structure's center, overwriting existing cells.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
