**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis correctly identified the core task: moving a specific "marker" element to a central location. However, the results show errors in two key areas:

1.  **Marker Identification:** While the "least frequent non-zero digit" worked for most single-cell markers, Test 3 revealed that the marker can be a *shape* composed of all instances of the least frequent digit (the 2x2 block of '4's).
2.  **Target Location:** The target location is not the geometric center of the *entire grid*, but rather the geometric center of the *largest contiguous structure* formed by other non-zero digits in the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the marker identification logic to handle multi-cell shapes formed by the least frequent digit.
2.  Implement logic to find the largest connected component of non-marker, non-zero digits.
3.  Calculate the geometric center of this largest component's bounding box.
4.  Update the transformation to place the identified marker object (potentially a shape) centered at the target structure's center, overwriting existing cells.
