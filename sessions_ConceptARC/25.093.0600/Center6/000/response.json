            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers. The grid dimensions vary between examples (13x13, 12x12, 15x15).\n2.  **Grid Content:** The grids contain mostly zeros (representing a background) and some non-zero digits.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core transformation involves relocating a specific non-zero digit from its original position in the input grid to the center of the grid in the output. The original location of this digit is then set to zero.\n4.  **Identifying the Moved Digit:** In each example, there's a non-zero digit that seems distinct or unique compared to other non-zero digits which might form larger patterns (like the 'X' of 2s, the border of 3s, or the rectangle of 4s). This unique digit appears only once in the input grids provided.\n    *   Example 1: The digit '4' is moved.\n    *   Example 2: The digit '7' is moved.\n    *   Example 3: The digit '8' is moved.\n5.  **Determining the Center:** The target location for the moved digit is the geometric center of the grid. For an HxW grid, the center coordinates appear to be `(floor((H-1)/2), floor((W-1)/2))`.\n6.  **Preservation:** All other elements of the grid remain unchanged between the input and output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
