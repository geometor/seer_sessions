Task: Relocate a specific digit to the grid center.

Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Properties:
        - height (H)
        - width (W)
        - cells (containing integer values)
  - OutputGrid:
      Type: 2D integer array
      Properties: derived from InputGrid after transformation
  - MarkerDigit:
      Type: Integer
      Properties:
        - value (M)
        - location_in_input (marker_row, marker_col)
      Identification: The non-zero digit with the minimum frequency in the InputGrid. (Assumed unique based on examples).
  - CenterPosition:
      Type: Coordinates (row, column)
      Properties:
        - center_row: floor((H - 1) / 2)
        - center_col: floor((W - 1) / 2)

Actions:
  1. FindMarker: Identify the MarkerDigit (value M) and its location (marker_row, marker_col) in the InputGrid by finding the least frequent non-zero digit.
  2. CalculateCenter: Determine the CenterPosition (center_row, center_col) based on InputGrid dimensions (H, W).
  3. TransformGrid:
     - Initialize OutputGrid as a copy of InputGrid.
     - Modify OutputGrid:
       - Set cell value at (marker_row, marker_col) to 0.
       - Set cell value at (center_row, center_col) to M.

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid is derived from InputGrid via the TransformGrid action.
  - The TransformGrid action depends on the results of FindMarker and CalculateCenter.
  - The value placed at the CenterPosition in the OutputGrid is the value of the MarkerDigit found in the InputGrid.
  - The original location of the MarkerDigit in the InputGrid becomes 0 in the OutputGrid.
