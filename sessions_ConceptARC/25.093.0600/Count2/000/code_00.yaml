task_description: Identify the geometric shape formed by '1's in a grid and count its perimeter segments.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D list of integers (0 or 1)
    properties:
      - Contains a background of '0's.
      - Contains a foreground of '1's forming a hollow shape outline.
  - element: shape
    type: Geometric figure
    properties:
      - Defined by the connected '1' cells in the input_grid.
      - Hollow.
      - Perimeter is composed of straight line segments (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
    relationships:
      - Embedded within the input_grid.
  - element: perimeter_segment
    type: Straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
    properties:
      - Composed of contiguous '1' cells.
      - Forms part of the shape's boundary.
  - element: output_sequence
    type: 1D list of integers
    properties:
      - Contains only the integer '7'.
      - Length is variable.
    relationships:
      - Derived from the input_grid's shape.
actions:
  - action: identify_shape
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: shape representation (internal)
  - action: trace_perimeter
    actor: system
    input: shape representation
    output: set of perimeter_segments
  - action: count_segments
    actor: system
    input: set of perimeter_segments
    output: segment_count (integer)
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    input: segment_count
    output: output_sequence (list of '7's with length = segment_count)
relationships:
  - type: determination
    subject: shape
    object: segment_count
    details: The number of distinct straight line segments forming the shape's perimeter determines the count.
  - type: determination
    subject: segment_count
    object: output_sequence length
    details: The count of perimeter segments determines the number of '7's in the output sequence.
