            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is a 2D grid (matrix) containing integers, specifically 0s and 1s.\n2.  **Structure:** The 1s consistently form the outline or perimeter of a geometric shape against a background of 0s. The shapes observed are a rectangle (train\\_1), a triangle (train\\_2), and a diamond/hexagon variant (train\\_3). These shapes are hollow.\n3.  **Output:** The output is a sequence (list or array) of the integer 7.\n4.  **Relationship:** The key transformation seems to relate the geometric properties of the shape formed by the 1s in the input to the *length* of the output sequence of 7s. The value '7' itself appears constant and unrelated to the input structure, likely just a fixed output element.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation:**\n\n*   **Train 1:** The input shape is a rectangle. A rectangle has 4 sides (straight line segments: top, bottom, left, right). The output is `7 7 7 7`, which has a length of 4.\n*   **Train 2:** The input shape is a triangle. A triangle has 3 sides (straight line segments: bottom, left diagonal, right diagonal). The output is `7 7 7`, which has a length of 3.\n*   **Train 3:** The input shape is a diamond or hexagon-like shape. Let's count its distinct straight sides: top horizontal, bottom horizontal, top-left diagonal, top-right diagonal, bottom-left diagonal, bottom-right diagonal. This gives 6 distinct straight line segments forming the perimeter. The output is `7 7 7 7 7 7`, which has a length of 6.\n\n**Conclusion:** The length of the output sequence corresponds to the number of distinct straight line segments that form the perimeter of the shape outlined by the '1's in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
