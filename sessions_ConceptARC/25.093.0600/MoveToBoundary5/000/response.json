The color itself varies between examples (5 in train\\_1, 7 in train\\_2).\n    *   The transformation involves moving (translating) the entire shape within the grid. The shape's structure and color remain identical.\n    *   The direction of translation appears to depend on the shape's geometry. In train\\_1, the shape is shifted horizontally to the right. In train\\_2, the shape is shifted vertically downwards.\n    *   The magnitude of the shift is 3 units in both examples, either horizontally or vertically.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
