Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 6x6 grids containing single-digit integers (0-9).
2.  **Core Observation:** The output grid is derived from the input grid by changing some zero (`0`) valued cells to non-zero values. The non-zero values used for filling seem to come from existing non-zero lines in the input.
3.  **Identifying Lines:** The input grids contain straight, continuous lines (segments) of identical non-zero numbers, either horizontally or vertically.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves extending these line segments. A line segment is extended from one of its ends, filling adjacent `0` cells along its axis (row for horizontal lines, column for vertical lines).
5.  **Extension Condition:** The extension continues through consecutive `0` cells until either:
    *   A non-zero cell is encountered along the extension path.
    *   The edge of the grid is reached.
6.  **Filling Rule:** Only if a non-zero cell is encountered (before the edge) are the intermediate `0` cells filled with the number of the extending line segment. If the extension path reaches the edge without hitting another non-zero number, no filling occurs for that specific end/direction.
7.  **Simultaneity:** It appears these extensions happen for all qualifying line segments and ends simultaneously or cumulatively, modifying the initial input grid to produce the final output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - cell_type: Integer (0-9)
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - value: Integer (0-9)
  - object: LineSegment
    properties:
      - type: maximal continuous sequence of identical non-zero cells
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - value: the non-zero integer of the cells in the segment
      - endpoints: the coordinates of the two cells at the ends of the segment
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    details: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right)
  - type: containment
    between: [LineSegment, Cell]
    details: A LineSegment is composed of multiple Cells
  - type: extension_path
    from: LineSegment endpoint
    details: A sequence of adjacent 0-valued cells starting from one end of a LineSegment, continuing along its orientation (row or column) away from the segment's body.
  - type: blocking_cell
    for: extension_path
    details: The first non-zero cell encountered along an extension_path.
actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    on: Grid
    output: Set of LineSegments
  - action: determine_extension
    on: LineSegment endpoint
    conditions:
      - The cell adjacent to the endpoint (away from the segment body) exists within the grid.
      - This adjacent cell and potentially subsequent cells along the orientation form an extension_path.
    outcome: Either identifies a blocking_cell or reaches the grid edge.
  - action: fill_path
    on: extension_path
    using: LineSegment value
    condition: A blocking_cell was identified for this path (did not reach the edge first).
    effect: Changes the value of all cells in the extension_path from 0 to the LineSegment value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all maximal, continuous, straight (horizontal or vertical) segments of identical non-zero numbers within the input grid.
3.  For each identified segment:
    a.  Determine its value (the number it's made of), its orientation (horizontal or vertical), and its two endpoints.
    b.  For each endpoint of the segment:
        i.  Define the extension direction as moving away from the segment's body along its orientation (e.g., for a horizontal segment ending at `(r, c)`, the rightward extension direction checks `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c+2)`, etc.).
        ii. Examine the sequence of cells starting from the cell adjacent to the endpoint in the extension direction.
        iii. Collect all consecutive cells with value `0` along this path (the "potential extension path").
        iv. Check the cell immediately following the sequence of zeros (or determine if the path reached the grid edge).
        v. If this next cell exists within the grid boundaries *and* has a non-zero value:
            1.  Iterate through all the cells collected in the potential extension path (the zeros).
            2.  Change the value of these cells in the *output grid* to the value of the current segment.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
