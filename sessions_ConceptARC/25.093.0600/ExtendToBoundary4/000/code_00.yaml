elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - cell_type: Integer (0-9)
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - value: Integer (0-9)
  - object: LineSegment
    properties:
      - type: maximal continuous sequence of identical non-zero cells
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - value: the non-zero integer of the cells in the segment
      - endpoints: the coordinates of the two cells at the ends of the segment
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [Cell, Cell]
    details: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right)
  - type: containment
    between: [LineSegment, Cell]
    details: A LineSegment is composed of multiple Cells
  - type: extension_path
    from: LineSegment endpoint
    details: A sequence of adjacent 0-valued cells starting from one end of a LineSegment, continuing along its orientation (row or column) away from the segment's body.
  - type: blocking_cell
    for: extension_path
    details: The first non-zero cell encountered along an extension_path.
actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    on: Grid
    output: Set of LineSegments
  - action: determine_extension
    on: LineSegment endpoint
    conditions:
      - The cell adjacent to the endpoint (away from the segment body) exists within the grid.
      - This adjacent cell and potentially subsequent cells along the orientation form an extension_path.
    outcome: Either identifies a blocking_cell or reaches the grid edge.
  - action: fill_path
    on: extension_path
    using: LineSegment value
    condition: A blocking_cell was identified for this path (did not reach the edge first).
    effect: Changes the value of all cells in the extension_path from 0 to the LineSegment value.
