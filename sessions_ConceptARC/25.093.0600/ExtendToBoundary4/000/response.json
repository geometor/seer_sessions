The non-zero values used for filling seem to come from existing non-zero lines in the input.\n3.  **Identifying Lines:** The input grids contain straight, continuous lines (segments) of identical non-zero numbers, either horizontally or vertically.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves extending these line segments. A line segment is extended from one of its ends, filling adjacent `0` cells along its axis (row for horizontal lines, column for vertical lines).\n5.  **Extension Condition:** The extension continues through consecutive `0` cells until either:\n    *   A non-zero cell is encountered along the extension path.\n    *   The edge of the grid is reached.\n6.  **Filling Rule:** Only if a non-zero cell is encountered (before the edge) are the intermediate `0` cells filled with the number of the extending line segment. If the extension path reaches the edge without hitting another non-zero number, no filling occurs for that specific end/direction.\n7.  **Simultaneity:** It appears these extensions happen for all qualifying line segments and ends simultaneously or cumulatively, modifying the initial input grid to produce the final output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
