Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cell: Cell(s) containing the value '1'.
    - Partition_A: Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location.
    - Partition_B: Subgrid/Column/Row containing the Marker_Cell.
    - Partition_C: (Optional) Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location (relevant for horizontal case).
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Location: Coordinates or defining axis (column index or row indices) of '1'.
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern of '1's (single column vs. block of rows).

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Based on repeating and assembling parts derived from the input.

Actions:
  - Locate_Marker: Find the position(s) of '1'.
  - Determine_Axis: Identify if the transformation is primarily horizontal or vertical based on '1' distribution.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid into relevant parts (A, B, C or A, B) based on the marker and axis.
  - Modify_Marker_Region: Create a new element (Column 0 or Row 0) by replacing '1's with '0's in the marker's region (Partition B).
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the number of repetitions based on the size of a specific partition (Partition C for horizontal, Partition B for vertical).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and concatenating/stacking the derived parts according to the determined axis and repetition count.

Relationships:
  - Output grid's structure and content are derived from the input grid's partitions.
  - The location and pattern of '1's dictate the partitioning strategy and assembly method (horizontal vs. vertical).
  - The size of certain input partitions determines the number of repetitions in the output.
