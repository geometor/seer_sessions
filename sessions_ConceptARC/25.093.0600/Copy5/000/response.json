            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Key Element:** The number '1' seems to play a crucial role as a marker or separator within the input grid. Its position and distribution dictate the transformation type.\n3.  **Transformation Types:** Two distinct transformation patterns emerge based on the arrangement of '1's:\n    *   **Horizontal Expansion (train\\_1, train\\_2):** When '1' appears in a single column, the grid is expanded horizontally. The process involves identifying parts of the grid relative to the '1' column, modifying the '1' column, and repeating/concatenating these parts.\n    *   **Vertical Expansion (train\\_3):** When '1' appears in a block of rows (specifically, these rows start with '1' and are grouped together in the example), the grid is expanded vertically. The process involves identifying blocks of rows relative to the '1'-containing rows, creating a zero-filled row, and repeating/stacking these parts.\n4.  **Core Operations:** The transformations involve partitioning the input grid, replacing '1' with '0', repetition, and concatenation (horizontal or vertical stacking).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
