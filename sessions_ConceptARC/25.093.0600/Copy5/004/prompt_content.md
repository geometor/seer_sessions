"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two rules:

1.  **Horizontal Expansion ('column' pattern):** If all '1's are located within a single column:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Matrix_A` (columns left), `Column_B` (marker column), and `Matrix_C` (columns right).
    b.  `Column_0` is created by replacing '1's in `Column_B` with '0'.
    c.  A horizontal block `Block_H` is formed: `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` (or just `Column_0` if `Matrix_A` is empty).
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_H` is `Matrix_C.shape[1] + 1`.
    e.  The output is constructed by horizontally concatenating `Block_H` repeated `Repetitions_H` times, followed by `Matrix_A` (if it exists).

2.  **Vertical Expansion ('rows' pattern):** If all '1's are located within a contiguous block of rows:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Subgrid_A` (rows above the marker block).
    b.  `Row_0` (a row of zeros) is created with the same width as the grid.
    c.  A vertical block `Block_V` is formed: `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` (or just `Row_0` if `Subgrid_A` is empty).
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_V` is the number of rows in the marker block.
    e.  The output is constructed by vertically stacking `Block_V` repeated `Repetitions_V` times, followed by `Subgrid_A` (if it exists).

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either case, or if no '1' is found, the original input grid is returned.
