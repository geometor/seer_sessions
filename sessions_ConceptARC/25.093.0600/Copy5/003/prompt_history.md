Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The number '1' seems to play a crucial role as a marker or separator within the input grid. Its position and distribution dictate the transformation type.
3.  **Transformation Types:** Two distinct transformation patterns emerge based on the arrangement of '1's:
    *   **Horizontal Expansion (train\_1, train\_2):** When '1' appears in a single column, the grid is expanded horizontally. The process involves identifying parts of the grid relative to the '1' column, modifying the '1' column, and repeating/concatenating these parts.
    *   **Vertical Expansion (train\_3):** When '1' appears in a block of rows (specifically, these rows start with '1' and are grouped together in the example), the grid is expanded vertically. The process involves identifying blocks of rows relative to the '1'-containing rows, creating a zero-filled row, and repeating/stacking these parts.
4.  **Core Operations:** The transformations involve partitioning the input grid, replacing '1' with '0', repetition, and concatenation (horizontal or vertical stacking).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cell: Cell(s) containing the value '1'.
    - Partition_A: Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location.
    - Partition_B: Subgrid/Column/Row containing the Marker_Cell.
    - Partition_C: (Optional) Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location (relevant for horizontal case).
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Location: Coordinates or defining axis (column index or row indices) of '1'.
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern of '1's (single column vs. block of rows).

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Based on repeating and assembling parts derived from the input.

Actions:
  - Locate_Marker: Find the position(s) of '1'.
  - Determine_Axis: Identify if the transformation is primarily horizontal or vertical based on '1' distribution.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid into relevant parts (A, B, C or A, B) based on the marker and axis.
  - Modify_Marker_Region: Create a new element (Column 0 or Row 0) by replacing '1's with '0's in the marker's region (Partition B).
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the number of repetitions based on the size of a specific partition (Partition C for horizontal, Partition B for vertical).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and concatenating/stacking the derived parts according to the determined axis and repetition count.

Relationships:
  - Output grid's structure and content are derived from the input grid's partitions.
  - The location and pattern of '1's dictate the partitioning strategy and assembly method (horizontal vs. vertical).
  - The size of certain input partitions determines the number of repetitions in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Marker:** Examine the input grid to locate all cells containing the value '1'. Determine the distribution pattern of these '1's.
2.  **Branch by Pattern:**
    *   **If '1's are confined to a single column:**
        a.  Identify this column as `Column B`.
        b.  Identify the block of columns to the left of `Column B` as `Matrix A`.
        c.  Identify the block of columns to the right of `Column B` as `Matrix C`. If no columns are to the right, `Matrix C` is empty.
        d.  Create `Column 0` by copying `Column B` and changing the cell(s) containing '1' to '0'.
        e.  Count the number of columns in `Matrix C` (call this `N_right`).
        f.  Define a repeating block as the horizontal concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]`.
        g.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating the repeating block `(N_right + 1)` times, followed by `Matrix A`.
    *   **If '1's are found in a contiguous block of rows (specifically, rows where '1' appears, potentially at the start):**
        a.  Identify these rows as `Subgrid B`.
        b.  Identify the contiguous block of rows above `Subgrid B` (which do not contain '1') as `Subgrid A`. Assume `Subgrid B` is below `Subgrid A`.
        c.  Create `Row 0`, a single row filled entirely with '0's, having the same width as the input grid.
        d.  Count the number of rows in `Subgrid B` (call this `N_rows_B`).
        e.  Define a repeating block as the vertical stacking `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` (where `/` denotes stacking rows).
        f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking the repeating block `N_rows_B` times, followed by `Subgrid A`.
3.  **Return:** Output the final constructed grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two rules:

1.  **Horizontal Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a single column:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into three parts: `Matrix A` (columns left of the '1' column), `Column B` (the '1' column), and `Matrix C` (columns right of the '1' column).
    b.  A new `Column 0` is created by replacing the '1'(s) in `Column B` with '0'.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]` horizontally `N+1` times (where `N` is the number of columns in `Matrix C`), followed by a final `Matrix A`.

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a contiguous block of rows:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into two parts: `Subgrid A` (rows above the '1' block) and `Subgrid B` (the contiguous rows containing all the '1's).
    b.  A new `Row 0` is created, consisting entirely of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the vertical stack `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` `M` times (where `M` is the number of rows in `Subgrid B`), followed by a final `Subgrid A`.

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either of these specific cases, the behavior is undefined by the examples.

Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Error Analysis:** The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates that somewhere in the code, a boolean NumPy array (resulting from an element-wise comparison like `array == value`) is being used in a context that requires a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement).
2.  **Code Review:** A detailed review of the provided `transform` function didn't reveal an obvious instance of this error *within* the function's core logic, especially since `np.where` correctly handles boolean arrays. The conditional checks (`if matrix_a is not None`, etc.) targeted `None`, not boolean arrays.
3.  **Alternative Cause:** The error might stem from how NumPy handles empty arrays resulting from slicing (e.g., `grid[:, 5:]` on a 5-column grid gives a `(rows, 0)` array, not `None`). While the previous code tried to assign `None` explicitly in edge cases, a more robust approach is to directly check the `.size` attribute of sliced arrays. Using `array.size > 0` is the standard way to check if a NumPy array is non-empty.
4.  **Strategy:** We will refine the natural language program and the underlying logic to explicitly use array slicing and check for non-empty arrays using `.size > 0` instead of relying on `is not None` checks. This assumes the core partitioning and assembly logic is correct but needs more robust handling of potentially empty partitions. The ambiguity error likely arises from an unexpected interaction with these (potentially empty) array partitions, even if not immediately obvious where. We will proceed by correcting the way partitions are checked before use.

**Metrics**

Let's confirm the shapes and sizes resulting from partitioning in each training example.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker patterns

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cell: Cell(s) containing the value '1'.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Location: Coordinates or defining axis (column index or row indices) of '1'.
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern of '1's ('single_column' vs. 'contiguous_rows').

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Based on repeating and assembling parts derived from the input.

Derived_Objects (Intermediate):
  - Pattern_Type: 'column' or 'rows' (determined from Marker_Distribution).
  - Relevant_Indices: Column index for 'column' pattern, or (start_row, end_row) tuple for 'rows' pattern.
  # For 'column' pattern:
  - Matrix_A: Subgrid left of the marker column (potentially empty).
  - Column_B: The marker column.
  - Matrix_C: Subgrid right of the marker column (potentially empty).
  - Column_0: Copy of Column_B with '1' replaced by '0'.
  - Repetitions_H: Number of times to repeat horizontal block (equals number of columns in Matrix_C + 1).
  - Block_H: Horizontal concatenation [Matrix_A | Column_0] (if Matrix_A exists, else just Column_0).
  # For 'rows' pattern:
  - Subgrid_A: Subgrid above the marker rows (potentially empty).
  - Subgrid_B_RowCount: Number of rows containing the '1' markers.
  - Row_0: A new row containing only '0's, width matching input grid.
  - Repetitions_V: Number of times to repeat vertical block (equals Subgrid_B_RowCount).
  - Block_V: Vertical stack [Subgrid_A / Row_0] (if Subgrid_A exists, else just Row_0).

Actions:
  - Locate_Markers: Find all coordinates (row, col) of '1's.
  - Determine_Pattern: Analyze marker coordinates to classify pattern ('column', 'rows', or 'unknown') and find relevant indices.
  - Partition_Grid:
      - If 'column': Slice grid into Matrix_A, Column_B, Matrix_C.
      - If 'rows': Slice grid into Subgrid_A. Determine Subgrid_B_RowCount.
  - Modify_Marker_Region:
      - If 'column': Create Column_0 from Column_B by replacing '1' with '0'.
      - If 'rows': Create Row_0 filled with '0's.
  - Calculate_Repetitions:
      - If 'column': Repetitions_H = number of columns in Matrix_C + 1.
      - If 'rows': Repetitions_V = Subgrid_B_RowCount.
  - Assemble_Output:
      - If 'column':
          1. Create Block_H = [Matrix_A | Column_0] (handle empty Matrix_A).
          2. Repeat Block_H horizontally Repetitions_H times.
          3. Append Matrix_A horizontally (if it exists).
      - If 'rows':
          1. Create Block_V = [Subgrid_A / Row_0] (handle empty Subgrid_A).
          2. Repeat Block_V vertically Repetitions_V times.
          3. Append Subgrid_A vertically (if it exists).

Relationships:
  - Output grid structure depends entirely on the detected pattern ('column' or 'rows').
  - Partitions (Matrix_A, Matrix_C, Subgrid_A) can be empty (size 0) depending on marker location. Check size before use (e.g., `array.size > 0`).
  - Number of repetitions depends on the size of Matrix_C (for horizontal) or the number of rows in the marker block (for vertical).

**Natural Language Program (Refined)**

1.  **Input:** Receive the input grid (list of lists of integers).
2.  **Convert & Analyze:** Convert the input list of lists into a NumPy array. Find the coordinates of all cells containing the value '1'.
3.  **Determine Pattern:**
    *   Examine the coordinates of the '1's.
    *   If all '1's share the same column index: Set `Pattern_Type` to 'column' and `Relevant_Index` to that column index.
    *   Else if all '1's occupy a set of contiguous row indices: Set `Pattern_Type` to 'rows' and `Relevant_Indices` to the tuple `(minimum_row_index, maximum_row_index)`.
    *   Else (no '1's or other patterns): Handle as an undefined case (e.g., return the input unchanged or raise an error). Assume valid patterns based on examples.
4.  **Process by Pattern:**
    *   **If `Pattern_Type` is 'column':**
        a.  Get the `marker_col` index from `Relevant_Index`.
        b.  Slice the grid: `Matrix_A = grid[:, :marker_col]`, `Column_B = grid[:, marker_col:marker_col+1]`, `Matrix_C = grid[:, marker_col+1:]`.
        c.  Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing any '1' with '0'.
        d.  Calculate `Repetitions_H = Matrix_C.shape[1] + 1`.
        e.  Assemble the horizontal repeating block `Block_H`:
            *   If `Matrix_A.size > 0`, `Block_H = horizontal_concatenate(Matrix_A, Column_0)`.
            *   Else, `Block_H = Column_0`.
        f.  Initialize an empty list `Output_Parts`.
        g.  Append `Block_H` to `Output_Parts`, `Repetitions_H` times.
        h.  If `Matrix_A.size > 0`, append `Matrix_A` to `Output_Parts`.
        i.  Construct the final `Output_Grid` by horizontally concatenating all arrays in `Output_Parts`.
    *   **If `Pattern_Type` is 'rows':**
        a.  Get the `start_row`, `end_row` indices from `Relevant_Indices`.
        b.  Slice the grid: `Subgrid_A = grid[:start_row, :]`.
        c.  Calculate `Repetitions_V = end_row - start_row + 1`.
        d.  Create `Row_0`, a single row of '0's with the same number of columns as the input grid.
        e.  Assemble the vertical repeating block `Block_V`:
            *   If `Subgrid_A.size > 0`, `Block_V = vertical_stack(Subgrid_A, Row_0)`.
            *   Else, `Block_V = Row_0`.
        f.  Initialize an empty list `Output_Parts`.
        g.  Append `Block_V` to `Output_Parts`, `Repetitions_V` times.
        h.  If `Subgrid_A.size > 0`, append `Subgrid_A` to `Output_Parts`.
        i.  Construct the final `Output_Grid` by vertically stacking all arrays in `Output_Parts`.
5.  **Output:** Convert the final `Output_Grid` (NumPy array) back to a list of lists and return it.
