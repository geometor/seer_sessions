```python

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two rules:

1.  **Horizontal Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a single column:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into three parts: `Matrix A` (columns left of the '1' column), `Column B` (the '1' column), and `Matrix C` (columns right of the '1' column).
    b.  A new `Column 0` is created by replacing the '1'(s) in `Column B` with '0'.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]` horizontally `N+1` times (where `N` is the number of columns in `Matrix C`), followed by a final `Matrix A`.

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a contiguous block of rows:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into two parts: `Subgrid A` (rows above the '1' block) and `Subgrid B` (the contiguous rows containing all the '1's).
    b.  A new `Row 0` is created, consisting entirely of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the vertical stack `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` `M` times (where `M` is the number of rows in `Subgrid B`), followed by a final `Subgrid A`.

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either of these specific cases, the behavior is undefined by the examples.
