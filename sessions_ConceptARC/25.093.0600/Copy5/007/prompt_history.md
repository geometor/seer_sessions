Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The number '1' seems to play a crucial role as a marker or separator within the input grid. Its position and distribution dictate the transformation type.
3.  **Transformation Types:** Two distinct transformation patterns emerge based on the arrangement of '1's:
    *   **Horizontal Expansion (train\_1, train\_2):** When '1' appears in a single column, the grid is expanded horizontally. The process involves identifying parts of the grid relative to the '1' column, modifying the '1' column, and repeating/concatenating these parts.
    *   **Vertical Expansion (train\_3):** When '1' appears in a block of rows (specifically, these rows start with '1' and are grouped together in the example), the grid is expanded vertically. The process involves identifying blocks of rows relative to the '1'-containing rows, creating a zero-filled row, and repeating/stacking these parts.
4.  **Core Operations:** The transformations involve partitioning the input grid, replacing '1' with '0', repetition, and concatenation (horizontal or vertical stacking).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cell: Cell(s) containing the value '1'.
    - Partition_A: Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location.
    - Partition_B: Subgrid/Column/Row containing the Marker_Cell.
    - Partition_C: (Optional) Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location (relevant for horizontal case).
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Location: Coordinates or defining axis (column index or row indices) of '1'.
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern of '1's (single column vs. block of rows).

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Based on repeating and assembling parts derived from the input.

Actions:
  - Locate_Marker: Find the position(s) of '1'.
  - Determine_Axis: Identify if the transformation is primarily horizontal or vertical based on '1' distribution.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid into relevant parts (A, B, C or A, B) based on the marker and axis.
  - Modify_Marker_Region: Create a new element (Column 0 or Row 0) by replacing '1's with '0's in the marker's region (Partition B).
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the number of repetitions based on the size of a specific partition (Partition C for horizontal, Partition B for vertical).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and concatenating/stacking the derived parts according to the determined axis and repetition count.

Relationships:
  - Output grid's structure and content are derived from the input grid's partitions.
  - The location and pattern of '1's dictate the partitioning strategy and assembly method (horizontal vs. vertical).
  - The size of certain input partitions determines the number of repetitions in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Marker:** Examine the input grid to locate all cells containing the value '1'. Determine the distribution pattern of these '1's.
2.  **Branch by Pattern:**
    *   **If '1's are confined to a single column:**
        a.  Identify this column as `Column B`.
        b.  Identify the block of columns to the left of `Column B` as `Matrix A`.
        c.  Identify the block of columns to the right of `Column B` as `Matrix C`. If no columns are to the right, `Matrix C` is empty.
        d.  Create `Column 0` by copying `Column B` and changing the cell(s) containing '1' to '0'.
        e.  Count the number of columns in `Matrix C` (call this `N_right`).
        f.  Define a repeating block as the horizontal concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]`.
        g.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating the repeating block `(N_right + 1)` times, followed by `Matrix A`.
    *   **If '1's are found in a contiguous block of rows (specifically, rows where '1' appears, potentially at the start):**
        a.  Identify these rows as `Subgrid B`.
        b.  Identify the contiguous block of rows above `Subgrid B` (which do not contain '1') as `Subgrid A`. Assume `Subgrid B` is below `Subgrid A`.
        c.  Create `Row 0`, a single row filled entirely with '0's, having the same width as the input grid.
        d.  Count the number of rows in `Subgrid B` (call this `N_rows_B`).
        e.  Define a repeating block as the vertical stacking `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` (where `/` denotes stacking rows).
        f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking the repeating block `N_rows_B` times, followed by `Subgrid A`.
3.  **Return:** Output the final constructed grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two rules:

1.  **Horizontal Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a single column:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into three parts: `Matrix A` (columns left of the '1' column), `Column B` (the '1' column), and `Matrix C` (columns right of the '1' column).
    b.  A new `Column 0` is created by replacing the '1'(s) in `Column B` with '0'.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]` horizontally `N+1` times (where `N` is the number of columns in `Matrix C`), followed by a final `Matrix A`.

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a contiguous block of rows:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into two parts: `Subgrid A` (rows above the '1' block) and `Subgrid B` (the contiguous rows containing all the '1's).
    b.  A new `Row 0` is created, consisting entirely of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the vertical stack `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` `M` times (where `M` is the number of rows in `Subgrid B`), followed by a final `Subgrid A`.

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either of these specific cases, the behavior is undefined by the examples.

Previous Code:

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two primary rules determined by the pattern of '1's:

1.  **Vertical Expansion ('rows' pattern):** If all '1's are located within a single, contiguous block of rows (potentially spanning multiple columns).
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Subgrid_A` (rows above the marker block).
    b.  A `Row_0` (a row of zeros) is created with the same width as the grid.
    c.  A vertical block `Block_V` is formed: `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` if `Subgrid_A` exists, otherwise just `Row_0`.
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_V` is the number of rows in the marker block.
    e.  The output is constructed by vertically stacking `Block_V` repeated `Repetitions_V` times, followed by `Subgrid_A` (if it exists).

2.  **Horizontal Expansion ('column' pattern):** This pattern applies if:
    - All '1's are located within a single column.
    - OR All '1's are located within a single row (spanning multiple columns). In this case, the *leftmost* column containing a '1' is treated as the marker column.
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Matrix_A` (columns left of the marker column), `Column_B` (the marker column), and `Matrix_C` (columns right of the marker column).
    b.  `Column_0` is created by replacing '1's in `Column_B` with '0'.
    c.  A horizontal block `Block_H` is formed: `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` if `Matrix_A` exists, otherwise just `Column_0`.
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_H` is `Matrix_C.shape[1] + 1`.
    e.  The output is constructed by horizontally concatenating `Block_H` repeated `Repetitions_H` times, followed by `Matrix_A` (if it exists).

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either case, or if no '1' is found, the original input grid is returned.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed on all examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context that requires a single boolean value (like an `if` statement), but the array contains multiple elements.

However, a closer look at the provided code reveals that array emptiness checks (`matrix_a.size > 0`, `subgrid_a.size > 0`) were already implemented correctly. The root cause likely lies in the `determine_pattern_refined` function, where the logic for distinguishing between 'rows' and 'column' patterns was flawed, especially for edge cases like a single '1' or when '1's align both vertically and horizontally.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Pattern Detection:** Redefine the conditions for identifying the transformation pattern based on the precise arrangement of '1's, giving clear precedence rules. The analysis suggests three distinct patterns based on the examples:
    *   **Vertical Expansion Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in the first column (index 0) *and* form a contiguous block of rows. (Corresponds to `train_3`)
    *   **Horizontal Column Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in a single column, but *not* satisfying the Vertical Expansion pattern (i.e., column index > 0, or column index 0 but rows are not contiguous). (Corresponds to `train_1`)
    *   **Horizontal Row Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in a single row and span multiple columns. The leftmost column containing a '1' acts as the marker column for partitioning. (Corresponds to `train_2`)
2.  **Update Implementation:** Modify the `determine_pattern_refined` function to implement this new logic.
3.  **Verify Transformation Logic:** Ensure the existing horizontal and vertical expansion logic correctly aligns with these newly defined patterns.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the revised understanding.

  - Create_Zero_Region: Generate a replacement region based on the pattern:
      - Vertical: Create `Row_0` (a row of zeros).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing '1's with '0's.
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the repetition count:
      - Vertical: `N_rows_B` (height of the marker block).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: `N_cols_C + 1` (number of columns in `Matrix_C` plus one).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and assembling parts:
      - Vertical: Vertically stack `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` (or just `Row_0`) `N_rows_B` times, then append `Subgrid_A`.
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Horizontally concatenate `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` (or just `Column_0`) `N_cols_C + 1` times, then append `Matrix_A`.

Relationships:
  - The specific pattern of '1's dictates both the partitioning strategy and the assembly method (vertical vs. horizontal).
  - The size of certain input partitions (marker block height or width of Matrix_C) determines the number of repetitions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Markers:**
    a.  Read the input grid. If the grid is empty, return an empty grid.
    b.  Locate all cells containing the value '1'. Record their `(row, column)` coordinates.
    c.  If no '1's are found, return the original input grid.
    d.  Analyze the coordinates of the '1's:
        i.  Find the set of unique rows and unique columns containing '1's.
        ii. Check if all '1's are in column 0 (`is_col_zero`).
        iii.Check if the rows containing '1's form a single contiguous block (`is_contiguous_rows`).
        iv. Check if all '1's are in a single column (`is_single_col`).
        v.  Check if all '1's are in a single row (`is_single_row`).

2.  **Determine Pattern and Apply Transformation:**
    *   **If `is_col_zero` is true AND `is_contiguous_rows` is true (Vertical Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `start_row` and `end_row` of the contiguous block of '1's in column 0.
        b.  Calculate the number of repetitions `N = end_row - start_row + 1`.
        c.  Identify `Subgrid_A` as the rows of the input grid *above* `start_row`. (If `start_row` is 0, `Subgrid_A` is empty).
        d.  Create `Row_0`, a single row of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
        e.  Define the repeating unit `Block_V`: If `Subgrid_A` exists, `Block_V` is `Subgrid_A` stacked vertically on top of `Row_0`. If `Subgrid_A` is empty, `Block_V` is just `Row_0`.
        f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking `Block_V` exactly `N` times. If `Subgrid_A` exists, append a final copy of `Subgrid_A` to the bottom.
    *   **Else if `is_single_col` is true (Horizontal Column Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `marker_col` index where all '1's reside.
        b.  Identify `Matrix_A` as the columns to the left of `marker_col`. (Empty if `marker_col` is 0).
        c.  Identify `Column_B` as the `marker_col`.
        d.  Identify `Matrix_C` as the columns to the right of `marker_col`. (Empty if `marker_col` is the last column).
        e.  Calculate the number of repetitions `N = number_of_columns_in_Matrix_C + 1`.
        f.  Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing all '1's with '0's.
        g.  Define the repeating unit `Block_H`: If `Matrix_A` exists, `Block_H` is `Matrix_A` horizontally concatenated with `Column_0`. If `Matrix_A` is empty, `Block_H` is just `Column_0`.
        h.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating `Block_H` exactly `N` times. If `Matrix_A` exists, append a final copy of `Matrix_A` to the right.
    *   **Else if `is_single_row` is true AND there is more than one unique column (Horizontal Row Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `marker_col` as the *minimum* column index containing a '1'.
        b.  Perform the exact same steps (b through h) as described for the **Horizontal Column Pattern** using this `marker_col`.
    *   **Else (Unknown Pattern):**
        a.  Return the original input grid unchanged.

3.  **Return:** Output the final constructed grid.
