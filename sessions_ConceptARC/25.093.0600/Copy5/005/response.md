"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two primary rules determined by the pattern of '1's:

1.  **Vertical Expansion ('rows' pattern):** If all '1's are located within a single, contiguous block of rows (potentially spanning multiple columns).
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Subgrid_A` (rows above the marker block).
    b.  A `Row_0` (a row of zeros) is created with the same width as the grid.
    c.  A vertical block `Block_V` is formed: `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` if `Subgrid_A` exists, otherwise just `Row_0`.
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_V` is the number of rows in the marker block.
    e.  The output is constructed by vertically stacking `Block_V` repeated `Repetitions_V` times, followed by `Subgrid_A` (if it exists).

2.  **Horizontal Expansion ('column' pattern):** This pattern applies if:
    - All '1's are located within a single column.
    - OR All '1's are located within a single row (spanning multiple columns). In this case, the *leftmost* column containing a '1' is treated as the marker column.
    a.  The grid is partitioned into `Matrix_A` (columns left of the marker column), `Column_B` (the marker column), and `Matrix_C` (columns right of the marker column).
    b.  `Column_0` is created by replacing '1's in `Column_B` with '0'.
    c.  A horizontal block `Block_H` is formed: `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` if `Matrix_A` exists, otherwise just `Column_0`.
    d.  The number of repetitions `Repetitions_H` is `Matrix_C.shape[1] + 1`.
    e.  The output is constructed by horizontally concatenating `Block_H` repeated `Repetitions_H` times, followed by `Matrix_A` (if it exists).

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either case, or if no '1' is found, the original input grid is returned.
