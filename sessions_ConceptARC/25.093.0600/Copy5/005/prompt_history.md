Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The number '1' seems to play a crucial role as a marker or separator within the input grid. Its position and distribution dictate the transformation type.
3.  **Transformation Types:** Two distinct transformation patterns emerge based on the arrangement of '1's:
    *   **Horizontal Expansion (train\_1, train\_2):** When '1' appears in a single column, the grid is expanded horizontally. The process involves identifying parts of the grid relative to the '1' column, modifying the '1' column, and repeating/concatenating these parts.
    *   **Vertical Expansion (train\_3):** When '1' appears in a block of rows (specifically, these rows start with '1' and are grouped together in the example), the grid is expanded vertically. The process involves identifying blocks of rows relative to the '1'-containing rows, creating a zero-filled row, and repeating/stacking these parts.
4.  **Core Operations:** The transformations involve partitioning the input grid, replacing '1' with '0', repetition, and concatenation (horizontal or vertical stacking).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cell: Cell(s) containing the value '1'.
    - Partition_A: Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location.
    - Partition_B: Subgrid/Column/Row containing the Marker_Cell.
    - Partition_C: (Optional) Subgrid identified based on Marker_Cell location (relevant for horizontal case).
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Location: Coordinates or defining axis (column index or row indices) of '1'.
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern of '1's (single column vs. block of rows).

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Based on repeating and assembling parts derived from the input.

Actions:
  - Locate_Marker: Find the position(s) of '1'.
  - Determine_Axis: Identify if the transformation is primarily horizontal or vertical based on '1' distribution.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid into relevant parts (A, B, C or A, B) based on the marker and axis.
  - Modify_Marker_Region: Create a new element (Column 0 or Row 0) by replacing '1's with '0's in the marker's region (Partition B).
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the number of repetitions based on the size of a specific partition (Partition C for horizontal, Partition B for vertical).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and concatenating/stacking the derived parts according to the determined axis and repetition count.

Relationships:
  - Output grid's structure and content are derived from the input grid's partitions.
  - The location and pattern of '1's dictate the partitioning strategy and assembly method (horizontal vs. vertical).
  - The size of certain input partitions determines the number of repetitions in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Marker:** Examine the input grid to locate all cells containing the value '1'. Determine the distribution pattern of these '1's.
2.  **Branch by Pattern:**
    *   **If '1's are confined to a single column:**
        a.  Identify this column as `Column B`.
        b.  Identify the block of columns to the left of `Column B` as `Matrix A`.
        c.  Identify the block of columns to the right of `Column B` as `Matrix C`. If no columns are to the right, `Matrix C` is empty.
        d.  Create `Column 0` by copying `Column B` and changing the cell(s) containing '1' to '0'.
        e.  Count the number of columns in `Matrix C` (call this `N_right`).
        f.  Define a repeating block as the horizontal concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]`.
        g.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating the repeating block `(N_right + 1)` times, followed by `Matrix A`.
    *   **If '1's are found in a contiguous block of rows (specifically, rows where '1' appears, potentially at the start):**
        a.  Identify these rows as `Subgrid B`.
        b.  Identify the contiguous block of rows above `Subgrid B` (which do not contain '1') as `Subgrid A`. Assume `Subgrid B` is below `Subgrid A`.
        c.  Create `Row 0`, a single row filled entirely with '0's, having the same width as the input grid.
        d.  Count the number of rows in `Subgrid B` (call this `N_rows_B`).
        e.  Define a repeating block as the vertical stacking `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` (where `/` denotes stacking rows).
        f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking the repeating block `N_rows_B` times, followed by `Subgrid A`.
3.  **Return:** Output the final constructed grid.
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and pattern of the number '1'.

The transformation follows one of two rules:

1.  **Horizontal Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a single column:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into three parts: `Matrix A` (columns left of the '1' column), `Column B` (the '1' column), and `Matrix C` (columns right of the '1' column).
    b.  A new `Column 0` is created by replacing the '1'(s) in `Column B` with '0'.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the concatenation `[Matrix A | Column 0]` horizontally `N+1` times (where `N` is the number of columns in `Matrix C`), followed by a final `Matrix A`.

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** If all '1's are located within a contiguous block of rows:
    a.  The grid is partitioned into two parts: `Subgrid A` (rows above the '1' block) and `Subgrid B` (the contiguous rows containing all the '1's).
    b.  A new `Row 0` is created, consisting entirely of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
    c.  The output is constructed by repeating the vertical stack `[Subgrid A / Row 0]` `M` times (where `M` is the number of rows in `Subgrid B`), followed by a final `Subgrid A`.

If the '1' pattern doesn't match either of these specific cases, the behavior is undefined by the examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code attempt failed consistently across all examples with a `ValueError` related to the ambiguous truth value of NumPy arrays. This indicates the core logic of identifying the '1' marker pattern (single column vs. contiguous rows) and applying the corresponding expansion (horizontal vs. vertical) is likely sound, but the implementation faltered on conditional checks involving potentially empty NumPy array partitions (e.g., `Matrix A` when the marker is in the first column, or `Subgrid A` when marker rows start from the first row).

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the implementation error by replacing ambiguous boolean checks like `if array:` with explicit size checks like `if array.size > 0:`.
2.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to explicitly mention these checks and handle edge cases where partitions might be empty.
3.  Verify the partitioning and repetition logic using code execution to gather metrics.

**Metrics:**

Let's verify the partitioning, repetition counts, and expected output dimensions for each training example.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Identified as `column` pattern at index 4. Matrix A (4x4), Matrix C (4x0). Repetitions = 0 + 1 = 1. Output cols = (4+1)*1 + 4 = 9. Matches expected.
*   **Example 2:** *Correction:* My manual analysis was wrong. The code identifies this as a `rows` pattern at index (0, 0), *not* a column pattern. Let's re-evaluate Example 2 based on the `rows` pattern.
    *   Input: `[[3, 3, 3, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]`
    *   Markers: `(0, 3), (0, 4)`. Unique rows = {0}. Unique cols = {3, 4}. Not a single column.
    *   Contiguous rows: Min row = 0, Max row = 0. `len(unique_rows)` (1) == `max_row - min_row + 1` (1). So, it *is* a `rows` pattern with `start_row=0`, `end_row=0`.
    *   `Subgrid A` (rows above row 0) is empty (shape 0x5).
    *   `Repetitions V` = `end_row - start_row + 1` = 1.
    *   `Row 0` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (shape 1x5).
    *   `Block V`: Since Subgrid A is empty, `Block V` is just `Row 0` (shape 1x5).
    *   Assemble: Repeat `Block V` (Row 0) `Repetitions V` (1) times, then add `Subgrid A` (empty). Output = `Row 0` (shape 1x5).
    *   This prediction (`[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`) *does not match* the expected output `[[3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3], ...]`.
    *   **Conclusion for Example 2:** The initial pattern detection (`determine_pattern`) logic needs refinement. It incorrectly prioritizes the `rows` pattern check when the markers span multiple columns within a single row. The intended logic for example 2 should be the `column` pattern based on visual inspection of the output (horizontal expansion). Let's assume the *intent* was the column pattern centered around the *first* column containing a '1'. In Example 2, the first '1' appears in column 3.
        *   If `marker_col = 3`: Matrix A (3x3), Col B (3x1), Matrix C (3x1). Reps = 1 + 1 = 2. Output cols = (3+1)*2 + 3 = 11. This matches the expected output shape.
*   **Example 3:** Identified as `column` pattern at index 0. Matrix A (6x0), Col B (6x1), Matrix C (6x3). Repetitions = 3 + 1 = 4. Output cols = (0+1)*4 + 0 = 4.
    *   This prediction (`column` pattern) *does not match* the expected output, which clearly shows vertical expansion.
    *   **Conclusion for Example 3:** The initial pattern detection logic failed again. The presence of '1's only in column 0 caused it to trigger the `column` pattern rule. However, the output indicates a `rows` pattern rule should apply. The '1's are in rows 3, 4, 5. These rows are contiguous. Min row = 3, Max row = 5. `len(unique_rows)` (3) == `max_row - min_row + 1` (3). This *should* be detected as a `rows` pattern with `start_row=3`, `end_row=5`.
        *   If `rows` pattern (3, 5): Subgrid A (3x4), Marker rows = 3. Reps = 3. Output rows = (3+1)*3 + 3 = 15. This matches the expected output shape.

**Revised Pattern Detection Strategy:**

The `determine_pattern` function needs adjustment:
1.  Prioritize the `rows` pattern check *if* the markers span multiple columns *but* are confined to a contiguous block of rows.
2.  If the `rows` pattern check fails (markers not in contiguous rows), *then* check for the `column` pattern (markers confined to a single column).
3.  For the `column` pattern, if multiple columns contain '1's but they are all in the *same row* (like Example 2), we need a tie-breaker rule. Based on Example 2's output, the rule seems to be: use the *leftmost* column containing a '1' as the marker column (`Column B`).

Let's refine `determine_pattern` logic:
*   Find all marker positions. If none, return 'unknown'.
*   Get unique rows and columns.
*   **Check Rows Pattern First:** Calculate min/max row. If `len(unique_rows) == max_row - min_row + 1`, return `('rows', (min_row, max_row))`.
*   **Check Column Pattern Second:** If `len(unique_cols) == 1`, return `('column', unique_cols.pop())`.
*   **Check Single Row, Multi-Column Case (like Example 2):** If `len(unique_rows) == 1` and `len(unique_cols) > 1`, return `('column', min(unique_cols))`. (Use the leftmost column).
*   Otherwise, return 'unknown'.

**YAML Facts (Revised):**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker patterns

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cells: List of (row, col) tuples for cells containing '1'.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Distribution: Pattern derived from Marker_Cells ('rows', 'column', 'unknown').
    - Marker_Indices:
        - If 'rows': (start_row, end_row) of the contiguous block.
        - If 'column': column_index (leftmost if '1's are in multiple columns of a single row).

Actions:
  - Locate_Markers: Find all coordinates of '1'.
  - Determine_Pattern:
      - Check if markers form a contiguous block of rows. If yes, pattern is 'rows'.
      - Else, check if markers are in a single column. If yes, pattern is 'column'.
      - Else, check if markers are in a single row but multiple columns. If yes, pattern is 'column' (using the minimum column index).
      - Else, pattern is 'unknown'.
  - Partition_Grid:
      - If 'rows': Identify `Subgrid_A` (rows above marker block).
      - If 'column': Identify `Matrix_A` (cols left), `Column_B` (marker col), `Matrix_C` (cols right). Check partitions for non-zero size.
  - Create_Zero_Region:
      - If 'rows': Create `Row_0` (zero-filled row).
      - If 'column': Create `Column_0` (copy `Column_B`, replace '1's with '0's).
  - Calculate_Repetitions:
      - If 'rows': Count rows in the marker block (`Repetitions_V`).
      - If 'column': Count columns in `Matrix_C` + 1 (`Repetitions_H`).
  - Assemble_Output:
      - If 'rows': Vertically stack `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` (or `Row_0` if `Subgrid_A` is empty) `Repetitions_V` times, then append `Subgrid_A` (if non-empty).
      - If 'column': Horizontally concatenate `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` (or `Column_0` if `Matrix_A` is empty) `Repetitions_H` times, then append `Matrix_A` (if non-empty).

Relationships:
  - Output structure depends critically on the determined Marker_Distribution pattern.
  - Empty partitions (Matrix_A, Subgrid_A) must be handled correctly during assembly.
  - Repetition count depends on the size of a specific partition ('rows' block height or Matrix_C width).
```


**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Locate Markers:** Find the row and column coordinates of all cells containing the value '1' in the input grid. If no '1's are found, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Determine Pattern:**
    a.  Collect the unique row indices and unique column indices of the markers.
    b.  **Check Rows Pattern:** Calculate the minimum (`min_row`) and maximum (`max_row`) row index containing a marker. If the number of unique marker rows equals `max_row - min_row + 1`, the pattern is `rows`, and the relevant indices are `(min_row, max_row)`. Proceed to step 3 (Vertical Expansion).
    c.  **Check Column Pattern:** If the pattern is not `rows`, check if there is only one unique column index containing markers. If yes, the pattern is `column`, and the relevant index is that column index. Proceed to step 4 (Horizontal Expansion).
    d.  **Check Single Row/Multi-Column Case:** If the pattern is not `rows` or `column`, check if there is only one unique row index containing markers but multiple unique column indices. If yes, the pattern is `column`, and the relevant index is the *minimum* (leftmost) column index containing a marker. Proceed to step 4 (Horizontal Expansion).
    e.  **Unknown Pattern:** If none of the above conditions are met, return the input grid unchanged.
3.  **Vertical Expansion (Rows Pattern):**
    a.  Get the `start_row` and `end_row` from the determined indices.
    b.  Identify `Subgrid A` as the rows of the input grid *above* `start_row`. Check if `Subgrid A` has a size greater than zero.
    c.  Calculate the number of repetitions (`Repetitions V`) as `end_row - start_row + 1`.
    d.  Create `Row 0`, a single row filled with zeros, having the same width as the input grid.
    e.  Define the repeating block `Block V`: If `Subgrid A` has size > 0, `Block V` is `Subgrid A` stacked vertically on top of `Row 0`. Otherwise, `Block V` is just `Row 0`.
    f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking `Block V` repeated `Repetitions V` times. If `Subgrid A` has size > 0, append `Subgrid A` to the bottom of the result.
    g.  Return the constructed grid.
4.  **Horizontal Expansion (Column Pattern):**
    a.  Get the `marker_col` index from the determined index.
    b.  Identify `Matrix A` as the columns of the input grid to the *left* of `marker_col`. Check if `Matrix A` has a size greater than zero.
    c.  Identify `Column B` as the single column at `marker_col`.
    d.  Identify `Matrix C` as the columns of the input grid to the *right* of `marker_col`. Check if `Matrix C` has a size greater than zero.
    e.  Create `Column 0` by copying `Column B` and replacing any '1's with '0's.
    f.  Calculate the number of repetitions (`Repetitions H`) as the number of columns in `Matrix C` plus 1.
    g.  Define the repeating block `Block H`: If `Matrix A` has size > 0, `Block H` is `Matrix A` horizontally concatenated with `Column 0`. Otherwise, `Block H` is just `Column 0`.
    h.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating `Block H` repeated `Repetitions H` times. If `Matrix A` has size > 0, append `Matrix A` to the right end of the result.
    i.  Return the constructed grid.
