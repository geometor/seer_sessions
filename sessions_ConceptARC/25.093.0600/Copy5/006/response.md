## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed on all examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context that requires a single boolean value (like an `if` statement), but the array contains multiple elements.

However, a closer look at the provided code reveals that array emptiness checks (`matrix_a.size > 0`, `subgrid_a.size > 0`) were already implemented correctly. The root cause likely lies in the `determine_pattern_refined` function, where the logic for distinguishing between 'rows' and 'column' patterns was flawed, especially for edge cases like a single '1' or when '1's align both vertically and horizontally.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Pattern Detection:** Redefine the conditions for identifying the transformation pattern based on the precise arrangement of '1's, giving clear precedence rules. The analysis suggests three distinct patterns based on the examples:
    *   **Vertical Expansion Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in the first column (index 0) *and* form a contiguous block of rows. (Corresponds to `train_3`)
    *   **Horizontal Column Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in a single column, but *not* satisfying the Vertical Expansion pattern (i.e., column index > 0, or column index 0 but rows are not contiguous). (Corresponds to `train_1`)
    *   **Horizontal Row Pattern:** Triggered when all '1's are in a single row and span multiple columns. The leftmost column containing a '1' acts as the marker column for partitioning. (Corresponds to `train_2`)
2.  **Update Implementation:** Modify the `determine_pattern_refined` function to implement this new logic.
3.  **Verify Transformation Logic:** Ensure the existing horizontal and vertical expansion logic correctly aligns with these newly defined patterns.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the revised understanding.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather precise data about the input grids and marker positions.

import numpy as np

            [4, 4, 4, 4, 1],
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 0],
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 0],
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
        ]
    },
    "train_2": {
        "input": [
            [3, 3, 3, 1, 1],
            [3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
            [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
        ]
    },
    "train_3": {
        "input": [
            [6, 6, 6, 6],
            [6, 4, 4, 6],
            [6, 6, 6, 6],
            [1, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0, 0]

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker pattern and location.

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cells: List of (row, col) tuples for cells containing '1'.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Pattern: Derived from Marker_Cells distribution. Can be:
        - Vertical: All '1's in column 0, forming a contiguous row block.
        - Horizontal_Column: All '1's in a single column (not pattern Vertical).
        - Horizontal_Row: All '1's in a single row, spanning multiple columns.
        - Unknown: Pattern doesn't match the above.
    - Marker_Indices: Relevant row/column index(es) based on the pattern:
        - Vertical: (start_row, end_row) of the '1' block.
        - Horizontal_Column: column_index containing '1's.
        - Horizontal_Row: min_column_index containing '1's.

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Dependent on the identified Marker_Pattern.

Actions:
  - Locate_Markers: Find all coordinates of '1's.
  - Determine_Pattern: Analyze marker coordinates to classify into Vertical, Horizontal_Column, Horizontal_Row, or Unknown pattern and identify relevant indices.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid based on the pattern and indices:
      - Vertical: Identify `Subgrid_A` (rows above marker block). Determine marker block height `N_rows_B`.
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Identify `Matrix_A` (cols left of marker col), `Column_B` (marker col), `Matrix_C` (cols right of marker col).
  - Create_Zero_Region: Generate a replacement region based on the pattern:
      - Vertical: Create `Row_0` (a row of zeros).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing '1's with '0's.
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the repetition count:
      - Vertical: `N_rows_B` (height of the marker block).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: `N_cols_C + 1` (number of columns in `Matrix_C` plus one).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and assembling parts:
      - Vertical: Vertically stack `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` (or just `Row_0`) `N_rows_B` times, then append `Subgrid_A`.
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Horizontally concatenate `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` (or just `Column_0`) `N_cols_C + 1` times, then append `Matrix_A`.

Relationships:
  - The specific pattern of '1's dictates both the partitioning strategy and the assembly method (vertical vs. horizontal).
  - The size of certain input partitions (marker block height or width of Matrix_C) determines the number of repetitions.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Markers:**
    a.  Read the input grid. If the grid is empty, return an empty grid.
    b.  Locate all cells containing the value '1'. Record their `(row, column)` coordinates.
    c.  If no '1's are found, return the original input grid.
    d.  Analyze the coordinates of the '1's:
        i.  Find the set of unique rows and unique columns containing '1's.
        ii. Check if all '1's are in column 0 (`is_col_zero`).
        iii.Check if the rows containing '1's form a single contiguous block (`is_contiguous_rows`).
        iv. Check if all '1's are in a single column (`is_single_col`).
        v.  Check if all '1's are in a single row (`is_single_row`).

2.  **Determine Pattern and Apply Transformation:**
    *   **If `is_col_zero` is true AND `is_contiguous_rows` is true (Vertical Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `start_row` and `end_row` of the contiguous block of '1's in column 0.
        b.  Calculate the number of repetitions `N = end_row - start_row + 1`.
        c.  Identify `Subgrid_A` as the rows of the input grid *above* `start_row`. (If `start_row` is 0, `Subgrid_A` is empty).
        d.  Create `Row_0`, a single row of '0's with the same width as the input grid.
        e.  Define the repeating unit `Block_V`: If `Subgrid_A` exists, `Block_V` is `Subgrid_A` stacked vertically on top of `Row_0`. If `Subgrid_A` is empty, `Block_V` is just `Row_0`.
        f.  Construct the output by vertically stacking `Block_V` exactly `N` times. If `Subgrid_A` exists, append a final copy of `Subgrid_A` to the bottom.
    *   **Else if `is_single_col` is true (Horizontal Column Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `marker_col` index where all '1's reside.
        b.  Identify `Matrix_A` as the columns to the left of `marker_col`. (Empty if `marker_col` is 0).
        c.  Identify `Column_B` as the `marker_col`.
        d.  Identify `Matrix_C` as the columns to the right of `marker_col`. (Empty if `marker_col` is the last column).
        e.  Calculate the number of repetitions `N = number_of_columns_in_Matrix_C + 1`.
        f.  Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing all '1's with '0's.
        g.  Define the repeating unit `Block_H`: If `Matrix_A` exists, `Block_H` is `Matrix_A` horizontally concatenated with `Column_0`. If `Matrix_A` is empty, `Block_H` is just `Column_0`.
        h.  Construct the output by horizontally concatenating `Block_H` exactly `N` times. If `Matrix_A` exists, append a final copy of `Matrix_A` to the right.
    *   **Else if `is_single_row` is true AND there is more than one unique column (Horizontal Row Pattern):**
        a.  Identify the `marker_col` as the *minimum* column index containing a '1'.
        b.  Perform the exact same steps (b through h) as described for the **Horizontal Column Pattern** using this `marker_col`.
    *   **Else (Unknown Pattern):**
        a.  Return the original input grid unchanged.

3.  **Return:** Output the final constructed grid.
