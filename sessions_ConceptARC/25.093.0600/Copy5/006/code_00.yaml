Task: Grid Transformation based on '1' marker pattern and location.

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Objects:
    - Grid: The entire input matrix.
    - Marker_Cells: List of (row, col) tuples for cells containing '1'.
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: rows, columns
    - Marker_Pattern: Derived from Marker_Cells distribution. Can be:
        - Vertical: All '1's in column 0, forming a contiguous row block.
        - Horizontal_Column: All '1's in a single column (not pattern Vertical).
        - Horizontal_Row: All '1's in a single row, spanning multiple columns.
        - Unknown: Pattern doesn't match the above.
    - Marker_Indices: Relevant row/column index(es) based on the pattern:
        - Vertical: (start_row, end_row) of the '1' block.
        - Horizontal_Column: column_index containing '1's.
        - Horizontal_Row: min_column_index containing '1's.

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid (List of Lists of Integers)
  Construction: Dependent on the identified Marker_Pattern.

Actions:
  - Locate_Markers: Find all coordinates of '1's.
  - Determine_Pattern: Analyze marker coordinates to classify into Vertical, Horizontal_Column, Horizontal_Row, or Unknown pattern and identify relevant indices.
  - Partition_Grid: Divide the input grid based on the pattern and indices:
      - Vertical: Identify `Subgrid_A` (rows above marker block). Determine marker block height `N_rows_B`.
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Identify `Matrix_A` (cols left of marker col), `Column_B` (marker col), `Matrix_C` (cols right of marker col).
  - Create_Zero_Region: Generate a replacement region based on the pattern:
      - Vertical: Create `Row_0` (a row of zeros).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Create `Column_0` by copying `Column_B` and replacing '1's with '0's.
  - Calculate_Repetitions: Determine the repetition count:
      - Vertical: `N_rows_B` (height of the marker block).
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: `N_cols_C + 1` (number of columns in `Matrix_C` plus one).
  - Assemble_Output: Construct the output grid by repeating and assembling parts:
      - Vertical: Vertically stack `[Subgrid_A / Row_0]` (or just `Row_0`) `N_rows_B` times, then append `Subgrid_A`.
      - Horizontal_Column/Row: Horizontally concatenate `[Matrix_A | Column_0]` (or just `Column_0`) `N_cols_C + 1` times, then append `Matrix_A`.

Relationships:
  - The specific pattern of '1's dictates both the partitioning strategy and the assembly method (vertical vs. horizontal).
  - The size of certain input partitions (marker block height or width of Matrix_C) determines the number of repetitions.
