            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 5x5 grids containing single-digit non-negative integers.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Both input and output grids exhibit forms of symmetry (rotational and/or reflectional).\n3.  **Value Palette:** Each input grid uses primarily three distinct values: zero and two other non-zero digits. Let's call the non-zero digit appearing in the corners `V1` and the other non-zero digit `V2`.\n4.  **Positional Patterns (Input):**\n    *   `V1` typically appears at the corners (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) and in an inner diamond shape (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3).\n    *   `V2` typically appears in a cross shape around the center (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).\n    *   Zero appears at the center (2,2) and along the edges (excluding corners).\n5.  **Positional Patterns (Output):**\n    *   The output grid also uses `V1` and `V2`.\n    *   `V1` appears in the inner diamond (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) and now *also* at the center (2,2).\n    *   `V2` appears on the middle row/column edges (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2).\n    *   Zeros fill the remaining positions, notably where `V1` was in the corners and where `V2` was in the input.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the non-zero values (`V1` and `V2`) based on specific coordinate mappings and changing certain values to zero. The values themselves (`V1`, `V2`) are preserved but moved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
