Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 5x5 grids containing single-digit non-negative integers.
2.  **Symmetry:** Both input and output grids exhibit forms of symmetry (rotational and/or reflectional).
3.  **Value Palette:** Each input grid uses primarily three distinct values: zero and two other non-zero digits. Let's call the non-zero digit appearing in the corners `V1` and the other non-zero digit `V2`.
4.  **Positional Patterns (Input):**
    *   `V1` typically appears at the corners (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) and in an inner diamond shape (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3).
    *   `V2` typically appears in a cross shape around the center (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).
    *   Zero appears at the center (2,2) and along the edges (excluding corners).
5.  **Positional Patterns (Output):**
    *   The output grid also uses `V1` and `V2`.
    *   `V1` appears in the inner diamond (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) and now *also* at the center (2,2).
    *   `V2` appears on the middle row/column edges (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2).
    *   Zeros fill the remaining positions, notably where `V1` was in the corners and where `V2` was in the input.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the non-zero values (`V1` and `V2`) based on specific coordinate mappings and changing certain values to zero. The values themselves (`V1`, `V2`) are preserved but moved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: grid
    rows: 5
    columns: 5
    cell_type: integer (0-9)

Objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - contains three distinct values: 0, V1, V2
      - V1 pattern: Corners and inner diamond ((0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4), (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3))
      - V2 pattern: Inner cross ((1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2))
      - Center value: 0 at (2,2)
  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - contains three distinct values: 0, V1, V2 (same V1, V2 as input)
      - V1 pattern: Inner diamond and center ((1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), (2,2))
      - V2 pattern: Outer cross ((0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2))
      - Corner values: 0

Relationships & Actions:
  - action: Identify V1 and V2
    input: Input Grid
    details: V1 is the value at (0,0), V2 is the value at (1,2).
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    details: Initialize a 5x5 grid with zeros.
  - action: Map V1 positions
    input_locations: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)
    output_locations: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)
    value: V1
  - action: Set center value
    output_location: (2,2)
    value: V1
  - action: Map V2 positions
    mappings:
      - input: (1,2) -> output: (0,2)
      - input: (2,1) -> output: (2,0)
      - input: (2,3) -> output: (2,4)
      - input: (3,2) -> output: (4,2)
    value: V2
  - action: Set remaining cells to zero
    details: All cells in the output grid not explicitly set by the above actions remain zero.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 5x5 grid, filling it entirely with zeros. This will be the output grid.
2.  Identify the non-zero value present at the input grid's corner (e.g., coordinate (0,0)); call this value `V1`.
3.  Identify the non-zero value present at the input grid's coordinate (1,2); call this value `V2`.
4.  Copy the value `V1` to the output grid at coordinates (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3).
5.  Set the value of the center cell (2,2) in the output grid to `V1`.
6.  Copy the value `V2` to the output grid at coordinates (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), and (4,2).
7.  The final output grid is the result of these operations.
