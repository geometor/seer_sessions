The input grid contains a background value (0), some structure elements (4), and a single marker (7). The output grid retains the dimensions of the input but replaces the original content. It consists of the background value (0) and a 3x3 square filled with a specific value (4). The key insight is that the position of the number 7 in the input grid determines the center position of the 3x3 square of 4s in the output grid. The original arrangement of 4s in the input is ignored in the output construction.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Determine the top-left corner coordinates for a 3x3 square centered at the found marker coordinates. This is (marker_row - 1, marker_col - 1).\n    4.

For each cell within this 3x3 area, check if its coordinates are within the valid bounds of the output grid.\n    6.
