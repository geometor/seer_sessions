task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensionality: 2D
      - cell_content: integers
      - size: variable (observed as 5x5 in examples)
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
  - name: non_zero_numbers
    description: The set of unique integers greater than 0 present in the input grid.
  - name: frequency_map
    description: A mapping from each non_zero_number to its count of occurrences in the input_grid.
  - name: target_number
    description: The non_zero_number with the highest frequency in the frequency_map. If there's a tie, the examples don't explicitly cover this, but the logic implies any one of the tied most frequent numbers could be chosen (though the examples provided don't have ties).
relationships:
  - type: derived_from
    source: output_grid
    target: input_grid
actions:
  - name: count_frequency
    input: input_grid
    output: frequency_map
    description: Count the occurrences of each distinct non-zero number in the input grid.
  - name: find_most_frequent
    input: frequency_map
    output: target_number
    description: Identify the non-zero number with the highest count.
  - name: replace_non_zeros
    input:
      - input_grid
      - target_number
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by iterating through the input grid. If a cell contains a non-zero number, replace it with the target_number. If a cell contains zero, keep it as zero.
