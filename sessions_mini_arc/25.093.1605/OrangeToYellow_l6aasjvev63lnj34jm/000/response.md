## Perception of Task Elements

The input and output are both 5x5 grids containing single-digit integers. The core transformation involves locating two specific numbers, '7' and '4', within the input grid and swapping their positions while modifying the original '7'. Specifically, the cell originally containing '7' is changed to '1', and the cell originally containing '4' is changed to '7'. All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial state of the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the cell containing the value '7' in the input grid. Store these as `location_of_seven`.
3.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the cell containing the value '4' in the input grid. Store these as `location_of_four`.
4.  In the output grid, update the cell at `location_of_seven` to have the value '1'.
5.  In the output grid, update the cell at `location_of_four` to have the value '7'.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
