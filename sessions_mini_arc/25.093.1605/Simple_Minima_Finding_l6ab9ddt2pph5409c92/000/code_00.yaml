task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9)
      - structure: rows and columns
  - object: input_grid
    relation: source data for transformation
  - object: output_grid
    relation: result of transformation applied to input_grid
    properties:
      - same dimensions as input_grid
actions:
  - action: copy_rows
    source: input_grid
    destination: output_grid
    details: Rows from index 1 to the end are copied verbatim.
  - action: determine_fill_value
    source: input_grid
    process:
      - scan columns from left (index 0) to right.
      - within each column, scan rows from top (index 0) to bottom.
      - identify the value of the first cell encountered that is not zero.
    result: fill_value (an integer)
  - action: modify_first_row
    target: output_grid
    details: Replace every element in the first row (index 0) with the determined fill_value.
relationships:
  - The output grid's rows from index 1 onwards are identical to the input grid's corresponding rows.
  - The output grid's first row's content depends entirely on the first non-zero value found in the input grid using a column-major, row-minor scanning order.
