*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task operates on a square grid of numbers (likely 5x5 in these examples).
    *   Each grid contains primarily zeros (representing empty space or background) and a single unique non-zero digit (e.g., 3 in example 1, 2 in example 2). This non-zero digit appears multiple times.
    *   The transformation rearranges the positions of the non-zero digits within the grid, preserving their values. Zeros also change position accordingly.
    *   Comparing the input and output grids across all examples reveals a consistent spatial rearrangement. Specifically, the element at row `r`, column `c` in the input grid appears at row `c`, column `r` in the output grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - contains: cells
      - object: cell
        properties:
          - value: integer (either 0 or a specific non-zero digit per task instance)
          - role: 0 represents background/empty, non-zero represents foreground/marker
          - position: defined by row and column index
      - object: non-zero digit
        properties:
          - value: consistent within a single task instance (e.g., 3, 2, 8, 4)
          - role: marker or object being manipulated
    action:
      - type: rearrangement
        description: The positions of all cells are systematically changed.
    relationship:
      - input_cell(row_r, col_c) transforms_to output_cell(row_c, col_r)
      - This relationship holds for all cells (both zero and non-zero).
      - The value of the cell is preserved during the transformation.
    derived_operation:
      - name: Transposition
        description: The operation is equivalent to a matrix transpose, where rows of the input become columns of the output, and columns of the input become rows of the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid as a two-dimensional array.
    2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially empty or filled with zeros.
    3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, identified by its row index `r` and column index `c`.
    4.  For each input cell at `(r, c)`, take its value.
    5.  Place this value into the output grid at the position `(c, r)` (swapping the row and column indices).
    6.  After iterating through all input cells, the output grid contains the transformed result. Return the output grid.
