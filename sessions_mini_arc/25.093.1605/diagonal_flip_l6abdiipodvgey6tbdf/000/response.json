This non-zero digit appears multiple times.\n    *   The transformation rearranges the positions of the non-zero digits within the grid, preserving their values. Zeros also change position accordingly.\n    *   Comparing the input and output grids across all examples reveals a consistent spatial rearrangement. Specifically, the element at row `r`, column `c` in the input grid appears at row `c`, column `r` in the output grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
