def transform(input_grid: List[str]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on a permutation rule applied to non-'3' digits.

    The transformation identifies all digits not equal to 3 (foreground digits) 
    in the input 5x5 grid. It determines the coordinates of these foreground 
    digits and sorts these coordinates first by row, then by column. Let N be 
    the number of foreground digits. A cyclic shift `k` is calculated based 
    on the parity of N: `k=1` if N is odd, and `k=0` if N is even. 

    The transformation then permutes the foreground digits: the digit 
    originally at the i-th coordinate in the sorted list is moved to the 
    location originally occupied by the ((i + k) mod N)-th coordinate in 
    the sorted list. The rest of the grid remains filled with the background 
    digit 3.

    Note: This rule is derived primarily from examples 2 and 3; example 1 
    appears to follow a different, more complex permutation rule not captured
    by this simple parity-based cyclic shift.
