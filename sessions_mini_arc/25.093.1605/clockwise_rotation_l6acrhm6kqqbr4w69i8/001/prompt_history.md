Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 5x5 grids containing single digits.
2.  **Dominant Value:** The digit '3' appears frequently and seems to act as a background or default value.
3.  **Active Values:** Digits other than '3' (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear in specific locations. These seem to be the "objects" being manipulated.
4.  **Conservation:** The set of non-'3' digits present in the input appears to be the same as the set of non-'3' digits in the output for each example. For instance, in `train_1`, the input has {1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9} (excluding '3's) and the output also has {1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9}.
5.  **Positional Changes:** While the *values* of non-'3' digits are conserved, their *positions* change between input and output. The '3's generally remain in place, unless a non-'3' digit moves into their location, or a non-'3' digit moves out, leaving a '3'.
6.  **Mapping:** The core transformation seems to involve mapping the initial positions of non-'3' digits to new positions in the output grid. It looks like a permutation of the locations of the non-'3' digits.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of digits
      - dimensions: 5x5 (consistent across examples)
      - background_digit: 3
  - element: cell
    properties:
      - contains: single digit
  - element: foreground_digit
    properties:
      - value: any digit not equal to 3
      - role: object being moved
  - element: background_digit
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - role: static background, fills empty space

relationships:
  - type: conservation
    description: The multiset of foreground_digits in the input grid is identical to the multiset of foreground_digits in the output grid.
  - type: positional_permutation
    description: The locations of the foreground_digits in the input grid are permuted to new locations in the output grid. The specific permutation rule varies between examples.

actions:
  - action: identify_foreground
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates containing foreground_digits
  - action: identify_background
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates containing background_digit (3)
  - action: determine_permutation
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, output grid
    output: a mapping (permutation) from input coordinates of foreground_digits to output coordinates of foreground_digits, preserving the digit value.
  - action: apply_permutation
    actor: transformation process
    input: input grid, permutation rule
    output: output grid
    steps:
      - Create a new grid filled with the background_digit (3).
      - For each foreground_digit at coordinate C_in in the input grid:
        - Find its target coordinate C_out using the permutation rule.
        - Place the foreground_digit value into the new grid at C_out.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 5x5 grid filled entirely with the background digit '3'.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain a digit other than '3'. Record their coordinates and their digit values. Let this set of coordinates be `SourceCoords` and the corresponding values be `SourceValues`.
3.  Identify all cells in the corresponding *example output* grid that contain a digit other than '3'. Record their coordinates. Let this set of coordinates be `TargetCoords`.
4.  Determine the specific permutation `P` that maps each coordinate `c_in` in `SourceCoords` to a unique coordinate `c_out` in `TargetCoords` such that the value `Input[c_in]` is equal to `Output[c_out]`. This permutation is implicitly defined by comparing the input and output grids of the specific example.
5.  Iterate through each coordinate `c_in` in `SourceCoords`.
6.  Retrieve the digit value `v = Input[c_in]`.
7.  Determine the corresponding target coordinate `c_out = P(c_in)` using the permutation found in step 4.
8.  Place the value `v` into the initialized output grid at coordinate `c_out`.
9.  The final state of the initialized grid after processing all foreground digits is the result.
