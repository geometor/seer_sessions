These seem to be the \"objects\" being manipulated.\n4.  **Conservation:** The set of non-'3' digits present in the input appears to be the same as the set of non-'3' digits in the output for each example. For instance, in `train_1`, the input has {1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9} (excluding '3's) and the output also has {1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9}.\n5.  **Positional Changes:** While the *values* of non-'3' digits are conserved, their *positions* change between input and output. The '3's generally remain in place, unless a non-'3' digit moves into their location, or a non-'3' digit moves out, leaving a '3'.\n6.  **Mapping:** The core transformation seems to involve mapping the initial positions of non-'3' digits to new positions in the output grid. It looks like a permutation of the locations of the non-'3' digits.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This permutation is implicitly defined by comparing the input and output grids of the specific example.\n5.  Iterate through each coordinate `c_in` in `SourceCoords`.\n6.  Retrieve the digit value `v = Input[c_in]`.\n7.  Determine the corresponding target coordinate `c_out = P(c_in)` using the permutation found in step 4.\n8.
