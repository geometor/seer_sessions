            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.\n*   **Grid Size:** The examples suggest a consistent grid size, likely 5x5.\n*   **Values:** The grids contain three distinct integer values:\n    *   `0`: Represents background or empty cells.\n    *   `6`: Represents key marker points in the input. There are always exactly two `6`s in the input. These points are preserved in the output.\n    *   `5`: Represents filled cells in the output, generated based on the positions of the `6`s. `5`s only appear in the output.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the two `6`s in the input and then filling certain `0` cells with `5`s based on their geometric relationship to the `6`s.\n*   **Geometric Relationship:** The `5`s appear to trace paths or connections between the two `6`s. Observing the examples, particularly `train_1` and `train_2`, reveals that the `5`s form a sort of \"hollow\" shape outlining the connection. The `5`s seem to be placed on cells that satisfy two conditions:\n    1.  They lie on *a* shortest path (using Manhattan distance) between the two `6`s.\n    2.  They lie on the boundary (edge rows or columns) of the minimal bounding box enclosing the two `6`s.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
