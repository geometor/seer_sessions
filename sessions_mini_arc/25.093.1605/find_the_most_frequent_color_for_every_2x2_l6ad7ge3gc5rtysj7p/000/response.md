**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing single digits.
2.  **Central Separator:** The input grids consistently feature a central column (index 2) and a central row (index 2) that seem to act as separators, dividing the grid into four main quadrants (excluding the central row/column itself). In the provided examples, the central column always contains the digit '5'.
3.  **Quadrants:** The input grid can be conceptually divided into four 2x2 quadrants based on the central row and column:
    *   Top-Left (TL): Rows 0-1, Columns 0-1
    *   Top-Right (TR): Rows 0-1, Columns 3-4
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): Rows 3-4, Columns 0-1
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): Rows 3-4, Columns 3-4
4.  **Value Extraction:** The core operation involves extracting a specific value from each of these four quadrants. Specifically, the value at the top-left corner of each quadrant is selected:
    *   `input[0][0]` from TL quadrant.
    *   `input[0][3]` from TR quadrant.
    *   `input[3][0]` from BL quadrant.
    *   `input[3][3]` from BR quadrant.
5.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is primarily filled with zeros, except for the top-left 2x2 area. The four extracted values are placed into this 2x2 area in the following order:
    *   `output[0][0]` = extracted TL value
    *   `output[0][1]` = extracted TR value
    *   `output[1][0]` = extracted BL value
    *   `output[1][1]` = extracted BR value

    details:
      - Initialize the 5x5 output grid with zeros.
      - Place the extracted TL value at output[0][0].
      - Place the extracted TR value at output[0][1].
      - Place the extracted BL value at output[1][0].
      - Place the extracted BR value at output[1][1].
relationships:
  - The output grid's top-left 2x2 values are determined by the top-left values of the four main quadrants of the input grid.
  - The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a 5x5 output grid with all values set to 0.
2.  Identify the four corner values from the input grid that represent the top-left cells of the four conceptual 2x2 quadrants defined by excluding the central row and column:
    *   `value_TL` = Get the value at input grid position (row=0, col=0).
    *   `value_TR` = Get the value at input grid position (row=0, col=3).
    *   `value_BL` = Get the value at input grid position (row=3, col=0).
    *   `value_BR` = Get the value at input grid position (row=3, col=3).
3.  Assign these extracted values to the top-left 2x2 area of the output grid:
    *   Set output grid position (row=0, col=0) to `value_TL`.
    *   Set output grid position (row=0, col=1) to `value_TR`.
    *   Set output grid position (row=1, col=0) to `value_BL`.
    *   Set output grid position (row=1, col=1) to `value_BR`.
4.  The final output grid is the result of these assignments.
