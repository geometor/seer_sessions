task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - size: 5x5
      - content: digits
      - structure: contains central row and column potentially acting as separators
      - quadrants: implicitly divided into four 2x2 quadrants by central lines
          - Top-Left (TL): rows 0-1, cols 0-1
          - Top-Right (TR): rows 0-1, cols 3-4
          - Bottom-Left (BL): rows 3-4, cols 0-1
          - Bottom-Right (BR): rows 3-4, cols 3-4
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - size: 5x5
      - content: digits
      - default_value: 0
      - populated_area: top-left 2x2 corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1)
  - action: extract_values
    source: input_grid
    details:
      - Select the value from the top-left cell of the TL quadrant (input[0][0]).
      - Select the value from the top-left cell of the TR quadrant (input[0][3]).
      - Select the value from the top-left cell of the BL quadrant (input[3][0]).
      - Select the value from the top-left cell of the BR quadrant (input[3][3]).
  - action: construct_output
    target: output_grid
    details:
      - Initialize the 5x5 output grid with zeros.
      - Place the extracted TL value at output[0][0].
      - Place the extracted TR value at output[0][1].
      - Place the extracted BL value at output[1][0].
      - Place the extracted BR value at output[1][1].
relationships:
  - The output grid's top-left 2x2 values are determined by the top-left values of the four main quadrants of the input grid.
  - The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.
