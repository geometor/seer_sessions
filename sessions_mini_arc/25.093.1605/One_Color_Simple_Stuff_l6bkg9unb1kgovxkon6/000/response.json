            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task operates on square grids composed of binary digits (0s and 1s). The core transformation involves shifting the content of the input grid upwards by one row. The first (top) row of the input grid is discarded in this shift. The key variation lies in how the last (bottom) row of the output grid is generated. This generation depends conditionally on the content of the *first* row of the *input* grid. If the input's first row contains any '1's, the output's last row becomes all '0's. However, if the input's first row consists entirely of '0's, the output's last row is created by taking the *last* row of the *input* grid and performing a circular left shift on its elements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
