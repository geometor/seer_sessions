"""
Identifies the unique non-zero 'significant_number' in the input grid.
Determines a 'target_column' based on whether the significant_number exists in the first column of the input grid:
- If yes, target_column is the last column.
- If no, target_column is the first column.
Determines a 'target_row' based on whether the significant_number exists in the last row of the input grid:
- If yes, target_row is the first row.
- If no, target_row is the last row.
Creates the output grid by first copying the input grid.
Then, fills the entire target_row in the output grid with the significant_number.
Finally, modifies the target_column in the output grid: for each cell in the target_column, if the corresponding cell in the *original* input grid was 0, sets the output grid cell to the significant_number; otherwise, keeps the potentially already modified value (if it was part of the target_row fill).
