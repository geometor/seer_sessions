Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both the input and output are represented as 5x5 grids of integers.
2.  **Grid Content:** Each input grid contains primarily zeros (0) and one other distinct non-zero integer (e.g., 2, 4, or 3 in the examples). This non-zero integer seems to be the 'significant' value for the transformation.
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. The core change involves filling an entire column with the significant non-zero integer.
4.  **Target Column:** The column being modified is either the very first column (index 0) or the very last column (index 4 in these 5x5 examples).
5.  **Condition for Target Column:** The choice between modifying the first or the last column appears to depend on the presence of the significant non-zero integer within the first column of the *input* grid.
    *   If the significant number exists anywhere in the first column of the input, the *last* column of the output is filled with that number.
    *   If the significant number does *not* exist in the first column of the input, the *first* column of the output is filled with that number.
6.  **Preservation:** All other elements of the grid, outside the modified column, remain unchanged from input to output.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - dimensions (e.g., 5x5)
        - cell_values (contains 0s and one unique non-zero integer)
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - dimensions (same as Input_Grid)
        - cell_values
  - Significant_Number:
      Type: Integer
      Properties:
        - value (the unique non-zero integer found in Input_Grid)
  - First_Column:
      Type: Conceptual column within the grid
      Properties:
        - index: 0
  - Last_Column:
      Type: Conceptual column within the grid
      Properties:
        - index: width - 1

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid is derived from Input_Grid.
  - Significant_Number is identified from the non-zero values in Input_Grid.
  - The column to be modified in Output_Grid (Target_Column) depends on whether Significant_Number is present in the First_Column of Input_Grid.

Actions:
  - Identify the Significant_Number from the Input_Grid.
  - Check if any cell in the First_Column of Input_Grid contains the Significant_Number.
  - Determine the Target_Column:
      - If Significant_Number is in First_Column: Target_Column is Last_Column.
      - If Significant_Number is NOT in First_Column: Target_Column is First_Column.
  - Create the Output_Grid by copying the Input_Grid.
  - Modify the Target_Column in the Output_Grid by filling all its cells with the Significant_Number.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the unique non-zero integer value present in the input grid; let this be `significant_number`.
2.  Examine the first column (column index 0) of the input grid. Check if the `significant_number` exists in any cell within this first column.
3.  If the `significant_number` is present in the first column:
    *   Create the output grid by taking the input grid and replacing all values in the *last* column with the `significant_number`.
4.  If the `significant_number` is *not* present in the first column:
    *   Create the output grid by taking the input grid and replacing all values in the *first* column with the `significant_number`.
5.  Return the modified grid as the output.
