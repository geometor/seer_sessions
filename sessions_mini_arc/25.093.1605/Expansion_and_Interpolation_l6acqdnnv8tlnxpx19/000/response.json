This non-zero integer seems to be the 'significant' value for the transformation.\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation modifies the input grid to produce the output grid. The core change involves filling an entire column with the significant non-zero integer.\n4.  **Target Column:** The column being modified is either the very first column (index 0) or the very last column (index 4 in these 5x5 examples).\n5.  **Condition for Target Column:** The choice between modifying the first or the last column appears to depend on the presence of the significant non-zero integer within the first column of the *input* grid.\n    *   If the significant number exists anywhere in the first column of the input, the *last* column of the output is filled with that number.\n    *   If the significant number does *not* exist in the first column of the input, the *first* column of the output is filled with that number.\n6.  **Preservation:** All other elements of the grid, outside the modified column, remain unchanged from input to output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
