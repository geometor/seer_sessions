Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - dimensions (height, width)
        - cell_values (contains 0s and one unique non-zero integer)
  - Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D array of integers
      Properties:
        - dimensions (same as Input_Grid)
        - cell_values
  - Significant_Number:
      Type: Integer
      Properties:
        - value (the unique non-zero integer found in Input_Grid)
  - First_Column_Input:
      Type: 1D array (column vector)
      Properties:
        - index: 0
        - source: Input_Grid
  - Last_Row_Input:
      Type: 1D array (row vector)
      Properties:
        - index: height - 1
        - source: Input_Grid
  - Target_Column:
      Type: Conceptual column within the grid
      Properties:
        - index: Determined by presence of Significant_Number in First_Column_Input
        - modification_rule: Fill cells with Significant_Number only if the original Input_Grid cell was 0.
  - Target_Row:
      Type: Conceptual row within the grid
      Properties:
        - index: Determined by presence of Significant_Number in Last_Row_Input
        - modification_rule: Fill all cells with Significant_Number.

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid is derived from Input_Grid.
  - Significant_Number is identified from the non-zero values in Input_Grid.
  - Target_Column index depends on whether Significant_Number is present in First_Column_Input.
      - If present: Target_Column index is width - 1 (Last Column).
      - If not present: Target_Column index is 0 (First Column).
  - Target_Row index depends on whether Significant_Number is present in Last_Row_Input.
      - If present: Target_Row index is 0 (First Row).
      - If not present: Target_Row index is height - 1 (Last Row).

Actions:
  - Identify the Significant_Number from the Input_Grid.
  - Determine the Target_Column index based on Significant_Number's presence in the Input_Grid's first column.
  - Determine the Target_Row index based on Significant_Number's presence in the Input_Grid's last row.
  - Create the Output_Grid by making a copy of the Input_Grid.
  - Modify the Target_Row in the Output_Grid by filling all its cells with the Significant_Number.
  - Modify the Target_Column in the Output_Grid: For each cell in the Target_Column, if the corresponding cell in the *original* Input_Grid was 0, set the Output_Grid cell to Significant_Number; otherwise, keep the value from the (potentially row-modified) Output_Grid.
