The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example.\n2.  **Grid Values:** The input grids contain only the values 0 and 3. The output grids contain the values 0, 3, and 7.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to operate on the cells containing the value '3'. Cells with '0' remain unchanged. Some '3' cells remain '3', while others are changed to '7'.\n4.  **Pattern Identification:** The '3' cells form contiguous rectangular or near-rectangular blocks. The cells that change from '3' to '7' seem to be located at the \"corners\" of these blocks. Specifically, they correspond to the minimum/maximum row and column indices within each distinct block of '3's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
