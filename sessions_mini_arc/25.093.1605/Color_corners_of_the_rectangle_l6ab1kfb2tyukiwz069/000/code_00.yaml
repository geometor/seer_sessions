    properties:
      - fixed_dimensions_across_examples: True # within a single example pair, input/output dims match
  - type: grid

transformation_details:
  - element: cell_value_0
    input_value: 0
    output_value: 0
    action: unchanged
  - element: cell_value_3
    input_value: 3
    output_value: either 3 or 7
    action: conditional_change
    condition: depends on position within a contiguous block of '3's

objects:
  - object: grid
    description: Represents the overall input and output structure.
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value (integer: 0, 3, or 7)
      - position (row, column)
  - object: block_of_3s
    description: A contiguous group of cells with the value 3. Adjacency is typically defined horizontally and vertically.
    properties:
      - cells (list of cell positions)
      - bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - corners (specific cells within the block at the extrema of the bounding box)

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    target: grid
    input_value: 3
    output: list of block_of_3s
  - action: find_block_corners
    target: block_of_3s
    result: identify cells within the block located at (min_row, min_col), (min_row, max_col), (max_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col) of the block's bounding box.
  - action: update_cell_value
    target: cell
    condition: If a cell is identified as a corner of a block_of_3s.
    new_value: 7

relationships:
  - A cell is part of a block_of_3s if its value is 3 and it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another cell in the same block.
  - A cell is a corner_of_a_block if its value is 3 and its position matches one of the four corner positions of the bounding box for the block it belongs to.
