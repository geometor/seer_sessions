The grid dimensions appear constant within each example pair (5x5 in all provided examples).\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The grids use integers 0 (often black), 4 (often blue), and 5 (often red). 0 and 4 appear in the input, while 0, 4, and 5 appear in the output.\n3.  **Core Change Trigger:** The presence of the number 0 in the input grid seems to be the trigger for changes in the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   Cells that are 0 in the input are changed to 5 in the output.\n    *   Cells that are directly below a 0 in the input are changed to 0 in the output, *regardless* of their original value in the input.\n    *   This \"change below to 0\" rule seems to take precedence. If a cell is 0 (changed to 5) and the cell below it is also 0 (changed to 5), the effect from the *upper* 0 cell forces the *lower* cell to become 0 in the final output.\n    *   Cells that are not 0 and are not directly below a 0 remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
