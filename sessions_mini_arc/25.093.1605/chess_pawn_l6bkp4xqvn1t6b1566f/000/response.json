The output grid is derived from the input grid based on the relative positions of the '1' and '2'. In some cases, the output grid is identical to the input grid. In other cases, the cell containing '2' in the input is changed to '1' in the output, and the cell containing '1' in the input is changed to '0' in the output. The transformation rule appears to depend on whether the '1' and '2' cells are diagonally adjacent.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
