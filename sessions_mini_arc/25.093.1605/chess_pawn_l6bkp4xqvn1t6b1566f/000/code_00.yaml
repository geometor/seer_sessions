objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array (list of lists)
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cells: contain integer values (0, 1, or 2)
  - name: cell_1
    type: grid cell
    properties:
      - value: 1
      - position: (row_1, col_1)
  - name: cell_2
    type: grid cell
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - position: (row_2, col_2)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [cell_1, cell_2]
    property: adjacency
    details: Checked for diagonal adjacency specifically. Two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are diagonally adjacent if the absolute difference in their row indices is 1 AND the absolute difference in their column indices is 1 (i.e., abs(r1 - r2) == 1 and abs(c1 - c2) == 1).
actions:
  - name: transform_grid
    condition: cell_1 and cell_2 are diagonally adjacent
    steps:
      - Change the value of cell_2 from 2 to 1 in the output grid.
      - Change the value of cell_1 from 1 to 0 in the output grid.
      - Keep all other cell values the same as the input grid.
  - name: copy_grid
    condition: cell_1 and cell_2 are NOT diagonally adjacent
    steps:
      - Copy the input grid directly to the output grid without changes.
