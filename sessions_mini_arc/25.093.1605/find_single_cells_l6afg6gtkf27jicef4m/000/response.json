'3's that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) form connected components.\n    *   The transformation retains only those '3's that are isolated, meaning they are not adjacent (including diagonally) to any other '3'. All other '3's (those part of components larger than one cell) are turned into '0's.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
