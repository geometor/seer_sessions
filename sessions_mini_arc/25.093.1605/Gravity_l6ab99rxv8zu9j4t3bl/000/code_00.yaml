Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    - rows: integer (number of rows)
    - columns: integer (number of columns)
    - cells: contain integer values

Cell Values:
  type: Integer
  properties:
    - value: The specific integer in the cell.
    - is_zero: boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise)
    - significance: 
        - 0 represents empty space.
        - Non-zero values represent objects subject to gravity.

Columns:
  type: Vertical subset of the grid
  properties:
    - index: The horizontal position of the column (0-based).
    - elements: List of cell values in the column from top to bottom.

Transformation:
  name: Columnar Gravity
  scope: Operates independently on each column.
  action:
    - Identify non-zero values within a column.
    - Preserve the top-to-bottom relative order of these non-zero values.
    - Relocate these non-zero values to the bottom-most available positions within the same column in the output grid.
    - Fill the remaining upper positions in the column with zeros.
  relationship: The final position of a non-zero number depends only on its original vertical position relative to other non-zero numbers within the same column and the grid height. It is independent of numbers in other columns.
