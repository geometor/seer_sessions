The values above the diagonal vary.\n    *   The transformation involves a manipulation of the rows.\n    *   Comparing input and output grids reveals that rows 2 through 5 of the input seem to directly correspond to rows 1 through 4 of the output. This suggests a row-shifting operation.\n    *   The first row of the input is discarded in this shift.\n    *   The last row of the output is newly constructed and does not directly copy any single row from the input. It consists of a single non-zero number in the first column, followed by zeros.\n    *   The non-zero value in the first column of the output's last row appears to be derived from the input grid. Specifically, it matches the value found in the last column of the *first* row of the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
