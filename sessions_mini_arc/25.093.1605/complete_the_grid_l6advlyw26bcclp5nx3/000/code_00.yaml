task: grid_transformation
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - type: output
      - dimensions: rows, columns (constant between input and output)
      - cells: contain numerical values
  - object: subgrid
    properties:
      - location: top-left corner of the input grid
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - role: pattern_source
relationship:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid.cell[r % 2, c % 2]
    to: output_grid.cell[r, c]
    description: The value of each cell in the output grid is determined by the value of a cell in the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid, based on the output cell's row and column indices modulo 2.
action:
  - name: tile_pattern
    actor: transformation_process
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - identify the 2x2 pattern from input_grid[0:2, 0:2]
      - create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid
      - populate each cell output_grid[r, c] with the value from input_grid[r % 2, c % 2]
