            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 5x5 grids containing single-digit integers.\n2.  **Static Middle Row:** The middle row (row index 2) appears identical in the input and output across all examples (`5 5 5 5 5`). This suggests it's either ignored or treated differently.\n3.  **Top/Bottom Interaction:** The changes occur exclusively in the top two rows (rows 0, 1) and the bottom two rows (rows 3, 4). The pattern of changes suggests an interaction or mapping between these two sections.\n4.  **Conditional Replacement:** Looking at column-wise comparisons between input and output, it seems values are copied *conditionally* between the top and bottom sections. For instance, in `train_1`, column 1, the `7`s from the bottom input `(3,1)` and `(4,1)` appear in the top output `(0,1)` and `(1,1)`. Conversely, the `6`s from the top input `(0,2)`, `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)` appear in the bottom output `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(4,0)`, `(4,1)`, `(4,2)`.\n5.  **Non-Zero Trigger:** The replacement seems triggered by *non-zero* values. If a cell in the source section (e.g., bottom) has a non-zero value, it overwrites the value in the corresponding cell in the destination section (e.g., top). If the source cell is zero, the destination cell retains its original value. This occurs simultaneously for both directions (top influencing bottom, bottom influencing top), using the original input values for the checks.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
