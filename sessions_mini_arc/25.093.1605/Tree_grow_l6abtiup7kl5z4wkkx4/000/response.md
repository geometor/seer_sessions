Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid (represented as a list of lists or similar structure) containing numerical values.
*   **Input Grid:** Composed of integers 0 and 9. The grid size appears consistent (5x5 in the examples).
*   **Output Grid:** Composed of integers 0, 3, and 9. The grid size is the same as the input.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some of the 0s in the input grid to 3s in the output grid. The 9s seem to remain unchanged. The placement of the new 3s appears related to the position of the 9s in the input grid. Specifically, 0s that are adjacent (including diagonals) to a 9 in the input grid become 3s in the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
3.  Get the value of the current cell in the input grid, let's call it `input_value`.
4.  **If `input_value` is 9:**
    *   Set the value of the corresponding cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to 9.
5.  **If `input_value` is 0:**
    *   Initialize a flag, `is_neighbor_9`, to false.
    *   Examine the 8 neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent) of the current cell (`r`, `c`) within the bounds of the *input* grid.
    *   For each valid neighbor:
        *   If the neighbor's value in the *input* grid is 9, set `is_neighbor_9` to true and stop checking neighbors for this cell.
    *   **If `is_neighbor_9` is true:**
        *   Set the value of the corresponding cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to 3.
    *   **If `is_neighbor_9` is false:**
        *   Set the value of the corresponding cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to 0.
6.  After iterating through all input cells, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
