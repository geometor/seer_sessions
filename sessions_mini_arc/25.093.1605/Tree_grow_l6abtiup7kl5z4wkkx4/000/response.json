The grid size appears consistent (5x5 in the examples).\n*   **Output Grid:** Composed of integers 0, 3, and 9. The grid size is the same as the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some of the 0s in the input grid to 3s in the output grid. The 9s seem to remain unchanged. The placement of the new 3s appears related to the position of the 9s in the input grid. Specifically, 0s that are adjacent (including diagonals) to a 9 in the input grid become 3s in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
