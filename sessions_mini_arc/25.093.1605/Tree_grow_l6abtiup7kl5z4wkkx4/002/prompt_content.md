"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rule:
1. Cells with value 9 remain unchanged.
2. Cells with value 0 are transformed to 3 if they are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a cell with value 9 in the input grid.
3. Cells with value 0 that are not adjacent to any 9 remain 0.
