task: Identify background cells adjacent to object cells and change their value.
grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 5x5 (in examples, potentially variable)
  cell_values:
    - 0: Represents background/empty space.
    - 4: Represents the primary object/shape in the input.
    - 6: Represents the border/adjacent cells in the output.
objects:
  - name: background_cell
    represented_by: value 0
  - name: object_cell
    represented_by: value 4
  - name: border_cell
    represented_by: value 6 (output only)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)
    applies_to: grid cells
actions:
  - name: find_adjacent_background
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates (row, col)
    description: Identifies all cells with value 0 in the input grid that are adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to at least one cell with value 4.
  - name: update_cell_value
    input: grid, coordinates (row, col), new_value
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the value of the cell at the specified coordinates to the new value.
  - name: preserve_cell_value
    input: grid, coordinates (row, col)
    output: grid
    description: Ensures the cell at the specified coordinates retains its original value during transformation if no update rule applies.
transformation_rule:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all background cells (value 0) in the input grid that are adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to any object cell (value 4).
  - step: For each identified background cell, update its value to 6 in the output grid.
  - step: All other cells (original 4s and 0s not adjacent to 4s) retain their values from the input grid.
