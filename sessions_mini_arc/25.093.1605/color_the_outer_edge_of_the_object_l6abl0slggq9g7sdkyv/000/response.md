Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (5x5 in the examples) containing numerical values.
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids use three distinct values: 0, 4, and 6.
3.  **Value Roles:**
    *   `0` appears to be a background or empty state.
    *   `4` represents the primary object or pattern in the input grid.
    *   `6` is a new value introduced in the output grid.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves adding `6`s to the grid. The positions of these `6`s are consistently adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the `4`s present in the input grid.
5.  **Preservation:** The original `4`s from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. The `0`s that are *not* adjacent to any `4` also remain unchanged.
6.  **Core Logic:** The task seems to be about identifying the "border" or "outline" cells around the shapes formed by the number `4`. Specifically, it finds all background (`0`) cells that touch (including corners) any part of the `4`-shape and changes them to `6`.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task: Identify background cells adjacent to object cells and change their value.
grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  size: 5x5 (in examples, potentially variable)
  cell_values:
    - 0: Represents background/empty space.
    - 4: Represents the primary object/shape in the input.
    - 6: Represents the border/adjacent cells in the output.
objects:
  - name: background_cell
    represented_by: value 0
  - name: object_cell
    represented_by: value 4
  - name: border_cell
    represented_by: value 6 (output only)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)
    applies_to: grid cells
actions:
  - name: find_adjacent_background
    input: input grid
    output: list of coordinates (row, col)
    description: Identifies all cells with value 0 in the input grid that are adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to at least one cell with value 4.
  - name: update_cell_value
    input: grid, coordinates (row, col), new_value
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the value of the cell at the specified coordinates to the new value.
  - name: preserve_cell_value
    input: grid, coordinates (row, col)
    output: grid
    description: Ensures the cell at the specified coordinates retains its original value during transformation if no update rule applies.
transformation_rule:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all background cells (value 0) in the input grid that are adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to any object cell (value 4).
  - step: For each identified background cell, update its value to 6 in the output grid.
  - step: All other cells (original 4s and 0s not adjacent to 4s) retain their values from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid (the output grid) initially identical to the input grid.
3.  Examine every cell in the *input* grid based on its row and column position.
4.  If a cell in the *input* grid contains the value `0`:
    a.  Look at all its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
    b.  Check if any of these neighbors in the *input* grid contain the value `4`.
    c.  If at least one neighbor contains `4`, then change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to `6`.
5.  If a cell in the input grid contains `4`, or if it contains `0` but has no neighbors with value `4`, its value in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.
6.  The final output grid reflects these changes.
