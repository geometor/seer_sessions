The positions of these `6`s are consistently adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the `4`s present in the input grid.\n5.  **Preservation:** The original `4`s from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. The `0`s that are *not* adjacent to any `4` also remain unchanged.\n6.  **Core Logic:** The task seems to be about identifying the \"border\" or \"outline\" cells around the shapes formed by the number `4`. Specifically, it finds all background (`0`) cells that touch (including corners) any part of the `4`-shape and changes them to `6`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
