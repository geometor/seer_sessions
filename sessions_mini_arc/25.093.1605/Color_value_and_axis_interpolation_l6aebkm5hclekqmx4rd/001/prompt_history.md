Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist mainly of zeros (0), with the significant data concentrated in the last row (row index 4).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the non-zero digits from the input's last row, but these digits are "extended" vertically upwards within their respective columns. The original zeros in the upper rows of the input are replaced by these extended digits.
4.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The key transformation appears column-based. For each column, the digit in the last row of the input determines *which* digit fills part of that column in the output and *how high* it extends upwards from the bottom row.
5.  **Value-to-Height Mapping:** By comparing the input value `v` in the last row `(4, c)` with the number of cells `h` filled with that value in the corresponding output column `c` (counting from the bottom up), we observe a consistent mapping across examples:
    *   Value `1` -> Fills `3` cells vertically.
    *   Value `2` -> Fills `2` cells vertically.
    *   Value `3` -> Fills `4` cells vertically.
    *   Value `5` -> Fills `5` cells vertically.
    *   Value `6` -> Fills `1` cell vertically.
    *   Value `0` -> Fills `0` cells (remains 0 unless overwritten).
6.  **Column Independence:** The transformation in each column seems independent of the other columns, depending only on the value in the last row of that specific column in the input.

  - action: fill_column
    description: >
      For a given column 'c', if the input value 'v' at input[4][c] is non-zero,
      determine its corresponding height 'h'. Fill the cells output[r][c] with
      the value 'v' for rows 'r' from 4 down to (4 - h + 1), inclusive.
    constraints:
      - Row index 'r' must be non-negative.
      - Only non-zero values from the input's last row create bars.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (5x5), filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to 4.
3.  Get the value `v` from the last row of the input grid at position `(4, c)`.
4.  If `v` is non-zero:
    a.  Determine the corresponding vertical fill height `h` based on the value `v` using the following mapping:
        *   If `v` is 1, set `h` to 3.
        *   If `v` is 2, set `h` to 2.
        *   If `v` is 3, set `h` to 4.
        *   If `v` is 5, set `h` to 5.
        *   If `v` is 6, set `h` to 1.
    b.  Iterate through row indices `r` starting from the last row (4) down to `(4 - h + 1)`.
    c.  For each valid row index `r` in this range (ensuring `r` is 0 or greater), set the value of the cell in the output grid at position `(r, c)` to `v`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
