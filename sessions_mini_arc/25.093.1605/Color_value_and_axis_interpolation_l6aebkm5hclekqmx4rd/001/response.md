"""
Processes a 5x5 input grid where the last row contains significant digits. 
Generates a 5x5 output grid based on the input's last row. For each column 'c',
the digit 'v' in the input grid at position (4, c) determines both the value 
and the height 'h' of a vertical bar extending upwards from the bottom row 
in the output grid's column 'c'. The mapping from value 'v' to height 'h' is:
1 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 1. Cells not part of these bars remain 0.
