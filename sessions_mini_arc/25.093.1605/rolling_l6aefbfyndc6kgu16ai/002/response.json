            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial transformation logic, derived solely from `train_1`, failed on `train_3`. The results indicate that the mapping from the input's top-left 2x2 block (`[[a, b], [c, d]]`) to the output's central 2x2 block (within the bottom-right 3x3, specifically `output[2:4, 2:4]`) is not fixed but conditional.\n\n*   **Observation:** The original code applied the mapping `output[2][2]=c`, `output[2][3]=d`, `output[3][2]=a`, `output[3][3]=b`. This worked for `train_1`, `train_2`, and `test_1`, but failed for `train_3`.\n*   **Discrepancy in `train_3`:**\n    *   Input: `a=6, b=6, c=6, d=9`\n    *   Expected output pattern: `w=6(c), x=6(b), y=9(d), z=6(a)`\n    *   Code generated pattern: `w=6(c), x=9(d), y=6(a), z=6(b)`\n    *   Errors: `output[2][3]` (x) was `d` instead of `b`. `output[3][2]` (y) was `a` instead of `d`.\n*   **Hypothesis:** There are two distinct mapping rules for the `output[2:4, 2:4]` block. The choice depends on a condition related to the input values `a, b, c, d`.\n*   **Condition Analysis:** Comparing `train_2` (where the original code worked) and `train_3` (where it failed) reveals a potential condition. In `train_2`, `a=5, c=5, d=5`, satisfying `a == c == d`. In `train_3`, `a=6, c=6, d=9`, which does *not* satisfy `a == c == d`.\n*   **Refined Hypothesis:**\n    *   If `a == c == d`, use mapping: `w=c, x=d, y=a, z=b`.\n    *   Otherwise, use mapping: `w=c, x=b, y=d, z=a`.\n    *   The corner element `output[4][4]` consistently maps to `d`.\n*   **Strategy:** Verify this conditional logic against all provided examples. Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this conditionality.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
