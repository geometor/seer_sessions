task_description: Transform a 5x5 input grid into a 5x5 output grid by copying a sub-pattern.
grid_dimensions:
  rows: 5
  columns: 5
input_grid:
  properties:
    - Contains integers.
    - Non-zero values are typically concentrated in the top-left 2x2 subgrid (indices [0:2, 0:2]).
    - Other cells are usually zero.
output_grid:
  properties:
    - Contains integers.
    - The top-left 2x2 subgrid (indices [0:2, 0:2]) is identical to the input's top-left 2x2 subgrid.
    - A specific pattern exists in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid (indices [2:5, 2:5]).
    - Other cells outside these two subgrids match the input (usually zero).
transformation:
  actions:
    - Copy the input grid to initialize the output grid.
    - Identify the values in the input's top-left 2x2 subgrid:
        a: input[0][0]
        b: input[0][1]
        c: input[1][0]
        d: input[1][1]
    - Overwrite specific cells in the output grid's bottom-right 3x3 subgrid using the identified values:
        output[2][2] = c
        output[2][3] = d
        output[3][2] = a
        output[3][3] = b
        output[4][4] = d
  relationships:
    - The output's bottom-right pattern is derived directly from the input's top-left pattern.
    - The cell values at specific coordinates in the output's bottom-right are determined by cell values at specific coordinates in the input's top-left.
