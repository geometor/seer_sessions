            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 5x5 in all examples.\n2.  **Grid Contents:** The grids contain digits from 0 to 9. The digit '0' appears to represent empty space or background. Non-zero digits are the primary objects of interest.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging the non-zero digits within the grid. The positions of the '0' digits remain fixed relative to the overall structure, although non-zero digits might move into or out of positions previously occupied by '0'.\n4.  **Pattern of Movement:** The non-zero digits appear to move in a rotational manner. Observing the examples, particularly train_1 and train_2, suggests movement along concentric square paths or \"layers\" within the grid.\n    *   The outermost layer consists of cells in row 0, column 0, row 4, and column 4.\n    *   The next inner layer consists of cells in row 1, column 1, row 3, and column 3 (that are not part of the outer layer).\n    *   The innermost layer is the single cell at (2, 2).\n5.  **Direction of Movement:** Tracking individual numbers (e.g., 7 at (0,0) in train_1 moves to (2,0) in the output, while 8 at (0,2) moves to (0,0)) reveals a clockwise shift. However, it's not a simple rotation of all cells in the layer. Instead, each non-zero digit moves to the position previously occupied by the *previous* non-zero digit encountered when traversing the layer clockwise. Equivalently, each non-zero position in the output grid receives its value from the *next* non-zero position encountered clockwise in the input grid.\n6.  **Handling of Zeroes:** Zeroes ('0') do not participate in the rotation; they remain stationary unless a non-zero digit moves into their position. The path of rotation effectively skips over the zero cells.\n7.  **Consistency:** This layered clockwise rotation of non-zero elements holds for all examples. In train_5, the single non-zero element is at the center (layer 2), which has only one position. Rotating a single element results in no change, correctly matching the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Determine the number of concentric layers based on the grid size (N=5). The layers are indexed from `l=0` (outermost) to `floor((N-1)/2)` (innermost).\n3.  For each layer index `l`:\n    a.  Generate a list of coordinates `layer_coords` that trace the perimeter of the layer in clockwise order, starting from the top-left corner `(l, l)`.\n    b.  Create a list `non_zero_coords_in_layer` containing only those coordinates from `layer_coords` where the input grid has a non-zero value.\n    c.  If the number of non-zero coordinates in the layer is greater than 1:\n        i.  Iterate through `non_zero_coords_in_layer` using an index `k` from 0 to its length minus 1.\n        ii. Identify the \"target\" coordinate `(tgt_r, tgt_c)` as the `k`-th coordinate in `non_zero_coords_in_layer`.\n        iii. Determine the index of the \"source\" coordinate within `non_zero_coords_in_layer` by calculating `source_idx = (k + 1) % len(non_zero_coords_in_layer)` (this wraps around to get the *next* non-zero coordinate clockwise).\n        iv. Identify the \"source\" coordinate `(src_r, src_c)` as the coordinate at `source_idx` in `non_zero_coords_in_layer`.\n        v. Get the `value` from the input grid at the source coordinate: `value = input[src_r][src_c]`.\n        vi. Place this `value` into the output grid at the target coordinate: `output[tgt_r][tgt_c] = value`.\n4.  Return the final output grid."
