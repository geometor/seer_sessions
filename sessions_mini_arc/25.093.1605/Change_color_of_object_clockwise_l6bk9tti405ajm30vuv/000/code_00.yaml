task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D Array
      - content: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - role: input and output container
  - element: Cell Value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - range: 0-9
      - meaning: 0 represents background, non-zero represents distinct objects/colors
  - element: Non-zero Value Group
    properties:
      - identifier: the unique non-zero integer value
      - property: frequency (count of occurrences in the input grid)
relationships:
  - type: Preservation
    description: Grid dimensions and the positions of zero cells are preserved between input and output.
  - type: Value Mapping
    description: Each unique non-zero value in the input is mapped to a unique non-zero value in the output. The set of unique non-zero values remains the same.
    basis: The mapping is determined by the frequency ranking of the non-zero values in the input grid.
actions:
  - action: Analyze Input Grid
    steps:
      - Identify all unique non-zero values.
      - Count the frequency of each unique non-zero value.
  - action: Determine Value Mapping
    steps:
      - Create a ranked list of input values based on frequency (descending order). Break ties by sorting values in ascending order.
      - Create a ranked list of target values based on frequency (ascending order). Break ties by sorting values in descending order.
      - Establish a one-to-one mapping between the i-th element of the input rank list and the i-th element of the target rank list.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    steps:
      - Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input.
      - Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
      - If the input cell value is 0, set the corresponding output cell value to 0.
      - If the input cell value is non-zero, find its mapped value using the established mapping and set the corresponding output cell value to the mapped value.
