Grid:
  Type: 2D Array of Integers
  Size: 5x5 (constant in examples)
Cells:
  Categories:
    - Corner:
        Locations: [[0,0], [0,4], [4,0], [4,4]]
    - Midpoint: # Midpoint of each edge
        Locations: [[0,2], [2,0], [2,4], [4,2]]
    - AdjacentBorder: # Border cells neither corner nor midpoint
        Locations: [[0,1], [0,3], [1,0], [1,4], [3,0], [3,4], [4,1], [4,3]]
    - Inner: # Cells not on the border
        Locations: [[1,1]..[3,3]] excluding midpoints (2,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,2) - actually all cells from (1,1) to (3,3)
  Properties:
    - Value: Integer digit
    - Location: [Row, Column]
Relationships:
  - InnerNeighborOfMidpoint:
      - Midpoint [0,2] -> Inner Cell [1,2]
      - Midpoint [2,0] -> Inner Cell [2,1]
      - Midpoint [2,4] -> Inner Cell [2,3]
      - Midpoint [4,2] -> Inner Cell [3,2]
Transformation:
  Type: Conditional Cell Modification
  Scope: Affects only Corner and Midpoint cells.
  Condition: Based on the value of Input Corner cells.
  Rule_Case1: # Input Corner Value == 0
    Output Corner Value: Value of Input AdjacentBorder cells
    Output Midpoint Value: Value of Input AdjacentBorder cells
  Rule_Case2: # Input Corner Value != 0
    Output Corner Value: 0
    Output Midpoint Value: Value of the respective InnerNeighborOfMidpoint cell in the Input grid.
  Unchanged: Inner cells and AdjacentBorder cells retain their Input values.
