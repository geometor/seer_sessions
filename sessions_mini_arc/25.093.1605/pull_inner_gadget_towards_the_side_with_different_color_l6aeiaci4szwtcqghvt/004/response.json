            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed to produce the correct output for any training example. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the movement or stopping logic, likely preventing any movement from occurring. The analysis revealed that the initial check for adjacency might have been incorrectly applied or the stopping condition itself was too broad (stopping on adjacency to any static object instead of just the target '7').\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Stop Condition:** Modify the logic to stop movement *only* when any part of the movable object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge) to a cell occupied by the target digit (7). Adjacency to other static elements (like the border) will not halt movement.\n2.  **Adjust Loop Logic:** Ensure the adjacency check happens *before* attempting to calculate and execute the next move step. The loop should terminate if the *current* position is adjacent to the target '7'.\n3.  **Verify Object Identification:** Double-check that the movable object and target object are correctly identified in all cases. The heuristic used (least frequent non-0, non-7, non-border) seems to work for the training examples but needs careful consideration.\n4.  **Iterative Movement:** Confirm the step-by-step movement simulation correctly updates the grid state, clearing the old positions and placing the object in the new ones.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Code Execution:**\n\nThe following metrics were calculated for the training examples:\n\n"

Mark the identified static obstacle cells (excluding the movable object cells).\n2.  **Determine Direction:**\n    *   Calculate the centroid (average row, column) of the movable object cells.\n    *   Calculate the centroid of the target object cells (`7`s).\n    *   Determine the primary cardinal direction (Up `(-1, 0)`, Down `(1, 0)`, Left `(0, -1)`, Right `(0, 1)`) pointing from the movable centroid towards the target centroid. If centroids are coincident or no target exists, the direction is `(0, 0)`.\n3.  **Simulate Movement:**\n    *   Initialize the current grid state.\n    *   Start an iterative loop:\n        a.  **Check Stop Condition (Adjacency):** Examine all cells currently occupied by the movable object. Is any of these cells directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not diagonal) to any target object cell (`7`)?\n        b.  If yes, the movement is complete. Exit the loop.

Will any potential next coordinate fall outside the grid boundaries?\n            ii. Will any potential next coordinate land on a cell currently occupied by a static obstacle?\n        e.  If the path is invalid (out of bounds or collision with an obstacle), the movement is blocked. Exit the loop.
