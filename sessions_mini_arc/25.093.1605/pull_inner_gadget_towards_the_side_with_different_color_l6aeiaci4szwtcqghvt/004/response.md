**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed to produce the correct output for any training example. The transformed output was identical to the input in all cases. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the movement or stopping logic, likely preventing any movement from occurring. The analysis revealed that the initial check for adjacency might have been incorrectly applied or the stopping condition itself was too broad (stopping on adjacency to any static object instead of just the target '7').

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Stop Condition:** Modify the logic to stop movement *only* when any part of the movable object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge) to a cell occupied by the target digit (7). Adjacency to other static elements (like the border) will not halt movement.
2.  **Adjust Loop Logic:** Ensure the adjacency check happens *before* attempting to calculate and execute the next move step. The loop should terminate if the *current* position is adjacent to the target '7'.
3.  **Verify Object Identification:** Double-check that the movable object and target object are correctly identified in all cases. The heuristic used (least frequent non-0, non-7, non-border) seems to work for the training examples but needs careful consideration.
4.  **Iterative Movement:** Confirm the step-by-step movement simulation correctly updates the grid state, clearing the old positions and placing the object in the new ones.

**Metrics and Observations from Code Execution:**

The following metrics were calculated for the training examples:


```
[
  {'Example': 1, 'Movable Digit': 8, 'Movable Coords': [(2, 2), (2, 3)], 'Target Coords': [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)], 'Movable Center': '(2.00, 2.50)', 'Target Center': '(2.00, 0.00)', 'Direction (dr, dc)': (0, -1)}, # Left
  {'Example': 2, 'Movable Digit': 9, 'Movable Coords': [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)], 'Target Coords': [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)], 'Movable Center': '(2.50, 1.50)', 'Target Center': '(0.00, 2.00)', 'Direction (dr, dc)': (-1, 0)}, # Up
  {'Example': 3, 'Movable Digit': 3, 'Movable Coords': [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)], 'Target Coords': [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)], 'Movable Center': '(1.00, 2.00)', 'Target Center': '(4.00, 2.00)', 'Direction (dr, dc)': (1, 0)}, # Down
  {'Example': 4, 'Movable Digit': 6, 'Movable Coords': [(1, 1), (2, 2)], 'Target Coords': [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)], 'Movable Center': '(1.50, 1.50)', 'Target Center': '(2.00, 4.00)', 'Direction (dr, dc)': (0, 1)}, # Right
  {'Example': 5, 'Movable Digit': 1, 'Movable Coords': [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)], 'Target Coords': [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)], 'Movable Center': '(1.33, 1.33)', 'Target Center': '(4.00, 2.00)', 'Direction (dr, dc)': (1, 0)} # Down
]
```


*   The calculated centroids and resulting movement directions align with the visual interpretation of the examples (Left, Up, Down, Right, Down).
*   This confirms that the direction-finding logic based on centroids is likely correct.
*   The failure of the previous code must stem from the implementation of the movement loop and the stopping condition check, not from identifying the direction.

**Updated YAML Facts:**


```yaml
# Task Components and Relationships (Refined)

# --- Grid Definition ---
grid:
  type: 2D array
  content: single-digit integers (0-9)
  role: defines the space where transformation occurs

# --- Identified Objects ---
background:
  digit: 0
  role: represents empty space
  behavior: static, fills vacated cells

target_object:
  digit: 7
  role: defines the destination boundary/attractor for movement
  identification: all cells containing the digit 7
  behavior: static, acts as the sole stopping trigger for movable_object(s) via adjacency

movable_object:
  role: the object(s) that undergo translation
  identification:
    - Heuristic: Find unique digits excluding 0 and 7.
    - Heuristic: Identify potential border digit (e.g., surrounding frame).
    - Heuristic: Select the remaining digit. If ambiguity (multiple remain), choose the least frequent one.
    - Composition: One or more contiguous blocks of the identified movable digit.
  properties:
    - digit_value: varies per example (e.g., 8, 9, 3, 6, 1)
    - shape: defined by contiguous cells of the movable digit
    - count: can be one or more separate blocks of the same digit (treated as a single logical object for movement)
  behavior: moves step-by-step within the grid

static_obstacles:
  role: elements that remain fixed but do *not* stop movement upon adjacency
  identification: all non-zero cells that are neither the target_object (7) nor the movable_object. Often forms the outer border.
  behavior: static, unchanged during transformation, does not impede movement unless directly blocking the path (object cannot move *into* an obstacle cell).

# --- Transformation Details ---
transformation:
  type: translation
  actor: movable_object(s) (all cells with the movable digit)
  action: move iteratively (step-by-step)
  direction:
    determination: Calculated based on the primary cardinal axis (Up, Down, Left, Right) from the centroid of the movable_object(s) towards the centroid of the target_object(s).
    calculation: (dr, dc) representing the unit vector in the determined direction.
  iteration_logic:
    - Start loop.
    - Check stop condition: Is any cell currently occupied by the movable_object adjacent (sharing edge) to any cell occupied by the target_object (7)?
    - If yes, break loop (movement finished).
    - If no, calculate potential next coordinates by adding (dr, dc) to current coordinates.
    - Check path validity: Would moving to potential next coordinates cause any part of the movable_object to go out of bounds or land on a static_obstacle cell?
    - If path is invalid (out of bounds or collision), break loop (movement blocked).
    - If path is valid, execute move:
        - Update grid: Change original positions of movable_object(s) to the background digit (0).
        - Update grid: Place the movable digit in the calculated new positions.
        - Update current coordinates of the movable_object.
    - Repeat loop.
  effect:
    - movable_object(s) occupy new positions closer to the target_object.
    - original positions of movable_object(s) are filled with the background digit (0).
    - target_object, static_obstacles, and background remain otherwise unchanged.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Identify the background digit (`0`).
    *   Identify the target object cells (all occurrences of `7`).
    *   Identify the static obstacle cells (all non-zero cells that are not `7`).
    *   Identify the movable object digit using heuristics (non-zero, non-7, likely not the primary border digit, potentially the least frequent remaining).
    *   Identify all cells occupied by the movable object digit. Mark the identified static obstacle cells (excluding the movable object cells).
2.  **Determine Direction:**
    *   Calculate the centroid (average row, column) of the movable object cells.
    *   Calculate the centroid of the target object cells (`7`s).
    *   Determine the primary cardinal direction (Up `(-1, 0)`, Down `(1, 0)`, Left `(0, -1)`, Right `(0, 1)`) pointing from the movable centroid towards the target centroid. If centroids are coincident or no target exists, the direction is `(0, 0)`.
3.  **Simulate Movement:**
    *   Initialize the current grid state.
    *   Start an iterative loop:
        a.  **Check Stop Condition (Adjacency):** Examine all cells currently occupied by the movable object. Is any of these cells directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not diagonal) to any target object cell (`7`)?
        b.  If yes, the movement is complete. Exit the loop. The current grid state is the final output.
        c.  **Calculate Potential Move:** Determine the potential next coordinates for *all* cells of the movable object by adding the direction vector (dr, dc) to their current coordinates.
        d.  **Check Path Validity:**
            i.  Will any potential next coordinate fall outside the grid boundaries?
            ii. Will any potential next coordinate land on a cell currently occupied by a static obstacle?
        e.  If the path is invalid (out of bounds or collision with an obstacle), the movement is blocked. Exit the loop. The current grid state is the final output.
        f.  **Execute Move:**
            i.  Update the grid: Set all current cells of the movable object to the background digit (`0`).
            ii. Update the grid: Set all the *potential next coordinates* to the movable object digit.
            iii. Update the record of the movable object's current coordinates to these new coordinates.
        g.  Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
4.  **Output:** Return the final grid state after the loop terminates.
