            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed because its stopping condition (`check_adjacency`) was evaluated based on the *current* position of the movable object relative to *all* static objects (including borders and the target '7'). This prevented movement if the object started adjacent to any static element.\n\nThe metric analysis confirms:\n1.  A single type of non-zero, non-7 digit consistently changes position (`movable_object`).\n2.  The digit '7' is always present and static (`target_object`).\n3.  Other non-zero digits form static boundaries/obstacles (`other_static_object`).\n4.  The movement occurs in a single cardinal direction.\n5.  The number of steps varies (1 or 2 steps in the examples).\n6.  The final position of the `movable_object` is always adjacent to the `target_object` ('7').\n\nThe core issue lies in *when* the stop condition is checked. The movement should proceed step-by-step *until* the *next planned step* would either cause adjacency to the target ('7') or collision with another static object/boundary.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Identification:** Improve the identification of `movable_object`, `target_object` ('7'), and `other_static_object` (all other non-zero, non-movable elements).\n2.  **Correct Iteration Logic:** Modify the main loop to:\n    *   Calculate the potential position after one step in the determined direction.\n    *   Check this *potential* position for boundary violations, collisions with `other_static_object`s, and adjacency to the `target_object` ('7').\n    *   If any of these conditions are met for the *potential* position, stop the movement; the *current* position is the final one.\n    *   Otherwise, execute the move (update grid, update current position) and continue the loop.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe `code_execution` provided the following key metrics per example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Movable: 8. Moves (0, -1) [Left] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7.\n*   **Example 2:** Movable: 9. Moves (-1, 0) [Up] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '5'.\n*   **Example 3:** Movable: 3. Moves (1, 0) [Down] by 2 steps. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '1'.\n*   **Example 4:** Movable: 6. Moves (0, 1) [Right] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '3'.\n*   **Example 5:** Movable: 1. Moves (1, 0) [Down] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '6'.\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n*   The number of steps taken varies.\n*   The final position is *always* adjacent to a '7'.\n*   The final position may *also* be adjacent to other static elements (like borders), but this seems incidental to the primary stopping condition (adjacency to '7').\n*   The direction is consistently the primary cardinal direction towards the '7' block.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
