## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed because its stopping condition (`check_adjacency`) was evaluated based on the *current* position of the movable object relative to *all* static objects (including borders and the target '7'). This prevented movement if the object started adjacent to any static element.

The metric analysis confirms:
1.  A single type of non-zero, non-7 digit consistently changes position (`movable_object`).
2.  The digit '7' is always present and static (`target_object`).
3.  Other non-zero digits form static boundaries/obstacles (`other_static_object`).
4.  The movement occurs in a single cardinal direction.
5.  The number of steps varies (1 or 2 steps in the examples).
6.  The final position of the `movable_object` is always adjacent to the `target_object` ('7').

The core issue lies in *when* the stop condition is checked. The movement should proceed step-by-step *until* the *next planned step* would either cause adjacency to the target ('7') or collision with another static object/boundary.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Identification:** Improve the identification of `movable_object`, `target_object` ('7'), and `other_static_object` (all other non-zero, non-movable elements).
2.  **Correct Iteration Logic:** Modify the main loop to:
    *   Calculate the potential position after one step in the determined direction.
    *   Check this *potential* position for boundary violations, collisions with `other_static_object`s, and adjacency to the `target_object` ('7').
    *   If any of these conditions are met for the *potential* position, stop the movement; the *current* position is the final one.
    *   Otherwise, execute the move (update grid, update current position) and continue the loop.

## Metrics Analysis

The `code_execution` provided the following key metrics per example:

*   **Example 1:** Movable: 8. Moves (0, -1) [Left] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7.
*   **Example 2:** Movable: 9. Moves (-1, 0) [Up] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '5'.
*   **Example 3:** Movable: 3. Moves (1, 0) [Down] by 2 steps. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '1'.
*   **Example 4:** Movable: 6. Moves (0, 1) [Right] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '3'.
*   **Example 5:** Movable: 1. Moves (1, 0) [Down] by 1 step. Stops adjacent to 7. Also adjacent to static border '6'.

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   The number of steps taken varies.
*   The final position is *always* adjacent to a '7'.
*   The final position may *also* be adjacent to other static elements (like borders), but this seems incidental to the primary stopping condition (adjacency to '7').
*   The direction is consistently the primary cardinal direction towards the '7' block.

# Task Components and Relationships (Revised)

grid:
  type: 2D array
  content: single-digit integers (0-9)
  role: defines the space for transformation

# --- Identified Objects ---
background:
  digit: 0
  role: empty space
  behavior: static, fills vacated cells during movement

target_object:
  digit: 7
  role: attractor and primary stopping boundary for movement
  identification: all cells containing the digit 7
  behavior: static

movable_object:
  role: object(s) undergoing translation
  identification:
    - contiguous block(s) of identical digits.
    - digit is not 0 (background) and not 7 (target).
    - determined by observing which non-0/non-7 digit changes position between input and output. Assumed to be only one such digit type per grid.
  properties:
    - digit_value: varies (e.g., 8, 9, 3, 6, 1)
    - shape: defined by contiguous cells
  behavior: moves iteratively within the grid until a stopping condition is met

other_static_object:
  role: obstacles or boundaries that prevent movement into their space
  identification:
    - all non-zero cells that are not part of the movable_object or target_object (7).
    - typically includes the outer border frame.
  behavior: static, prevent movable_object from entering their cells

# --- Transformation Details ---
transformation:
  type: iterative translation
  actor: movable_object(s)
  action: slide step-by-step in a single cardinal direction
  direction:
    determination: Primary cardinal axis (Up, Down, Left, Right) determined by the relative positions of the movable_object(s) and the target_object(s) (7s). Calculate from centroid to centroid.
  iteration_logic:
    1. Determine the single movement direction vector (dr, dc).
    2. Initialize the current state grid (copy of input) and current movable coordinates.
    3. Loop:
       a. Calculate the `potential_next_coords` by applying (dr, dc) to all `current_movable_coords`.
       b. Check for **collisions** and **stop conditions** based on `potential_next_coords`:
          i. **Boundary Collision:** Will any `potential_next_coords` be outside the grid?
          ii. **Obstacle Collision:** Will any `potential_next_coords` overlap with `other_static_object` coordinates?
          iii. **Target Adjacency:** Will any `potential_next_coords` be adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any `target_object` coordinate?
       c. If any of conditions (i), (ii), or (iii) are TRUE, then **stop** the loop; the `current_movable_coords` represent the final position.
       d. If ALL conditions (i), (ii), (iii) are FALSE:
          - Update the grid state: clear the `current_movable_coords` (set to 0), place the movable digit at the `potential_next_coords`.
          - Update `current_movable_coords` to `potential_next_coords`.
          - Continue the loop.
  effect:
    - movable_object(s) occupy new positions, having moved iteratively until the step *before* colliding with an obstacle/boundary or becoming adjacent to the target_object (7).
    - vacated path cells are filled with the background digit (0).
    - target_object(s) and other_static_object(s) remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program (Revised)

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a copy of the input grid, which will be modified to become the output grid.
    *   Identify the coordinates of the background cells (`0`).
    *   Identify the coordinates of the target cells (`7`) -> `target_coords`.
    *   Identify the digit and coordinates of the movable object (the non-0, non-7 digit group that changes position) -> `movable_digit`, `current_movable_coords`.
    *   Identify the coordinates of all other static obstacles (non-0, non-7, non-movable cells) -> `obstacle_coords`.
2.  **Determine Direction:**
    *   Calculate the center of `current_movable_coords`.
    *   Calculate the center of `target_coords`.
    *   Determine the single cardinal direction vector (`dr`, `dc`) pointing from the movable center towards the target center. If no target or ambiguous direction, set `(dr, dc)` to `(0, 0)`.
3.  **Iterative Movement:**
    *   If `(dr, dc)` is `(0, 0)`, skip movement.
    *   Otherwise, start a loop:
        a.  Calculate the `potential_next_coords` by adding (`dr`, `dc`) to each coordinate in `current_movable_coords`.
        b.  Initialize `stop_moving = False`.
        c.  Check **Stopping Conditions** based on `potential_next_coords`:
            i.  For each `(nr, nc)` in `potential_next_coords`:
                *   If `(nr, nc)` is outside grid bounds, set `stop_moving = True` and break inner check.
                *   If `(nr, nc)` is in `obstacle_coords`, set `stop_moving = True` and break inner check.
                *   Check neighbors of `(nr, nc)`: For each neighbor `(adj_r, adj_c)`, if `(adj_r, adj_c)` is in `target_coords`, set `stop_moving = True` and break inner check.
            ii. If `stop_moving` became `True` during the checks, break the outer loop (movement ends).
        d.  If `stop_moving` is still `False` (move is valid):
            i.  Update the grid: Erase the `movable_digit` from `current_movable_coords` (set cells to `0`).
            ii. Update the grid: Place the `movable_digit` at `potential_next_coords`.
            iii. Update `current_movable_coords` = `potential_next_coords`.
            iv. Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
4.  **Finalize:** Return the modified grid.
