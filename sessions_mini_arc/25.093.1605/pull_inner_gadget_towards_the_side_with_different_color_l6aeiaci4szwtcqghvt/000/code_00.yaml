# Task Components and Relationships

# --- Grid Definition ---
grid:
  type: 2D array
  content: single-digit integers (0-9)
  role: defines the space where transformation occurs

# --- Identified Objects ---
background:
  digit: 0
  role: represents empty space
  behavior: static, fills vacated cells

border:
  role: static frame or boundary
  identification: usually the outermost layer of identical digits, but can include other static non-zero elements (like some 7s).
  behavior: remains unchanged during transformation

movable_object:
  role: the object(s) that undergo translation
  identification: one or more contiguous blocks of identical digits that are not 0, not the primary border digit, and not the target digit (7).
  properties:
    - digit_value: varies per example (e.g., 8, 9, 3, 6, 1)
    - shape: defined by contiguous cells
    - count: can be one or more separate blocks of the same digit
  behavior: moves within the grid

target_object:
  role: defines the destination boundary or attractor for movement
  identification: contiguous block(s) of the digit 7 (based on examples)
  behavior: static, acts as a stopping point for movable_object(s)

# --- Transformation Details ---
transformation:
  type: translation
  actor: movable_object(s)
  action: move iteratively (step-by-step)
  direction:
    determination: Determined by the relative position of the movable_object(s) with respect to the target_object(s). The movement is along the cardinal axis (Up, Down, Left, Right) that represents the primary direction from movable to target.
  stopping_condition: The iterative movement stops immediately when any cell occupied by any movable_object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge, not diagonal) to any cell occupied by the target_object (digit 7) or another static border element. All movable objects cease movement together.
  effect:
    - movable_object(s) occupy new positions.
    - original positions of movable_object(s) are filled with the background digit (0).
    - border, target_object, and background remain otherwise unchanged.
