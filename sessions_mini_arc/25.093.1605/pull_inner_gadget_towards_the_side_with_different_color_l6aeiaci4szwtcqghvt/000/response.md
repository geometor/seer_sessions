Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are always 2D grids of single-digit integers.
2.  **Background:** The digit `0` consistently represents empty space or background.
3.  **Border:** There's typically an outer border frame composed of a single digit (e.g., `4` in train_1, `5` in train_2). This border seems static. Sometimes, other non-zero digits also act as static boundaries or internal walls (like the `7`s often positioned along one edge).
4.  **Movable Objects:** Within the grid, there are contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits (that are not the primary border digit and not `0`). These blocks appear to be the objects that move. Examples: `8`s in train_1, `9`s in train_2, `3`s in train_3, `6`s in train_4, `1`s in train_5. There can be multiple disconnected blocks of the same digit (train_4).
5.  **Target/Obstacle Objects:** The digit `7` appears in every example, forming static blocks. The movable objects seem to move *towards* these `7` blocks and stop upon reaching adjacency.
6.  **Movement:** The core transformation involves moving the "movable object(s)" within the grid. The space they vacate is filled with `0`s.
7.  **Directionality:** The direction of movement varies across examples: Left (train_1), Up (train_2), Down (train_3 & 5), Right (train_4). This direction seems determined by the relative position of the movable object(s) with respect to the target `7` block(s). The movement occurs in the primary cardinal direction towards the target.
8.  **Stopping Condition:** The movement isn't just one step (except sometimes by coincidence). It appears the movable object(s) slide iteratively, one step at a time, in the determined direction until any part of any movable object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge) to a target `7` cell or potentially another static border element. All related movable blocks stop simultaneously when the condition is met for any one part.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
# Task Components and Relationships

# --- Grid Definition ---
grid:
  type: 2D array
  content: single-digit integers (0-9)
  role: defines the space where transformation occurs

# --- Identified Objects ---
background:
  digit: 0
  role: represents empty space
  behavior: static, fills vacated cells

border:
  role: static frame or boundary
  identification: usually the outermost layer of identical digits, but can include other static non-zero elements (like some 7s).
  behavior: remains unchanged during transformation

movable_object:
  role: the object(s) that undergo translation
  identification: one or more contiguous blocks of identical digits that are not 0, not the primary border digit, and not the target digit (7).
  properties:
    - digit_value: varies per example (e.g., 8, 9, 3, 6, 1)
    - shape: defined by contiguous cells
    - count: can be one or more separate blocks of the same digit
  behavior: moves within the grid

target_object:
  role: defines the destination boundary or attractor for movement
  identification: contiguous block(s) of the digit 7 (based on examples)
  behavior: static, acts as a stopping point for movable_object(s)

# --- Transformation Details ---
transformation:
  type: translation
  actor: movable_object(s)
  action: move iteratively (step-by-step)
  direction:
    determination: Determined by the relative position of the movable_object(s) with respect to the target_object(s). The movement is along the cardinal axis (Up, Down, Left, Right) that represents the primary direction from movable to target.
  stopping_condition: The iterative movement stops immediately when any cell occupied by any movable_object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge, not diagonal) to any cell occupied by the target_object (digit 7) or another static border element. All movable objects cease movement together.
  effect:
    - movable_object(s) occupy new positions.
    - original positions of movable_object(s) are filled with the background digit (0).
    - border, target_object, and background remain otherwise unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background digit (0), the static border elements (typically the outermost frame digit and potentially others like the digit 7), and the movable digit(s) (non-zero, non-border, non-7).
2.  Locate all contiguous blocks of the movable digit(s) ("movable objects").
3.  Locate all contiguous blocks of the target digit (7) ("target objects").
4.  Determine the single cardinal direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) that points generally from the center(s) of the movable object(s) towards the center(s) of the target object(s).
5.  Initialize a representation of the grid state (e.g., copy the input grid).
6.  Start an iterative process:
    a.  Check if any cell occupied by a movable object is directly adjacent (sharing an edge) to any cell occupied by a target object (7) or a static border element.
    b.  If adjacency is found (stopping condition met), terminate the iteration.
    c.  If no adjacency is found, simulate one step of movement:
        i.  Calculate the next position for all cells currently occupied by movable objects by shifting them one unit in the determined direction.
        ii. Update the grid representation: change the original positions of the movable objects to the background digit (0) and place the movable objects' digits in their calculated new positions.
    d.  Repeat the iteration with the updated grid state.
7.  The final grid state after the iteration stops is the transformation output.
