            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are always 2D grids of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Background:** The digit `0` consistently represents empty space or background.\n3.  **Border:** There's typically an outer border frame composed of a single digit (e.g., `4` in train_1, `5` in train_2). This border seems static. Sometimes, other non-zero digits also act as static boundaries or internal walls (like the `7`s often positioned along one edge).\n4.  **Movable Objects:** Within the grid, there are contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits (that are not the primary border digit and not `0`). These blocks appear to be the objects that move. Examples: `8`s in train_1, `9`s in train_2, `3`s in train_3, `6`s in train_4, `1`s in train_5. There can be multiple disconnected blocks of the same digit (train_4).\n5.  **Target/Obstacle Objects:** The digit `7` appears in every example, forming static blocks. The movable objects seem to move *towards* these `7` blocks and stop upon reaching adjacency.\n6.  **Movement:** The core transformation involves moving the \"movable object(s)\" within the grid. The space they vacate is filled with `0`s.\n7.  **Directionality:** The direction of movement varies across examples: Left (train_1), Up (train_2), Down (train_3 & 5), Right (train_4). This direction seems determined by the relative position of the movable object(s) with respect to the target `7` block(s). The movement occurs in the primary cardinal direction towards the target.\n8.  **Stopping Condition:** The movement isn't just one step (except sometimes by coincidence). It appears the movable object(s) slide iteratively, one step at a time, in the determined direction until any part of any movable object becomes adjacent (sharing an edge) to a target `7` cell or potentially another static border element. All related movable blocks stop simultaneously when the condition is met for any one part.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
