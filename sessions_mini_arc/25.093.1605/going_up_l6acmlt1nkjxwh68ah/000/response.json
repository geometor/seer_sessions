The specific non-zero value is consistent within an input/output pair but differs between pairs.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task aims to rearrange the rows of the input grid to form the output grid based on the location of the non-zero elements.\n4.  **Core Logic:** The transformation identifies rows containing non-zero elements in the input (\"pattern rows\") and uses them to construct the output grid. Specifically, it seems to stack these pattern rows at the top of the output grid, preserving their relative order from the input. If the pattern rows don't fill the entire output grid height, the *last* identified pattern row is repeated to fill the remaining rows.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Create an ordered list containing only those rows that include at least one non-zero value. Maintain the relative order of these rows as found in the input.\n2.  **Handle Empty Case:** If no pattern rows are found (the input grid is all zeros), the output grid should also be all zeros with the same dimensions.\n3.  **Determine Last Pattern Row:** Identify the last row in the ordered list of pattern rows.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n5.  **Fill with Pattern Rows:** Populate the output grid starting from the top row (row 0). Copy the identified pattern rows sequentially into the output grid rows, maintaining their order.\n6.  **Fill Remaining Rows:** If the number of pattern rows is less than the total height of the grid, fill all subsequent rows (from the row after the last copied pattern row down to the bottom row) with copies of the determined \"last pattern row\".\n7.  **Return:** The fully constructed output grid is the result."
