Each input grid features a pattern composed of a single non-zero integer against a background of zeros. The output grid shows the same pattern, but its orientation is changed. The transformation consistently appears to be a reflection across the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) or, equivalently, a matrix transposition. The non-zero value itself remains unchanged, only its position is altered. The grid dimensions also remain constant.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
