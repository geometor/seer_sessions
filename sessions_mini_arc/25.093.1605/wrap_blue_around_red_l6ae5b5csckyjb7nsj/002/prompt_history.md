## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each example pair.
3.  **Values:** The grids contain non-negative integers. The value '0' appears to be a background or empty state. Non-zero values seem to represent distinct objects or states.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some '0' values to '1' in the output. Non-zero values from the input seem to persist in the output at their original locations.
5.  **Rule:** The change from '0' to '1' appears dependent on the proximity of the '0' cell to non-zero cells in the input grid. Specifically, a '0' becomes a '1' if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one non-zero cell.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (`row`, `col`) of the input grid.
3.  If the value of the input cell at (`row`, `col`) is '0':
    a.  Check all eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) of the cell (`row`, `col`) in the *input* grid.
    b.  If any of these neighbors contain a value other than '0':
        i.  Set the value of the corresponding cell (`row`, `col`) in the *output* grid to '1'.
4.  Leave all cells that were initially non-zero in the input grid unchanged in the output grid (this is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the '0's that meet the condition).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. If a cell in the input grid has a value of '0':
    a. Check its eight neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) in the input grid.
    b. If at least one neighbor has a non-zero value, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to '1'.
4. Cells that were non-zero in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
