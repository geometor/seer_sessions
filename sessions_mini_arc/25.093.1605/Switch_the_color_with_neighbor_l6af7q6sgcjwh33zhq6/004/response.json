            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly implemented a frequency-based swapping logic derived from the first example. However, testing against the full training set revealed inconsistencies. Specifically, the provided expected outputs for `train_3` and `train_4` (and the reported failure for `test_1`) cannot be achieved using a consistent, global digit-to-digit mapping based *solely* on the frequency ranking observed in `train_1` and `train_2`. The metrics calculation confirmed that these inconsistent examples require certain input digits to map to multiple different output digits within the same grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe most reliable approach is to adhere to the clear pattern demonstrated in the consistent examples (`train_1`, `train_2`). This pattern involves swapping the two most frequent non-zero digits (M1, M2) and the next two most frequent non-zero digits (M3, M4). Digits not involved in these pairs (including M3 if only three unique non-zero digits exist, or any digits beyond the top four) are assumed to map to themselves. Zero always maps to zero. The inconsistencies in other examples will be noted but the implemented logic will follow the consistent pattern, assuming those examples might contain errors or follow a different transformation principle not generalizable from the provided data.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following table summarizes the analysis of each example based on the refined understanding:\n\n| Example   | Input Grid (First Row) | Distinct Non-Zero Digits | Sorted Digits (Value, Frequency) | M1, M2, M3, M4 | Proposed Mapping (based on consistent rule) | Consistent w/ Expected Output? | Notes                                       |\n| :-------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |\n| `train_1` | `3 3 0 0 0`            | 4                        | (2, 4), (3, 4), (6, 3), (8, 1)   | 2, 3, 6, 8     | {0:0, 2:3, 3:2, 6:8, 8:6}                  | Yes                            | M1/M2 tied, sorted by value.

Sort_Digits:\n        - Create a list of the unique non-zero digits.\n        - Sort this list based on two criteria:\n            - Primary Key: Frequency (descending order).\n            - Secondary Key: Digit value (ascending order, for tie-breaking).\n        - Label the sorted digits as M1 (most frequent), M2, M3, M4, etc.\n    3.  Define_Mapping:\n        - Create a transformation map `T`. Initialize `T[d] = d` for all digits `d` from 0 to 9.\n        - If M1 and M2 exist: Update the map such that `T[M1] = M2` and `T[M2] = M1`.\n        - If M3 and M4 exist: Update the map such that `T[M3] = M4` and `T[M4] = M3`.\n        - All other digits (0, and any non-zero digits not in the top 4 pairs, including M3 if only 3 unique non-zeros exist) retain their initial identity mapping.\n    4.

They imply context-dependent mapping or errors in the examples.\n  - The implemented rule prioritizes the consistent pattern observed in `train_1` and `train_2`.\n```"

Ignore the digit 0.\n2.  **Rank Digits:** Make a list of the non-zero digits that appeared at least once. Sort this list. The most frequent digit comes first. If two digits have the same frequency, the smaller digit comes first. This gives you a ranked list: M1, M2, M3, M4, etc.\n3.  **Determine Swaps:**\n    *   Identify the first two digits in the ranked list (M1 and M2). These two digits will swap with each other.\n    *   Identify the next two digits in the ranked list (M3 and M4). If they exist (i.e., if there were at least four distinct non-zero digits), these two digits will also swap with each other.\n4.  **Create Mapping:** Define the transformation rule for every digit from 0 to 9:\n    *   0 always transforms to 0.\n    *   M1 transforms to M2, and M2 transforms to M1 (if M1, M2 exist).\n    *   M3 transforms to M4, and M4 transforms to M3 (if M3, M4 exist).\n    *   Any other digit transforms to itself.\n5.  **Apply Mapping:** Create a new grid of the same size as the input. Go through each cell of the input grid, take the digit in that cell, apply the transformation rule defined in step 4, and put the result in the corresponding cell of the new grid. This new grid is the output."
