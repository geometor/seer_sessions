Task: Digit Grid Transformation via Frequency-Based Swapping

Input_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Definition: A 2D array of single-digit integers.
  Element_Type: Integer
  Value_Range: 0-9

Output_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Definition: A 2D array of single-digit integers derived from the Input_Object.
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as Input_Object.

Transformation_Rule:
  Name: Frequency-Based Pairwise Swap
  Action: Modifies digit values based on global frequency analysis.
  Steps:
    1.  Analyze_Frequency:
        - Identify all unique non-zero digits in the Input_Object.
        - Calculate the frequency (count) of each unique non-zero digit.
    2.  Sort_Digits:
        - Create a list of the unique non-zero digits.
        - Sort this list based on two criteria:
            - Primary Key: Frequency (descending order).
            - Secondary Key: Digit value (ascending order, for tie-breaking).
        - Label the sorted digits as M1 (most frequent), M2, M3, M4, etc.
    3.  Define_Mapping:
        - Create a transformation map `T`. Initialize `T[d] = d` for all digits `d` from 0 to 9.
        - If M1 and M2 exist: Update the map such that `T[M1] = M2` and `T[M2] = M1`.
        - If M3 and M4 exist: Update the map such that `T[M3] = M4` and `T[M4] = M3`.
        - All other digits (0, and any non-zero digits not in the top 4 pairs, including M3 if only 3 unique non-zeros exist) retain their initial identity mapping.
    4.  Apply_Transformation:
        - Iterate through each cell of the Input_Object.
        - For a cell containing digit `d_in`, find the corresponding mapped value `d_out = T[d_in]`.
        - Place `d_out` into the corresponding cell of the Output_Object.

Noted_Inconsistencies:
  - The provided expected outputs for `train_3`, `train_4`, and the failed `test_1` are inconsistent with any single, global digit-to-digit mapping rule applied uniformly. They imply context-dependent mapping or errors in the examples.
  - The implemented rule prioritizes the consistent pattern observed in `train_1` and `train_2`.
