            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid of single digits into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to be a value-replacement process where specific digits in the input grid are systematically changed to other digits in the output grid. The core logic seems to revolve around identifying pairs of digits based on their frequency within the input grid and then swapping these pairs.\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of integers (specifically, single digits 0-9).\n2.  **Transformation:** A substitution cipher applied to the grid elements.\n3.  **Rule Identification:** The key challenge is determining which digits map to which other digits.\n4.  **Frequency Analysis:** The frequency of non-zero digits seems crucial. The two most frequent non-zero digits appear to form one swap pair, and the next two most frequent non-zero digits form a second swap pair.\n5.  **Zero Handling:** The digit '0' consistently remains unchanged.\n6.  **Handling Fewer than 4 Non-Zero Digits:**\n    *   If only 3 distinct non-zero digits exist (e.g., train_3: 4, 8, 9), the top two (4, 8) form the first pair. The third digit (9) seems to pair with another digit (5 in the example) to form the second swap pair (9, 5). The origin or rule for selecting '5' is not immediately obvious from frequency alone but was observed in the output.\n    *   If only 2 distinct non-zero digits exist, they form the single swap pair.\n    *   The behavior with 3 distinct non-zero digits in train_4 (5, 1, 8) is less clear under this simple frequency rule, as the output transformations (5<->1, 8->1, 1->8 in some contexts) don't perfectly align with swapping the top two (5, 1) and then pairing the third (8) uniquely.\n7.  **Inconsistencies:** The described frequency-based pair-swapping rule works perfectly for `train_1` and `train_2`. It requires assuming a specific second pair (9, 5) for `train_3` and even then leads to a slight mismatch in the output provided for `train_3`. The rule struggles to explain the transformations observed in `train_4` consistently. However, it represents the most dominant pattern observed.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```"
