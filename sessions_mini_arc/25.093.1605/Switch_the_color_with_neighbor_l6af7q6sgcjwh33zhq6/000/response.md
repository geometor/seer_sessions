**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming an input grid of single digits into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to be a value-replacement process where specific digits in the input grid are systematically changed to other digits in the output grid. The core logic seems to revolve around identifying pairs of digits based on their frequency within the input grid and then swapping these pairs.

1.  **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids of integers (specifically, single digits 0-9).
2.  **Transformation:** A substitution cipher applied to the grid elements.
3.  **Rule Identification:** The key challenge is determining which digits map to which other digits.
4.  **Frequency Analysis:** The frequency of non-zero digits seems crucial. The two most frequent non-zero digits appear to form one swap pair, and the next two most frequent non-zero digits form a second swap pair.
5.  **Zero Handling:** The digit '0' consistently remains unchanged.
6.  **Handling Fewer than 4 Non-Zero Digits:**
    *   If only 3 distinct non-zero digits exist (e.g., train_3: 4, 8, 9), the top two (4, 8) form the first pair. The third digit (9) seems to pair with another digit (5 in the example) to form the second swap pair (9, 5). The origin or rule for selecting '5' is not immediately obvious from frequency alone but was observed in the output.
    *   If only 2 distinct non-zero digits exist, they form the single swap pair.
    *   The behavior with 3 distinct non-zero digits in train_4 (5, 1, 8) is less clear under this simple frequency rule, as the output transformations (5<->1, 8->1, 1->8 in some contexts) don't perfectly align with swapping the top two (5, 1) and then pairing the third (8) uniquely.
7.  **Inconsistencies:** The described frequency-based pair-swapping rule works perfectly for `train_1` and `train_2`. It requires assuming a specific second pair (9, 5) for `train_3` and even then leads to a slight mismatch in the output provided for `train_3`. The rule struggles to explain the transformations observed in `train_4` consistently. However, it represents the most dominant pattern observed.

Task: Digit Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Element_Type: Integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Variable dimensions (all examples 5x5)
    - Contains digits 0-9

Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Element_Type: Integer (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as input grid
    - Contains digits derived from input grid via transformation

Transformation_Logic:
  Core_Operation: Value Swapping
  Affected_Elements: Non-zero digits
  Unaffected_Elements: Zero digits (0 maps to 0)
  Rule_Basis: Frequency of non-zero digits in the input grid

  Steps:
    1. Calculate_Frequency: Determine the count of each non-zero digit in the input grid.
    2. Identify_Pairs:
       - Pair_1: Identify the two most frequent non-zero digits (M1, M2). Designate them for swapping (M1 <-> M2). Handle ties arbitrarily or by numerical value.
       - Pair_2: Identify the third and fourth most frequent non-zero digits (M3, M4). Designate them for swapping (M3 <-> M4).
    3. Handle_Edge_Cases:
       - If only 3 distinct non-zero digits (M1, M2, M3): Swap (M1 <-> M2). The third digit (M3) appears to swap with a specific partner based on observed examples (e.g., 9 swaps with 5 in train_3), though
