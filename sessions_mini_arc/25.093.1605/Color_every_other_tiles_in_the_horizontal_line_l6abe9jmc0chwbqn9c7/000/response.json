            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe input and output are both 5x5 grids containing digits 0, 4, and 5. The core task appears to involve modifying specific occurrences of the digit '5' within the grid, changing them to '4' based on their context within a row. The digit '0' seems to act as a background or empty space and remains unchanged. The transformation rule seems localized to specific rows where sequences of '5's appear horizontally. Vertical structures of '5's are present but don't seem to directly influence the change, except by contributing '5's to the relevant rows. The key change happens within horizontal runs of '5's, where an alternating pattern of '4' and '5' replaces the original run.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
