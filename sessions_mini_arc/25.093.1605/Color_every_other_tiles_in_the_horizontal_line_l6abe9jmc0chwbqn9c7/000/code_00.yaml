Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell_Values: [0, 4, 5]

Objects:
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (0, 4, or 5)
      - Position: (row_index, column_index)
  - Name: Row
    Properties:
      - Cells: Sequence of Cells
      - Index: Integer (0-4)

Relationships:
  - A Cell is part of a Row.
  - A Row is part of the Grid.
  - Cells within a Row have horizontal neighbors (left, right).

Input_Specifics:
  - Contains patterns of '5's, often forming lines (horizontal/vertical).
  - Contains '0's, often as background.

Output_Specifics:
  - Largely identical to input.
  - Some '5's are changed to '4's.
  - '0's remain unchanged.

Transformation_Focus:
  - Operates row by row.
  - Identifies horizontal contiguous sequences of '5's within each row.
  - Modifies values within these sequences.

Action:
  - Iterate through each row.
  - Identify consecutive runs of the value '5'.
  - For each run of '5's:
    - Replace the '5' at the 1st position in the run with '4'.
    - Keep the '5' at the 2nd position.
    - Replace the '5' at the 3rd position with '4'.
    - Continue alternating (4, 5, 4, 5, ...) for the duration of the run.
  - Values outside these horizontal runs of '5's remain unchanged.
