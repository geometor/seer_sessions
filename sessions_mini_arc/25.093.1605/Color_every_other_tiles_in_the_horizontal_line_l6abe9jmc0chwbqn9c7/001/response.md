"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each row independently.
Identifies contiguous horizontal runs of the value '5'.
If a run of '5's has a length greater than 1, it modifies the cells
within that run based on their position: cells at odd positions
(1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) within the run are changed to '4', while cells
at even positions (2nd, 4th, ...) remain '5'.
Cells with value '0' and cells in runs of '5's with length 1 remain unchanged.
