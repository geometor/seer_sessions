Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5 (inferred from examples)
  Cell_Values_Input: [0, 5]
  Cell_Values_Output: [0, 4, 5]

Objects:
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (0, 4, or 5)
      - Position: (row_index, column_index)
  - Name: Horizontal_Run_of_5s
    Properties:
      - Cells: A contiguous sequence of Cells in the same row with Value=5
      - Start_Column: Index of the first cell in the run
      - End_Column: Index of the last cell in the run
      - Length: Number of cells in the run

Relationships:
  - A Cell is part of a Grid.
  - A Cell can be part of a Horizontal_Run_of_5s.

Transformation_Rule:
  Name: Alternate_Horizontal_Fives
  Input_Condition: Cell Value is 5.
  Context_Condition: Cell is part of a Horizontal_Run_of_5s with Length > 1.
  Action:
    - Determine the 1-based position of the Cell within its Horizontal_Run_of_5s.
    - If the position is odd (1, 3, 5,...), change the Cell's Value to 4 in the output.
    - If the position is even (2, 4, 6,...), the Cell's Value remains 5 in the output.
  Default_Action: If the Input_Condition or Context_Condition is not met, the Cell's Value in the output is the same as its Value in the input.

Anomaly:
  - Source: train_3 expected output
  - Cell: (0, 2)
  - Description: Input value is 0, Expected output value is 5. This contradicts the Default_Action where 0s should remain 0. This is treated as a likely error in the example data.
