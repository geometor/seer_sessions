```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid by processing each row independently.
Identifies contiguous horizontal runs of the value '5'.
If a run of '5's has a length greater than 1, it modifies the cells
within that run based on their 1-based position: cells at odd positions
(1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) within the run are changed to '4', while cells
at even positions (2nd, 4th, ...) remain '5'.
Cells with value '0' and isolated '5's (runs of length 1) remain unchanged.
