Grid:
  Type: 2D Array (List of Lists)
  Dimensions: 5x5 (Constant across examples)
  Cell_Values:
    Input: Integers (0, 5)
    Output: Integers (0, 4, 5)

Objects:
  - Name: Cell
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (0, 4, or 5)
      - Position: (row_index, column_index)
  - Name: Row
    Properties:
      - Cells: Sequence of Cells
      - Index: Integer (0-4)
  - Name: Horizontal_Run_of_Fives
    Properties:
      - Row_Index: Integer
      - Start_Column: Integer
      - End_Column: Integer
      - Length: Integer (End_Column - Start_Column)
      - Cells: Sequence of Cells within the run

Relationships:
  - A Cell is part of a Row.
  - A Row is part of the Grid.
  - Cells within a Row have horizontal neighbors.
  - Horizontal_Run_of_Fives is a contiguous subsequence of Cells within a Row, all having the value 5.

Input_State:
  - Grid contains cells with values 0 and 5.
  - '0' acts as background/empty space.
  - '5's can appear individually or in contiguous horizontal sequences (runs).

Output_State:
  - Grid contains cells with values 0, 4, and 5.
  - Cells that were '0' in the input remain '0'.
  - Cells that were '5' in the input might change to '4' or remain '5'.

Transformation:
  - Scope: Operates independently on each Row.
  - Trigger: Presence of a Horizontal_Run_of_Fives.
  - Condition: The Length of the Horizontal_Run_of_Fives must be greater than 1.
  - Action (if condition met):
    - Iterate through the Cells within the run, based on their position relative to the start of the run (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
    - Change the Value of the Cell to '4' if its position within the run is odd (1, 3, 5, ...).
    - Keep the Value of the Cell as '5' if its position within the run is even (2, 4, 6, ...).
  - Action (if condition not met, i.e., run length is 1):
    - Keep the Value of the Cell as '5'.
  - Action (if cell is not part of a Horizontal_Run_of_Fives):
    - Keep the original Value (which will be '0' or an isolated '5').

Anomaly:
  - Train_3_Expected_Output: Row 0 shows `0 0 5 0 0` while the corresponding Input Row 0 is `0 0 0 0 0`. This conflicts with the general rule that '0's remain unchanged and transformations only apply to '5's. This is treated as a potential error in the example data.
