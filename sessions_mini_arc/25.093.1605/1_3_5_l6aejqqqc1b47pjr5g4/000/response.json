We can think of 0 as \"empty\" or \"background\" and 4 as \"filled\" or \"active\".\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a propagation or spreading process. The locations of the '4's in the output depend on the locations of the '4's in the input.\n4.  **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   In `train_1`, a single '4' at `(4, 2)` results in '4's at `(3, 2)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 2)`, and `(4, 3)`. The original '4' seems to persist, and new '4's appear in adjacent cells (up, left, right).\n    *   In `train_2`, the configuration from `train_1`'s output evolves further. The '4's spread again. For instance, the '4' at `(3, 2)` seems to cause a '4' to appear at `(2, 2)`. The '4's in row 4 cause the empty cells `(4, 0)` and `(4, 4)` to become '4'.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input grid is nearly filled with '4's. The only '0's are at the top corners `(0, 0)` and `(0, 4)`. These become '4' in the output, likely because they are adjacent to existing '4's.\n5.  **Hypothesized Rule:** The core rule seems to be: A cell becomes '4' if it was already '4' *or* if it was '0' and had at least one immediate orthogonal neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that was '4' in the input grid. This is characteristic of a simple cellular automaton growth or fill rule.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
