Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell Values: [0, 4]

Objects:
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - row_index: Integer (0-4)
        - column_index: Integer (0-4)
        - value: Integer (0 or 4)
      Relationships:
        - is_orthogonal_neighbor_of: Cell

Transformation:
  Name: Neighbor-Based Propagation
  Rule: For each cell in the output grid:
    - If the corresponding cell in the input grid has value 4, the output cell value is 4.
    - If the corresponding cell in the input grid has value 0:
        - Check its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.
        - If any neighbor has value 4, the output cell value becomes 4.
        - Otherwise, the output cell value remains 0.
  Concurrency: All cell updates are based on the state of the *input* grid.
