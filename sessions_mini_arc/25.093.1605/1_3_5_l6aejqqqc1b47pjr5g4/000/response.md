Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers, specifically 5x5 in size.
2.  **Values:** The grids contain only two distinct values: 0 and 4. We can think of 0 as "empty" or "background" and 4 as "filled" or "active".
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a propagation or spreading process. The locations of the '4's in the output depend on the locations of the '4's in the input.
4.  **Pattern Analysis:**
    *   In `train_1`, a single '4' at `(4, 2)` results in '4's at `(3, 2)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 2)`, and `(4, 3)`. The original '4' seems to persist, and new '4's appear in adjacent cells (up, left, right).
    *   In `train_2`, the configuration from `train_1`'s output evolves further. The '4's spread again. For instance, the '4' at `(3, 2)` seems to cause a '4' to appear at `(2, 2)`. The '4's in row 4 cause the empty cells `(4, 0)` and `(4, 4)` to become '4'.
    *   In `train_3`, the input grid is nearly filled with '4's. The only '0's are at the top corners `(0, 0)` and `(0, 4)`. These become '4' in the output, likely because they are adjacent to existing '4's.
5.  **Hypothesized Rule:** The core rule seems to be: A cell becomes '4' if it was already '4' *or* if it was '0' and had at least one immediate orthogonal neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that was '4' in the input grid. This is characteristic of a simple cellular automaton growth or fill rule.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell Values: [0, 4]

Objects:
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - row_index: Integer (0-4)
        - column_index: Integer (0-4)
        - value: Integer (0 or 4)
      Relationships:
        - is_orthogonal_neighbor_of: Cell

Transformation:
  Name: Neighbor-Based Propagation
  Rule: For each cell in the output grid:
    - If the corresponding cell in the input grid has value 4, the output cell value is 4.
    - If the corresponding cell in the input grid has value 0:
        - Check its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.
        - If any neighbor has value 4, the output cell value becomes 4.
        - Otherwise, the output cell value remains 0.
  Concurrency: All cell updates are based on the state of the *input* grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell location (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
3.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  If the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *input* grid is 0:
    b.  Check the values of its valid orthogonal neighbors in the *input* grid: `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`. Ensure neighbors are within the grid boundaries.
    c.  If any of these valid neighbors has a value of 4 in the *input* grid:
    d.  Set the value of the cell `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to 4.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
