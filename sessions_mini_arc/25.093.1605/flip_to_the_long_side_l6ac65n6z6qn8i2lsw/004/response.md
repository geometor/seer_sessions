## General Assessment and Strategy

The core logic identified in the previous attempt appears consistent with all four training examples. The transformation involves swapping adjacent pairs of columns. The specific pairs to be swapped (starting with (0,1) or starting with (1,2)) depend on the parity of the index of the first column (leftmost) that contains at least one non-zero element. If the grid contains only zeros, the behavior defaults to swapping pairs starting with (0,1).

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" suggests a type mismatch or incorrect boolean evaluation occurred during testing, likely related to using NumPy arrays where standard Python lists or simple booleans were expected. This might be an issue within the testing environment or harness, rather than a fundamental flaw in the core logic as described. The strategy is to reaffirm the logic based on the examples, refine the documentation (YAML and natural language program), and ensure the coder phase implements this logic robustly, perhaps explicitly handling list inputs or converting inputs to a consistent format if necessary.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the first non-zero column index and the resulting swap starting index for each training example.


``` python
import copy

# Re-use the function from the previous attempt to find the first non-zero column
def find_first_non_zero_col(grid):
    """
    Finds the index of the first column containing a non-zero value.
    Returns -1 if the grid is empty or all values are zero.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return -1 # Indicate empty or invalid grid

    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0])

    for j in range(num_cols):
        for i in range(num_rows):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                return j  # Found the first non-zero column index
    
    return -1 # No non-zero values found

# Define the input grids
train_1_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
]

train_2_input = [
    [6, 0, 6, 0, 0],
    [0, 6, 0, 6, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

train_3_input = [
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

train_4_input = [
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

inputs = [train_1_input, train_2_input, train_3_input, train_4_input]
results = []

for i, grid in enumerate(inputs):
    first_nz_col = find_first_non_zero_col(grid)
    if first_nz_col != -1 and first_nz_col % 2 != 0:
        start_index = 1 # Odd first non-zero column -> start swaps at index 1
    else:
        start_index = 0 # Even first non-zero column or all zeros -> start swaps at index 0
    results.append({
        'example': i + 1,
        'first_nz_col': first_nz_col,
        'start_swap_index': start_index
    })

print(results)
```
```
[{'example': 1, 'first_nz_col': 3, 'start_swap_index': 1}, {'example': 2, 'first_nz_col': 0, 'start_swap_index': 0}, {'example': 3, 'first_nz_col': 0, 'start_swap_index': 0}, {'example': 4, 'first_nz_col': 0, 'start_swap_index': 0}]

```
The metrics confirm the previous analysis:
*   Example 1: First non-zero column is 3 (odd), so swaps should start at index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...).
*   Example 2: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...).
*   Example 3: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0.
*   Example 4: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0.

This logic consistently explains the transformation shown in all training examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists) of integers
      - dimensions: variable rows and columns
      - cells: contain non-negative integers
      - state: input_grid, output_grid

  - property: first_non_zero_column_index
    applies_to: grid
    definition: The smallest column index `j` such that at least one cell `grid[i][j]` is non-zero. If all cells are zero, this property is considered 'even' for determining swap behavior (or effectively index 0).

  - relationship: adjacency
    between: columns
    definition: Columns with indices `j` and `j+1` are adjacent.

  - action: swap_adjacent_column_pairs
    target: grid
    parameters:
      - start_index: The index of the first column in the first pair to swap (either 0 or 1).
    condition: Applied iteratively to pairs `(j, j+1)` where `j >= start_index` and `j` increments by 2. Requires `j+1` to be a valid column index.
    effect: Modifies the grid by exchanging the entire contents of column `j` with column `j+1` for all applicable pairs.

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1. Determine the `first_non_zero_column_index` of the `input_grid`.
  - step: 2. Set the `start_index` for swapping:
      - If `first_non_zero_column_index` is odd, set `start_index` to 1.
      - Otherwise (if even or if the grid is all zeros), set `start_index` to 0.
  - step: 3. Create a copy of the `input_grid` to serve as the initial `output_grid`.
  - step: 4. Apply the `swap_adjacent_column_pairs` action to the `output_grid`, using the determined `start_index`.
  - step: 5. The final state of the `output_grid` is the result.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Inspect Input Grid:** Examine the input grid to find the index of the first (leftmost) column that contains any non-zero value. Let this index be `first_nz_col`. If the grid contains only zeros, treat `first_nz_col` as effectively even (e.g., conceptually 0).
2.  **Determine Swap Pattern:**
    *   If `first_nz_col` is odd, the column swapping will start with the pair at indices (1, 2).
    *   If `first_nz_col` is even (or if the grid was all zeros), the column swapping will start with the pair at indices (0, 1).
3.  **Perform Swaps:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the column indices `j` starting from the determined pattern's start index (0 or 1) and incrementing by 2 (i.e., j = start, start+2, start+4, ...). For each `j`, if column `j+1` exists within the grid bounds, swap the entire content of column `j` with the entire content of column `j+1` in the copied grid.
4.  **Output:** The modified grid after performing all required swaps is the output.
