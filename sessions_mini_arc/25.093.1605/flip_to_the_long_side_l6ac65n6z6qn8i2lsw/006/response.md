## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed due to a Python/NumPy error (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`), indicating an issue in how boolean checks were performed on array-like structures, not necessarily a flaw in the core transformation logic identified.

Manual analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the hypothesis: the transformation involves swapping adjacent columns, and the pattern of swaps (starting with pair (0,1) vs. pair (1,2)) depends on the parity of the index of the first column containing a non-zero element.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic based on all examples.
2.  Generate metrics to support the logic.
3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and accuracy based on the confirmed logic.
4.  The subsequent coder phase must focus on correctly implementing this logic, ensuring proper handling of lists/arrays in conditional checks to avoid the previous error.

## Metrics Analysis

Metrics will be gathered by analyzing the provided examples.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Dimensions: 5x5
*   Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 3 (Value 7 at (0,3)) - Parity: Odd
*   Observed Swaps: Columns 3 and 4 are swapped. Pairs (0,1) and (2,3) remain unchanged.
*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...). The relevant pair (3,4) is swapped.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Dimensions: 5x5
*   Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 0 (Value 6 at (0,0)) - Parity: Even
*   Observed Swaps: Columns 0 and 1 are swapped. Columns 2 and 3 are swapped. Column 4 remains unchanged relative to its potential partner.
*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...). Relevant pairs (0,1) and (2,3) are swapped.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Dimensions: 5x5
*   Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 0 (Value 8 at (0,0)) - Parity: Even
*   Observed Swaps: Columns 0 and 1 are swapped. Pairs (2,3), (4,5)... remain unchanged (as they contain only zeros or don't exist).
*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...). Relevant pair (0,1) is swapped.

**Example 4:**
*   Input Dimensions: 5x5
*   Output Dimensions: 5x5
*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 1 (Value 3 at (0,1)) - Parity: Odd
*   Observed Swaps: Columns 1 and 2 are swapped. Pair (0,1) remains unchanged. Pair (3,4) remains unchanged.
*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...). Relevant pair (1,2) is swapped.

**Conclusion:** The metrics consistently support the rule: determine the index `k` of the first column with a non-zero value. If `k` is odd, swap adjacent column pairs starting at index 1 ((1,2), (3,4), ...). If `k` is even (or if all elements are zero, implicitly index 0), swap adjacent column pairs starting at index 0 ((0,1), (2,3), ...).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists) of integers
      - dimensions: M rows, N columns (variable, e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cells: contain non-negative integers
  - property: first_non_zero_column_index
    description: The smallest column index `j` such that at least one cell `grid[i][j]` is non-zero. If all cells are zero, this property is considered to have an effective index of 0 (even parity).
    value_range: 0 to N-1, or conceptually 0 if all zeros.
  - property: column_index_parity
    based_on: first_non_zero_column_index
    values:
      - even: If the first non-zero column index is 0, 2, 4, ... or if the grid is all zeros.
      - odd: If the first non-zero column index is 1, 3, 5, ...
  - action: swap_adjacent_columns
    target: Pairs of columns `(j, j+1)` in the grid.
    condition: The selection of pairs to swap depends on the `column_index_parity`.
    effect: The entire content of column `j` is exchanged with the entire content of column `j+1`.
transformation_goal:
  - Modify the input grid by conditionally swapping adjacent column pairs based on the parity of the first non-zero column's index.
transformation_logic:
  - step_1: Determine the `first_non_zero_column_index`.
  - step_2: Determine the `column_index_parity`.
  - step_3: If parity is `even`, set `start_swap_index` to 0.
  - step_4: If parity is `odd`, set `start_swap_index` to 1.
  - step_5: Perform `swap_adjacent_columns` action for pairs `(j, j+1)` where `j` starts at `start_swap_index` and increments by 2 (`j = start_swap_index, start_swap_index + 2, ...`), ensuring `j+1` is within grid bounds.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Inspect the Input Grid:** Examine the input grid column by column, from left to right (index 0 upwards), to find the index of the first column that contains at least one non-zero value.
2.  **Determine Starting Point for Swaps:**
    *   If a non-zero value is found and its column index is **odd** (1, 3, 5, ...), the swapping process will start by considering the pair of columns at indices (1, 2).
    *   If a non-zero value is found and its column index is **even** (0, 2, 4, ...), OR if the entire grid contains only zeros, the swapping process will start by considering the pair of columns at indices (0, 1).
3.  **Perform Column Swaps:**
    *   Identify the starting column index determined in the previous step (either 0 or 1). Let this be `start_index`.
    *   Iterate through the columns of the grid, starting from `start_index`, with a step of 2 (i.e., process indices `start_index`, `start_index + 2`, `start_index + 4`, ...).
    *   For each index `j` in this sequence, if column `j+1` exists within the grid boundaries, swap the entire contents of column `j` with the entire contents of column `j+1`.
4.  **Output:** The grid resulting from these swaps is the final output.
