            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed due to a Python/NumPy error (`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`), indicating an issue in how boolean checks were performed on array-like structures, not necessarily a flaw in the core transformation logic identified.\n\nManual analysis of the input/output pairs confirms the hypothesis: the transformation involves swapping adjacent columns, and the pattern of swaps (starting with pair (0,1) vs. pair (1,2)) depends on the parity of the index of the first column containing a non-zero element.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic based on all examples.\n2.  Generate metrics to support the logic.\n3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program for clarity and accuracy based on the confirmed logic.\n4.  The subsequent coder phase must focus on correctly implementing this logic, ensuring proper handling of lists/arrays in conditional checks to avoid the previous error.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nMetrics will be gathered by analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Dimensions: 5x5\n*   Output Dimensions: 5x5\n*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 3 (Value 7 at (0,3)) - Parity: Odd\n*   Observed Swaps: Columns 3 and 4 are swapped. Pairs (0,1) and (2,3) remain unchanged.\n*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...). The relevant pair (3,4) is swapped.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Dimensions: 5x5\n*   Output Dimensions: 5x5\n*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 0 (Value 6 at (0,0)) - Parity: Even\n*   Observed Swaps: Columns 0 and 1 are swapped. Columns 2 and 3 are swapped. Column 4 remains unchanged relative to its potential partner.\n*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...). Relevant pairs (0,1) and (2,3) are swapped.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Dimensions: 5x5\n*   Output Dimensions: 5x5\n*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 0 (Value 8 at (0,0)) - Parity: Even\n*   Observed Swaps: Columns 0 and 1 are swapped. Pairs (2,3), (4,5)... remain unchanged (as they contain only zeros or don't exist).\n*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...). Relevant pair (0,1) is swapped.\n\n**Example 4:**\n*   Input Dimensions: 5x5\n*   Output Dimensions: 5x5\n*   First Non-Zero Column Index (Input): 1 (Value 3 at (0,1)) - Parity: Odd\n*   Observed Swaps: Columns 1 and 2 are swapped. Pair (0,1) remains unchanged. Pair (3,4) remains unchanged.\n*   Pattern: Swapping starts from index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...). Relevant pair (1,2) is swapped.\n\n**Conclusion:** The metrics consistently support the rule: determine the index `k` of the first column with a non-zero value. If `k` is odd, swap adjacent column pairs starting at index 1 ((1,2), (3,4), ...). If `k` is even (or if all elements are zero, implicitly index 0), swap adjacent column pairs starting at index 0 ((0,1), (2,3), ...).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
