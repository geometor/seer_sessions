*   **Perception of Elements:** The task operates on 2D grids of integers. The input grid undergoes a transformation to produce the output grid. The transformation appears to be column-based, specifically involving swapping pairs of adjacent columns. The dimensions of the grid remain constant. The values within the cells are moved, but not altered.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
          - cells: contain non-negative integers
      - relationship: adjacency
        between: columns
        definition: Columns with indices `j` and `j+1` are adjacent.
      - action: swap_columns
        target: adjacent column pairs
        condition: Applies to pairs starting with an even index (0, 2, 4, ...)
        effect: The entire content of column `j` is exchanged with the entire content of column `j+1`.
    transformation_goal:
      - Rearrange the grid by systematically swapping adjacent pairs of columns.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through the columns of the input grid using an index `j`, starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 in each step (i.e., process columns 0, 2, 4, ...).
    2.  For each index `j`, check if a subsequent column `j+1` exists within the grid boundaries.
    3.  If column `j+1` exists, swap the entire contents of column `j` with the entire contents of column `j+1`.
    4.  The resulting grid after performing all necessary swaps is the output.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The core logic identified in the previous attempt appears consistent with all four training examples. The transformation involves swapping adjacent pairs of columns. The specific pairs to be swapped (starting with (0,1) or starting with (1,2)) depend on the parity of the index of the first column (leftmost) that contains at least one non-zero element. If the grid contains only zeros, the behavior defaults to swapping pairs starting with (0,1).

The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" suggests a type mismatch or incorrect boolean evaluation occurred during testing, likely related to using NumPy arrays where standard Python lists or simple booleans were expected. This might be an issue within the testing environment or harness, rather than a fundamental flaw in the core logic as described. The strategy is to reaffirm the logic based on the examples, refine the documentation (YAML and natural language program), and ensure the coder phase implements this logic robustly, perhaps explicitly handling list inputs or converting inputs to a consistent format if necessary.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the first non-zero column index and the resulting swap starting index for each training example.

```
The metrics confirm the previous analysis:
*   Example 1: First non-zero column is 3 (odd), so swaps should start at index 1 (pairs (1,2), (3,4), ...).
*   Example 2: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0 (pairs (0,1), (2,3), ...).
*   Example 3: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0.
*   Example 4: First non-zero column is 0 (even), so swaps should start at index 0.

This logic consistently explains the transformation shown in all training examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists) of integers
      - dimensions: variable rows and columns
      - cells: contain non-negative integers
      - state: input_grid, output_grid

  - property: first_non_zero_column_index
    applies_to: grid
    definition: The smallest column index `j` such that at least one cell `grid[i][j]` is non-zero. If all cells are zero, this property is considered 'even' for determining swap behavior (or effectively index 0).

  - relationship: adjacency
    between: columns
    definition: Columns with indices `j` and `j+1` are adjacent.

  - action: swap_adjacent_column_pairs
    target: grid
    parameters:
      - start_index: The index of the first column in the first pair to swap (either 0 or 1).
    condition: Applied iteratively to pairs `(j, j+1)` where `j >= start_index` and `j` increments by 2. Requires `j+1` to be a valid column index.
    effect: Modifies the grid by exchanging the entire contents of column `j` with column `j+1` for all applicable pairs.

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1. Determine the `first_non_zero_column_index` of the `input_grid`.
  - step: 2. Set the `start_index` for swapping:
      - If `first_non_zero_column_index` is odd, set `start_index` to 1.
      - Otherwise (if even or if the grid is all zeros), set `start_index` to 0.
  - step: 3. Create a copy of the `input_grid` to serve as the initial `output_grid`.
  - step: 4. Apply the `swap_adjacent_column_pairs` action to the `output_grid`, using the determined `start_index`.
  - step: 5. The final state of the `output_grid` is the result.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Inspect Input Grid:** Examine the input grid to find the index of the first (leftmost) column that contains any non-zero value. Let this index be `first_nz_col`. If the grid contains only zeros, treat `first_nz_col` as effectively even (e.g., conceptually 0).
2.  **Determine Swap Pattern:**
    *   If `first_nz_col` is odd, the column swapping will start with the pair at indices (1, 2).
    *   If `first_nz_col` is even (or if the grid was all zeros), the column swapping will start with the pair at indices (0, 1).
3.  **Perform Swaps:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through the column indices `j` starting from the determined pattern's start index (0 or 1) and incrementing by 2 (i.e., j = start, start+2, start+4, ...). For each `j`, if column `j+1` exists within the grid bounds, swap the entire content of column `j` with the entire content of column `j+1` in the copied grid.
4.  **Output:** The modified grid after performing all required swaps is the output.
