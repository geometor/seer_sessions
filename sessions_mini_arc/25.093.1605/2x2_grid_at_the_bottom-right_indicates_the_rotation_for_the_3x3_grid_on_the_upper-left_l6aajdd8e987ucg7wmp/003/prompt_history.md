Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are represented as 2D grids (matrices) of numbers.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited set of numbers, which likely represent colors:
    *   `0`: Appears to be the background color (black).
    *   `3`: A primary color involved in the input patterns (blue).
    *   `1`: Another color present in some input patterns (red).
    *   `4`: Another color present in some input patterns (yellow).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a consistent change: cells with values `1` or `4` in the input grid are replaced with `0` in the output grid. Cells with values `0` or `3` remain unchanged.
4.  **No Spatial Rearrangement:** The positions of the `3`s and `0`s are preserved between input and output. The only change is the conversion of `1`s and `4`s to `0`s.

**YAML Facts:**

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - The position of each cell is maintained from input to output.
transformation_rule:
  - For each cell in the input grid:
    - If the cell value is 1 or 4, the corresponding output cell value becomes 0.
    - Otherwise, the corresponding output cell value is the same as the input cell value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (row by row, column by column) of the input grid.
3.  For the current cell, check its value (color).
4.  If the value is `1` or `4`, set the value of the corresponding cell in the new grid to `0`.
5.  If the value is not `1` or `4` (meaning it's `0` or `3`), copy the value from the input cell to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
6.  The final new grid is the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified that colors 1 (red) and 4 (yellow) are removed (replaced by 0) in the output. However, the provided code based on this simple rule failed on training examples 2 and 3, and test example 1.

The failure occurred because the *expected* outputs for these examples showed that the blue pixels (color 3) also changed their configuration, specifically *when* red (1) or yellow (4) pixels were present in the input. In the first training example, where the initial code succeeded, the blue pixels retained their original configuration; crucially, the red/yellow pixels were present but spatially separated from the blue pixels in that example.

This suggests a conditional transformation:
1.  Colors 1 and 4 are always removed.
2.  The configuration of color 3 remains unchanged *only if* colors 1 or 4 are absent (or perhaps sufficiently "separate", as in train_1, although the exact separation rule isn't clear).
3.  If colors 1 or 4 *are* present (and potentially "interacting" with color 3), the original configuration of color 3 is replaced by a *new*, different configuration of color 3.

The primary challenge is defining the rule that generates the *new* configuration for color 3 in the cases where it changes. The transformation applied to the blue pixels (`T` in the thought process) is not immediately obvious (not a simple shift, scale, rotation, bounding box fill, or convex hull). It varies between examples, suggesting it depends on the specific input configuration of the blue pixels.

**Strategy:**
1.  Acknowledge the two distinct transformation modes based on the presence/absence (or interaction) of colors 1/4.
2.  Accurately describe the removal of colors 1 and 4.
3.  Describe the preservation of color 3 in the absence of interaction with 1/4.
4.  Describe the replacement of color 3 with a *new configuration* when 1/4 are present/interacting, even if the exact algorithm for generating the new configuration (`T`) is still unclear from the examples. The natural language program must state that this replacement occurs and results in the shapes seen in the examples.

**Metrics**

Based on the `tool_code` analysis:

*   **Grid Shape:** All input and output grids are 5x5.
*   **Color Presence:**
    *   Input grids contain colors 0, 1, 3, 4.
    *   Output grids contain only colors 0, 3.
*   **Counts & Coordinates (Input -> Output):**
    *   **Train 1:**
        *   Input: 3x(1), 3x(3), 1x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,0), (0,1), (2,2)}`. Coords(1/4): `{(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}`.
        *   Output: 0x(1), 3x(3), 0x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,0), (0,1), (2,2)}`. (Blue unchanged).
    *   **Train 2:**
        *   Input: 3x(1), 4x(3), 1x(4). Coords(3): `{(1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)}`. Coords(1/4): `{(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}`.
        *   Output: 0x(1), 4x(3), 0x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)}`. (Blue changed).
    *   **Train 3:**
        *   Input: 3x(1), 3x(3), 1x(4). Coords(3): `{(1,0), (1,1), (2,2)}`. Coords(1/4): `{(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}`.
        *   Output: 0x(1), 3x(3), 0x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,0), (1,1), (1,2)}`. (Blue changed).
    *   **Test 1:**
        *   Input: 3x(1), 4x(3), 1x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)}`. Coords(1/4): `{(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}`.
        *   Output: 0x(1), 4x(3), 0x(4). Coords(3): `{(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)}`. (Blue changed).

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   The presence of any 1s or 4s in the input always results in zero 1s or 4s in the output.
*   The number of blue (3) pixels can change between input and output (e.g., Test 1: 4 in -> 4 out; Train 3: 3 in -> 3 out).
*   The specific coordinates of the blue (3) pixels change in examples 2, 3, and test 1, indicating a transformation beyond simple removal of other colors.

      - dimensions: same as input grid
      - background: color 0
      - content: Populated based on the outcomes of remove_color, preserve_blue_configuration or transform_blue_configuration actions.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - The final output grid's blue cells depend conditionally on the presence of red or yellow cells in the input grid.

transformation_rule_summary:
  - If the input grid contains any red (1) or yellow (4) cells, remove them (set to 0). Then, replace all original blue (3) cells with a new configuration of blue cells determined by a specific transformation rule (T) applied to the original blue cell coordinates.
  - If the input grid contains *no* red (1) or yellow (4) cells, the output grid is identical to the input grid (inferred, needs confirmation example).
  - Based on Train_1: If red/yellow cells exist but are "separate" from blue cells, the blue cells might be preserved while red/yellow are removed. This adds ambiguity to the simple presence check. A more refined rule might involve proximity or bounding box overlap. However, sticking to the clearest pattern: presence of 1/4 triggers removal of 1/4 and transformation T of 3s. Absence of 1/4 preserves 3s. Train_1 might be a specific edge case of T where T(config) = config under certain separation conditions, or the simple presence rule is sufficient and Train_1's output implies T(input_3s) happens to equal input_3s in that case.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (0).
2.  Check the input grid to determine if any cells contain the colors red (1) or yellow (4).
3.  **Condition 1: Red (1) or Yellow (4) cells ARE present:**
    a. Identify the coordinates of all blue (3) cells in the *input* grid. Let this set of coordinates be `InputBlueCoords`.
    b. Apply a specific transformation function, `T`, to `InputBlueCoords` to generate a new set of coordinates, `OutputBlueCoords`. (Note: The exact definition of `T` is derived from the relationship between input and output blue coordinates in examples train_2, train_3, and test_1 where red/yellow cells were present).
    c. For each coordinate pair `(r, c)` in `OutputBlueCoords`, set the cell at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to blue (3).
    d. All other cells in the output grid remain background (0). (Effectively, red and yellow cells are removed, and the original blue configuration is replaced).
4.  **Condition 2: Red (1) and Yellow (4) cells ARE NOT present:**
    a. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the *input* grid.
    b. Copy the value from the input cell `(r, c)` to the corresponding output cell `(r, c)`. (The output is identical to the input).
5.  Return the final output grid.
