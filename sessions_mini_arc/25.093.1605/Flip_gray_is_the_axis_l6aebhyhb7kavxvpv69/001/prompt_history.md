*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are numerical grids of the same dimensions (5x5 in the example).
    *   The grids contain single-digit integers, including zero.
    *   Comparing the input and output grids, the top three rows appear identical.
    *   The bottom two rows of the output grid seem to be derived from the top two rows of the input grid. Specifically, the fourth output row mirrors the second input row, and the fifth output row mirrors the first input row.
    *   The transformation involves a vertical reflection or mirroring across the horizontal centerline of the grid.
    *   Zeros in the input grid can be replaced by non-zero values in the output if the corresponding mirrored position in the input contains a non-zero value.
    *   The operation effectively ensures vertical symmetry in the output grid by filling in values based on reflection, keeping the larger value if both the original and reflected positions have non-zero values (though in this example, the reflection fills only zero-value cells).

```yaml
    Objects:
      - Input_Grid:
          Properties:
            - Type: 2D Array/Matrix
            - Element_Type: Integer
            - Dimensions: Height (H), Width (W)
            - Cells: Contains individual numeric values at coordinates (row, column)
      - Output_Grid:
          Properties:
            - Type: 2D Array/Matrix
            - Element_Type: Integer
            - Dimensions: Height (H), Width (W) (Same as Input_Grid)
            - Cells: Contains individual numeric values at coordinates (row, column)
      - Horizontal_Centerline:
          Properties:
            - Type: Axis of Reflection
            - Position: Mathematically located at (H-1)/2. For H=5, this is row index 2.

    Relationships:
      - Output_Grid is derived from Input_Grid.
      - Each Cell (i, j) in Output_Grid depends on the Cell (i, j) in Input_Grid and its vertically reflected counterpart Cell (H-1-i, j) in Input_Grid.

    Actions:
      - For each cell position (i, j):
        - Identify the value in the Input_Grid at (i, j).
        - Identify the value in the Input_Grid at the vertically reflected position (H-1-i, j).
        - Compare the two identified values.
        - Select the maximum of the two values.
        - Assign the selected maximum value to the Output_Grid at position (i, j).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Define the input grid `I` with height `H` and width `W`.
    2.  Create an output grid `O` of the same dimensions `H` x `W`.
    3.  For each cell in the grid, identified by its row index `i` (from 0 to H-1) and column index `j` (from 0 to W-1):
        a.  Get the value `v1` from the input grid `I` at position `(i, j)`.
        b.  Calculate the row index `i_reflected` for the vertically reflected position as `H - 1 - i`.
        c.  Get the value `v2` from the input grid `I` at the reflected position `(i_reflected, j)`.
        d.  Determine the value for the output grid `O` at position `(i, j)` by taking the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.
        e.  Assign this maximum value to `O[i][j]`.
    4.  The final grid `O` is the result.
