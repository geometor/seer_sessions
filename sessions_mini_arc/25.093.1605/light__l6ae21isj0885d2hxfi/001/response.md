"""
Identify the 'kernel' cell in the input grid, defined as the cell containing a non-zero value that appears only once in the entire grid. Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized to zero. Determine the coordinates of all cells lying on the four diagonal lines passing through the kernel cell's position, extending to the grid boundaries. Place the kernel cell's value at these determined coordinates in the output grid.
