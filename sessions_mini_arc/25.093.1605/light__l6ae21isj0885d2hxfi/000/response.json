            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are represented as 5x5 grids containing single digits (0-9). The digit '0' appears to function as a background color/value.\n2.  **Core Transformation Element:** The transformation seems to hinge on identifying a specific, unique cell within the input grid. I'll call this the \"kernel\" cell.\n3.  **Kernel Identification:** The kernel cell seems to be characterized by its value (color). In grids containing distinct groups of non-zero colors, the kernel is the cell whose color forms a group of size one, distinct from larger adjacent groups of other colors.\n    *   In `train_1`, the '4' is unique compared to the connected '2's.\n    *   In `train_2`, the '5' is unique compared to the connected '3's.\n    *   In `train_3`, the '6' is unique compared to the connected '1's.\n    *   In `train_4`, the '2' is unique compared to the connected '7's.\n    The kernel has both a value (`kernel_value`) and a position (`kernel_r`, `kernel_c`).\n4.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is generated based on the identified kernel.\n    *   It has the same dimensions as the input (5x5).\n    *   It is initially filled with the background color '0'.\n    *   The `kernel_value` is then \"painted\" onto the output grid.\n    *   The *pattern* of the painted cells corresponds to all cells lying on the four diagonal lines extending outwards from the kernel's position (`kernel_r`, `kernel_c`) until they hit the grid boundaries. The kernel cell itself is included. All other cells remain '0'.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Identify the \"kernel\" cell: find the cell containing a non-zero value (`kernel_value`) that exists as a single instance, distinct from any surrounding connected components formed by other non-zero values.
