      - cells: list of cell objects
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [5, 5]
      - cells: list of cell objects
  - name: cell
    type: grid_element
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: [row, column]
  - name: kernel_cell
    type: cell
    properties:
      - identified_by: being the single instance of its non-zero value, distinct from any adjacent connected groups of other non-zero values.
      - value: kernel_value (integer)
      - position: kernel_position ([kernel_r, kernel_c])

relationships:
  - type: determination
    subject: kernel_cell
    object: input_grid
    details: The kernel_cell (value and position) is determined by analyzing the spatial arrangement and values of non-zero cells in the input_grid.
  - type: creation
    subject: output_grid
    object: kernel_cell
    details: The output_grid's non-zero pattern and value are derived from the kernel_cell's value and position.
  - type: pattern_formation
    subject: output_grid non-zero cells
    object: kernel_position
    details: The positions of non-zero cells in the output grid form diagonal lines radiating from the kernel_position within the grid boundaries.
  - type: value_propagation
    subject: output_grid non-zero cells
    object: kernel_value
    details: The value of all non-zero cells in the output grid is equal to the kernel_value.

actions:
  - name: identify_kernel
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [kernel_value, kernel_position]
    description: Scan the input grid to find the cell that represents the singular instance of its value, differentiated from surrounding connected non-zero structures. Extract its value and position.
  - name: generate_diagonal_pattern
    inputs: [kernel_position, grid_dimensions]
    outputs: [set_of_coordinates]
    description: Calculate the coordinates of all cells lying on the four diagonal paths starting from kernel_position and extending to the grid boundaries. Include the kernel_position itself.
  - name: create_output
    inputs: [grid_dimensions, kernel_value, set_of_coordinates]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a new grid of the specified dimensions, initialize with '0', and place the kernel_value at each coordinate in the set_of_coordinates.
