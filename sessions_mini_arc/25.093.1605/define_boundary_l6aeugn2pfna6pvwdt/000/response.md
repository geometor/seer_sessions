**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers. The input grids contain primarily the values 4 and 0. The output grids show modifications where some 4s are changed to 6s, while other cells remain unchanged. The transformation seems localized, depending on the value of a cell and its immediate neighbors. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. The value 0 appears to act as a boundary or inactive element, and the outermost cells of the grid also seem unchanged unless they are part of a larger internal structure.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - rows: number of rows
      - columns: number of columns
      - cells: individual elements within the grid

  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (observed values: 0, 4, 6)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: dictionary containing values of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - name: identify_target_cells
    input: input grid
    condition: cell value is 4
    output: list of coordinates for potential transformation

  - name: check_neighbors
    input: target cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: all four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) exist within the grid boundaries AND their value is 4
    output: boolean (true if condition met, false otherwise)

  - name: transform_cell
    input: cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: check_neighbors returns true for the cell
    action: change the value of the cell at the given coordinates from 4 to 6 in the output grid

  - name: copy_cell
    input: cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: the cell is not transformed (either not a 4 initially, or does not meet neighbor condition)
    action: copy the value of the cell from the input grid to the same coordinates in the output grid

relationships:
  - type: neighborhood
    description: A cell's transformation depends on the values of its immediate cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - type: boundary
    description: Cells on the grid edges or adjacent to a 0 might not meet the neighbor condition, preventing their transformation.

result:
  - object: output grid
    derivation: Constructed cell by cell based on the transformation or copying actions applied to the input grid.
    properties: same dimensions as the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid, excluding the border cells (row 0, last row, column 0, last column), as cells on the border cannot have four neighbors within the grid.
3.  For each interior cell at position (row, col):
    a.  Check if the value of the input cell `input[row][col]` is 4.
    b.  If it is 4, check the values of its four cardinal neighbors: `input[row-1][col]` (up), `input[row+1][col]` (down), `input[row][col-1]` (left), and `input[row][col+1]` (right).
    c.  If all four neighbors also have the value 4, set the corresponding cell in the output grid `output[row][col]` to 6.
    d.  If the cell value is not 4, or if any of its four neighbors do not have the value 4, copy the original value from `input[row][col]` to `output[row][col]`.
4.  Copy the values of all border cells from the input grid directly to the output grid.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
