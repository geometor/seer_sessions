The output grids show modifications where some 4s are changed to 6s, while other cells remain unchanged. The transformation seems localized, depending on the value of a cell and its immediate neighbors. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. The value 0 appears to act as a boundary or inactive element, and the outermost cells of the grid also seem unchanged unless they are part of a larger internal structure.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
