task_elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - rows: number of rows
      - columns: number of columns
      - cells: individual elements within the grid

  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (observed values: 0, 4, 6)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: dictionary containing values of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - name: identify_target_cells
    input: input grid
    condition: cell value is 4
    output: list of coordinates for potential transformation

  - name: check_neighbors
    input: target cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: all four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) exist within the grid boundaries AND their value is 4
    output: boolean (true if condition met, false otherwise)

  - name: transform_cell
    input: cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: check_neighbors returns true for the cell
    action: change the value of the cell at the given coordinates from 4 to 6 in the output grid

  - name: copy_cell
    input: cell coordinates, input grid
    condition: the cell is not transformed (either not a 4 initially, or does not meet neighbor condition)
    action: copy the value of the cell from the input grid to the same coordinates in the output grid

relationships:
  - type: neighborhood
    description: A cell's transformation depends on the values of its immediate cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
  - type: boundary
    description: Cells on the grid edges or adjacent to a 0 might not meet the neighbor condition, preventing their transformation.

result:
  - object: output grid
    derivation: Constructed cell by cell based on the transformation or copying actions applied to the input grid.
    properties: same dimensions as the input grid.
