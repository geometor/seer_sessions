            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers. The input grids contain a cluster of non-zero digits surrounded by zeros. The output grids also contain a cluster of non-zero digits (seemingly the same digits as the input cluster, but rearranged) surrounded by zeros. The core operation appears to involve identifying the non-zero cluster, transforming it (rearranging its elements), and relocating it within the grid.\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The primary \"object\" is the rectangular subgrid containing all the non-zero numbers in the input.\n2.  **Transformation:** The arrangement of numbers within this object changes between the input and output. Observing the examples, the transformation looks like a matrix transpose (swapping rows and columns).\n3.  **Relocation:** The position of the top-left corner of the object changes. In all examples, the top-left corner of the transformed object in the output is shifted one position down and one position to the right relative to the top-left corner of the original object in the input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) that contain non-zero values. These define the bounding box of the non-zero cluster.\n3.  If no non-zero values are found in the input grid, return the zero-filled output grid.\n4.  Extract the rectangular subgrid (the non-zero cluster) from the input grid using the determined bounding box coordinates (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`).\n5.  Perform a matrix transposition on the extracted subgrid. The element originally at relative position `(i, j)` within the subgrid moves to relative position `(j, i)` in the transposed subgrid.\n6.  Calculate the target top-left coordinates for placing the transposed subgrid in the output grid by adding 1 to the original minimum row index (`min_r + 1`) and adding 1 to the original minimum column index (`min_c + 1`).\n7.  Place the transposed subgrid into the output grid, starting at these newly calculated target coordinates.\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
