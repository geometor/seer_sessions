task_elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: 5x5 (based on examples)
  - object: NonZeroCluster
    properties:
      - type: subgrid within the main Grid
      - elements: non-zero integers
      - shape: rectangular (defined by bounding box)
      - location: top-left corner coordinates (row, col)
      - content: specific arrangement of non-zero integers
actions:
  - action: IdentifyBoundingBox
    input: Input Grid
    output: Coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) of the NonZeroCluster
    description: Find the smallest rectangle enclosing all non-zero elements.
  - action: ExtractCluster
    input: Input Grid, BoundingBox Coordinates
    output: Subgrid representing the NonZeroCluster
    description: Create a new grid containing only the elements within the bounding box.
  - action: TransposeCluster
    input: Extracted Subgrid (NonZeroCluster)
    output: Transposed Subgrid
    description: Swap rows and columns of the subgrid. The element at (i, j) moves to (j, i).
  - action: CalculateNewLocation
    input: Original BoundingBox Coordinates (min_row, min_col)
    output: New Top-Left Coordinates (new_row, new_col)
    description: Calculate the target location for the transposed cluster in the output grid. new_row = min_row + 1, new_col = min_col + 1.
  - action: PlaceTransposedCluster
    input: Output Grid (initially zeros), Transposed Subgrid, New Top-Left Coordinates
    output: Modified Output Grid
    description: Copy the elements of the transposed subgrid into the output grid starting at the calculated new location.
relationships:
  - relation: Output Cluster Content
    subject: NonZeroCluster in Output Grid
    object: NonZeroCluster in Input Grid
    description: The content of the output cluster is the matrix transpose of the input cluster.
  - relation: Output Cluster Position
    subject: Top-Left corner of NonZeroCluster in Output Grid
    object: Top-Left corner of NonZeroCluster in Input Grid
    description: The output cluster's top-left corner is located one row below and one column to the right of the input cluster's top-left corner.
