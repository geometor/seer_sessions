*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a 5x5 grid containing numerical values. 0 represents the background color.
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two distinct connected components (objects) made of non-zero values.
    *   The two objects are always vertically separated by at least one row of zeros. One object is positioned higher ("upper object") in the grid than the other ("lower object").
    *   The output grid is also a 5x5 grid.
    *   The transformation retains the upper object completely in its original position and color.
    *   The lower object from the input is entirely removed in the output.
    *   A single pixel is added to the output grid. This pixel has the color of the upper object. Its position is determined as follows:
        *   Its row index is the same as the topmost row index of the *original* lower object in the input grid.
        *   Its column index is the same as the column index of the top-most, left-most pixel of the *upper* object in the input grid.
    *   All other cells in the output grid, specifically those below the upper object and not part of the single added pixel, are set to 0 (background).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a 5x5 grid filled with zeros.
    2.  Identify all connected components of non-zero cells in the input grid. Assume there are exactly two such components (objects).
    3.  Determine the "upper object" as the one whose highest pixel (minimum row index) is smaller than the other object's highest pixel. Determine the "lower object" correspondingly.
    4.  Find the set of coordinates `{(r, c)}` for all pixels belonging to the upper object.
    5.  Find the color (`upper_color`) of the upper object.
    6.  Find the anchor point (`upper_anchor_row`, `upper_anchor_col`) of the upper object, defined as the pixel within the upper object with the minimum row index, breaking ties by choosing the minimum column index.
    7.  Find the topmost row index (`lower_topmost_row`) of the lower object.
    8.  For each coordinate `(r, c)` belonging to the upper object, set the cell `output[r][c]` to `upper_color`.
    9.  Set the cell `output[lower_topmost_row][upper_anchor_col]` to `upper_color`.
