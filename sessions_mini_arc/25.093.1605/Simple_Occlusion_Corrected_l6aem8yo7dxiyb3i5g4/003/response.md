"""
Identifies two distinct non-zero objects in the input grid based on their color. 
Retains the object with the numerically higher color value in its original position and color in the output grid, discarding the other object.
Adds a single pixel to the output grid:
- Its color matches the retained object's color.
- Its row index is the same as the topmost row index of the discarded object.
- Its column index is the same as the column index of the retained object's anchor point 
  (top-most, left-most pixel).
All other cells in the output grid are set to the background color (0).

    Finds connected components of non-zero cells in the grid, treating
