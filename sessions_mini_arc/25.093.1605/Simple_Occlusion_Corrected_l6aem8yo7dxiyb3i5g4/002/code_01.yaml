task_description: Identify two distinct non-zero objects in the grid. Retain the object with the numerically higher color value, discarding the other. Add a single pixel whose color matches the retained object, positioned at the topmost row of the discarded object and the anchor column (top-most, left-most pixel's column) of the retained object.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - size: 5x5 (based on examples, may vary)
      - background_color: 0
  - element: object
    description: A connected component of non-zero cells, assumed to have a uniform color.
    properties:
      - color: The non-zero integer value of the cells.
      - pixels: Set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to the object.
      - topmost_row: The minimum row index among the object's pixels.
      - anchor_point: The pixel (row, col) with the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.
      - anchor_col: The column index of the anchor_point.

actions:
  - action: find_distinct_objects
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [object_A, object_B]
    description: Find the two distinct connected components of non-zero cells, treating each different color value as potentially starting a new object. Return properties for each. Assumes exactly two such objects exist.
  - action: determine_retained_discarded
    inputs: [object_A, object_B]
    outputs: [retained_object, discarded_object]
    description: Compare the 'color' property of object_A and object_B. The object with the higher numerical color value is 'retained_object', the other is 'discarded_object'.
  - action: create_output_grid
    inputs: [grid_size, background_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Initialize an empty grid of the correct size filled with the background color.
  - action: copy_object_pixels
    inputs: [object_to_copy, target_grid]
    outputs: [modified_target_grid]
    description: Place the pixels of the object_to_copy onto the target_grid using the object's color.
  - action: place_derived_pixel
    inputs: [retained_object_color, retained_object_anchor_col, discarded_object_topmost_row, target_grid]
    outputs: [modified_target_grid]
    description: Set the pixel at (discarded_object_topmost_row, retained_object_anchor_col) in the target_grid to the retained_object_color.

transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify the two distinct non-zero objects (Object A, Object B) in the input grid and determine their properties (pixels, color, topmost_row, anchor_point).
  - step: Compare the colors of Object A and Object B. Designate the object with the higher color value as the 'retained_object' and the other as the 'discarded_object'.
  - step: Extract the color (`retained_color`), pixels (`retained_pixels`), and anchor column (`retained_anchor_col`) from the 'retained_object'.
  - step: Extract the topmost row index (`discarded_topmost_row`) from the 'discarded_object'.
  - step: Initialize the output grid with the background color (0).
  - step: Copy the `retained_pixels` to the output grid, setting their color to `retained_color`.
  - step: Place a single pixel in the output grid at position (`discarded_topmost_row`, `retained_anchor_col`) with the color `retained_color`.
