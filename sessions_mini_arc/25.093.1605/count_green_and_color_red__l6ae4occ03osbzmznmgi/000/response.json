            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a grid of numbers as input and produces a grid of numbers of the same dimensions as output.\n2.  **Grid Size:** All examples use 5x5 grids.\n3.  **Input Values:** The input grids contain only the numbers 0 and 3. The number 3 appears to mark specific cells of interest.\n4.  **Output Values:** The output grids contain only the numbers 0 and 2. The number 2 appears in the output grid, replacing some initial 0s.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The spatial arrangement of the 3s in the input does not seem to directly map to the spatial arrangement of the 2s in the output. However, the *quantity* of 3s in the input appears directly related to the *quantity* of 2s in the output. The 2s in the output always start filling the grid from the top-left cell (0,0) and proceed in standard reading order (left-to-right, then top-to-bottom).\n6.  **Key Observation:** By counting the number of 3s in each input grid and comparing it to the number of 2s in the corresponding output grid, a consistent pattern emerges: the total count of 3s in the input equals the total count of 2s in the output.\n\n    *   Example 1: Input has 9 threes. Output has 9 twos.\n    *   Example 2: Input has 5 threes. Output has 5 twos.\n    *   Example 3: Input has 12 threes. Output has 12 twos.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
