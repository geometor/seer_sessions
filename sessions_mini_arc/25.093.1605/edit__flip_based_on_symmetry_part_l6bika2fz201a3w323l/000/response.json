Other non-zero digits represent foreground colors, forming shapes or patterns within the grid.\n\nComparing each input grid to its corresponding output grid reveals that the transformation involves moving a single foreground-colored cell within its row. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. The cell that moves is always one that is \"horizontally isolated,\" meaning its left and right neighbors within the same row are both background cells (0) or grid boundaries. The destination column for the moved cell appears determined by reflecting its original column position across the center of the horizontal span (minimum to maximum column index) occupied by *all* non-zero cells in the entire input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new grid identical to the input grid.\n    b. Change the value of the cell at the original position `(r_move, c_move)` in the new grid to 0.\n    c.
