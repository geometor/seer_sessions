The output grids contain only 0 and 5.\n3.  **Key Transformation Value:** The number 6 in the input seems crucial. It always disappears in the output, but its position influences the final state of other cells. Specifically, input 6s seem to become 5s in the output.\n4.  **Value Preservation/Change:**\n    *   Input 0s always remain 0s in the output.\n    *   Input 6s always become 5s in the output.\n    *   Input 5s sometimes remain 5s and sometimes become 0s in the output.\n5.  **Pattern of Preservation for 5s:** Observing the examples, an input 5 seems to remain a 5 in the output *only if* it shares either the same row or the same column as an input 6. If an input 5 does not share a row or column with any input 6, it becomes 0 in the output. If there are multiple 6s, a 5 needs to align with only one of them to be preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
