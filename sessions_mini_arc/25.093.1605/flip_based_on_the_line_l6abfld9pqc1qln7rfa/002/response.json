            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial transformation rule, derived primarily from `train_1`, partially captured the logic but failed on other examples. Specifically, it correctly identified the horizontal reflection case for `train_1` but misclassified `train_4` (which should undergo pixel removal) and incorrectly handled cases where the pattern doesn't touch the bottom edge (`train_2`, `train_3`). The errors in `train_2` and `train_3` indicated a different transformation (vertical reflection within the bounding box followed by a downward shift) was needed when the pattern doesn't touch the bottom. The error in `train_4` revealed that the condition for horizontal reflection needed refinement to distinguish it from the pixel removal case when the pattern *does* touch the bottom edge.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program by:\n1.  Defining two main cases based on whether the pattern's bounding box touches the bottom edge of the grid.\n2.  For the case where the bottom edge is *not* touched, describe the transformation as a vertical reflection of the pattern within its bounding box, followed by shifting the entire grid content down by one row.\n3.  For the case where the bottom edge *is* touched, define two sub-cases:\n    *   Horizontal Reflection: Refine the condition based on the pattern also touching the top and left edges, and its rightmost extent being within the left half (including the center column) of the grid.\n    *   Pixel Removal: Apply this rule otherwise (when the bottom is touched but the reflection condition is not met). Describe the pixel removal process based on the row with the most non-zero elements and the rightmost non-zero element within that row.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered for each training input using `code_execution`:\n\n"

If there are no non-zero cells, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.

Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with zeros.\n    b.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the pattern's bounding box from the input grid (rows `min_r` to `max_r`, columns `min_c` to `max_c`).\n    c.  Perform a vertical reflection (flip rows top-to-bottom) on the extracted subgrid.\n    d.  Place this vertically reflected subgrid into the new grid, positioning its top-left corner at row `min_r + 1` and column `min_c`.\n    e.

Pattern touches the left edge (`min_c == 0`).\n        iii.The pattern's rightmost extent is within the left half or the center column of the grid (`max_c <= floor((W - 1) / 2)`).\n    b.  **Subcase 2a: If ALL conditions in 5a are met (Horizontal Reflection):**\n        i.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions, initialized with zeros.\n        ii.
