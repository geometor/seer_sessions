- grid:
    type: object
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixels.
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      pixels: individual cell values, 0 usually represents background.
- pattern:
    type: object
    description: The collection of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      non_zero_cells: list of coordinates (r, c) and values (v)
      bounding_box: defined by min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c
      touches_top: min_r == 0
      touches_bottom: max_r == H - 1
      touches_left: min_c == 0
      touches_right: max_c == W - 1
      max_c_in_left_half: max_c <= floor((W - 1) / 2)
- transformation:
    type: action
    description: Modifies the input grid based on the pattern's properties.
    conditions:
      - condition: if pattern.touches_bottom is False
        action: vertical_reflection_and_shift
      - condition: if pattern.touches_bottom is True AND pattern.touches_top is True AND pattern.touches_left is True AND pattern.max_c_in_left_half is True
        action: horizontal_reflection
      - condition: if pattern.touches_bottom is True AND the horizontal_reflection condition is False
        action: pixel_removal
- vertical_reflection_and_shift:
    type: action
    description: Vertically flips the pattern within its bounding box, then shifts the entire grid down by one row.
    operands:
      - input_grid
      - pattern.bounding_box
    result: output_grid
- horizontal_reflection:
    type: action
    description: Reflects the entire input grid horizontally across its vertical center line.
    operands:
      - input_grid
    result: output_grid
- pixel_removal:
    type: action
    description: Removes the rightmost non-zero pixel from the row containing the most non-zero pixels (using the lowest row index in case of a tie).
    operands:
      - input_grid
    result: output_grid (copy of input_grid with one pixel set to 0)
