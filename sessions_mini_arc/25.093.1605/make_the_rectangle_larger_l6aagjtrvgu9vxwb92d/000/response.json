            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (5x5 in the examples) containing single-digit integers. The digit '0' represents the background.\n2.  **Input Object:** Each input grid contains a single connected component (object) made of a non-zero digit (e.g., 8, 6, 4). These objects vary in shape and size (a block with a hole, a single pixel, a solid rectangle).\n3.  **Output Object:** The output grid also contains a single object derived from the input object.\n4.  **Color Preservation:** The non-zero digit (color) of the object remains the same from input to output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves expanding the bounding box of the input object and potentially creating a hole within the expanded object.\n6.  **Bounding Box Expansion:** The bounding box of the non-zero object in the input seems to determine the structure of the output. The output object occupies a bounding box that is one unit larger in height and width than the input object's bounding box, specifically by expanding one unit up and one unit to the left from the input's top-left corner while keeping the bottom-right corner the same.\n7.  **Hole Creation:** If the input object's bounding box has both height and width greater than 1, a hole is created in the output object. This hole seems to occupy the region corresponding to the input object's bounding box, excluding its last row and last column. If the input object is only 1 pixel high or 1 pixel wide, no hole is created.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation\n\n"

Determine the color `C` of this group.\n3.  Find the bounding box of the group: the minimum row `r1`, maximum row `r2`, minimum column `c1`, and maximum column `c2`.\n4.  Calculate the height `H = r2 - r1 + 1` and width `W = c2 - c1 + 1`.\n5.  Create a new output grid of the same size as the input, initialized with zeros.\n6.  Define the coordinates for the main body of the output shape: rows from `r1 - 1` to `r2`, and columns from `c1 - 1` to `c2`. Ensure coordinates stay within the grid boundaries (e.g., row and column indices cannot be less than 0).\n7.  Fill the cells within these output coordinates in the new grid with the color `C`.\n8.  Check if the input object's dimensions satisfy `H > 1` and `W > 1`.\n9.
