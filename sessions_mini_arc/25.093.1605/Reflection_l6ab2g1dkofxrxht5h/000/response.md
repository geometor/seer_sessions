**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 5x5 input grid of numbers into a 5x5 output grid. The input grids contain patterns formed by non-zero numbers, typically located near the top of the grid. The output grid is initially empty (all zeros), and the pattern from the input grid is transferred to the output grid. The transformation rule appears to be a vertical reflection or flip of the input grid content across the horizontal midline. The content of input row `i` moves to output row `N-1-i`, where `N` is the height of the grid (5 in these examples).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - dimensions: 5x5 (constant across examples)
  - background_value: 0

Objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: Configuration of non-zero cells in the input grid.
    location: Variable, but tends to be near the top in the input examples.

Action:
  - name: vertical_reflection
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
    description: Reflects the entire input grid vertically across its horizontal center line.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is the result of applying the vertical_reflection action to the input grid.
  - Specifically, the value at input[row][col] becomes the value at output[grid_height - 1 - row][col].
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.
3.  Copy the value from the input cell `input[row][col]` to the output cell `output[grid_height - 1 - row][col]`, where `grid_height` is the number of rows in the grid (5).
4.  Return the resulting output grid.
