The input grids contain patterns formed by non-zero numbers, typically located near the top of the grid. The output grid is initially empty (all zeros), and the pattern from the input grid is transferred to the output grid. The transformation rule appears to be a vertical reflection or flip of the input grid content across the horizontal midline. The content of input row `i` moves to output row `N-1-i`, where `N` is the height of the grid (5 in these examples).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
