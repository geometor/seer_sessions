Grid_Properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - dimensions: 5x5 (constant across examples)
  - background_value: 0

Objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: Configuration of non-zero cells in the input grid.
    location: Variable, but tends to be near the top in the input examples.

Action:
  - name: vertical_reflection
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
    description: Reflects the entire input grid vertically across its horizontal center line.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is the result of applying the vertical_reflection action to the input grid.
  - Specifically, the value at input[row][col] becomes the value at output[grid_height - 1 - row][col].
