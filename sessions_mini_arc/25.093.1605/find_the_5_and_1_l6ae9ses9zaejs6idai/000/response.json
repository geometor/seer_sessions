The digits 0, 1, 2, and 5 are present in the output.\n3.  **Transformation Locus:** The change between input and output appears localized to a single column in each example.\n4.  **Trigger Condition:** The transformation targets a column that consists *entirely* of the digit 5 in the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Within the targeted column:\n    *   All 5s are changed to 1s.\n    *   The 5 in the bottom-most cell (last row) of that column is changed to 2 instead of 1.\n6.  **Unchanged Elements:** All cells containing 0, and any 5s located outside the identified all-5 column, remain unchanged from input to output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
