Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are structured as 5x5 grids of numerical digits.
2.  **Key Digits:** The digits 0 and 5 are present in the input. The digits 0, 1, 2, and 5 are present in the output.
3.  **Transformation Locus:** The change between input and output appears localized to a single column in each example.
4.  **Trigger Condition:** The transformation targets a column that consists *entirely* of the digit 5 in the input grid.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Within the targeted column:
    *   All 5s are changed to 1s.
    *   The 5 in the bottom-most cell (last row) of that column is changed to 2 instead of 1.
6.  **Unchanged Elements:** All cells containing 0, and any 5s located outside the identified all-5 column, remain unchanged from input to output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  size: 5x5
  cell_values:
    input: [0, 5]
    output: [0, 1, 2, 5]
transformation:
  scope: column-based
  condition:
    target_object: column
    property: all_cells_are_5
  actions:
    - target_element: cell_value
      input_value: 5
      condition: located_in_target_column AND NOT is_last_row
      output_value: 1
    - target_element: cell_value
      input_value: 5
      condition: located_in_target_column AND is_last_row
      output_value: 2
    - target_element: cell_value
      condition: not_in_target_column OR input_value_is_0
      output_value: same_as_input
relationships:
  - The output grid values depend on the input grid values and their column-wise arrangement.
  - A specific column pattern (all 5s) triggers a specific modification rule within that column.
  - Positional information (being in the last row) influences the specific output value within the target column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
3.  For the current column, check if all its cells contain the value 5.
4.  If a column consisting entirely of 5s is found:
    a.  Iterate through the rows of this specific column in the output grid.
    b.  For each cell in this column, change its value to 1.
    c.  After iterating through the rows, specifically change the value of the cell in the last row (bottom cell) of this column to 2.
    d.  Stop searching for other columns (assuming only one such column exists per input, based on examples).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
