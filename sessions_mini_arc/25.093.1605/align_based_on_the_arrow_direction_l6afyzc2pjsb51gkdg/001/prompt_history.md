*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task involves transforming a square numerical grid (matrix) into another grid of the same size.
    *   The transformation seems to operate by selecting values from one of the two main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left) of the input grid and placing them in the corresponding positions in the output grid.
    *   All non-selected positions in the output grid are set to zero.
    *   A key feature is that *one* element from the selected diagonal in the input is *excluded* (set to zero) in the output.
    *   The choice of which diagonal to use (main or anti-diagonal) appears to depend on the relative sum of the elements along each diagonal.
    *   The choice of which element on the selected diagonal to exclude seems to depend on symmetry properties of the input grid and potentially the value of a specific cell like `input[1][0]`.
