            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 5x5 in all examples.\n2.  **Values:** The grids contain integers. Input grids use 0, 2, and 5. Output grids use 0, 1, 2, and 5.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to primarily involve changing some '0' cells in the input to '1' in the output. The positions and values of the original non-zero numbers (2 and 5) are preserved in the output grid.\n4.  **Rule Dependency:** The placement of '1's depends on the neighboring cells in the *input* grid. Specifically, it seems related to the number and values (2 or 5) of the non-zero neighbors of a '0' cell.\n5.  **Value-Specific Behavior:** The rules for placing a '1' seem to differ depending on whether the neighbors are '2' or '5'.\n    *   Having a single neighbor '2' seems to trigger placing a '1'. (See train\\_2)\n    *   Being positioned directly between two '5's (horizontally or vertically) seems to trigger placing a '1'. (See train\\_1)\n    *   Having one neighbor '2' and one neighbor '5' also seems to trigger placing a '1'. (See train\\_3, train\\_4, train\\_5)\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
