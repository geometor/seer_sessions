"""
Transforms a 5x5 input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify all non-zero digits in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero digit `d` at input position `(r_in, c_in)`:
   a. Calculate a segment length `L = 5 - 2 * abs(r_in - 2)`.
   b. Determine the diagonal index `D = (c_in - r_in) mod 5`.
   c. Determine the vertical range of the segment: `L` rows centered around `r_in`.
   d. Generate the coordinates `(r_out, c_out)` for the segment: 
      For each `r_out` in the vertical range, `c_out = (D + r_out) mod 5`.
3. Initialize a 5x5 output grid with zeros.
4. For each generated segment coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` associated with digit `d`, 
   update the corresponding output cell's value to be the maximum of its current 
   value and `d`.
5. Return the final output grid.
