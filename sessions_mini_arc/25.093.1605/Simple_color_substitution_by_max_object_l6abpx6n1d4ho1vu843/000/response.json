'0' seems to act as a background color. Non-zero integers form patterns or shapes.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves swapping two specific non-zero colors throughout the grid, while leaving all other colors (including the background '0') unchanged.\n*   **Color Selection:** The key challenge is determining *which* two colors to swap based on the input grid's properties. Analyzing the examples reveals a pattern:\n    *   In Example 1, colors 8 and 4 are swapped. Color 4 appears once, color 8 is the most frequent non-zero color (5 times).\n    *   In Example 2, colors 6 and 7 are swapped. Color 7 appears once, color 6 is the most frequent non-zero color (5 times).\n    *   In Example 3, colors 8 and 9 are swapped. Color 8 appears once, color 9 is the most frequent non-zero color (5 times).\n*   **Rule:** The transformation identifies the unique color that appears exactly once (excluding 0) and the most frequent non-zero color. These two colors are then swapped everywhere in the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
