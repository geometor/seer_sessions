task_description: Swap two specific colors in a grid based on frequency counts.
grid_properties:
  type: 2D array of integers
  element_range: 0-9 (observed)
  background_color: 0
objects:
  - object: color_cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - frequency: count of occurrences in the grid
relationships:
  - relationship: color_frequency
    description: The number of times each non-zero color appears in the input grid.
  - relationship: unique_color
    description: The non-zero color that appears exactly once in the input grid.
    property: frequency == 1
  - relationship: most_frequent_color
    description: The non-zero color that appears most often in the input grid.
    property: maximum frequency among non-zero colors
actions:
  - action: identify_swap_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: [color_1, color_2]
    steps:
      - Calculate frequency of each non-zero color.
      - Find color_1 where frequency is 1.
      - Find color_2 with the maximum frequency (must be non-zero).
  - action: perform_swap
    inputs: [input_grid, color_1, color_2]
    outputs: output_grid
    steps:
      - Iterate through each cell of the input_grid.
      - If cell value == color_1, set output cell value to color_2.
      - Else if cell value == color_2, set output cell value to color_1.
      - Else, set output cell value to the input cell value.
transformation_goal: Create an output grid where color_1 and color_2 from the input grid have been swapped, and all other colors remain the same.
