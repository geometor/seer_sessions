Each task involves modifying the input grid based on the spatial arrangement of numbers.\nThe key elements appear to be:\n1.  A dominant non-zero number (e.g., 4 in train_1, 1 in train_2, 6 in train_3) that forms a connected region, often acting like a boundary or background.\n2.  A region of zeros ('hole') enclosed or partially enclosed by the dominant number's region.\n3.  A single cell with a different non-zero value (e.g., 3 in train_1, 5 in train_2, 5 in train_3) located adjacent to the dominant number's region.\n\nThe transformation seems to involve:\n1.  Identifying the 'hole' region of zeros.\n2.  Identifying the unique, adjacent, different non-zero value ('source value') and its location.\n3.  Identifying the value of the dominant region ('background value').\n4.  Filling the 'hole' region with the 'source value'.\n5.  Changing the original location of the 'source value' to the 'background value'.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

This `X` defines the `BackgroundRegion`.\n3.  **Identify Hole Region (H):** Find all connected zero-valued cells `H` such that every cell in `H` is orthogonally adjacent only to cells with value `X` or other cells within `H`.\n4.  **Identify Source Cell (Y):** Scan the `InputGrid` to find the unique cell `(r_y, c_y)` containing a non-zero value `Y` such that `Y` is not equal to `X`, and the cell `(r_y, c_y)` is orthogonally adjacent to at least one cell belonging to the `BackgroundRegion` (i.e., a cell with value `X` identified in step 2).\n5.  **Fill Hole:** Iterate through all cells `(r_h, c_h)` identified as part of the `HoleRegion` `H` in step 3. Set the value of `OutputGrid[r_h][c_h]` to `Y`.\n6.  **Update Source Location:** Set the value of the `OutputGrid` at the original location of the source cell: `OutputGrid[r_y][c_y] = X`.\n7.  **Finalize:** The `OutputGrid` now holds the final transformed state."
