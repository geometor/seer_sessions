objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D Array of Integers
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: 2D Array of Integers
  - name: BackgroundRegion
    description: The largest connected component of a single non-zero integer (X) that encloses or borders a region of zeros.
    properties:
      - value: X (integer)
      - cells: List of coordinates (row, col)
      - connectivity: Orthogonal
  - name: HoleRegion
    description: A connected component of zeros (0) where all adjacent non-zero cells belong to the BackgroundRegion.
    properties:
      - value: 0 (integer)
      - cells: List of coordinates (row, col)
      - connectivity: Orthogonal
      - relationship: Enclosed or bordered by BackgroundRegion
  - name: SourceCell
    description: A single cell containing a non-zero integer (Y) different from the BackgroundRegion's value (X), which is orthogonally adjacent to the BackgroundRegion.
    properties:
      - value: Y (integer, Y != 0, Y != X)
      - location: Coordinate (row, col)
      - relationship: Adjacent to BackgroundRegion

actions:
  - name: IdentifyRegions
    description: Analyze the InputGrid to find the BackgroundRegion, HoleRegion, and SourceCell based on their definitions and relationships.
  - name: FillHole
    description: Modify a copy of the InputGrid by setting the value of all cells within the HoleRegion to the value (Y) of the SourceCell.
  - name: UpdateSource
    description: In the modified grid, set the value of the cell at the SourceCell's original location to the value (X) of the BackgroundRegion.
  - name: GenerateOutput
    description: The final modified grid after FillHole and UpdateSource is the OutputGrid.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [SourceCell, BackgroundRegion]
    details: The SourceCell shares an orthogonal edge with at least one cell in the BackgroundRegion.
  - type: Enclosure/Bordering
    between: [HoleRegion, BackgroundRegion]
    details: All non-zero neighbors of any cell in the HoleRegion must belong to the BackgroundRegion.

constraints:
  - There is exactly one unique SourceCell value (Y) adjacent to the BackgroundRegion (X).
  - The HoleRegion is defined by zeros directly bordered by the BackgroundRegion (X).
