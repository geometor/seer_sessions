"""
Transforms the input grid based on identifying background, source, and hole regions.

The transformation identifies a 'background' value (X), a 'source' value (Y), 
and a 'hole' region (H) of zeros. The hole region is defined as a connected 
component of zeros where all adjacent non-zero cells have the background value X.
The source value Y is typically a unique, non-zero value different from X, located 
at cell (r_y, c_y). The transformation fills the hole region H with the source 
value Y and changes the value at the original source cell location (r_y, c_y) 
to the background value X.

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the `InputGrid` to serve as the `OutputGrid`.
2.  **Identify Background (X) and Source (Y) Values:** Determine the most frequent 
    non-zero value (X) and the least frequent non-zero value (Y).
3.  **Identify Source Cell Location:** Find the coordinates (r_y, c_y) of the cell 
    containing the source value Y.
4.  **Identify Hole Region (H):** Find the connected component of zero-valued cells (H) 
    such that every non-zero orthogonal neighbor of any cell in H has the value X.
5.  **Fill Hole:** Update the `OutputGrid` by setting the value of all cells within 
    the identified Hole Region H to the source value Y.
6.  **Update Source Location:** Set the value of the `OutputGrid` at the original 
    location of the source cell (r_y, c_y) to the background value X.
7.  **Finalize:** Return the modified `OutputGrid`.
