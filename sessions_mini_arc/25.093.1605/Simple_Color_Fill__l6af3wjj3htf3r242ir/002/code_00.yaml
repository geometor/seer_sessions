    type: 2D Array of Integers
  - name: SourceCell
    description: >
      A unique cell containing a non-zero integer (Y) which is the least frequent
      non-zero value in the grid and is orthogonally adjacent to at least one cell
      containing a *different* non-zero integer (X).
    properties:
      - value: Y (integer, Y != 0)
      - location: Coordinate (row_y, col_y)
      - relationship: Is adjacent to at least one BackgroundCell
      - property: Least frequent non-zero value
  - name: BackgroundValue
    description: >
      The non-zero integer value (X) found in cells orthogonally adjacent to the
      SourceCell (Y). X != Y. X is typically the most frequent non-zero value.
    properties:
      - value: X (integer, X != 0, X != Y)
      - property: Adjacent to SourceCell
      - property: Usually most frequent non-zero value
  - name: InternalHoleRegion
    description: >
      A connected component of zero (0) valued cells where all orthogonally adjacent
      non-zero cells have the BackgroundValue (X), AND no cell within this component
      is located on the boundary of the grid (row 0, col 0, max_row, max_col).
    properties:
      - value: 0 (integer)
      - cells: List of coordinates (row_h, col_h)
      - connectivity: Orthogonal
      - relationship: All non-zero neighbors have BackgroundValue (X)
      - constraint: Does not touch grid boundary

actions:
  - name: IdentifySourceAndBackground
    description: >
      Scan the InputGrid to find the unique SourceCell (Y at (row_y, col_y)) based
      on its properties (least frequent non-zero, adjacent to a different non-zero).
      Identify the BackgroundValue (X) from the neighbors of the SourceCell.
  - name: IdentifyInternalHole
    description: >
      Find all connected components of zero-valued cells in the InputGrid.
      Filter these components to keep only those where all non-zero neighbors have
      the BackgroundValue (X). From the filtered set, select the single component
      where none of its cells lie on the grid boundary. This is the InternalHoleRegion (H).
  - name: FillHole
    description: >
      Modify a copy of the InputGrid (OutputGrid) by setting the value of all
      cells within the identified InternalHoleRegion (H) to the value (Y) of the SourceCell.
  - name: UpdateSourceLocation
    description: >
      In the OutputGrid, set the value of the cell at the SourceCell's original
      location (row_y, col_y) to the BackgroundValue (X).
  - name: GenerateOutput
    description: The final modified OutputGrid after FillHole and UpdateSourceLocation.

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    between: [SourceCell, Cell with BackgroundValue]
    details: The SourceCell shares an orthogonal edge with at least one cell having the BackgroundValue (X).
  - type: Bordering
    between: [InternalHoleRegion, Cells with BackgroundValue]
    details: All non-zero orthogonal neighbors of any cell in the InternalHoleRegion must have the BackgroundValue (X).
  - type: Spatial Constraint
    on: InternalHoleRegion
    details: No cell within the InternalHoleRegion can have a row or column index equal to 0 or the maximum row/column index of the grid.

constraints:
  - There is exactly one SourceCell value (Y).
  - The SourceCell (Y) is adjacent to cells with exactly one other non-zero value (X).
  - There is exactly one InternalHoleRegion satisfying the definition.
