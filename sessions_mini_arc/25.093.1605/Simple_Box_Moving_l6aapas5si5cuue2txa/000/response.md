Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (5x5 in the examples) containing non-negative integers.
2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific "action" cell based on its value and its relationship with an adjacent "target" cell. The value from the action cell is then propagated (copied) into other cells based on the properties of the action and target cells.
3.  **Identifying Action/Target Cells:**
    *   An "action" cell appears to be a cell with a value `V` that is greater than the value `T` of an adjacent non-zero cell. In the examples, the action cell seems to be the one with the highest value that satisfies this condition (3 in Ex1, 4 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3).
    *   A "target" cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the action cell, has a non-zero value `T`, and `T < V`. The specific target cell involved seems to determine the direction of propagation.
4.  **Propagation Mechanism:**
    *   The value `V` of the action cell is propagated in a line away from the action cell, starting near the target cell.
    *   The propagation rule depends on the value `T` of the target cell:
        *   If `T == 1` (Example 1), `V` cells are filled with the value `V`, starting *after* the target cell in the propagation direction.
        *   If `T != 1` (Examples 2 and 3, where T=2 and T=6 respectively), cells are filled with the value `V` starting *adjacent* to the target cell in the propagation direction, continuing until the grid boundary is reached.
5.  **Grid Updates:**
    *   The action cell's value is set to 0 in the output.
    *   The target cell retains its original value `T`.
    *   Other cells are either unchanged or overwritten by the propagation.
6.  **Uniqueness:** The examples suggest that only one action/target pair triggers the propagation in each grid transformation.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Propagate Value from Action Cell based on Adjacent Target Cell

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, defined by row, column, and value.

Properties:
  - Cell:
    - row: Integer index.
    - column: Integer index.
    - value: Non-negative integer.
  - Adjacency: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right).

Relationships:
  - Action-Target Pair:
    - action_cell: Cell(r, c) with value V.
    - target_cell: Cell(tr, tc) adjacent to action_cell with value T.
    - condition: V > T and T > 0.
    - trigger: In the examples, the pair involving the highest value V seems to be the trigger.

Actions:
  - Find Trigger Pair: Identify the unique action_cell (r, c) with value V and adjacent target_cell (tr, tc) with value T (V > T > 0) that initiates the transformation. (Assumption: The action cell is the one with the maximum value meeting the criteria).
  - Determine Direction: Calculate the direction of propagation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on the relative positions of the action and target cells (direction points away from action_cell, starting from target_cell).
  - Propagate Value:
    - If target_cell.value (T) == 1:
      - Start at the cell *after* target_cell in the propagation direction.
      - Fill the next V cells with value V along that direction (stop at boundary).
    - If target_cell.value (T) != 1:
      - Start at the cell *adjacent* to target_cell in the propagation direction.
      - Fill cells with value V along that direction until the grid boundary.
  - Update Grid:
    - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
    - Set output_grid[r][c] (action_cell position) to 0.
    - Overwrite cells in output_grid according to the Propagate Value step.
    - Ensure output_grid[tr][tc] (target_cell position) retains its original value T.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input grid. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Action and Target Cells:** Scan the input grid to find a cell `(r, c)` with value `V` (the "Action Cell") such that it is adjacent to at least one cell `(tr, tc)` with a non-zero value `T` (the "Target Cell") where `V > T`. Assume the Action Cell is the one with the highest value `V` that satisfies this condition across the entire grid. Identify the specific Target Cell `(tr, tc)` that corresponds to the observed transformation (in the examples, only one adjacent cell seems to lead to the correct output propagation path).
3.  **Determine Propagation Direction:** Define the direction based on the relative positions: if `tr < r`, direction is UP; if `tr > r`, direction is DOWN; if `tc < c`, direction is LEFT; if `tc > c`, direction is RIGHT. This direction represents moving away from the Action Cell, starting from the Target Cell.
4.  **Execute Propagation based on Target Value:**
    *   **If the Target Cell's value `T` is 1:** Find the first cell `(nr, nc)` along the propagation direction, starting *after* the Target Cell `(tr, tc)`. Fill this cell `(nr, nc)` and the subsequent `V-1` cells along the same direction with the value `V`. Stop filling if the grid boundary is reached.
    *   **If the Target Cell's value `T` is not 1:** Find the first cell `(nr, nc)` along the propagation direction, starting *adjacent* to the Target Cell `(tr, tc)`. Fill this cell `(nr, nc)` and all subsequent cells along the same direction with the value `V` until the grid boundary is reached.
5.  **Finalize Output Grid:**
    *   In the output grid (initially a copy of the input), set the value of the Action Cell `(r, c)` to 0.
    *   Update the values of the cells modified during the propagation step.
    *   Ensure the Target Cell `(tr, tc)` in the output grid retains its original value `T` (it should not be overwritten by propagation or the zeroing of the action cell).
6.  **Return:** The modified grid is the final output.
