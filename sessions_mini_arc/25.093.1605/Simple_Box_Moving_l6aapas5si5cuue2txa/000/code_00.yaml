Task: Propagate Value from Action Cell based on Adjacent Target Cell

Objects:
  - Grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - Cell: An element within the grid, defined by row, column, and value.

Properties:
  - Cell:
    - row: Integer index.
    - column: Integer index.
    - value: Non-negative integer.
  - Adjacency: Cells sharing an edge (up, down, left, right).

Relationships:
  - Action-Target Pair:
    - action_cell: Cell(r, c) with value V.
    - target_cell: Cell(tr, tc) adjacent to action_cell with value T.
    - condition: V > T and T > 0.
    - trigger: In the examples, the pair involving the highest value V seems to be the trigger.

Actions:
  - Find Trigger Pair: Identify the unique action_cell (r, c) with value V and adjacent target_cell (tr, tc) with value T (V > T > 0) that initiates the transformation. (Assumption: The action cell is the one with the maximum value meeting the criteria).
  - Determine Direction: Calculate the direction of propagation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on the relative positions of the action and target cells (direction points away from action_cell, starting from target_cell).
  - Propagate Value:
    - If target_cell.value (T) == 1:
      - Start at the cell *after* target_cell in the propagation direction.
      - Fill the next V cells with value V along that direction (stop at boundary).
    - If target_cell.value (T) != 1:
      - Start at the cell *adjacent* to target_cell in the propagation direction.
      - Fill cells with value V along that direction until the grid boundary.
  - Update Grid:
    - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
    - Set output_grid[r][c] (action_cell position) to 0.
    - Overwrite cells in output_grid according to the Propagate Value step.
    - Ensure output_grid[tr][tc] (target_cell position) retains its original value T.
