*   **Perception of the elements of the task:**
    *   The input and output are both grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 5x5 in all provided examples.
    *   Input grids contain primarily 0s and one other non-zero digit (1, 2, or 3).
    *   Output grids contain primarily 0s and the digit 5.
    *   The pattern of 5s in the output grid seems to depend deterministically on the *type* of non-zero digit present in the input grid, rather than the specific locations or quantity (beyond determining which type is dominant).
    *   When the input contains mostly 1s (as the non-zero digit), the output has 5s along the main diagonal.
    *   When the input contains mostly 2s, the output has 5s along the anti-diagonal.
    *   When the input contains mostly 3s, the output has 5s along the top row.
    *   The task appears to involve identifying the dominant non-zero digit in the input grid and generating a corresponding fixed pattern of 5s in the output grid.

*   **Facts:**

    objects:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: grid (matrix)
          - dimensions: variable (observed as 5x5)
          - cell_values: integers (observed as 0, 1, 2, 3)

        properties:
          - type: grid (matrix)
          - dimensions: same as input_grid
          - cell_values: integers (observed as 0, 5)

        properties:

          - value: the non-zero digit that appears most frequently in the input_grid

    actions:
      - name: analyze_input
        steps:
          - count occurrences of each non-zero digit in input_grid
          - identify the dominant_nonzero_digit
      - name: generate_output
        steps:
          - create an output_grid of the same dimensions as input_grid, filled with 0s
          - based on dominant_nonzero_digit:
              - if 1: place 5s along the main diagonal
              - if 2: place 5s along the anti-diagonal
              - if 3: place 5s along the top row
              - otherwise: leave as all 0s (inferred)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input grid.
    2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct non-zero number (1, 2, 3, etc.) present in the input grid.
    3.  Determine which non-zero number has the highest count. Let this be the `dominant_number`. If there are no non-zero numbers or there is a tie in counts, handle appropriately (e.g., default to an all-zero output or follow a tie-breaking rule if specified, though not needed based on examples).
    4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with zeros.
    5.  Check the value of the `dominant_number`:
        *   If the `dominant_number` is 1, modify the output grid by setting the value of each cell along the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) to 5.
        *   If the `dominant_number` is 2, modify the output grid by setting the value of each cell along the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals grid height minus 1) to 5.
        *   If the `dominant_number` is 3, modify the output grid by setting the value of each cell in the first row (row index 0) to 5.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
