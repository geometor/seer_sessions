Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell Values:
    - 0: Empty space
    - 4: Movable object
    - 5: Transformed object state (appears only in output)

Objects:
  - Type: Clusters or individual cells
    Identifier: Value '4'
    Properties:
      - Position (row, column)
      - Color/Value: 4

Actions:
  - Name: Gravity Simulation
    Input: Grid with '4's
    Output: Grid with '4's moved down in each column
    Constraints:
      - '4's fall until hitting the bottom boundary (row 4) or another '4'.
      - Relative vertical order of '4's within a column is preserved.
      - Horizontal position (column) is preserved.
      - Vacated cells become '0'.
  - Name: Row Transformation
    Trigger Condition: Based on the count of '4's in specific rows of the *original input* grid.
    Effect: Replaces entire rows of the gravity-affected grid with the value '5'.
    Affected Rows (Output Grid):
      - Bottom row (row 4)
      - Second-to-bottom row (row 3)
    Details:
      - If the *input* grid's bottom row (row 4) has >= 3 '4's, the *output* grid's bottom row becomes all '5's.
      - If the *input* grid's second-to-bottom row (row 3) has >= 3 '4's AND the *input* grid's bottom row (row 4) also has >= 3 '4's, the *output* grid's second-to-bottom row becomes all '5's.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: '4's interact vertically during gravity (stopping).
  - Conditional: The transformation to '5' depends on the configuration of '4's in the bottom two rows of the *initial* input grid.
