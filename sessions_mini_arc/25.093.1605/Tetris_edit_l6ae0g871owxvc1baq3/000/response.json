The output introduces the value '5'.\n3.  **Movement:** The primary action seems to be a downward movement of the '4' elements within each column, resembling gravity. Elements fall until they hit the bottom edge or another element.\n4.  **Transformation:** Under specific conditions related to the bottom rows of the *input* grid, rows in the *output* grid (after gravity has been applied) are entirely replaced with '5's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
