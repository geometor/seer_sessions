Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers. All examples use 5x5 grids.
2.  **Values:** The input grids contain only the integers 0 and 5. The output grids contain integers 0, 2, and 5.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing certain 0s in the input grid to 2s in the output grid. The 5s remain unchanged, and some 0s also remain unchanged.
4.  **Pattern:** The change from 0 to 2 seems dependent on the horizontal proximity to the number 5. Specifically, if a sequence of one or more 0s is immediately adjacent horizontally (either to the left or right) to a sequence of one or more 5s within the same row, those 0s are changed to 2s.
5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. Changes in one row do not appear to be influenced by other rows.
6.  **Example Walkthrough (train_3):**
    *   Input Row 0: `0 5 5 0 0`. The sequence `5 5` is adjacent to the sequence `0 0` on its right. Thus, `0 0` becomes `2 2`. Output Row 0: `0 5 5 2 2`.
    *   Input Row 1: `0 5 0 0 0`. No sequence of 0s is directly adjacent to the `5`. Output Row 1: `0 5 0 0 0`.
    *   Input Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0`. No 5s present. Output Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0`.
    *   Input Row 3: `0 0 5 5 0`. The sequence `0 0` is adjacent to the sequence `5 5` on its left. Thus, `0 0` becomes `2 2`. Output Row 3: `2 2 5 5 0`.
    *   Input Row 4: `0 0 0 5 0`. No sequence of 0s is directly adjacent to the `5`. Output Row 4: `0 0 0 5 0`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row, identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of the value 5. Record their start and end column indices.
4.  For the same current row, identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of the value 0. Record their start and end column indices.
5.  For each identified sequence of 0s:
    *   Check if its end column index plus one equals the start column index of any identified sequence of 5s in the same row (i.e., the 0 sequence immediately precedes a 5 sequence).
    *   Check if its start column index minus one equals the end column index of any identified sequence of 5s in the same row (i.e., the 0 sequence immediately follows a 5 sequence).
    *   If either of these adjacency conditions is true, change the value of all cells within that 0 sequence in the *output* grid from 0 to 2.
6.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous transformation attempt correctly identified the core mechanism involving sequences of 0s changing to 2s based on adjacency to 5s. However, the specific condition triggering the change was inaccurately modelled. The results show errors where:
1.  Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` were sometimes changed when they shouldn't have been (e.g., `0 5 5` becoming `2 5 5`).
2.  Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` were sometimes *not* changed when other adjacent 0 sequences *were* changed (the key difference in Train 3, Row 3: `0 0 5 5 0` -> `2 2 5 5 0`).

The crucial refinement seems to be that the transformation applies *only* to sequences of 0s that are:
a.  Immediately adjacent (horizontally) to a sequence of exactly two 5s (`5 5`).
b.  Have a length greater than 1. Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` remain unchanged.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the identification of relevant sequences: specifically find `5 5` sequences and adjacent `0` sequences.
2.  Add a condition to check the length of the adjacent `0` sequence before applying the transformation.

## Metrics

Let's analyze the relationship between `5 5` sequences and adjacent `0` sequences, focusing on the length of the `0` sequence and whether it changes.

**Metrics Interpretation:**

The summary clearly shows the pattern:
*   Zero sequences of length 1 adjacent to `5 5` were checked 4 times, and *never* changed to 2s (Changed = False).
*   Zero sequences of length 2 adjacent to `5 5` were checked 4 times, and *always* changed to 2s (Changed = True).
*   Zero sequences of length 3 adjacent to `5 5` were checked 2 times, and *always* changed to 2s (Changed = True).

This confirms the hypothesis: the transformation applies if and only if a zero sequence is adjacent to a `5 5` sequence *and* the zero sequence has a length strictly greater than 1.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Process each row of the input grid individually.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all horizontal sequences consisting of exactly two 5s (`5 5`). Store their start and end column indices. If no `5 5` sequences exist in the row, proceed to the next row.
    b.  Identify all horizontal sequences consisting of 0s. Store their start, end, and length for each sequence.
    c.  For each identified sequence of 0s:
        i.  Check if this 0-sequence has a length greater than 1.
        ii. If its length is greater than 1, check if it is immediately adjacent (horizontally, either to the left or right) to *any* of the `5 5` sequences found in step 3a for this row.
        iii. If both conditions (length > 1 and adjacency to a `5 5` sequence) are true, then change the value of all cells within this specific 0-sequence in the *output* grid from 0 to 2.
4.  After iterating through all rows, return the completed output grid.
