objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output state.
      properties:
        - rows: Integer number of rows.
        - columns: Integer number of columns.
        - cells: Collection of individual cells within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An individual element within the grid.
      properties:
        - row_index: Integer row position (0-based).
        - column_index: Integer column position (0-based).
        - value: Integer value (0, 2, or 5).
  - sequence:
      description: A contiguous horizontal run of cells with the same value within a single row.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value repeated in the sequence (e.g., 0 or 5).
        - start_col: The starting column index of the sequence.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the sequence.
        - length: The number of cells in the sequence.
        - row_index: The row index where the sequence occurs.

actions:
  - find_sequences:
      description: Identify all horizontal sequences of a specific value (0 or 5) within a given row.
      inputs: [row_data, target_value]
      outputs: [list_of_sequences]
  - check_adjacency:
      description: Determine if a sequence of 0s is immediately adjacent horizontally to a sequence of 5s in the same row.
      inputs: [sequence_0, sequence_5]
      outputs: [boolean_is_adjacent]
      condition: sequence_0.row_index == sequence_5.row_index AND (sequence_0.end_col + 1 == sequence_5.start_col OR sequence_5.end_col + 1 == sequence_0.start_col)
  - change_value:
      description: Modify the value of cells within a sequence from 0 to 2.
      inputs: [grid, sequence_to_change]
      outputs: [modified_grid]

relationships:
  - adjacency:
      description: The relationship between two sequences in the same row where one ends immediately before the other begins horizontally.
      involved_objects: [sequence, sequence]
  - precedence:
      description: A sequence of 0s appears immediately to the left of a sequence of 5s.
      involved_objects: [sequence_of_0s, sequence_of_5s]
  - succession:
      description: A sequence of 0s appears immediately to the right of a sequence of 5s.
      involved_objects: [sequence_of_5s, sequence_of_0s]
