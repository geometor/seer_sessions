            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids (matrices) of integers. All examples use 5x5 grids.\n2.  **Values:** The input grids contain only the integers 0 and 5. The output grids contain integers 0, 2, and 5.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing certain 0s in the input grid to 2s in the output grid. The 5s remain unchanged, and some 0s also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Pattern:** The change from 0 to 2 seems dependent on the horizontal proximity to the number 5. Specifically, if a sequence of one or more 0s is immediately adjacent horizontally (either to the left or right) to a sequence of one or more 5s within the same row, those 0s are changed to 2s.\n5.  **Row Independence:** The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. Changes in one row do not appear to be influenced by other rows.\n6.  **Example Walkthrough (train_3):**\n    *   Input Row 0: `0 5 5 0 0`. The sequence `5 5` is adjacent to the sequence `0 0` on its right. Thus, `0 0` becomes `2 2`. Output Row 0: `0 5 5 2 2`.\n    *   Input Row 1: `0 5 0 0 0`. No sequence of 0s is directly adjacent to the `5`. Output Row 1: `0 5 0 0 0`.\n    *   Input Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0`. No 5s present. Output Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0`.\n    *   Input Row 3: `0 0 5 5 0`. The sequence `0 0` is adjacent to the sequence `5 5` on its left. Thus, `0 0` becomes `2 2`. Output Row 3: `2 2 5 5 0`.\n    *   Input Row 4: `0 0 0 5 0`. No sequence of 0s is directly adjacent to the `5`. Output Row 4: `0 0 0 5 0`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
