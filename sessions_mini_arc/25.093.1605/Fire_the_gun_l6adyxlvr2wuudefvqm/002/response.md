## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of changing 0s to 2s based on horizontal adjacency to 5s within a row. However, it over-applied the rule, changing 0s adjacent to *any* sequence of 5s. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more specific condition: the transformation from 0 to 2 only occurs when a sequence of one or more 0s is immediately adjacent (left or right) to a sequence of 5s that has a length of *exactly two* (i.e., `5 5`). Adjacency to single 5s or sequences of three or more 5s does not trigger the change.

The strategy is to refine the transformation logic by:
1.  Identifying sequences of 0s and 5s in each row.
2.  Specifically filtering the sequences of 5s to find only those with a length of exactly 2.
3.  Checking for adjacency between the sequences of 0s and the identified sequences of exactly two 5s.
4.  Applying the 0-to-2 change only when this specific adjacency condition is met.

## Metrics

Let's gather metrics on the performance of the *previous* code attempt against the training examples.

**Summary of Metrics (Previous Code Attempt):**

*   **False Positives:** The code consistently produced "false positive" changes (changing 0s to 2s when they should have remained 0s). The number of false positives exactly matches the `pixels_off` count in each example (12, 9, 10 respectively).
*   **False Negatives:** There were no "false negative" changes (failing to change a 0 to a 2 when it was expected). This confirms the previous code correctly identified *all* required changes, but also included incorrect ones.
*   **Actual vs Expected Changes:** The number of actual 0-to-2 changes made by the code (15, 11, 14) was significantly higher than the number of expected changes (3, 2, 4).
*   **Conclusion:** The previous code's logic for identifying *which* adjacent 0s to change was too inclusive. The refinement needs to restrict the conditions under which the change occurs. The new hypothesis (adjacency only to `5 5` sequences) aligns with this need for restriction.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of the value 5. Record their start column index, end column index, and calculate their length.
    b.  Filter these sequences to retain only those where the length is *exactly 2*. Store these "length-2 5-sequences".
    c.  Identify all contiguous horizontal sequences of the value 0. Record their start and end column indices.
    d.  For each identified sequence of 0s:
        i.  Set a flag `change_to_2` to `False`.
        ii. Iterate through the stored "length-2 5-sequences" from step 3b.
        iii. Check if the current 0 sequence's end column index plus one equals the start column index of the "length-2 5-sequence" (0s are immediately left of `5 5`).
        iv. Check if the current 0 sequence's start column index minus one equals the end column index of the "length-2 5-sequence" (0s are immediately right of `5 5`).
        v.  If either adjacency condition (iii or iv) is true, set `change_to_2` to `True` and break the inner loop (no need to check other `5 5` sequences for this 0 sequence).
        vi. If the `change_to_2` flag is `True` after checking all relevant "length-2 5-sequences", modify the *output* grid by changing the value of all cells within that 0 sequence (from its start column to its end column in the current row) from 0 to 2.
4.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
