objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output state.
      properties:
        - rows: Integer number of rows.
        - columns: Integer number of columns.
        - cells: Collection of individual cells within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An individual element within the grid.
      properties:
        - row_index: Integer row position (0-based).
        - column_index: Integer column position (0-based).
        - value: Integer value (0, 2, or 5).
  - sequence:
      description: A contiguous horizontal run of cells with the same value within a single row.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value repeated in the sequence (e.g., 0 or 5).
        - start_col: The starting column index of the sequence.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the sequence.
        - length: The number of cells in the sequence (calculated as end_col - start_col + 1).
        - row_index: The row index where the sequence occurs.
  - specific_sequence_55:
      description: A sequence where the value is 5 and the length is exactly 2.
      inherits: sequence
      constraints:
        - value == 5
        - length == 2

actions:
  - find_sequences:
      description: Identify all horizontal sequences of a specific value (0 or 5) within a given row.
      inputs: [row_data, target_value]
      outputs: [list_of_sequences]
  - filter_sequences_by_length:
      description: Select sequences from a list that match a specific length.
      inputs: [list_of_sequences, target_length]
      outputs: [filtered_list_of_sequences]
  - check_specific_adjacency:
      description: Determine if a sequence of 0s is immediately adjacent horizontally (left or right) to a sequence of 5s of *exactly length two* in the same row.
      inputs: [sequence_0, sequence_55] # sequence_55 is an instance of specific_sequence_55
      outputs: [boolean_is_adjacent]
      condition: sequence_0.row_index == sequence_55.row_index AND (sequence_0.end_col + 1 == sequence_55.start_col OR sequence_55.end_col + 1 == sequence_0.start_col)
  - change_value:
      description: Modify the value of cells within a sequence from 0 to 2 in the output grid.
      inputs: [grid, sequence_to_change]
      outputs: [modified_grid]

relationships:
  - specific_adjacency:
      description: The relationship between a sequence of 0s and a sequence of 5s of length exactly 2, where one ends immediately before the other begins horizontally in the same row.
