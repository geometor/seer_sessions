objects:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of integers representing the input and output state.
      properties:
        - rows: Integer number of rows.
        - columns: Integer number of columns.
        - cells: Collection of individual cells within the grid.
  - cell:
      description: An individual element within the grid.
      properties:
        - row_index: Integer row position (0-based).
        - column_index: Integer column position (0-based).
        - value: Integer value (0, 2, or 5).
  - sequence:
      description: A contiguous horizontal run of cells with the same value within a single row.
      properties:
        - value: The integer value repeated in the sequence (e.g., 0 or 5).
        - start_col: The starting column index of the sequence.
        - end_col: The ending column index of the sequence.
        - length: The number of cells in the sequence (calculated as end_col - start_col + 1).
        - row_index: The row index where the sequence occurs.

actions:
  - find_sequences:
      description: Identify all horizontal sequences of a specific value (0 or 5) within a given row.
      inputs: [row_data, target_value]
      outputs: [list_of_sequences] # Each sequence includes start, end, length
  - filter_sequences_by_length:
      description: Select sequences that match a specific length criterion.
      inputs: [list_of_sequences, required_length]
      outputs: [filtered_list_of_sequences]
  - check_adjacency:
      description: Determine if a sequence_A is immediately adjacent horizontally (left or right) to sequence_B in the same row.
      inputs: [sequence_A, sequence_B]
      outputs: [boolean_is_adjacent]
      condition: sequence_A.row_index == sequence_B.row_index AND (sequence_A.end_col + 1 == sequence_B.start_col OR sequence_B.end_col + 1 == sequence_A.start_col)
  - change_sequence_value:
      description: Modify the value of all cells within a specified sequence in the grid.
      inputs: [grid, sequence_to_change, new_value]
      outputs: [modified_grid]

relationships:
  - adjacency:
      description: The relationship between two sequences in the same row where one ends immediately before the other begins horizontally.
      involved_objects: [sequence, sequence]

transformation_trigger:
  description: A condition that causes a sequence of 0s to change to 2s.
  conditions:
    - A sequence of 0s exists (`zero_sequence`).
    - A sequence of 5s with length exactly 2 exists (`five_five_sequence`).
    - `zero_sequence` and `five_five_sequence` are in the same row.
    - `zero_sequence` and `five_five_sequence` are immediately adjacent horizontally.
    - `zero_sequence.length > 1`.
