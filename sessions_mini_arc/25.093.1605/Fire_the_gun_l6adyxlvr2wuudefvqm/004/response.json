            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous transformation attempt correctly identified the core mechanism involving sequences of 0s changing to 2s based on adjacency to 5s. However, the specific condition triggering the change was inaccurately modelled. The results show errors where:\n1.  Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` were sometimes changed when they shouldn't have been (e.g., `0 5 5` becoming `2 5 5`).\n2.  Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` were sometimes *not* changed when other adjacent 0 sequences *were* changed (the key difference in Train 3, Row 3: `0 0 5 5 0` -> `2 2 5 5 0`).\n\nThe crucial refinement seems to be that the transformation applies *only* to sequences of 0s that are:\na.  Immediately adjacent (horizontally) to a sequence of exactly two 5s (`5 5`).\nb.  Have a length greater than 1. Single 0s adjacent to `5 5` remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the identification of relevant sequences: specifically find `5 5` sequences and adjacent `0` sequences.\n2.  Add a condition to check the length of the adjacent `0` sequence before applying the transformation.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between `5 5` sequences and adjacent `0` sequences, focusing on the length of the `0` sequence and whether it changes.\n\n"
