"""
Transforms a 2D grid by changing sequences of 0s to 2s only if they are 
immediately adjacent horizontally (left or right) to a sequence of 5s 
that has a length of exactly two (i.e., '5 5') within the same row. 
Other 0s and all 5s remain unchanged.

    Finds all contiguous horizontal sequences of a target value in a row.
