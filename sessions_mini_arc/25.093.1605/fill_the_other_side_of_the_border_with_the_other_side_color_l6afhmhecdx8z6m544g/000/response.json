            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both are grids (matrices) of integers, consistently 5x5 in the examples.\n2.  **Content:** The grids contain integers. Notably, the number `0` appears frequently in the inputs and is often replaced in the outputs.\n3.  **Key Feature:** In each input grid, there seems to be one unique, non-zero integer that acts as a \"trigger\" or \"source\" number (7, 2, 3, 9 in the examples). This trigger number appears only once, distinct from any potential \"background\" numbers (like 1 or 8) that might appear multiple times.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the trigger number and its location in the input grid.\n    *   Identifying the cells containing `0` in the input grid.\n    *   Replacing a subset of these `0` cells in the output grid with the trigger number.\n    *   The original location of the trigger number in the input grid seems to become `0` in the output grid.\n5.  **Pattern:** The pattern of which `0`s get replaced depends on the initial location of the trigger number. It appears to be a fill or propagation process starting from a corner *opposite* to the quadrant where the trigger number was located. The fill spreads through connected `0` cells.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find the \"trigger\" number (T) and its location (r\\_t, c\\_t). The trigger number is the integer that appears exactly once and is not zero (you might need to handle cases with background numbers by identifying the number with frequency 1, excluding 0).\n3.  Determine the grid dimensions (height H, width W).\n4.  Determine the starting corner (r\\_s, c\\_s) for the fill process based on the trigger location (r\\_t, c\\_t):\n    *   If r\\_t < H/2 and c\\_t < W/2 (Top-Left quadrant), set (r\\_s, c\\_s) to (H-1, W-1) (Bottom-Right corner).\n    *   If r\\_t >= H/2 and c\\_t >= W/2 (Bottom-Right quadrant), set (r\\_s, c\\_s) to (0, 0) (Top-Left corner).\n    *   If r\\_t >= H/2 and c\\_t < W/2 (Bottom-Left quadrant), set (r\\_s, c\\_s) to (0, W-1) (Top-Right corner).\n    *   If r\\_t < H/2 and c\\_t >= W/2 (Top-Right quadrant), set (r\\_s, c\\_s) to (H-1, 0) (Bottom-Left corner).\n5.  Set the value of the cell at the original trigger location (r\\_t, c\\_t) in the output grid to 0.\n6.  Perform a flood fill or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the determined corner (r\\_s, c\\_s):\n    *   Use a queue for the BFS and a way to track visited cells (e.g., a set or a boolean grid) to avoid infinite loops.\n    *   Add the starting cell (r\\_s, c\\_s) to the queue.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue the current cell (r, c).\n        *   If (r, c) is out of bounds, or already visited, continue to the next iteration.\n        *   Mark (r, c) as visited.\n        *   Check the value of the cell (r, c) in the *original input grid*:\n            *   If `input[r][c]` is 0:\n                *   Set `output[r][c]` to the trigger number T.\n                *   Add all valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of (r, c) to the queue.\n            *   If `input[r][c]` is non-zero:\n                *   Do not change `output[r][c]`.\n                *   Do not add neighbors from this cell (the fill is blocked).\n7.
