The '1's often form closed or partially closed shapes/boundaries.\n4.  **Output Values:** The output grids contain only the values 0 and 7.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The '1's from the input grid seem to define boundaries.\n    *   Regions of '0's in the input that are completely enclosed by these '1' boundaries are transformed into '7's in the output grid.\n    *   The original '1' boundary cells themselves are transformed into '0's in the output grid.\n    *   Regions of '0's in the input that are *not* enclosed by '1's (i.e., they can reach the edge of the grid by moving through other '0's) remain '0's in the output grid.\n    *   The value '7' seems to be a constant replacement value for the enclosed areas.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
