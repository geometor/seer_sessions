task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  input_values: [0, 1]
  output_values: [0, 7]
  size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions
objects:
  - object: boundary
    defined_by: cells with value 1 in the input grid
    role: defines enclosed regions
  - object: enclosed_region
    defined_by: cells with value 0 in the input grid that cannot reach the grid edge by moving horizontally/vertically through other 0-valued cells
    properties:
      input_value: 0
      output_value: 7
  - object: exterior_region
    defined_by: cells with value 0 in the input grid that can reach the grid edge by moving horizontally/vertically through other 0-valued cells
    properties:
      input_value: 0
      output_value: 0
  - object: boundary_cell
    defined_by: cells with value 1 in the input grid
    properties:
      input_value: 1
      output_value: 0
transformation:
  action: identify enclosed regions
  details: uses the '1' cells as barriers to determine which '0' cells are enclosed
  output_mapping:
    - input: enclosed '0'
      output: 7
    - input: non-enclosed '0'
      output: 0
    - input: '1' (boundary)
      output: 0
