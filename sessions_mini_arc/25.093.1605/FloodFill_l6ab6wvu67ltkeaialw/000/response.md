Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers.
2.  **Grid Size:** The grid dimensions appear consistent between the input and output for each example (e.g., 5x5).
3.  **Input Values:** The input grids contain only the values 0 and 1. The '1's often form closed or partially closed shapes/boundaries.
4.  **Output Values:** The output grids contain only the values 0 and 7.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The '1's from the input grid seem to define boundaries.
    *   Regions of '0's in the input that are completely enclosed by these '1' boundaries are transformed into '7's in the output grid.
    *   The original '1' boundary cells themselves are transformed into '0's in the output grid.
    *   Regions of '0's in the input that are *not* enclosed by '1's (i.e., they can reach the edge of the grid by moving through other '0's) remain '0's in the output grid.
    *   The value '7' seems to be a constant replacement value for the enclosed areas.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  input_values: [0, 1]
  output_values: [0, 7]
  size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions
objects:
  - object: boundary
    defined_by: cells with value 1 in the input grid
    role: defines enclosed regions
  - object: enclosed_region
    defined_by: cells with value 0 in the input grid that cannot reach the grid edge by moving horizontally/vertically through other 0-valued cells
    properties:
      input_value: 0
      output_value: 7
  - object: exterior_region
    defined_by: cells with value 0 in the input grid that can reach the grid edge by moving horizontally/vertically through other 0-valued cells
    properties:
      input_value: 0
      output_value: 0
  - object: boundary_cell
    defined_by: cells with value 1 in the input grid
    properties:
      input_value: 1
      output_value: 0
transformation:
  action: identify enclosed regions
  details: uses the '1' cells as barriers to determine which '0' cells are enclosed
  output_mapping:
    - input: enclosed '0'
      output: 7
    - input: non-enclosed '0'
      output: 0
    - input: '1' (boundary)
      output: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value 0.
3.  For each identified 0-cell, perform a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) starting from that cell, moving only horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells that also contain 0.
4.  Determine if this search can reach any cell on the outermost border (edge) of the input grid.
5.  If the search from a starting 0-cell *cannot* reach the grid border, then this cell is considered "enclosed".
6.  For every cell identified as "enclosed" in the previous step, set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to 7.
7.  All other cells in the output grid (those corresponding to input '1's or non-enclosed '0's) remain 0.
8.  Return the final output grid.
