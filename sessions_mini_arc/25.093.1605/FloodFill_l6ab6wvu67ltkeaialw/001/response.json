Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value 0 and are located on the outermost border (edge) of the grid.\n3. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from these border '0' cells. The search can only move horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells that also contain 0. Mark all reachable '0' cells during this search as 'exterior'.\n4. Iterate through the entire input grid.\n5. If an input cell contains a '0' and was *not* marked as 'exterior' during the BFS, it means this cell is part of an enclosed region. Set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 7.\n6. All other cells in the output grid (those corresponding to input '1's or '0's marked as 'exterior') remain 0.\n7.
