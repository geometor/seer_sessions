The input grid contains some pattern of 1s. The output grid seems to simplify this pattern into a single diagonal line of 1s. The position of this diagonal line in the output appears to be determined by the location of the \"first\" 1 encountered in the input grid when scanning from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.\n\n**YAML block documenting facts:**\n\n"

For each `i`, calculate the coordinates `(r_diag, c_diag) = (r_start + i, c_start + i)`. Check if these coordinates are within the bounds of the 5x5 grid (i.e., `0 <= r_diag < 5` and `0 <= c_diag < 5`). If they are within bounds, set the value of the cell at `(r_diag, c_diag)` in the output grid to 1. Continue incrementing `i` until the calculated coordinates fall outside the grid boundaries.\n6.
