# Objects and their properties
Grid:
  - type: object
  - properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5 (constant)
      - cells: list of lists (or equivalent structure)
Cell:
  - type: object
  - properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column) where 0 <= row < 5, 0 <= column < 5
      - value: 0 or 1
InputGrid:
  - type: Grid
  - role: input data for the transformation
OutputGrid:
  - type: Grid
  - role: result of the transformation

# Relationships
Transformation:
  - type: action
  - input: InputGrid
  - output: OutputGrid
  - rule: >
      The OutputGrid is derived from the InputGrid. It consists of a single
      diagonal sequence of 1s starting at a specific cell, with all other cells
      being 0.
StartCell:
  - type: Cell
  - description: The cell in the InputGrid that determines the start of the diagonal in the OutputGrid.
  - identification_rule: >
      Find the minimum row index `r` containing a 1 in the InputGrid.
      Among all cells with this minimum row index `r`, find the minimum
      column index `c`. The cell `(r, c)` is the StartCell.
OutputDiagonal:
  - type: sequence of Cells
  - description: The sequence of cells in the OutputGrid that contain 1s.
  - generation_rule: >
      Starting from StartCell `(r_start, c_start)`, the sequence includes
      cells `(r_start + i, c_start + i)` for `i = 0, 1, 2, ...` as long
      as the coordinates remain within the 5x5 grid boundaries.
