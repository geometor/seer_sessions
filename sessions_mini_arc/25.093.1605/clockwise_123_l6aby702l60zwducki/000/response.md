Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers (colors) based on specific rules.
1.  **Grid:** A rectangular array of cells, each containing an integer.
2.  **Colors:** The integers represent colors. Color 0 is typically the background. Non-zero integers represent foreground objects or filled areas.
3.  **Input State:** The initial configuration of colors in the grid. Contains existing shapes or patterns.
4.  **Output State:** The modified configuration after applying the transformation rule. Some background cells (0) are changed to a specific foreground color. Existing foreground colors remain unchanged.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core process involves identifying a "source color" and one or more "trigger points" based on the input configuration. These triggers initiate a filling process (like dropping paint) which potentially involves vertical falling and horizontal spreading, using the source color. There appear to be two distinct scenarios for triggering the fill.

## YAML Fact Sheet


```yaml
Observations:
  Input_Type: 2D Grid of integers (Colors)
  Output_Type: 2D Grid of integers (Colors)
  Grid_Size: Consistent between input and output for a given example (e.g., 5x5)
  Background_Color: 0
  Foreground_Colors: Integers > 0
  Transformation_Type: Additive Filling - Only 0s are changed to non-zero colors. Existing non-zero colors are preserved.

Key_Elements:
  - Name: Topmost Populated Row
    Description: The highest row (smallest row index) containing at least one non-zero color.
    Symbolic_Name: r_top
  - Name: Fill Color Source
    Description: The leftmost non-zero color found in the Topmost Populated Row (r_top).
    Symbolic_Name: fill_color
  - Name: Rightmost Element Position (Top Row)
    Description: The column index of the rightmost non-zero color in the Topmost Populated Row (r_top).
    Symbolic_Name: c_right
  - Name: Isolated Trigger Element
    Description: A non-zero element that is the *only* non-zero element in its row, and this row must be below r_top. If multiple exist, the one in the lowest row (max row index) is chosen. If ties exist in the lowest row, the rightmost one (max column index) is chosen.
    Symbolic_Name: trigger (r_trigger, c_trigger)
  - Name: Top Row Fill Target
    Description: Zero-valued cells in r_top located to the right of c_right.
  - Name: Falling Path
    Description: A vertical sequence of 0-valued cells starting below a trigger point and extending downwards until hitting the grid boundary or a non-zero cell.
  - Name: Spreading Path
    Description: A horizontal sequence of 0-valued cells starting to the left of the lowest cell in a Falling Path and extending leftwards until hitting the grid boundary or a non-zero cell.

Transformation_Rules_Summary:
  - Rule 1 (Top Row Extension & Drip):
      Applies_When: No Isolated Trigger Element exists below r_top.
      Action:
        1. Fill any 0s in r_top to the right of c_right with fill_color.
        2. If any cells were filled in step 1, find the rightmost filled cell at (r_top, c_new_right).
        3. If the cell (r_top + 1, c_new_right) is within bounds and is 0, fill it with fill_color.
  - Rule 2 (Isolated Trigger Fall & Spread):
      Applies_When: An Isolated Trigger Element (r_trigger, c_trigger) exists below r_top.
      Action:
        1. Identify the vertical Falling Path starting below the trigger.
        2. Identify the horizontal Spreading Path starting leftwards from the bottom of the Falling Path.
        3. Fill all cells in the Falling Path and Spreading Path with fill_color.

Priority: Rule 2 (Isolated Trigger) takes precedence. If an Isolated Trigger exists, Rule 1 is not applied. If no Isolated Trigger exists, Rule 1 is applied.

## Natural Language Program

Here is a natural language program describing the transformation:

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Top Row Parameters:**
    a. Find the highest row index, `r_top`, that contains at least one non-zero value. If no non-zero values exist anywhere, stop.
    b. Find the column index, `c_left`, of the leftmost non-zero value in row `r_top`. Set the `fill_color` to the value at `(r_top, c_left)`.
    c. Find the column index, `c_right`, of the rightmost non-zero value in row `r_top`.
3.  **Check for Isolated Trigger:**
    a. Search all rows `r` from `r_top + 1` down to the bottom row of the grid.
    b. For each row `r`, check if it contains exactly one non-zero value.
    c. Collect all such "isolated trigger" cells `(r, c)`.
    d. If one or more isolated triggers were found:
        i. Select the trigger `(r_trigger, c_trigger)` that has the maximum `r` value. If there's a tie for maximum `r`, select the one among them with the maximum `c` value.
        ii. **Perform Fall & Spread (Rule 2):**
            A. Starting from the cell directly below the trigger, `(r_trigger + 1, c_trigger)`, trace downwards column `c_trigger`. Identify the contiguous sequence of cells containing 0. Let the last cell in this sequence be `(y_stop, c_trigger)`. This is the Falling Path.
            B. Starting from the cell to the left of the end of the fall, `(y_stop, c_trigger - 1)`, trace leftwards along row `y_stop`. Identify the contiguous sequence of cells containing 0. Let the last cell in this sequence be `(y_stop, x_stop)`. This is the Spreading Path.
            C. Change the value of all cells in the Falling Path and the Spreading Path to `fill_color` in the output grid.
        iii. Proceed to step 5 (Finalize).
4.  **Perform Top Row Extension & Drip (Rule 1):** (This step only runs if NO isolated trigger was found in step 3)
    a. Initialize a flag `filled_top_row = false`.
    b. Iterate through columns `c` from `c_right + 1` to the last column index.
    c. If the cell `(r_top, c)` in the output grid contains 0:
        i. Change the value of `(r_top, c)` to `fill_color`.
        ii. Set `filled_top_row = true`.
        iii. Keep track of the rightmost column filled in this step, `c_new_right = c`.
    d. If `filled_top_row` is true:
        i. Check the cell below the rightmost filled cell: `(r_top + 1, c_new_right)`.
        ii. If this cell is within grid boundaries and contains 0, change its value to `fill_color` in the output grid.
5.  **Finalize:** The transformation is complete. The output grid holds the final state.
