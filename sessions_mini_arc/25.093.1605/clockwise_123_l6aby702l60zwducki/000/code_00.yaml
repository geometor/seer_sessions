Observations:
  Input_Type: 2D Grid of integers (Colors)
  Output_Type: 2D Grid of integers (Colors)
  Grid_Size: Consistent between input and output for a given example (e.g., 5x5)
  Background_Color: 0
  Foreground_Colors: Integers > 0
  Transformation_Type: Additive Filling - Only 0s are changed to non-zero colors. Existing non-zero colors are preserved.

Key_Elements:
  - Name: Topmost Populated Row
    Description: The highest row (smallest row index) containing at least one non-zero color.
    Symbolic_Name: r_top
  - Name: Fill Color Source
    Description: The leftmost non-zero color found in the Topmost Populated Row (r_top).
    Symbolic_Name: fill_color
  - Name: Rightmost Element Position (Top Row)
    Description: The column index of the rightmost non-zero color in the Topmost Populated Row (r_top).
    Symbolic_Name: c_right
  - Name: Isolated Trigger Element
    Description: A non-zero element that is the *only* non-zero element in its row, and this row must be below r_top. If multiple exist, the one in the lowest row (max row index) is chosen. If ties exist in the lowest row, the rightmost one (max column index) is chosen.
    Symbolic_Name: trigger (r_trigger, c_trigger)
  - Name: Top Row Fill Target
    Description: Zero-valued cells in r_top located to the right of c_right.
  - Name: Falling Path
    Description: A vertical sequence of 0-valued cells starting below a trigger point and extending downwards until hitting the grid boundary or a non-zero cell.
  - Name: Spreading Path
    Description: A horizontal sequence of 0-valued cells starting to the left of the lowest cell in a Falling Path and extending leftwards until hitting the grid boundary or a non-zero cell.

Transformation_Rules_Summary:
  - Rule 1 (Top Row Extension & Drip):
      Applies_When: No Isolated Trigger Element exists below r_top.
      Action:
        1. Fill any 0s in r_top to the right of c_right with fill_color.
        2. If any cells were filled in step 1, find the rightmost filled cell at (r_top, c_new_right).
        3. If the cell (r_top + 1, c_new_right) is within bounds and is 0, fill it with fill_color.
  - Rule 2 (Isolated Trigger Fall & Spread):
      Applies_When: An Isolated Trigger Element (r_trigger, c_trigger) exists below r_top.
      Action:
        1. Identify the vertical Falling Path starting below the trigger.
        2. Identify the horizontal Spreading Path starting leftwards from the bottom of the Falling Path.
        3. Fill all cells in the Falling Path and Spreading Path with fill_color.

Priority: Rule 2 (Isolated Trigger) takes precedence. If an Isolated Trigger exists, Rule 1 is not applied. If no Isolated Trigger exists, Rule 1 is applied.
