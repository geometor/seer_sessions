```python
"""
This program transforms a 2D grid of integers based on identified patterns.
The transformation involves two potential rules, prioritized as follows:

Rule 1 (Isolated Trigger Fall & Spread):
If there is an "isolated trigger" element (a non-zero cell that is the only non-zero element in its row, and this row is below the topmost row containing any non-zero elements), the rule applies. The trigger chosen is the one in the lowest row, breaking ties by choosing the rightmost one. The fill color is determined by the leftmost non-zero element in the topmost populated row. This fill color "falls" vertically downwards from below the trigger through consecutive 0s, and then "spreads" horizontally leftwards from the bottom of the fall path through consecutive 0s.

Rule 2 (Top Row Extension & Drip):
If no isolated trigger exists, this rule applies. The fill color is determined as in Rule 1. Any 0s in the topmost populated row to the right of the rightmost non-zero element are filled with the fill color. If any cells were filled this way, the cell directly below the rightmost newly filled cell is also filled with the fill color, provided it's within bounds and is currently 0.

Existing non-zero cells in the input grid are preserved in the output.
