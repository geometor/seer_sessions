            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing binary values (0 or 1).\n2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation modifies the positions of the '1's within the grid. It doesn't seem to add '1's arbitrarily but rather adjusts an existing pattern of '1's.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The '1's in the input always appear to lie along a single straight line: either a vertical column, a horizontal row, or the main diagonal (where row index equals column index).\n4.  **Central Point:** The coordinate (2, 2), the geometric center of the 5x5 grid, appears to be crucial. The output pattern seems anchored or related to this center point.\n5.  **Transformation Behavior:**\n    *   If the input '1's are in a vertical column, the output '1's form a contiguous vertical segment starting from the top (row 0) or the closest original '1' to the top, and extending down *to* the center row (row 2), inclusive. Any original '1's below the center row are removed. The cell at the intersection of the column and the center row (row 2) is always set to '1' in the output.\n    *   If the input '1's are in a horizontal row, the output '1's form a contiguous horizontal segment ending at the rightmost original '1' or further right, starting *from* the center column (column 2), inclusive. Any original '1's left of the center column are removed. The cell at the intersection of the row and the center column (column 2) is always set to '1' in the output.\n    *   If the input '1's are on the main diagonal, the output '1's form a contiguous diagonal segment starting from the top-left (0,0) or the closest original '1' to the top-left, and extending down-right *to* the center point (2, 2), inclusive. Any original '1's beyond the center point are removed. The center cell (2, 2) is always set to '1' in the output.\n6.  **Summary:** The transformation identifies the line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) containing the input '1's. It then modifies this line segment in the output, ensuring it includes the center point (2, 2) and truncates or adjusts the segment based on its orientation relative to the center.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
