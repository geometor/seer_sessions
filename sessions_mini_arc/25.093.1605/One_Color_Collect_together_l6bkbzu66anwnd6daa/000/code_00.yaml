Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell Values: [0, 1]
Center Point:
  Coordinates: (row=2, column=2)
Input Pattern:
  Object: Set of cells with value 1
  Property: All cells lie on a single line (vertical, horizontal, or main diagonal) that potentially intersects the Center Point.
Transformation:
  Action: Modify the set of cells with value 1
  Rule:
    - Identify the line type (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) of the Input Pattern.
    - Define Output Pattern based on line type and Center Point:
      - If Vertical Line (column = C):
        - Retain input cells (r, C) where r <= center_row (2).
        - Ensure cell (center_row, C) is 1.
      - If Horizontal Line (row = R):
        - Retain input cells (R, c) where c >= center_col (2).
        - Ensure cell (R, center_col) is 1.
      - If Diagonal Line (row = column):
        - Retain input cells (d, d) where d <= center_row (2).
        - Ensure cell (center_row, center_col) is 1.
  Output: New grid containing the Output Pattern.
