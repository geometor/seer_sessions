Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 5x5 grids containing binary values (0 or 1).
2.  **Core Operation:** The transformation modifies the positions of the '1's within the grid. It doesn't seem to add '1's arbitrarily but rather adjusts an existing pattern of '1's.
3.  **Key Feature:** The '1's in the input always appear to lie along a single straight line: either a vertical column, a horizontal row, or the main diagonal (where row index equals column index).
4.  **Central Point:** The coordinate (2, 2), the geometric center of the 5x5 grid, appears to be crucial. The output pattern seems anchored or related to this center point.
5.  **Transformation Behavior:**
    *   If the input '1's are in a vertical column, the output '1's form a contiguous vertical segment starting from the top (row 0) or the closest original '1' to the top, and extending down *to* the center row (row 2), inclusive. Any original '1's below the center row are removed. The cell at the intersection of the column and the center row (row 2) is always set to '1' in the output.
    *   If the input '1's are in a horizontal row, the output '1's form a contiguous horizontal segment ending at the rightmost original '1' or further right, starting *from* the center column (column 2), inclusive. Any original '1's left of the center column are removed. The cell at the intersection of the row and the center column (column 2) is always set to '1' in the output.
    *   If the input '1's are on the main diagonal, the output '1's form a contiguous diagonal segment starting from the top-left (0,0) or the closest original '1' to the top-left, and extending down-right *to* the center point (2, 2), inclusive. Any original '1's beyond the center point are removed. The center cell (2, 2) is always set to '1' in the output.
6.  **Summary:** The transformation identifies the line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) containing the input '1's. It then modifies this line segment in the output, ensuring it includes the center point (2, 2) and truncates or adjusts the segment based on its orientation relative to the center.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 5x5
  Cell Values: [0, 1]
Center Point:
  Coordinates: (row=2, column=2)
Input Pattern:
  Object: Set of cells with value 1
  Property: All cells lie on a single line (vertical, horizontal, or main diagonal) that potentially intersects the Center Point.
Transformation:
  Action: Modify the set of cells with value 1
  Rule:
    - Identify the line type (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) of the Input Pattern.
    - Define Output Pattern based on line type and Center Point:
      - If Vertical Line (column = C):
        - Retain input cells (r, C) where r <= center_row (2).
        - Ensure cell (center_row, C) is 1.
      - If Horizontal Line (row = R):
        - Retain input cells (R, c) where c >= center_col (2).
        - Ensure cell (R, center_col) is 1.
      - If Diagonal Line (row = column):
        - Retain input cells (d, d) where d <= center_row (2).
        - Ensure cell (center_row, center_col) is 1.
  Output: New grid containing the Output Pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the grid center as `C = (row=2, column=2)`.
2.  Identify all coordinates `(r, c)` in the input grid where the value is 1. Let this set be `S_in`.
3.  Determine if all points in `S_in` lie on a single line type relative to the center `C`:
    a.  **Vertical:** Check if all points `(r, c)` in `S_in` have `c == C.column`.
    b.  **Horizontal:** Check if all points `(r, c)` in `S_in` have `r == C.row`.
    c.  **Diagonal:** Check if all points `(r, c)` in `S_in` have `r == c`.
4.  Initialize an empty 5x5 output grid with all zeros.
5.  Based on the identified line type, populate the output grid:
    a.  **If Vertical (all points in column `C.column`):**
        For each point `(r, C.column)` in `S_in`, if `r <= C.row`, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 1.
        Ensure the output grid cell at `(C.row, C.column)` is set to 1.
    b.  **If Horizontal (all points in row `C.row`):**
        For each point `(C.row, c)` in `S_in`, if `c >= C.column`, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 1.
        Ensure the output grid cell at `(C.row, C.column)` is set to 1.
    c.  **If Diagonal (all points satisfy `r == c`):**
        For each point `(d, d)` in `S_in`, if `d <= C.row`, set the corresponding cell `(d, d)` in the output grid to 1.
        Ensure the output grid cell at `(C.row, C.column)` is set to 1.
6.  Return the populated output grid.
