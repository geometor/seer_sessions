The output grid consists entirely of 0s and 5s. The transformation appears to operate row by row. The value assigned to an entire output row (either all 0s or all 5s) depends on a property of the corresponding input row. Specifically, it seems that if an input row contains the digit 0 at any position, the corresponding output row is filled with 0s. If an input row does *not* contain any 0s, the corresponding output row is filled with 5s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
