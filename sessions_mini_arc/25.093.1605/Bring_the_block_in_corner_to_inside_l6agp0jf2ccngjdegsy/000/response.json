Let's call this the \"target block\".\n*   There are one or more other non-zero digits located elsewhere in the grid, often near the edges or corners, separated from the target block by zeros. Let's call these \"mover digits\".\n*   The transformation involves moving the \"mover digits\" diagonally towards the \"target block\".\n*   The mover digit stops and replaces the first digit of the target block it encounters along its diagonal path.\n*   The original position of the mover digit is replaced with a zero.\n*   All other digits (zeros and the un-replaced parts of the target block) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
