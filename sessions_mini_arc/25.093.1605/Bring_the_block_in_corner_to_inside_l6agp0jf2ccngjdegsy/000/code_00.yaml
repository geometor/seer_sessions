task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - size: fixed (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column)
      - value: integer (0-9)
  - object: target_block
    properties:
      - type: group of adjacent cells
      - value: identical non-zero integer (e.g., 4, 8, 5)
      - location: typically central or contiguous
  - object: mover_digit
    properties:
      - type: cell
      - value: non-zero integer, different from target_block value
      - location: typically separated from target_block by zeros, often near edges/corners
actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: mover_digits
    condition: non-zero cells not part of the largest contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: target_block
    condition: the largest contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.
  - action: determine_path
    actor: mover_digit
    parameters:
      - direction: diagonal towards the nearest cell of the target_block
  - action: move
    actor: mover_digit
    result:
      - moves along the determined path until it encounters the first cell belonging to the target_block.
  - action: update_grid
    actor: system
    steps:
      - copy input grid to output grid.
      - for each mover_digit:
        - find the destination cell (first target_block cell on its diagonal path).
        - set the value of the destination cell in the output grid to the mover_digit's value.
        - set the value of the mover_digit's original cell in the output grid to 0.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entities: [mover_digit, target_block]
    description: mover_digit moves diagonally towards the target_block.
  - type: replacement
    entities: [mover_digit, target_block_cell]
    description: mover_digit value replaces the value of the first target_block cell encountered on its path.
  - type: state_change
    entities: [mover_digit_original_cell]
    description: original cell of the mover_digit becomes 0.
