The output grids contain the numbers 0, 1, and 5. The transformation appears to involve changing some of the 0s to 1s based on their proximity to the 5s. The positions and values of the 5s remain unchanged from input to output. The change from 0 to 1 seems to occur for cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a cell containing a 5.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
