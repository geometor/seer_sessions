Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cell_values_input: [0, 5]
      - cell_values_output: [0, 1, 5]
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - name: Path Segment
    properties:
      - type: Horizontal or Vertical sequence of cells
      - endpoints: Two cells with value 5 in the input grid
      - interior: Sequence of cells strictly between the endpoints
      - condition: All interior cells must have value 0 in the input grid ("clear path")

Relationships:
  - Transformation_Condition: A cell's value can change from 0 to 1 based on its position relative to cells with value 5.
  - Path_Membership: A cell with value 0 in the input grid might belong to one or more clear horizontal or vertical path segments between two 5s.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all cells with value 5 in the input grid.
  - Scan: For each cell `(r, c)` with value 0 in the input grid:
      a. Search Horizontally: Find the nearest cell with value 5 to the left (`L`) and nearest cell with value 5 to the right (`R`) in the same row `r`.
      b. Check Horizontal Path: If both `L` and `R` exist, verify that all cells between `L` and `R` (i.e., at `input[r][L+1 ... R-1]`) have value 0 in the input grid. If true, mark cell `(r, c)` for change to 1.
      c. Search Vertically: Find the nearest cell with value 5 above (`U`) and nearest cell with value 5 below (`D`) in the same column `c`.
      d. Check Vertical Path: If both `U` and `D` exist, verify that all cells between `U` and `D` (i.e., at `input[U+1 ... D-1][c]`) have value 0 in the input grid. If true, mark cell `(r, c)` for change to 1.
  - Update: Create an output grid, initially copying the input grid. Change the value to 1 in the output grid for any cell `(r, c)` that was marked for change in the previous step (either by horizontal or vertical path check).
  - Preserve: Cells with value 5 in the input remain 5 in the output. Cells with value 0 that were not marked for change remain 0.

Notes:
  - The transformation is based solely on the input grid state.
  - The "clear path" rule, as defined, correctly predicts outputs for examples 1-3 but fails for example 4 at position (3, 2), suggesting a potential issue with the example or a missing nuance in the rule.
