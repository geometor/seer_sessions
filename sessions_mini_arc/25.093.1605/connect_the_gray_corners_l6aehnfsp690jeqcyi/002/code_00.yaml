Objects:
  - name: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5 in examples)
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 5] (0 and 5 in input, 0, 1, 5 in output)
  - name: Cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

Relationships:
  - Collinear Pair: Two cells with value 5 are considered a pair if they lie on the same row or same column.
  - Clear Path: The path between a collinear pair of 5s (exclusive of the endpoints) is clear if all cells on the straight line segment between them have a value of 0 in the input grid.

Actions:
  - Identify all cells with value 0 in the input grid.
  - For each cell `(r, c)` with value 0:
    - Check Horizontally: Find the nearest 5s in the same row, `(r, c_left)` to the left (where `c_left < c`) and `(r, c_right)` to the right (where `c_right > c`). If both exist and the path between them (all cells `(r, k)` where `c_left < k < c_right`) is clear (all are 0s), then the cell `(r, c)` transforms to 1.
    - Check Vertically: Find the nearest 5s in the same column, `(r_up, c)` above (where `r_up < r`) and `(r_down, c)` below (where `r_down > r`). If both exist and the path between them (all cells `(k, c)` where `r_up < k < r_down`) is clear (all are 0s), then the cell `(r, c)` transforms to 1.
  - Copy the input grid to create an output grid.
  - Modify the output grid: Change the value of cells identified in the previous step from 0 to 1.
  - Cells originally having value 5 remain 5.
  - Cells originally having value 0 that do not meet the path criteria remain 0.
