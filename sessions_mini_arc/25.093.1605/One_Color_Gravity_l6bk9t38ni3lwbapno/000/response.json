The input grids feature scattered 1s, while the output grids consistently have all 0s except for the bottom-most row (row index 4). The pattern in the last row of the output seems to depend on the column positions of the 1s in the input grid. Specifically, if any cell within a column in the input grid contains a 1, the corresponding cell in the *last row* of the output grid becomes 1. All other cells in the output grid are set to 0. This transformation essentially projects the presence of a '1' in any row of a given column down onto the last row of the output grid for that same column.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
