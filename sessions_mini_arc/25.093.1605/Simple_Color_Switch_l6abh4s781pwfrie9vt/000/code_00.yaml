Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: 5x5
        - elements: integers
  - Output_Grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - dimensions: 5x5
        - elements: integers
  - Row:
      type: 1D array
      properties:
        - elements: integers
        - position: index within the grid (0 to 4)

Actions:
  - Vertical_Flip:
      description: Reverses the order of rows in the grid.

Relationships:
  - The Output_Grid is a transformation of the Input_Grid.
  - For an N x M grid (here N=5), Row `i` of the Input_Grid becomes Row `N-1-i` of the Output_Grid.
  - The elements within each row maintain their original horizontal positions.
