task_type: grid_transformation
grid_dimensions: 5x5
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - size: 5x5
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 2, 3, 4, 6 observed)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: border
    properties:
      - value: 6
      - location: row 0, row 4, column 0, column 4
      - characteristic: static, unchanged by transformation
  - object: inner_grid
    properties:
      - location: rows 1-3, columns 1-3 (0-based index)
      - characteristic: dynamic, subject to transformation
  - object: background_cell
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: empty space, can be filled
  - object: active_cell
    properties:
      - value: non-zero integer (2, 3, 4 observed) within inner_grid
      - role: propagates downwards
actions:
  - action: identify_subgrid
    actor: transformation_process
    target: inner_grid
    details: Exclude the border cells.
  - action: propagate_downwards
    actor: active_cell
    target: background_cell
    condition: The background_cell is directly below the active_cell within the same column of the inner_grid.
    effect: The value of the background_cell is replaced by the value of the active_cell.
    iteration: This propagation process continues iteratively or until no further changes occur in a pass.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [cell, cell]
    details: adjacency (specifically, 'below' relationship is key)
  - type: containment
    between: [grid, border]
  - type: containment
    between: [grid, inner_grid]
  - type: containment
    between: [inner_grid, active_cell]
  - type: containment
    between: [inner_grid, background_cell]
  - type: transformation_rule
    input: inner_grid (initial state)
    output: inner_grid (final state)
    process: iterative downward propagation of non-zero values into zero values within each column.
