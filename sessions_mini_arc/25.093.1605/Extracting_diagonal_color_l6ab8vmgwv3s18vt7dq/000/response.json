            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a 2D grid of numbers as input and produces a 2D grid of numbers of the same dimensions as output.\n2.  **Grid Size:** All examples use 5x5 grids. It's likely the transformation applies generally to square grids, but confirmed for 5x5.\n3.  **Grid Content:** The input grids contain non-negative integers, primarily zeros and a few other distinct non-zero digits. The output grids also contain non-negative integers.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid has a very specific structure: it consists mostly of zeros, with a single non-zero value placed along the main anti-diagonal (from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner).\n5.  **Value Selection:** The non-zero value used in the output's anti-diagonal appears to be derived from the non-zero values present in the input grid. Comparing the examples:\n    *   train\\_1: Input non-zeros {8}. Output uses 8.\n    *   train\\_2: Input non-zeros {9, 6}. Output uses 6.\n    *   train\\_3: Input non-zeros {8, 7}. Output uses 7.\n    *   train\\_4: Input non-zeros {4, 3}. Output uses 3.\n    The rule seems to be: find all unique non-zero numbers in the input grid and select the *minimum* of those numbers.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The selected minimum non-zero value populates the anti-diagonal cells of the output grid. All other cells in the output grid are zero. The anti-diagonal cells `(r, c)` satisfy the condition `r + c = N - 1`, where `N` is the grid dimension (5 in these examples).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the minimum value among the collected unique non-zero integers. Call this `fill_value`.\n4.  Determine the dimensions (e.g., N rows, M columns) of the input grid. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (N rows, M columns) and initialize all its cells to zero.\n5.  Iterate through the rows of the output grid from index `r = 0` to `N-1`. For each row `r`, calculate the corresponding column index `c = (M-1) - r`. If `c` is a valid column index (i.e., `0 <= c < M`), set the value of the cell at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `fill_value`. (This places `fill_value` along the anti-diagonal).\n6.  Return the generated output grid."
