task_description: "Transform a 5x5 grid containing a 3x3 block of 5s based on the block's position."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - value_types: integer
  - object: input_block
    properties:
      - shape: 3x3 square
      - value: 5
      - location: variable (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner relative to grid)
  - object: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - object: output_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 6
      - shape: variable subset of a 3x3 area
      - location: corresponds to the location of the input_block
relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    subject: input_block
    object: output_pattern
    details: The specific pattern of 6s in the output depends directly on which of the four possible corner positions the input_block occupies.
actions:
  - action: identify_block_location
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (top-left row, top-left column) of the 3x3 block of 5s.
  - action: determine_block_position_type
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: block_location_coordinates
    output: classification (e.g., Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
  - action: select_output_pattern
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: block_position_type
    output: specific 3x3 pattern mask defining where 6s should be placed.
  - action: apply_pattern
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_grid, block_location_coordinates, selected_output_pattern
    output: output_grid
    details: Create an output grid initialized with 0s. Place 6s in the output grid at locations corresponding to the input block's position, following the selected pattern mask.
