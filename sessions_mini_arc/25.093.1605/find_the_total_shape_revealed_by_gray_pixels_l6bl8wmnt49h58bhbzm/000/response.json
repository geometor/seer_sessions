The background is composed of the value 0.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation acts specifically on the 3x3 block of 5s. The 0s in the input generally remain 0s in the output.\n6.  **Pattern Variation:** The arrangement of 6s in the output changes depending on the position of the initial 3x3 block of 5s in the input.\n7.  **Positional Dependence:** There are four distinct examples, each showing the 3x3 block starting in a different corner quadrant of the 5x5 grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each position corresponds to a unique output pattern of 6s within the space originally occupied by the 5s.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Based on the identified position, apply the corresponding pattern of 6s to the output grid, using (`r`, `c`) as the starting reference point for the pattern:\n    *   If **Top-Left**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)` from (`r`, `c`).\n    *   If **Top-Right**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)` from (`r`, `c`).\n    *   If **Bottom-Left**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)` from (`r`, `c`).\n    *   If **Bottom-Right**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)` from (`r`, `c`).\n5.
