"""
Transforms a 5x5 grid containing a 3x3 block of 5s based on the block's position.

1. Initialize a new 5x5 output grid filled with zeros.
2. Scan the input 5x5 grid to find the top-left corner coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the 3x3 block of cells containing the value 5.
3. Determine the block's position based on its top-left corner (`r`, `c`):
    - Top-Left: (0, 0)
    - Top-Right: (0, 2)
    - Bottom-Left: (2, 0)
    - Bottom-Right: (2, 2)
4. Based on the identified position, apply a predefined pattern of 6s to the output grid, using (`r`, `c`) as the starting reference point for the pattern.
5. Return the completed output grid.
