Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (5x5) containing integer values.
2.  **Input Values:** The input grids primarily contain the value 0 (background) and a block of the value 5.
3.  **Output Values:** The output grids also contain the value 0, but the non-zero value is 6.
4.  **Object Identification:** The main object in the input is a solid 3x3 square composed of the value 5. The background is composed of the value 0.
5.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation acts specifically on the 3x3 block of 5s. The 0s in the input generally remain 0s in the output.
6.  **Pattern Variation:** The arrangement of 6s in the output changes depending on the position of the initial 3x3 block of 5s in the input.
7.  **Positional Dependence:** There are four distinct examples, each showing the 3x3 block starting in a different corner quadrant of the 5x5 grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each position corresponds to a unique output pattern of 6s within the space originally occupied by the 5s.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a 5x5 grid containing a 3x3 block of 5s based on the block's position."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - value_types: integer
  - object: input_block
    properties:
      - shape: 3x3 square
      - value: 5
      - location: variable (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner relative to grid)
  - object: background
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - object: output_pattern
    properties:
      - value: 6
      - shape: variable subset of a 3x3 area
      - location: corresponds to the location of the input_block
relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    subject: input_block
    object: output_pattern
    details: The specific pattern of 6s in the output depends directly on which of the four possible corner positions the input_block occupies.
actions:
  - action: identify_block_location
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (top-left row, top-left column) of the 3x3 block of 5s.
  - action: determine_block_position_type
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: block_location_coordinates
    output: classification (e.g., Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
  - action: select_output_pattern
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: block_position_type
    output: specific 3x3 pattern mask defining where 6s should be placed.
  - action: apply_pattern
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_grid, block_location_coordinates, selected_output_pattern
    output: output_grid
    details: Create an output grid initialized with 0s. Place 6s in the output grid at locations corresponding to the input block's position, following the selected pattern mask.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 5x5 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  Scan the input 5x5 grid to find the top-left corner coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the 3x3 block of cells containing the value 5.
3.  Determine the block's position based on its top-left corner (`r`, `c`):
    *   If `r` is 0 and `c` is 0, it's the **Top-Left** block.
    *   If `r` is 0 and `c` is 2, it's the **Top-Right** block.
    *   If `r` is 2 and `c` is 0, it's the **Bottom-Left** block.
    *   If `r` is 2 and `c` is 2, it's the **Bottom-Right** block.
4.  Based on the identified position, apply the corresponding pattern of 6s to the output grid, using (`r`, `c`) as the starting reference point for the pattern:
    *   If **Top-Left**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)` from (`r`, `c`).
    *   If **Top-Right**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)` from (`r`, `c`).
    *   If **Bottom-Left**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)` from (`r`, `c`).
    *   If **Bottom-Right**, place 6s at relative coordinates `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)` from (`r`, `c`).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
