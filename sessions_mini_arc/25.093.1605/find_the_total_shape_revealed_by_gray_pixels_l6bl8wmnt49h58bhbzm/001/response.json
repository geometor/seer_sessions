Initialize a new 5x5 output grid filled with zeros.\n2. Scan the input 5x5 grid to find the top-left corner coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the 3x3 block of cells containing the value 5.\n3. Determine the block's position based on its top-left corner (`r`, `c`):\n    - Top-Left: (0, 0)\n    - Top-Right: (0, 2)\n    - Bottom-Left: (2, 0)\n    - Bottom-Right: (2, 2)\n4.
