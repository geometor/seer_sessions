task_elements:
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array or matrix
      - content: cells with numerical values (colors)
      - dimensions: variable (5x5 in examples)
  - object: Cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer representing a color
  - object: Color
    properties:
      - type: integer value
      - role:
          - background (typically 0)
          - foreground (non-zero values)
relationships:
  - type: identity
    between: [input Grid.dimensions, output Grid.dimensions]
    description: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: mapping
    between: [input Cell.value, output Cell.value]
    description: The value of a cell in the output grid depends on its value in the input grid based on a global swap rule.
actions:
  - action: identify_swap_colors
    input: input Grid
    output: [color_A, color_B]
    description: Find the two unique non-zero color values present in the input grid.
  - action: swap_colors
    input: [input Grid, color_A, color_B]
    output: output Grid
    description: Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell's value is color_A, change it to color_B in the output. If it's color_B, change it to color_A. If it's 0 (or any other color not identified for swapping), keep its value unchanged.
