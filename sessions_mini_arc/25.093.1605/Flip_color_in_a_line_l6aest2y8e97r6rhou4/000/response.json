The majority of cells are 0 (background).\n2.  **Non-Zero Structures:** The non-zero values form distinct shapes or structures within the grid:\n    *   A contiguous vertical line segment (all cells have the same non-zero value).\n    *   A contiguous horizontal line segment (cells can have one or two distinct non-zero values).\n    *   A single isolated non-zero cell.\n3.  **Value Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the *values* within these identified structures, while the *positions* of the structures themselves remain largely unchanged.\n4.  **Interaction between Structures:** The transformation rules for the values within each structure seem dependent on the values present in the *other* structures. Specifically:\n    *   The new value(s) for the horizontal segment depend on the original values within that segment.\n    *   The new value for the vertical segment depends on the original value of the isolated cell.\n    *   The new value for the isolated cell depends on the original value of the vertical segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the coordinates and values of the horizontal segment (contiguous non-zero cells in a single row). Store its unique non-zero values.\n3.  Identify the coordinates and the single non-zero value (`V_val`) of the vertical segment (contiguous non-zero cells in a single column with the same value).\n4.  Identify the coordinate and the non-zero value (`I_val`) of the isolated cell (the single non-zero cell not belonging to the horizontal or vertical segments).\n5.  Determine the value transformation map for the horizontal segment:\n    *   If the horizontal segment has exactly two unique non-zero values, `A` and `B`, create a mapping: `{A: B, B: A}`.\n    *   If the horizontal segment has only one unique non-zero value, `A`, create a mapping: `{A: A}`.\n6.  Iterate through the coordinates of the horizontal segment in the input grid. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the corresponding output grid cell `output[r][c]` to the mapped value based on the input value `input[r][c]` and the mapping created in step 5.\n7.  Iterate through the coordinates of the vertical segment. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, set the corresponding output grid cell `output[r][c]` to the original value of the isolated cell (`I_val`).\n8.  Retrieve the coordinate `(r_i, c_i)` of the isolated cell. Set the output grid cell `output[r_i][c_i]` to the original value of the vertical segment (`V_val`).\n9.  Ensure all cells that were originally 0 in the input remain 0 in the output (this is handled if starting with a zero grid and only filling non-zero values, or by skipping zero cells if modifying a copy).\n10.
