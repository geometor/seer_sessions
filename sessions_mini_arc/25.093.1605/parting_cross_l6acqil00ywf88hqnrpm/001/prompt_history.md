Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is always a 5x5 grid.
*   The significant data in the input is concentrated in the top-left 2x2 corner (indices [0:2, 0:2]). The rest of the input grid appears to be filled with zeros and is irrelevant to the output.
*   The output is also a 5x5 grid.
*   The significant data in the output is concentrated in the bottom-right 3x3 corner (indices [2:5, 2:5]). The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.
*   There's a clear spatial shift of the core information from the top-left in the input to the bottom-right in the output.
*   The 2x2 input block's values are mapped to the *corners* of the 3x3 output block.
*   The non-corner cells within the 3x3 output block are filled with a constant value (5).

task_description: "Transform a 5x5 input grid by mapping its top-left 2x2 values to the corners of a 3x3 pattern placed in the bottom-right of the output grid, filling the rest of the 3x3 pattern with 5."

grid_properties:
  input_size: [5, 5]

transformation_rules:
  - action: Initialize output grid
    details: Create a 5x5 grid filled with the background_value_output (0).
  - action: Define target pattern area
    details: Identify the 3x3 subgrid at indices [2:5, 2:5] in the output grid.
  - action: Fill target pattern area
    details: Set all cells within the target_subgrid to the fill_value_output (5).
  - action: Map input corners to output corners
    details: Overwrite the corner cells of the target_subgrid with values from the source_subgrid.
    mapping:
      - input_index: [0, 0]
        output_index: [2, 2]
      - input_index: [0, 1]
        output_index: [2, 4]

        output_index: [4, 2]
      - input_index: [1, 1]
        output_index: [4, 4]

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input source_subgrid values
    to: output target_subgrid corner values
  - type: placement
    object: target_subgrid pattern
    location: bottom-right of output grid

constants:
  - name: fill_value
    value: 5
    role: Fills the non-corner elements of the output 3x3 subgrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 5x5 grid, initialized entirely with zeros, to serve as the output.
2.  Fill the 3x3 subgrid located at rows 2 through 4 and columns 2 through 4 of the output grid with the number 5.
3.  Take the value from the input grid at row 0, column 0, and place it into the output grid at row 2, column 2.
4.  Take the value from the input grid at row 0, column 1, and place it into the output grid at row 2, column 4.
5.  Take the value from the input grid at row 1, column 0, and place it into the output grid at row 4, column 2.
6.  Take the value from the input grid at row 1, column 1, and place it into the output grid at row 4, column 4.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
