Each example pair consists of an `input` grid and an `output` grid.\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   Grids have dimensions (height and width). In all examples, the grids are 5x5.\n    *   Grid cells contain binary values (0 or 1).\n    *   The arrangement of 1s within the grids forms visual patterns.\n*   **Relationships/Patterns:**\n    *   In all three examples, the `output` grid is identical, irrespective of the variations in the `input` grid.\n    *   The consistent `output` grid displays a specific pattern: a right-aligned triangle formed by 1s. The number of 1s increases by one in each subsequent row, starting from one '1' in the top row and ending with five '1's in the bottom row.\n*   **Action:** The transformation seems to disregard the content of the `input` grid and consistently generates a specific, predefined `output` grid pattern.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
