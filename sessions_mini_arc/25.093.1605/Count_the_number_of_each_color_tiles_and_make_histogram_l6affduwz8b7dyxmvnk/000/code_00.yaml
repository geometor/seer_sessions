Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    height: 5
    width: 5
    background_value: 0

Objects:
  type: Non-zero integer cells in the grid
  identifier: color (the integer value)
  properties:
    - color_value: The specific integer (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 8)
    - input_locations: List of (row, col) coordinates where the color appears in the input grid
    - total_count: The total number of times the color appears in the input grid

Transformation:
  action: Rearrangement and consolidation of objects based on color
  rules:
    - For each unique non-zero color 'c' present in the input grid:
        1. Calculate its total_count 'n'.
        2. Determine a target_row 'r' based on a fixed mapping of the color_value:
             - color 3 maps to row 0
             - color 2 maps to row 1
             - color 6 maps to row 2
             - color 8 maps to row 3
        3. In the output grid, place the color 'c' into the target_row 'r', filling 'n' cells horizontally.
        4. The placement is right-aligned, occupying columns from (grid_width - n) to (grid_width - 1).
    - All cells in the output grid not assigned a color are set to the background_value (0).
  output_grid: A new grid constructed based on these rules.

Relationships:
  - The output row for a color is solely determined by the color's value (fixed mapping).
  - The number of cells a color occupies horizontally in the output row is determined by its total count in the input grid.
