Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (5x5 in the examples) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Color Representation:** The digit 0 represents the background. Non-zero digits (2, 3, 6, 8 in the examples) represent different types of objects or "colors".
3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves rearranging the non-zero digits. The spatial positions change significantly, but the *types* of non-zero digits seem preserved, although their counts might change based on the output structure.
4.  **Output Structure:** In the output, all instances of a specific non-zero digit are grouped together horizontally within a single row. They are always aligned to the right edge of the grid.
5.  **Row Assignment:** Each unique non-zero color from the input appears to be assigned to a specific, fixed row in the output, regardless of its original position(s) in the input grid. The examples show:
    *   Color 3 always ends up in output row 0.
    *   Color 2 always ends up in output row 1.
    *   Color 6 always ends up in output row 2.
    *   Color 8 always ends up in output row 3.
6.  **Horizontal Span:** The number of cells occupied by a color in its assigned output row is equal to the total count of that color's occurrences in the *entire input grid*.

## Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    height: 5
    width: 5
    background_value: 0

Objects:
  type: Non-zero integer cells in the grid
  identifier: color (the integer value)
  properties:
    - color_value: The specific integer (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 8)
    - input_locations: List of (row, col) coordinates where the color appears in the input grid
    - total_count: The total number of times the color appears in the input grid

Transformation:
  action: Rearrangement and consolidation of objects based on color
  rules:
    - For each unique non-zero color 'c' present in the input grid:
        1. Calculate its total_count 'n'.
        2. Determine a target_row 'r' based on a fixed mapping of the color_value:
             - color 3 maps to row 0
             - color 2 maps to row 1
             - color 6 maps to row 2
             - color 8 maps to row 3
        3. In the output grid, place the color 'c' into the target_row 'r', filling 'n' cells horizontally.
        4. The placement is right-aligned, occupying columns from (grid_width - n) to (grid_width - 1).
    - All cells in the output grid not assigned a color are set to the background_value (0).
  output_grid: A new grid constructed based on these rules.

Relationships:
  - The output row for a color is solely determined by the color's value (fixed mapping).
  - The number of cells a color occupies horizontally in the output row is determined by its total count in the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (0).
2.  Identify the set of unique non-zero integer values (colors) present anywhere in the input grid.
3.  For each unique color `C` found in the input grid:
    a.  Count the total number of times `C` appears in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
    b.  Determine the specific output row `R` assigned to color `C` using the following mapping:
        *   If `C` is 3, assign `R = 0`.
        *   If `C` is 2, assign `R = 1`.
        *   If `C` is 6, assign `R = 2`.
        *   If `C` is 8, assign `R = 3`.
        *   (Assume other colors, if they were possible, would have their own row assignments or a default behavior).
    c.  If a target row `R` is determined for color `C`:
        i.  Identify the rightmost `N` column indices in the output grid. If the grid width is `W`, these columns are `W - N`, `W - N + 1`, ..., `W - 1`.
        ii. Fill the cells in the output grid at row `R` and these calculated columns with the color `C`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
