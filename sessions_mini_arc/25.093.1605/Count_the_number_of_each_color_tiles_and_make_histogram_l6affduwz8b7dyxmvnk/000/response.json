Non-zero digits (2, 3, 6, 8 in the examples) represent different types of objects or \"colors\".\n3.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation involves rearranging the non-zero digits. The spatial positions change significantly, but the *types* of non-zero digits seem preserved, although their counts might change based on the output structure.\n4.  **Output Structure:** In the output, all instances of a specific non-zero digit are grouped together horizontally within a single row. They are always aligned to the right edge of the grid.\n5.  **Row Assignment:** Each unique non-zero color from the input appears to be assigned to a specific, fixed row in the output, regardless of its original position(s) in the input grid. The examples show:\n    *   Color 3 always ends up in output row 0.\n    *   Color 2 always ends up in output row 1.\n    *   Color 6 always ends up in output row 2.\n    *   Color 8 always ends up in output row 3.\n6.  **Horizontal Span:** The number of cells occupied by a color in its assigned output row is equal to the total count of that color's occurrences in the *entire input grid*.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
