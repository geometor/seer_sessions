Schema:
  Objects:
    - Grid: A 2D array representing the input and output states.
      Properties:
        - cells: A list of lists containing integer values (0, 2, 4).
        - dimensions: (height, width) of the grid.
    - Cell: An individual element within the grid.
      Properties:
        - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
        - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
    - SourceCell: A cell in the input grid with value 4.
    - TargetCell: A cell in the input grid with value 0.
    - ObstacleCell: A cell in the input grid with a non-zero value (e.g., 4).
    - Boundary: The edges of the grid.
  Relationships:
    - ProjectionPath: A sequence of contiguous cells starting adjacent to a SourceCell and extending orthogonally (up, down, left, or right).
    - Blocking: An ObstacleCell or Boundary terminates a ProjectionPath.
  Actions:
    - Initialize Output: Create an output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
    - Identify Sources: Locate all SourceCells (value 4) in the input grid.
    - Project Influence: For each SourceCell:
        - Trace outwards in each of the four orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right).
        - For each step along the trace:
          - Check if the current position is within grid boundaries.
          - Check if the cell at the current position in the *input* grid is a TargetCell (value 0).
          - If both conditions are true:
            - Change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 2.
            - Continue tracing in the same direction.
          - If either condition is false (out of bounds or ObstacleCell encountered):
            - Stop tracing in that direction.
    - Preserve: Maintain the original values of SourceCells (4) and any TargetCells (0) not reached by a projection.
