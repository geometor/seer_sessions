Okay, analyzing the provided input-output examples.

**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of integers. The input grids contain the numbers 0 and 4. The output grids contain the numbers 0, 2, and 4. The core transformation seems to involve the number 4 influencing its neighboring cells. Specifically, cells containing 0 that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a cell containing 4 are changed to 2 in the output grid. The original 4s remain unchanged, as do 0s that are not adjacent to any 4s. The grid dimensions remain constant.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Schema:
  Objects:
    - Grid: A 2D array representing the input and output states.
      Properties:
        - cells: A list of lists containing integer values.
        - dimensions: (height, width) of the grid.
    - Cell: An individual element within the grid.
      Properties:
        - value: An integer (0, 2, or 4).
        - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
        - neighbors: Orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
  Relationships:
    - Adjacency: Cells sharing a horizontal or vertical edge.
    - Source: Cells with value 4 act as sources for transformation.
    - Target: Cells with value 0 are potential targets for transformation.
    - Effect: Cells with value 2 are the result of the transformation.
  Actions:
    - Identify: Locate all cells with value 4 in the input grid.
    - Check Neighbors: For each cell with value 4, examine its orthogonal neighbors.
    - Conditional Update: If a neighbor cell exists within the grid boundaries and has a value of 0 in the input grid, change its value to 2 in the output grid.
    - Preserve: Maintain the original values of cells containing 4 and cells containing 0 that are not adjacent to any 4s.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (output) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all values from the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the **input** grid.
3.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is 4:
    1.  Check the cell directly above (`r-1`, `c`): If this position is within the grid boundaries AND the value at `input[r-1][c]` is 0, set the value of the corresponding cell in the **output** grid (`output[r-1][c]`) to 2.
    2.  Check the cell directly below (`r+1`, `c`): If this position is within the grid boundaries AND the value at `input[r+1][c]` is 0, set the value of the corresponding cell in the **output** grid (`output[r+1][c]`) to 2.
    3.  Check the cell to the left (`r`, `c-1`): If this position is within the grid boundaries AND the value at `input[r][c-1]` is 0, set the value of the corresponding cell in the **output** grid (`output[r][c-1]`) to 2.
    4.  Check the cell to the right (`r`, `c+1`): If this position is within the grid boundaries AND the value at `input[r][c+1]` is 0, set the value of the corresponding cell in the **output** grid (`output[r][c+1]`) to 2.
4.  After checking all cells in the input grid, return the final output grid.
