The output grids contain the numbers 0, 2, and 4. The core transformation seems to involve the number 4 influencing its neighboring cells. Specifically, cells containing 0 that are orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a cell containing 4 are changed to 2 in the output grid. The original 4s remain unchanged, as do 0s that are not adjacent to any 4s. The grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
