Grid:
  type: object
  properties:
    - cells:
        type: array
        description: A 2D array representing the grid structure.
    - dimensions:
        type: tuple
        description: The height and width of the grid.
Cell:
  type: object
  properties:
    - value:
        type: integer
        description: The number contained in the cell (0 or 8).
    - position:
        type: tuple
        description: The (row, column) coordinates of the cell within the grid.
Relationships:
  - type: Alignment
    description: Cells can be aligned horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column).
  - type: Segment
    description: A sequence of adjacent cells along a row or column.
Transformation:
  action: Fill Segment
  trigger: Pairs of 8s in the input grid.
  condition: Find pairs of cells containing 8 in the *input* grid at positions (r, c1) and (r, c2) such that c1 < c2 AND all cells between them, (r, c) for c1 < c < c2, contain 0 in the *input* grid. OR Find pairs of cells containing 8 in the *input* grid at positions (r1, c) and (r2, c) such that r1 < r2 AND all cells between them, (r, c) for r1 < r < r2, contain 0 in the *input* grid.
  result: Change the value of all identified intermediate 0 cells to 8 in the output grid.
  preservation: Cells originally containing 8 in the input grid retain their value. Cells containing 0 that are not part of a fillable segment retain their value.
