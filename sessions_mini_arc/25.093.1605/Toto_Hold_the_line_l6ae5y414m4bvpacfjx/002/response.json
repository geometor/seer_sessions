            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code, based on the \"betweenness\" rule (a 0 becomes 8 only if it has 8s immediately adjacent horizontally or vertically), successfully passed Train Examples 1 and 3 but failed on Train Example 2 and Test Example 1.\n\n*   **Failure Analysis:** The failures occurred where 0s needed to be changed to 8s even though they weren't *immediately* between two 8s. Instead, they were part of a *line segment* of 0s bounded by 8s on the same row or column. For instance, in Train Example 2, the 8s at `(0, 0)` and `(3, 0)` define a vertical segment, causing `(1, 0)` and `(2, 0)` to become 8s. Similarly, `(1, 2)` and `(1, 4)` define a horizontal segment, causing `(1, 3)` to become 8. In Test Example 1, `(4, 0)` and `(4, 3)` define a horizontal segment, causing `(4, 1)` and `(4, 2)` to become 8s.\n*   **Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation rule involves finding pairs of 8s in the *input* grid that lie on the same row or column. If such a pair exists, all cells containing 0s *strictly between* these two 8s (along that row or column) are changed to 8 in the output grid. The original 8s remain unchanged.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, find all column indices containing an 8. For every pair of such indices (c1, c2) in that row, change all cells `(row, c)` from 0 to 8 where `c1 < c < c2` and `input[row, c]` was originally 0, *provided there are no other 8s between `c1` and `c2`*. A simpler way is: find pairs of 8s (c1, c2) such that *all* cells between them `input[row, c]` for `c1 < c < c2` are 0.\n    2.  Iterate through each column of the input grid. For each column, find all row indices containing an 8. For every pair of such indices (r1, r2) in that column, change all cells `(r, col)` from 0 to 8 where `r1 < r < r2` and `input[r, col]` was originally 0, *provided there are no other 8s between `r1` and `r2`*. Again, simpler: find pairs of 8s (r1, r2) such that *all* cells between them `input[r, col]` for `r1 < r < r2` are 0.\n    3.  Apply these changes to a copy of the input grid to produce the output grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's gather some specific metrics using code execution to support the revised hypothesis.\n\n"
