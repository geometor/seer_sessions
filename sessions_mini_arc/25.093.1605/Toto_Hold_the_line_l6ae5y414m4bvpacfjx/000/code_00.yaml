    description: Cells have adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

Transformation:
  action: Modify Cell Value
  condition: If a cell contains 0 AND ((the cell above it contains 8 AND the cell below it contains 8) OR (the cell to its left contains 8 AND the cell to its right contains 8)).
  result: The cell's value is changed to 8.
  preservation: Cells originally containing 8 retain their value. Cells containing 0 that do not meet the condition retain their value.
