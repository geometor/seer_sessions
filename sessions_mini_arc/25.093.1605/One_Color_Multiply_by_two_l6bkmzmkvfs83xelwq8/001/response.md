"""
Constructs a 5x5 output grid by copying specific rows from the 5x5 input grid.
- The first row of the output is a copy of the first row of the input.
- The second and third rows of the output are copies of the fourth row of the input.
- The fourth and fifth rows of the output are copies of the fifth row of the input.
