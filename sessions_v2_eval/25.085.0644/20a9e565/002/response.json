This indicates a fundamental issue, likely occurring early in the `transform` function. The potential failure points are:\n\n1.  **Gray Shape Classification:** The `classify_gray_shape` function might not be correctly identifying the 'L' and 'Z' shapes in the input grids, leading to an incorrect determination of the 'case' (L_only, Z_only, Both) or falling into the default error state.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition:** The functions `check_pattern_C_over_CCC` and `check_pattern_CCC_C0C_CCC` might be failing to find the required colored patterns even when they exist, causing the specific case logic to error out (e.g., \"Could not find color with C/CCC pattern.\").\n3.  **Case Logic Errors:** Even if shapes and patterns are identified, subsequent logic within each case (like calculating stack height, determining output dimensions, or extracting subgrids) might be flawed.\n\nThe consistent `[[0]]` output across different expected cases (L_only, Both, Z_only) suggests the problem might be in the initial shape classification or pattern detection steps that are common prerequisites.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Verify Shape Classification:** Use `tool_code` to explicitly run `find_objects` for gray (5) and then `classify_gray_shape` on the results for each example input. This will confirm if the 'L' and 'Z' shapes are being correctly identified and counted.\n2.  **Verify Pattern Recognition:** For each example, use `tool_code` to check for the existence of the specific colored patterns (`C/CCC`, `CCC/C0C/CCC`) using the relevant check functions. Identify the colors involved.\n3.  **Trace Execution:** Based on the verified shapes and patterns, determine which case *should* be triggered for each example and mentally trace or use print statements (if allowed in the environment) to see where the execution deviates in the Python code.\n4.  **Refine Logic:** Adjust the classification, pattern checking, or case-specific logic based on the discrepancies found. Pay close attention to coordinate definitions, bounding box calculations, and loop conditions.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
