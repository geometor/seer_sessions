facts:
  - item: grid
    attributes:
      - input_dimensions: [20, 20]
      - output_dimensions: [20, 20]
  - item: dividing_lines
    attributes:
      - type: complete rows and columns
      - color: red (2)
      - function: separate the grid into regions, remain unchanged in output
  - item: background_pixel
    attributes:
      - property: most frequent color excluding the dividing line color
      - role: color to be replaced during flood fill
      - example_1_color: blue (1)
      - example_2_color: yellow (4)
  - item: region
    attributes:
      - definition: area bounded by dividing lines and/or grid edges
      - interaction: processed mostly independently, except for reflection rule
  - item: initiator_pixel
    attributes:
      - definition: pixel within a region whose color is not the background color and not the dividing line color
      - role: starting point and color source for flood fill within its region
  - item: flood_fill_action
    attributes:
      - trigger: presence of initiator_pixel(s) in a region
      - process: replace contiguous background_pixels connected to an initiator_pixel with the initiator_pixel's color
      - constraints: bounded by region limits, does not replace non-background_pixels
  - item: reflection_action
    attributes:
      - trigger: bottom-left region contains no initiator_pixels
      - source_region: processed top-left region
      - transformation: vertical flip
      - target_region: bottom-left region
