Task: Grid Transformation based on Content Extraction and Scaling

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Objects: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - Background: White pixels (color 0).
  - Container_Object:
      - Property: Is a non-white object.
      - Property: Contains other non-white pixels (Content_Pixels) within its bounding box that are not its own color.
      - Property: Appears to be unique in each input example.
      - Property: Its bounding box dimensions (Height_C, Width_C) are used to determine the scaling factor.
  - Content_Pixels:
      - Property: Located within the bounding box of the Container_Object.
      - Property: Color is not white (0) and not the color of the Container_Object.
      - Property: Their relative spatial arrangement forms a smaller grid (Content_Grid).
      - Property: Dimensions of Content_Grid (Height_Cont, Width_Cont).
  - Other_Objects: Non-white objects that are not the Container_Object; seem irrelevant to the output.

Transformation_Properties:
  - Action: Identify the unique Container_Object.
  - Action: Extract the Content_Pixels within the Container_Object's bounding box.
  - Action: Determine the grid structure (Content_Grid) formed by the Content_Pixels and its dimensions (Height_Cont, Width_Cont).
  - Action: Calculate the scaling factor `S = min(Height_C, Width_C) - 1`.
  - Action: Generate an output grid of size `(Height_Cont * S) x (Width_Cont * S)`.
  - Action: Map each Content_Pixel to an `S x S` block in the output grid, preserving relative positions.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Structure: Composed of solid blocks of color.
  - Colors: Derived exclusively from the Content_Pixels of the input.
  - Dimensions: Determined by `(Height_Cont * S) x (Width_Cont * S)`.

Relationships:
  - Container_Object contains Content_Pixels.
  - Container_Object dimensions determine the Scale_Factor.
  - Content_Grid structure and colors determine the Output_Grid structure and colors.
  - Scale_Factor determines the size of the blocks in the Output_Grid and its overall dimensions relative to the Content_Grid.
