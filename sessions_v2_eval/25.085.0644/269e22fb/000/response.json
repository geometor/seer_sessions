The output grid appears to be composed of four copies of the input grid, placed in the four quadrants, with different flip transformations applied to three of them. The background color of the output grid seems to be determined by the most frequent color in the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML**:\n    "

Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid. Copy this flipped grid into the top-right region of the output grid, covering rows 0 to H-1 and columns 20-W to 19 (`output[0:H, 20-W:20]`).\n    6.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid. Copy this flipped grid into the bottom-left region of the output grid, covering rows 20-H to 19 and columns 0 to W-1 (`output[20-H:20, 0:W]`).\n    7.  Create a version of the input grid that is flipped both horizontally and vertically. Copy this doubly flipped grid into the bottom-right region of the output grid, covering rows 20-H to 19 and columns 20-W to 19 (`output[20-H:20, 20-W:20]`).\n    8.
