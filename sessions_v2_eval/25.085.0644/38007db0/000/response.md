Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input grids are larger than their corresponding output grids. The inputs appear composed of repeating structural units arranged in a larger grid format (3x3 in `train_1`, 3x4 in `train_2`).
2.  **Separators:** These structural units are separated by lines (rows and columns) of a single, consistent color (blue '1' in `train_1`, green '3' in `train_2`). This color also forms the outermost border of the entire input grid.
3.  **Unit Size:** By observing the separators, the repeating units seem to be 7x7 squares (including their borders). For instance, in `train_1`, the blue lines occur at indices 0, 6, 12, 18 for both rows and columns. The distance between these lines is 6, suggesting a 7x7 block structure (0 to 6, 6 to 12, etc.). The same pattern holds for `train_2` with green lines.
4.  **Internal Patterns:** Within the separating lines, each 7x7 unit contains its own internal border (magenta '6' in `train_1`, yellow '4' in `train_2`) and an internal pattern using other colors (yellow '4' in `train_1`, blue '1' in `train_2`). These internal patterns can vary between units within the same input grid.
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid in both examples is significantly narrower than the input but retains the same height. Visually, the output grid seems to be an exact copy of the *rightmost* column of 7x7 units from the input grid.
    *   In `train_1` (19x19 input), the output (19x7) matches columns 12 through 18 of the input.
    *   In `train_2` (19x25 input), the output (19x7) matches columns 18 through 24 of the input.
6.  **Key Action:** The core operation appears to be selecting and extracting the rightmost vertical "strip" of the input grid, where the width of this strip corresponds to the width of the repeating structural unit (7 pixels).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Determine the Unit Size**:
    *   Examine the first row (or column) of the input grid.
    *   Identify the color of the pixel at index 0 (this is the border/separator color).
    *   Find the index of the *second* occurrence of this border/separator color along that row (or column). Let this index be `S`.
    *   The width (and height) of the repeating structural unit, including its borders, is `S`.
2.  **Determine Input Dimensions**: Get the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
3.  **Calculate Extraction Column**: Calculate the starting column index for the extraction: `StartCol = W - S`.
4.  **Extract Subgrid**: Create the output grid by selecting the portion of the input grid that starts at row 0, column `StartCol`, has height `H`, and width `S`.
