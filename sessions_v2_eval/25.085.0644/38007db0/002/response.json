            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly calculated the width of the repeating unit. It relied solely on the first row to find the border color and its second occurrence, which was misleading when the first row consisted entirely of the border color. The actual transformation involves identifying a repeating structural unit (content + separator) based on vertical border lines and extracting the rightmost complete unit.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the unit detection logic:\n1.  Identify the border color (top-left pixel).\n2.  Find a row that contains non-border colors to analyze the repeating pattern. Using the second row (index 1) worked for the examples, but a more robust approach would be to find the first row containing non-border colors.\n3.  Determine the width of the content part of the pattern by finding the distance between the first two occurrences of the border color in that representative row.\n4.  Calculate the full unit width by adding 1 (for the separator column) to the content width.\n5.  Extract the rightmost columns corresponding to this full unit width.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (19, 19)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)\n    *   Border Color: 1 (blue)\n    *   Representative Row (Index 1): `1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 6 6 6 6 1`\n    *   Border Indices: `[0, 6, 12, 18]`\n    *   Content Width (Difference between first two indices): `6 - 0 = 6`\n    *   Full Unit Width (Content Width + 1): `6 + 1 = 7`\n    *   Calculated Start Column (`Input Width - Unit Width`): `19 - 7 = 12`\n    *   Calculated Output Shape: `(19, 7)` -> Matches Expected.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (19, 25)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)\n    *   Border Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Representative Row (Index 1): `3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 3`\n    *   Border Indices: `[0, 6, 12, 18, 24]`\n    *   Content Width (Difference between first two indices): `6 - 0 = 6`\n    *   Full Unit Width (Content Width + 1): `6 + 1 = 7`\n    *   Calculated Start Column (`Input Width - Unit Width`): `25 - 7 = 18`\n    *   Calculated Output Shape: `(19, 7)` -> Matches Expected.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the rows of the input grid, starting from the second row (index 1), to find the first row (`representative_row`) that contains at least one pixel whose color is different from the `border_color`. If no such row exists below the first, use the first row itself (index 0) as the `representative_row`.\n3.  Within the `representative_row`, find the column indices where the `border_color` appears.\n4.  Calculate the `content_width` by subtracting the index of the first occurrence of the `border_color` from the index of the second occurrence. If there is only one occurrence or fewer, assume the `content_width` is the total width of the grid minus 1.\n5.  Determine the `unit_width` by adding 1 to the `content_width`. This accounts for the content and the separator border column.\n6.  Determine the width `W` of the input grid.\n7.  Calculate the starting column index `start_col` for the extraction by subtracting `unit_width` from `W`.\n8.  Construct the output grid by extracting the subgrid from the input grid that includes all rows and the columns from `start_col` to the end (`W-1`).**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because its method for determining the repeating unit size was flawed. It relied only on the first row and the second occurrence of the border color, which resulted in an incorrect unit size (often 1) when the first row consisted entirely of the border color. The analysis of the failed examples and the metric calculations confirm that the transformation involves identifying a horizontally repeating structural unit (composed of content and a vertical separator) and extracting the rightmost instance of this unit.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\nThe core issue lies in correctly identifying the width of the repeating unit. The strategy is to:\n1.  Robustly identify the border/separator color.\n2.  Find a row suitable for analyzing the pattern's horizontal repetition (i.e., a row containing non-border colors).\n3.  Calculate the width of the pattern's content based on the spacing between border colors in that representative row.\n4.  Determine the full unit width (content + separator).\n5.  Extract the rightmost subgrid matching this unit width.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the `code_output` from the analysis tool:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (19, 19)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)\n    *   Border Color: 1 (blue)\n    *   Representative Row Index: 1\n    *   Content Width (from border indices [0, 6, ...]): 6\n    *   Calculated Unit Width (Content + 1): 7\n    *   Calculated Output Shape: (19, 7) -> Matches Expected.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (19, 25)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (19, 7)\n    *   Border Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Representative Row Index: 1\n    *   Content Width (from border indices [0, 6, ...]): 6\n    *   Calculated Unit Width (Content + 1): 7\n    *   Calculated Output Shape: (19, 7) -> Matches Expected.\n\nThe revised logic for calculating the unit width based on a representative row correctly predicts the output shape for both failed examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
