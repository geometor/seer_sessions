The output grid has a fixed width of 8 pixels and a height that is a multiple of 4, determined by the number of patterns found.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation involves identifying all solid and hollow 4x4 squares in the input, sorting them based on their original position, and arranging them into two columns in the output grid. Hollow squares go into the left column, and solid squares go into the right column. The vertical order within each column corresponds to the top-to-bottom order of the squares in the input grid.\n5.  **Padding:** If one type of square (hollow or solid) has fewer instances than the other, the corresponding column in the output grid is padded with 4x4 blocks of white pixels at the bottom to match the height determined by the maximum count.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record the pattern, its type (solid or hollow), and its top-left coordinates from the input grid. Ignore any 4x4 blocks that don't fit these definitions.\n3.  **Separate** the identified squares into two lists: one for hollow squares and one for solid squares.\n4.  **Sort** the list of hollow squares based first on their original top-row index, and then by their original left-column index as a tiebreaker.\n5.  **Sort** the list of solid squares using the same criteria (original top-row index, then original left-column index).\n6.  **Determine** the number of rows needed in the output grid by taking the maximum count between the number of hollow squares and the number of solid squares. The output grid height will be this maximum count multiplied by 4. The output grid width is fixed at 8.\n7.  **Construct** the output grid, initializing it with white pixels.\n8.  **Place** the sorted hollow squares into the output grid. Starting from the top row (row 0), place each 4x4 hollow square pattern into the left columns (columns 0-3) sequentially downwards.\n9.  **Place** the sorted solid squares into the output grid. Starting from the top row (row 0), place each 4x4 solid square pattern into the right columns (columns 4-7) sequentially downwards.\n10. **Ensure** any grid space remaining below the placed squares (if the counts of hollow and solid squares were unequal) remains filled with white pixels."
