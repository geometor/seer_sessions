Identify the background color (most frequent) and foreground color (other significant color) in the input grid.\n2. Find all contiguous objects composed of the foreground color pixels (using 8-way connectivity).\n3. Identify the largest object (the one containing the most pixels). If there's a tie, any of the largest can be chosen.\n4. Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing only the pixels of the selected largest object.\n5. Create an output grid whose dimensions are 2 larger (in height and width) than the bounding box of the largest object.\n6. Initialize the output grid with the background color.\n7. Draw a 1-pixel thick border around the output grid using the foreground color.\n8. Copy only the pixels belonging to the largest object into the center of the output grid (inside the border), placed relative to the object's bounding box. The color copied is the foreground color. Pixels within the central area that do not correspond to a pixel from the largest object remain the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the background (most frequent) and foreground (typically the second most frequent,\n    or the only other color) colors.\n    Handles cases with potentially more than two colors by assuming the most frequent\n    is background and the next most frequent (or only other) is foreground.\n    \"\"\"\n    colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    \n    if len(colors) == 1:\n        # Only one color present\n        return colors[0], None\n    \n    # Sort colors by frequency in descending order\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-counts)\n    sorted_colors = colors[sorted_indices]\n    sorted_counts = counts[sorted_indices]\n    \n    background_color = sorted_colors[0]\n    \n    # Foreground is typically the second color if it exists\n    if len(sorted_colors) > 1:\n        foreground_color = sorted_colors[1]\n    else:\n         # Should not happen if len(colors) > 1, but as a safeguard\n        foreground_color = None\n        \n    # Refinement: In case the 'foreground' color has very few pixels compared to background,\n    # ensure we pick the color forming the main non-background shapes.\n    # The second most frequent color usually achieves this in ARC.\n    \n    return background_color, foreground_color\n\n\ndef find_objects(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of the target_color using Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    with 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).\n    Returns a list of objects, where each object is a dictionary containing its pixels,\n    bounding box coordinates, and size.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If the pixel is the target color and hasn't been visited yet, start a BFS\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_object_pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                # Initialize bounding box for this object\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    current_object_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    # Update bounding box\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Explore 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            # Skip the center pixel itself\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                            # Check if neighbor is within grid bounds\n                            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                                # Check if neighbor is the target color and not visited\n                                if grid[nr, nc] == target_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Store the found object's details\n                if current_object_pixels:\n                    objects.append({\n                        'pixels': set(current_object_pixels), # Use set for efficient lookup if needed later\n                        'min_row': min_r, 'max_row': max_r,\n                        'min_col': min_c, 'max_col': max_c,\n                        'size': len(current_object_pixels)\n                    })\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid:\n    Extracts the largest contiguous object of the foreground color,\n    finds its bounding box, and places it centered within a\n    foreground-colored border on a background-colored grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Handle grids smaller than 1x1 (edge case)\n    if input_np.size == 0:\n        return []\n    if input_np.shape[0] == 0 or input_np.shape[1] == 0:\n         return [[]] # Or appropriate empty representation\n\n    # 1.
