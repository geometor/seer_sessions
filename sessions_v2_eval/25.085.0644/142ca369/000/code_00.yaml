identity:
  - The background color is white (0).
  - All non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved in the output grid at their original locations.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (non-white values 1-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color (same as originating pixel)
      - direction (diagonal, down and right)
      - origin (position of a non-white input pixel)
      - termination_condition (grid boundary or existing non-white pixel)
actions:
  - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - For each non-white pixel:
    - Trace a path diagonally down-right (increment row and column by 1).
    - For each step along the path:
      - Check if the target position is within grid bounds.
      - Check if the target position in the output grid is currently white (0).
      - If within bounds and target is white, color the target position with the originating pixel's color.
      - If out of bounds or target is non-white, stop tracing for the current originating pixel.
relationships:
  - Each non-white pixel in the input serves as an origin for a potential diagonal line in the output.
  - The color of the line matches the color of its origin pixel.
  - Lines are blocked by grid boundaries and any pre-existing non-white pixels in the output grid (including pixels from previously drawn lines or original input pixels).
