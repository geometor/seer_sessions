Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the two least frequent colors (excluding the background) and swapping them. This approach worked for Example 2 but failed for Example 1.

*   In Example 1, the code identified azure (8, count 7) and red (2, count 11) as the two least frequent non-background colors and swapped them. However, the expected output requires swapping azure (8, count 7) and green (3, count 12).
*   In Example 2, the code identified magenta (6, count 1) and yellow (4, count 5) as the two least frequent non-background colors and swapped them. This correctly matched the expected output.

The discrepancy in Example 1 indicates that simply using the pixel frequency count is not the correct strategy. The strategy needs refinement to account for why green was chosen instead of red in Example 1, while the frequency-based choice was correct in Example 2.

A new hypothesis is needed. Let's examine properties other than pixel count, such as the number of distinct objects of each color.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's get precise counts for pixels and objects for each non-background color in the examples.
