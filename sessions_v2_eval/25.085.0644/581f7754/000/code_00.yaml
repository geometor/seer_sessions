grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input grid is 18x8.
  - background_color: blue (1)

objects:
  - type: composite_object
    description: Connected components of non-background pixels.
    identification: Find contiguous pixels that are not blue (1).
  - type: target_object
    description: Specific composite objects containing both azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels.
    properties:
      - contains_azure: true
      - contains_yellow: true
  - type: anchor_pixel
    description: The yellow (4) pixel within a target_object.
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.
  - type: other_pixels
    description: Pixels not part of a target_object (includes background and other non-target objects/pixels like the standalone yellow pixel).

actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift
    target: target_object
    parameters:
      - direction: Based on the anchor_pixel's column index relative to the grid's vertical midpoint (column 4).
      - magnitude: 3 columns.
    condition: If anchor_pixel column < 4, shift right. If anchor_pixel column >= 4, shift left.
  - name: remain_unchanged
    target: other_pixels

relationships:
  - The anchor_pixel (yellow) determines the transformation applied to its containing target_object (azure/yellow structure).
  - The grid's width determines the midpoint column used in the shift condition.

output_construction:
  - Create a new grid initialized with the background color (blue).
  - Draw all 'other_pixels' at their original locations.
  - For each 'target_object', calculate its new position based on the horizontal_shift action and draw it in the new location.
