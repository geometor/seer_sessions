The output introduces azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a background (mostly red) with scattered yellow pixels, sometimes forming specific patterns.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, with the key difference being that certain yellow (4) pixels are changed to azure (8).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The change seems localized to specific configurations of yellow pixels. Red pixels and yellow pixels not part of these configurations remain unchanged.\n5.  **Key Pattern:** Observing the locations where yellow changes to azure across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: a 3x3 area where the center pixel and its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all yellow (4). It looks like a plus sign (+) made of 5 yellow pixels.\n6.  **Action:** When this yellow plus pattern is detected in the input, all five yellow pixels that constitute the plus shape are changed to azure (8) in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index (r, c), excluding the border pixels (as they cannot be the center of a 3x3 pattern). Specifically, iterate for rows from 1 to height-2 and columns from 1 to width-2.\n3.  For each pixel at (r, c), check if it forms the center of a yellow plus pattern (+):\n    *   Verify that the pixel at (r, c) is yellow (4).\n    *   Verify that the pixel above it at (r-1, c) is yellow (4).\n    *   Verify that the pixel below it at (r+1, c) is yellow (4).\n    *   Verify that the pixel to its left at (r, c-1) is yellow (4).\n    *   Verify that the pixel to its right at (r, c+1) is yellow (4).\n4.  If all five conditions in step 3 are met, then update the colors in the output grid for all five corresponding pixel locations ( (r, c), (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) ) to azure (8).\n5.  After checking all possible center pixels, return the final output grid."
