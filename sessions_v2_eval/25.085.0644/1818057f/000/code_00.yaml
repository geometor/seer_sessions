elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - consists of pixels with colors (red: 2, yellow: 4, azure: 8)
      - dimensions vary across examples
  - object: pattern
    definition: A 3x3 area centered on a pixel (r, c).
    properties:
      - target_color: yellow (4)
      - shape: plus sign (+)
      - components:
          - center pixel (r, c)
          - north neighbor (r-1, c)
          - south neighbor (r+1, c)
          - west neighbor (r, c-1)
          - east neighbor (r, c+1)
      - condition: All five component pixels must be yellow (4).
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    input: input grid
    target: the yellow plus pattern (+)
    description: Scan the grid to find all occurrences where a pixel and its four cardinal neighbors are all yellow (4).
  - name: change_color
    input: pixels identified by 'identify_pattern'
    from_color: yellow (4)
    to_color: azure (8)
    output: modified grid
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - A pixel's color changes from yellow (4) to azure (8) *if and only if* it is part of the identified yellow plus pattern (+).
  - All other pixels (red pixels, and yellow pixels not part of the pattern) retain their original color.
