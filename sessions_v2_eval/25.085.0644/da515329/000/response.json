These azure pixels often form simple shapes or clusters.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They also have a white (0) background but contain significantly more azure (8) pixels than the inputs.\n3.  **Transformation:** The azure pixels in the output appear to be generated based on the positions of the azure pixels in the input. Specifically, lines or rays of azure pixels seem to emanate horizontally and vertically from each input azure pixel. These rays extend outwards until they either reach the boundary of the grid or encounter the row or column of another *original* azure pixel from the input. The original input azure pixels are also present in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Store these as a set of \"source coordinates\".\n3.

Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).\n    b.  **Trace Up:** Starting from the pixel directly above the source `(r-1, c)`, move upwards row by row towards row 0. For each pixel `(i, c)` encountered:\n        i.   Check if the coordinate `(i, c)` exists within the set of source coordinates identified in step 2.\n        ii.  If it does, stop tracing upwards from this source.\n        iii. If it does not, set the pixel `(i, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).

For each pixel `(i, c)` encountered:\n        i.   Check if `(i, c)` is a source coordinate.\n        ii.  If it is, stop tracing downwards.\n        iii. If not, set `(i, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).

For each pixel `(r, j)` encountered:\n        i.   Check if `(r, j)` is a source coordinate.\n        ii.  If it is, stop tracing leftwards.\n        iii. If not, set `(r, j)` in the output grid to azure (8).
