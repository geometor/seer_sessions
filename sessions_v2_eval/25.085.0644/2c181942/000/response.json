            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of varying sizes, filled with integer values representing colors.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in all input and output grids is azure (8), acting as the background.\n3.  **Objects:** Scattered across the input grids are pixels and contiguous groups of pixels (objects) with colors other than azure (blue, red, green, yellow, magenta, orange).\n4.  **Transformation Observation:** Comparing input and output grids reveals that the non-azure objects change their vertical positions. They appear to move downwards.\n5.  **Movement Constraint:** The movement is strictly vertical (within the same column). Objects do not shift horizontally.\n6.  **Stopping Condition:** Objects stop moving downwards when they either reach the bottom edge of the grid or encounter another non-azure object directly below them within the same column.\n7.  **Stacking Behavior:** Objects stack vertically on top of each other within their original columns.\n8.  **Object Integrity:** The shapes, colors, and relative vertical order (within a column) of the non-azure pixels are preserved during the transformation. No pixels are added, removed, or change color.\n9.  **Overall Effect:** The transformation simulates the effect of gravity acting independently on each column, causing all non-background elements to settle at the lowest possible positions within their respective columns.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (index `c` from 0 to width-1).\n3.  For the current column `c`, determine the target row index `target_r` for placing the next non-background pixel found. Initialize `target_r` to the last row index (height-1).\n4.  Iterate through the rows of the current input column `c` from bottom to top (index `r` from height-1 down to 0).\n5.  At each position `(r, c)` in the input grid, check if the pixel color is not the background color (azure - 8).\n6.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is not the background color:\n    *   Copy the color of the input pixel `(r, c)` to the output grid at position `(target_r, c)`.\n    *   Decrement the `target_r` index by 1 (moving the target placement position one row up for the next non-background pixel found in this column).\n7.  After processing all rows for the current column `c`, move to the next column.\n8.  Once all columns have been processed, the output grid contains the transformed result."
