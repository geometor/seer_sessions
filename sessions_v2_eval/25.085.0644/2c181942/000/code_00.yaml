task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (pixels) representing colors.
  background_color: azure (8).
  grid_dimensions: variable (up to 30x30).

elements:
  - element_type: background
    color: azure (8)
    behavior: static, fills empty space.
  - element_type: object_pixel
    color: any color except azure (8)
    behavior: subject to gravity.

actions:
  - action_name: apply_gravity
    target: object_pixel
    effect: move pixel vertically downwards within its column.
    constraints:
      - stops at the bottom boundary of the grid.
      - stops immediately above the highest object_pixel already settled in that column.

relationships:
  - relationship_type: vertical_stacking
    elements: [object_pixel, object_pixel]
    condition: Occurs when a falling object_pixel encounters another object_pixel directly below it in the same column.
    effect: The falling object_pixel stops in the cell directly above the encountered pixel.
  - relationship_type: column_independence
    elements: [columns]
    condition: Gravity acts independently on each column.
    effect: The movement of pixels in one column does not affect the movement or final position of pixels in other columns.
