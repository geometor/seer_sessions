            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt generated code based on observations from a single example. The code failed due to an environment issue (`No module named 'scipy'`), but more importantly, the underlying logic needs validation against all provided training examples. The core idea seems to involve identifying a 'pattern' object and 'marker' locations and then replicating the pattern at these locations.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Analyze *all* training examples provided (input and expected output).\n2.  Identify commonalities and differences in the transformations across examples.\n3.  Verify or refute the assumptions made previously:\n    *   Background color is the most frequent color.\n    *   The largest non-background object is the 'pattern'.\n    *   The color of the smallest non-background object(s) identifies 'marker' locations.\n    *   The pattern is copied such that its *bounding box center* aligns with each marker pixel.\n    *   The original instance of the pattern object is always preserved in the output.\n4.  Refine the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation rule derived from the complete set of examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example to gather metrics and compare against the expected output. We'll assume the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `scipy`) are available for analysis.\n\n**Example 1 (d43fd935):**\n\n*   **Input:** 10x10 grid. Background: white (0). Objects: Blue L-shape (size 5), Red dot (size 1).\n*   **Assumptions:** Pattern = Blue L-shape (largest). Marker color = Red (smallest object). Marker location = (4, 4). BBox center of L = (1, 1) relative to its top-left (1,1). Target top-left for copy = (4-1, 4-1) = (3, 3).\n*   **Expected Output:** 10x10 grid. Background: white (0). Original Blue L-shape at (1,1) to (3,3). A *new* Blue L-shape is placed starting at (3,3), centered around the original red dot position (4,4).\n*   **Observation:** The logic holds for this example. The original pattern is preserved. A copy is placed, centered on the marker location.\n\n**Example 2 (780d0b14):**\n\n*   **Input:** 13x13 grid. Background: white (0). Objects: Green complex shape (size 25), Yellow dot (size 1).\n*   **Assumptions:** Pattern = Green shape (largest). Marker color = Yellow (smallest object). Marker location = (6, 6). BBox center of Green shape (relative to its top-left 1,1) is approx (5, 5). Target top-left for copy = (6-5, 6-5) = (1, 1).\n*   **Expected Output:** 13x13 grid. Background: white (0). Original Green shape. A *new* Green shape placed starting at (1,1), centered around the original yellow dot position (6,6). This *overwrites* the original green shape.\n*   **Observation:** The logic seems to hold. The placement causes overlap/overwriting, which is consistent with the previous code's step 8c. The original pattern *appears* preserved because the copy overlaps it perfectly.\n\n**Example 3 (b7a873dc):**\n\n*   **Input:** 16x16 grid. Background: white (0). Objects: Red complex shape (size 39), Blue dot (size 1), Orange dot (size 1).\n*   **Assumptions:** Pattern = Red shape (largest). Smallest objects are Blue dot and Orange dot (both size 1). This introduces ambiguity: which is the marker color? Let's assume *all* colors corresponding to the minimum size are marker colors. Marker colors = Blue, Orange. Marker locations = (6, 9) [Blue], (10, 4) [Orange]. BBox center of Red shape (relative to top-left 1,2) is approx (6, 5).\n    *   For Blue marker (6, 9): Target top-left = (6-6, 9-5) = (0, 4).\n    *   For Orange marker (10, 4): Target top-left = (10-6, 4-5) = (4, -1).\n*   **Expected Output:** 16x16 grid. Background: white (0). Original Red shape. A *new* Red shape placed starting at (0, 4) (centered on original blue dot). Another *new* Red shape placed starting at (4, -1) -> effectively starting at (4, 0) due to clipping (centered on original orange dot).\n*   **Observation:** The logic appears to hold, assuming *all* pixels matching the color(s) of the smallest object(s) serve as markers. Clipping at the grid boundaries is necessary.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

The examples don't cover this, but the logic implies it would copy itself centered on its own pixels, likely resulting in a slightly shifted/expanded version or no visible change if placement aligns perfectly.\n  - Pattern placement near edges results in clipping; only parts of the pattern within the grid boundaries are drawn.\n  - If multiple objects share the largest size, the choice of pattern_object might matter (not seen in examples).\n  - If multiple objects share the smallest size but have different colors, all their colors become marker_colors (seen in Example 3).\n```"

Record their color, size (pixel count), pixel coordinates, and bounding boxes.\n3.  **Identify Pattern Object:** Find the object with the largest size. This is the 'pattern object'. Store its color and its shape (the coordinates of its pixels relative to its bounding box's top-left corner). Calculate the relative center of the pattern object's *bounding box* (`center_row = bbox_height // 2`, `center_col = bbox_width // 2`).\n4.  **Identify Marker Colors:** Find the minimum size among all non-background objects. Identify all distinct colors associated with objects of this minimum size. These are the 'marker colors'.\n5.  **Find Marker Locations:** Locate all pixels in the *original input grid* that have any of the identified 'marker colors'. These are the 'marker locations'.\n6.  **Initialize Output:** Create the output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.\n7.  **Stamp Pattern Copies:** For each 'marker location' `(marker_row, marker_col)` found in step 5:\n    a.  Calculate the target top-left coordinate `(target_top_left_row, target_top_left_col)` on the output grid where the pattern copy should start. This is determined by aligning the pattern's relative bounding box center (calculated in step 3) with the marker location: `target_top_left_row = marker_row - center_row`, `target_top_left_col = marker_col - center_col`.\n    b.  Iterate through each relative pixel coordinate `(rel_row, rel_col)` defining the pattern's shape (from step 3).\n    c.  Calculate the destination coordinate `(dest_row, dest_col)` on the output grid: `dest_row = target_top_left_row + rel_row`, `dest_col = target_top_left_col + rel_col`.\n    d.  Check if the destination coordinate `(dest_row, dest_col)` is within the bounds of the output grid.\n    e.  If it is within bounds, set the color of the pixel at `(dest_row, dest_col)` in the output grid to the pattern object's color. This overwrites any existing color at that location.\n8.  **Final Output:** The modified grid after stamping all pattern copies is the final output."
