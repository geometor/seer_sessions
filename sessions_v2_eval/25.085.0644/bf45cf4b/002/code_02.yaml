facts:
  - description: "Task involves tiling based on two structures identified in the input grid."
    properties:
      background_color: "The most frequent color in the input grid."
      structures: "Two distinct groups of non-background pixels, identifiable by the sets of colors they contain."

  - description: "One structure serves as a pattern tile source."
    properties:
      role: "Provides the repeating unit for the output grid."
      identification_criterion: "The structure whose bounding box contains the minimum number of background pixels."
      bounding_box: "The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to this structure's color set."
      tile_data: "The rectangular region of the input grid defined by the pattern structure's bounding box (can include background pixels)."
      pattern_height_ph: "Height of the pattern structure's bounding box."
      pattern_width_pw: "Width of the pattern structure's bounding box."
      colors: "The set of non-background colors making up this structure."

  - description: "The second structure serves as a control object."
    properties:
      role: "Determines the number of times the pattern tile is repeated."
      identification_criterion: "The structure whose bounding box contains more background pixels (or equal if counts match, though unlikely given examples)."
      bounding_box: "The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to this structure's color set."
      control_height_ch: "Height of the control structure's bounding box. Determines vertical tiling count."
      control_width_cw: "Width of the control structure's bounding box. Determines horizontal tiling count."
      colors: "The set of non-background colors making up this structure."

  - description: "Identifying the two structures requires partitioning non-background colors."
    properties:
      step_1: "Find all unique non-background colors present."
      step_2: "Determine the two distinct sets of colors corresponding to the two structures (e.g., partition based on spatial separation or other heuristics if not obvious)."
      step_3: "For each color set, find all pixel coordinates matching those colors."
      step_4: "Calculate the bounding box for each set of coordinates."
      step_5: "Count background pixels within each bounding box to distinguish pattern from control."

  - description: "The transformation is constructing the output by tiling."
    properties:
      output_grid_height: "control_height_ch * pattern_height_ph"
      output_grid_width: "control_width_cw * pattern_width_pw"
      process: "Repeat the pattern_tile_data `ch` times vertically and `cw` times horizontally."
