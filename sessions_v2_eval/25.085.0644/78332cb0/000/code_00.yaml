facts:
  - item: grid
    attributes:
      - contains_pixels: yes
      - pixels_have_colors: yes, 0-9
      - background_color: orange (7) is common but not universal
      - foreground_objects: contiguous blocks of non-background color
  - item: separator
    attributes:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - shape: horizontal row or vertical column spanning the grid
      - function: divides the grid into distinct rectangular subgrids (blocks)
  - item: block
    attributes:
      - shape: rectangular subgrid
      - location: defined by separator lines
      - content: pixels forming patterns, typically surrounded by a background color (like orange 7)
  - process: transformation
    actions:
      - identify_separators: find all full rows and columns of magenta (6) pixels.
      - determine_segmentation_type: check if separators are horizontal, vertical, or both.
      - extract_blocks: isolate the rectangular subgrids defined by the separators, excluding the separators themselves. Keep track of original position (e.g., row/column index or TL/TR/BL/BR label for 2x2 case).
      - determine_output_orientation:
        - if input separators are horizontal only, output orientation is horizontal.
        - if input separators are vertical only, output orientation is vertical.
        - if input separators are both, output orientation is vertical.
      - determine_block_order:
        - if output is horizontal (input was horizontal): order blocks by decreasing original row index (bottom-up).
        - if output is vertical (input was vertical): order blocks by increasing original column index (left-to-right).
        - if output is vertical (input was both): order blocks by sequence TL, BR, TR, BL based on original position.
      - assemble_output:
        - create a new grid.
        - place the blocks in the determined order and orientation.
        - insert separators between blocks:
          - if output is vertical, insert a single horizontal row of magenta (6) pixels between blocks.
          - if output is horizontal, insert a single vertical column of magenta (6) pixels between blocks.
