Each inner block contains mostly white (0) pixels and a single column of a distinct color (blue-1, magenta-6, yellow-4, red-2).\n    *   The column index of the non-white color within each key block seems significant. These columns are 1, 7, 13, and 19.\n    *   The data section contains larger regions of various colors (green-3, blue-1, yellow-4, red-2) and a small 2x2 azure (8) square.\n    *   The output grid corresponds exactly in size to the data section of the input grid (19x24). The key section is discarded.\n    *   The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels within the data section. Comparing the input's data section to the output grid, many green (3) pixels have become azure (8).\n    *   The change from green (3) to azure (8) occurs *only* in the columns identified from the key section (columns 1, 7, 13, 19). However, the change only applies if the original pixel was green (3). Other colors in these columns (like blue-1 in col 1, yellow-4 in col 19, and the original azure-8 in col 13) remain unchanged. Pixels outside these specific columns also remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
