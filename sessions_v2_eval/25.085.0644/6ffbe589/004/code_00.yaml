task_description: Transforms an input grid by focusing on the main non-white object and generating an output grid based on its bounding box and modified content.

definitions:
  - name: component
    description: A set of connected non-white pixels. Connectivity is 8-way (includes diagonals).
  - name: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a component. Defined by (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - name: bbox_area
    description: The area of the bounding box (height * width). height = max_row - min_row + 1, width = max_col - min_col + 1.
  - name: target_component
    description: The single component selected for the transformation.
  - name: input_crop
    description: The portion of the input grid extracted based on the target_component's bounding_box.

observations:
  - step_1_selection:
      description: Identify all 8-way connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
      evidence: Analysis of examples shows multiple components can exist.
  - step_2_criterion:
      description: Select the component with the largest bounding_box area as the target_component.
      evidence: In all examples, the component with max bbox_area corresponds spatially and dimensionally to the expected output. Pixel count is also maximal for this component, but bbox_area is the confirmed criterion matching output dimensions.
      metric: |
        Example 1: Max BBox Area = 169 (Component 1) -> Output Size 13x13
        Example 2: Max BBox Area = 100 (Component 1) -> Output Size 10x10
        Example 3: Max BBox Area = 100 (Component 1) -> Output Size 10x10
  - step_3_bounding_box:
      description: Determine the bounding_box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of the target_component.
      evidence: The coordinates calculated match the required output dimensions.
  - step_4_output_dimensions:
      description: The output grid has the same height and width as the target_component's bounding_box.
      evidence: Consistent across all examples.
  - step_5_content_origin:
      description: The content of the output grid is derived from the content of the input grid within the target_component's bounding_box (the input_crop).
      evidence: The output retains colors and general structure from the input_crop.
  - step_6_content_modification:
      description: The input_crop is modified pixel-by-pixel to produce the final output grid. This modification is not a simple copy, mask, or uniform filter.
      evidence: Comparison between `Transformed Output` (which is the input_crop) and `Expected Output` shows differences where pixels change value (0 to non-0, non-0 to 0, potentially non-0 to different non-0).
      details: The specific rule for pixel modification is not yet determined but appears to depend on local context within the input_crop.
