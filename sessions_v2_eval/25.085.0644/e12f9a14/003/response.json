The projection extends outwards in the four cardinal directions\n(up, down, left, right) from each source pixel. The projection stops if it hits a green 3 pixel,\nanother non-azure 8 pixel, or the grid boundary. Green 3 pixels and original source pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIf an azure 8 pixel can be reached by projections from multiple source pixels, the final color is determined\nby the nearest source pixel. If there's a tie in distance between a vertical (up/down) projection and a\nhorizontal (left/right) projection, the vertical projection takes precedence. If there's a tie in distance\nbetween two vertical projections (up vs down) or two horizontal projections (left vs right), the projection\noriginating from the source pixel with the smaller row index (for vertical ties) or smaller column index\n(for horizontal ties) takes precedence. If row/column indices are also the same (which shouldn't happen\nfor distinct sources affecting the same pixel), the 'up' direction beats 'down', and 'left' beats 'right'.\nEffectively, search order up, down, left, right determines the winner in case of equidistant sources.\n\nThe transformation logic involves:\n1. Initializing the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterating through each pixel of the grid.\n3. If a pixel is azure (8), search outwards in the four cardinal directions to find the nearest source pixel(s).\n4. The search stops upon encountering a green (3) boundary, another non-azure (8) pixel, or the grid edge.\n5. Record the color and distance of the nearest source found in each direction.\n6. Determine the final color for the azure pixel based on the minimum distance, prioritizing vertical sources in case of a tie.\n7. Update the corresponding pixel in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the color projection transformation with boundary constraints and conflict resolution.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = input_grid_np.copy()\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    background_color = 8\n    boundary_color = 3\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel to potentially fill if it's background\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Only modify background pixels\n            if input_grid_np[r, c] == background_color:\n                \n                # Store potential source colors and their distances for this pixel\n                # (color, distance, source_row, source_col, is_vertical)\n                potential_sources = []\n\n                # Search Up\n                for row_idx in range(r - 1, -1, -1):\n                    color = input_grid_np[row_idx, c]\n                    if color != background_color and color != boundary_color:\n                        potential_sources.append({'color': color, 'dist': r - row_idx, 'source_r': row_idx, 'source_c': c, 'is_vertical': True})\n                        break # Found nearest source in this direction\n                    elif color == boundary_color:\n                        break # Hit boundary\n                    # Continue if background_color\n                \n                # Search Down\n                for row_idx in range(r + 1, height):\n                    color = input_grid_np[row_idx, c]\n                    if color != background_color and color != boundary_color:\n                        potential_sources.append({'color': color, 'dist': row_idx - r, 'source_r': row_idx, 'source_c': c, 'is_vertical': True})\n                        break \n                    elif color == boundary_color:\n                        break\n                        \n                # Search Left\n                for col_idx in range(c - 1, -1, -1):\n                    color = input_grid_np[r, col_idx]\n                    if color != background_color and color != boundary_color:\n                        potential_sources.append({'color': color, 'dist': c - col_idx, 'source_r': r, 'source_c': col_idx, 'is_vertical': False})\n                        break\n                    elif color == boundary_color:\n                        break\n                        \n                # Search Right\n                for col_idx in range(c + 1, width):\n                    color = input_grid_np[r, col_idx]\n                    if color != background_color and color != boundary_color:\n                        potential_sources.append({'color': color, 'dist': col_idx - c, 'source_r': r, 'source_c': col_idx, 'is_vertical': False})\n                        break\n                    elif color == boundary_color:\n                        break\n\n                # Determine the winning color based on rules\n                if not potential_sources:\n                    continue # No source found, pixel remains background\n\n                min_dist = min(s['dist'] for s in potential_sources)\n                \n                # Filter sources with the minimum distance\n                closest_sources = [s for s in potential_sources if s['dist'] == min_dist]\n\n                # Prioritize vertical sources\n                vertical_winners = [s for s in closest_sources if s['is_vertical']]\n                horizontal_winners = [s for s in closest_sources if not s['is_vertical']]\n\n                winner = None\n                if vertical_winners:\n                    # If multiple vertical winners, choose based on row index, then use original order (up first)\n                    winner = min(vertical_winners, key=lambda s: s['source_r'])\n                elif horizontal_winners:\n                     # If multiple horizontal winners, choose based on col index, then use original order (left first)\n                    winner = min(horizontal_winners, key=lambda s: s['source_c'])\n                \n                if winner:\n                   output_grid[r, c] = winner['color']\n\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
