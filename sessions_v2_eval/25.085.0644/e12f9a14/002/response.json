            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code implemented a basic color projection rule where \"source\" colors (not azure 8 or green 3) projected outwards indefinitely in cardinal directions, overwriting everything in their path. The results clearly show this is incorrect. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs, primarily because the projection in the expected outputs seems to be constrained.\n\nComparing the inputs and expected outputs across all examples reveals a pattern:\n1.  **Source Pixels:** Colors other than azure (8) and green (3) act as sources.\n2.  **Boundaries:** Green (3) pixels act as boundaries or containers.\n3.  **Background:** Azure (8) pixels are the background that gets filled.\n4.  **Projection:** Source colors project outwards (up, down, left, right).\n5.  **Stopping Condition:** The projection seems to stop *just before* hitting a green (3) pixel or the grid boundary. The green pixels themselves are preserved.\n6.  **Conflict Resolution:** When projections from different source pixels overlap on a background pixel, there seems to be a rule determining the final color. Observing Example 1 suggests vertical projections might take precedence over horizontal ones.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the projection logic to incorporate the green boundary stopping condition and the observed conflict resolution rule.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
