            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background:** Each example seems to have a dominant background color (white, orange, blue) that mostly remains unchanged, except where objects move over it.\n3.  **Objects:** There are multiple distinct objects (contiguous blocks of a single color) in each input grid, superimposed on the background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves one object (\"mover\") moving across the grid towards another object (\"barrier\") until they become adjacent.\n5.  **Movement Trail:** As the mover object traverses the grid, it leaves a \"trail\" behind it, changing the color of the background cells it passes over.\n6.  **Trail Color:** The color of the trail appears to be determined by the colors involved. In most examples (2, 3, 4, 5), the trail color matches the mover object's color. However, in Example 1, the trail color matches the barrier object's color (Yellow, 4). This suggests a special rule: if the barrier object is Yellow (4), the trail is Yellow (4); otherwise, the trail is the same color as the mover object.\n7.  **Stopping Condition:** The movement ceases precisely when any part of the mover object becomes adjacent (including diagonally) to any part of the barrier object.\n8.  **Movement Direction:** The mover object consistently moves in a direction that reduces the distance to the barrier object. This can be straight (horizontal/vertical) or diagonal. If multiple single steps reduce the distance equally, the tie seems to be broken by preferring diagonal moves (or moves with a larger change in both row and column).\n9.  **Identifying Roles (Mover/Barrier/Ignored):**\n    *   Typically, there are three non-background colors. One acts as the mover, one as the barrier, and one is ignored (remains static).\n    *   The ignored object seems to be the one whose color/object is initially \"furthest\" or most separated from the other two.\n    *   The mover and barrier objects are the pair that are initially closest to each other (minimum distance between any pixel of one object and any pixel of the other).\n    *   By comparing the input and output, we can determine which of the interacting pair is the mover (the one whose position changes) and which is the barrier (the one that stays stationary and acts as the destination).\n10. **Final State:** The output grid contains the background, the stationary ignored object(s), the stationary barrier object, the trail left by the mover, and the mover object in its final position adjacent to the barrier.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
