This means the code could not be parsed or executed, so we haven't yet tested the underlying logic against the examples. The error message indicates an unclosed dictionary literal (`{...`) somewhere in the code. Although the error is reported at line 311, the actual mistake might be earlier, as the parser sometimes only detects the imbalance later on.\n2.  **Likely Location**: Based on a review of the code, a potential candidate for the unclosed brace is the `region_map` dictionary literal within the `pair_frames_contents` function (around lines 210-215 in the provided snippet).\n    ```"
