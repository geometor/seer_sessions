  example_1:
    input_grid_shape: [20, 15]
    output_grid_shape: [6, 12]
    objects:
      - type: frame
        color: blue (1)
        location: top-left area
        internal_pixels:
          - color: azure (8) # Placeholder
            pattern: square-like shape
          - color: blue (1) # Content
            pattern: small internal square shape
      - type: frame
        color: yellow (4)
        location: top-right area
        internal_pixels:
          - color: azure (8) # Placeholder
            pattern: square-like shape
          - color: yellow (4) # Content
            pattern: small internal cross shape
      - type: frame
        color: red (2)
        location: bottom-left area
        internal_pixels:
          - color: azure (8) # Placeholder
            pattern: square-like shape
          - color: red (2) # Content
            pattern: small internal 'H' shape
      - type: frame
        color: green (3)
        location: bottom-right area
        internal_pixels:
          - color: azure (8) # Placeholder
            pattern: square-like shape
          - color: green (3) # Content
            pattern: small internal checkerboard shape
      - type: background/separator
        color: azure (8)
        location: large areas between and around frames
    transformation:
      - action: identify_frames
        description: Locate hollow rectangular objects.
      - action: identify_internal_pixels
        description: For each frame, find pixels within its bounding box but not part of the border.
      - action: identify_placeholder_color
        input: internal pixels of all frames
        output: azure (8)
        criteria: Color that exists within the internal areas of multiple frames and is replaced in the output. It's the only color completely removed from the input grid.
      - action: identify_content_color
        input: internal pixels of a single frame
        output: The color within the internal pixels that is NOT the placeholder color (e.g., blue(1) for the blue frame).
      - action: replace_placeholder
        description: Within each frame's internal area, replace all pixels of the placeholder color (azure 8) with the frame's specific content color.
        input_frame_internal_example (blue frame): pixels are azure(8) and blue(1)
        output_frame_internal_example (blue frame): pixels are blue(1) and blue(1) # Azure 8 replaced by Blue 1
      - action: assemble_output
        description: Arrange the transformed frames in a new grid, maintaining their relative spatial layout from the input. Discard original background/separator pixels.
  example_2:
    input_grid_shape: [30, 30]
    output_grid_shape: [16, 16]
    objects:
      - type: frame # Multiple frames exist (yellow, green, azure, blue, etc.)
        # Details omitted for brevity, but structure is similar:
        # Frame border color (C_frame), internal pixels contain Placeholder (P) and Content (C_content) patterns.
      - type: background/separator
        color: red (2)
        location: large areas between and around frames
    transformation:
      - action: identify_frames
        description: Locate hollow rectangular objects.
      - action: identify_internal_pixels
        description: For each frame, find pixels within its bounding box but not part of the border.
      - action: identify_placeholder_color
        input: internal pixels of all frames
        output: red (2)
        criteria: Color that exists within the internal areas of multiple frames and is replaced in the output. It's the only color completely removed from the input grid.
      - action: identify_content_color
        input: internal pixels of a single frame
        output: The color within the internal pixels that is NOT the placeholder color (e.g., maroon(9) for the yellow frame).
      - action: replace_placeholder
        description: Within each frame's internal area, replace all pixels of the placeholder color (red 2) with the frame's specific content color.
        input_frame_internal_example (yellow frame): pixels are red(2) and maroon(9)
        output_frame_internal_example (yellow frame): pixels are maroon(9) and maroon(9) # Red 2 replaced by Maroon 9
      - action: assemble_output
        description: Arrange the transformed frames in a new grid, maintaining their relative spatial layout from the input. Discard original background/separator pixels.
