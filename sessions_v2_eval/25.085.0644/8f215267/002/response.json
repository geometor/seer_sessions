            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue is a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy'`, which prevented the code from executing against the training examples. Therefore, we cannot verify the correctness of the implemented logic based on execution results.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Acknowledge the execution failure and its cause (missing dependency).\n2. Re-evaluate the transformation logic described in the Python code's docstring and implementation against all provided training examples *manually*.\n3. Refine the understanding and the natural language program based on this manual analysis, assuming the core logic derived previously is the intended path.\n4. Note the dependency on `scipy` (specifically for `label` and `find_objects`) which might need alternative implementation if the target environment lacks it.\n\n## Metrics and Observations (Based on Manual Analysis of Logic)\n\nSince code execution failed, we cannot generate metrics programmatically. However, we can describe the expected objects and properties based on the logic defined in the Python code and manual inspection of the examples (assuming access to the task examples).\n\n**General Observations:**\n*   **Background:** Each grid has a dominant background color. The parity of this color's value is important.\n*   **Objects:** The key objects are hollow rectangles formed by a single non-background color. These rectangles have a border exactly one pixel thick, and their interior contains only the background color in the input.\n*   **Action:** The transformation involves two main actions applied to each identified hollow rectangle:\n    1.  **Preservation:** The border of the rectangle is copied to the output grid.\n    2.  **Pattern Application:** A pattern is drawn on the horizontal midline of the rectangle's *internal* area. The pattern consists of pixels matching the rectangle's color, placed only in columns whose index parity matches the background color's parity.\n\n**Example-Specific Metrics (Inferred from Logic):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: e.g., 6x6\n    *   Background Color: White (0), Parity: 0 (Even)\n    *   Objects: One hollow Red (2) rectangle.\n    *   Action: Draw Red border. Fill points on the internal horizontal midline in even-indexed columns (strictly inside the border) with Red.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: e.g., 8x7\n    *   Background Color: Gray (5), Parity: 1 (Odd)\n    *   Objects: One hollow Blue (1) rectangle.\n    *   Action: Draw Blue border. Fill points on the internal horizontal midline in odd-indexed columns (strictly inside the border) with Blue.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: e.g., 14x13\n    *   Background Color: White (0), Parity: 0 (Even)\n    *   Objects:\n        *   One hollow Green (3) rectangle.\n        *   One hollow Yellow (4) rectangle.\n    *   Action (Green): Draw Green border. Fill points on the internal horizontal midline in even-indexed columns (strictly inside the border) with Green.\n    *   Action (Yellow): Draw Yellow border. Fill points on the internal horizontal midline in even-indexed columns (strictly inside the border) with Yellow.\n\n*(Note: Actual grid sizes and precise rectangle coordinates depend on the specific task data, which should be available in the session history).*\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
