*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger, square output grid. The input grids consist of horizontal stripes of solid colors. The output grids exhibit a pattern of nested square frames or layers, where the colors seem derived from the input stripes. The size of the output grid appears related to the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid is square, and its side length `D` seems to be calculated as `max(input_height, input_width) * 2 - 2`. The color of each pixel in the output grid appears to be determined by its "depth" or distance from the nearest edge, corresponding to the color of an input row at that index.

    task_description: Transform an input grid of horizontal color stripes into a larger square output grid with nested frames.

    elements:
      - element: input_grid
        properties:
          - height: H
          - width: W
          - content: Grid containing horizontal stripes, where each row `i` typically has a uniform color `Ci`.
      - element: output_grid
        properties:
          - height: D
          - width: D
          - relationship_to_input: D = max(H, W) * 2 - 2
          - content: Square grid composed of nested frames or layers.

    transformation:
      - action: determine_output_size
        input: input_grid dimensions (H, W)
        output: output_grid dimension D = max(H, W) * 2 - 2
      - action: create_output_grid
        size: D x D
      - action: populate_output_grid
        details: Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the output grid.
      - sub_action: calculate_distance
        input: cell coordinates (r, c), output dimension D
        output: distance = min(r, c, D - 1 - r, D - 1 - c)
        description: This calculates the minimum distance of the cell to any of the four edges.
      - sub_action: assign_color
        input: distance, input_grid
        output: color for output cell (r, c)
        logic: The color is taken from the input grid at row index equal to 'distance'. Specifically, use the color `input_grid[distance][0]`.
        constraint: Assumes input rows are monochromatic or only the first column's color matters. The calculated 'distance' must be less than the input grid height H.

    example_specific_details:
      - example: train_1
        input_size: 14x14
        output_size_calculation: max(14, 14) * 2 - 2 = 26
        output_size: 26x26
        center_color_determination: Central pixels (e.g., 12,12) have distance min(12, 12, 25-12, 25-12) = 12. Output color is input[12][0] (Red).
      - example: train_2
        input_size: 13x12
        output_size_calculation: max(13, 12) * 2 - 2 = 24
        output_size: 24x24
        center_color_determination: Central pixels (e.g., 11,11) have distance min(11, 11, 23-11, 23-11) = 11. Output color is input[11][0] (Azure).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input grid and determine its height `H` and width `W`.
    2.  Calculate the dimension `D` for the square output grid using the formula: `D = max(H, W) * 2 - 2`.
    3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) of size `D x D`.
    4.  For each cell position `(r, c)` in the output grid (where `r` is the row index from 0 to `D-1` and `c` is the column index from 0 to `D-1`):
        a.  Calculate the minimum distance from the cell `(r, c)` to any of the four edges of the output grid. This distance `dist` is given by `min(r, c, D - 1 - r, D - 1 - c)`.
        b.  Retrieve the color from the input grid located at row index `dist` and column index 0 (assuming input rows are monochromatic, the color of the first pixel represents the whole row). Let this color be `C = input_grid[dist][0]`.
        c.  Set the color of the output grid cell `(r, c)` to `C`.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
