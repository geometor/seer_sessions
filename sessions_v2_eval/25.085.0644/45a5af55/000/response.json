            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger, square output grid. The input grids consist of horizontal stripes of solid colors. The output grids exhibit a pattern of nested square frames or layers, where the colors seem derived from the input stripes. The size of the output grid appears related to the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid is square, and its side length `D` seems to be calculated as `max(input_height, input_width) * 2 - 2`. The color of each pixel in the output grid appears to be determined by its \"depth\" or distance from the nearest edge, corresponding to the color of an input row at that index.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
