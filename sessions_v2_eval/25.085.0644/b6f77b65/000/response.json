            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Indicator Pixel:** The pixel at coordinates (0, 0) in the input grid seems to act as a control or indicator. Its color determines the subsequent transformation.\n2.  **Objects:** The rest of the input grid contains multiple distinct objects, typically appearing as hollow shapes ('L' shapes, 'U' shapes) composed of one or two colors. These objects are separated by white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves two main actions based on the indicator color:\n    *   **Object Removal:** One or more objects are completely removed (replaced by white) from the grid. The object(s) removed appear to be those containing the same color as the indicator pixel.\n    *   **Object Shifting:** The remaining objects (those *not* containing the indicator color) are shifted vertically downwards by a specific amount.\n4.  **Shift Amount:** The number of rows the remaining objects are shifted downwards appears to depend solely on the color of the indicator pixel at (0, 0).\n    *   Maroon (9) at (0, 0): No shift (0 rows).\n    *   Magenta (6) at (0, 0): Shift down by 2 rows.\n    *   Any other color observed (Yellow (4), Orange (7)) at (0, 0): Shift down by 3 rows.\n5.  **Special Case (Maroon):** If the indicator pixel is Maroon (9), no changes occur; the output is identical to the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
