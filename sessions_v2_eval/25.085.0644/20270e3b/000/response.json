White (0) is implicitly the background in the visualization but doesn't appear explicitly in the data values shown.\n2.  **Structures:**\n    *   Yellow (4) often appears as borders or large background blocks.\n    *   Blue (1) forms internal patterns or shapes.\n    *   Orange (7) appears sparsely, sometimes as single pixels (Ex 2, 4), sometimes in lines/blocks (Ex 1, 3).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is generally a subset of the input grid, implying a removal operation. However, Example 4 shows an increase in columns, and Example 2 shows modifications, which complicates a simple removal hypothesis.\n4.  **Role of Orange (7):** Orange pixels seem critical. Their presence correlates with the removal or modification of parts of the grid.\n5.  **Removal Axis:** Removal seems to happen along either rows or columns.\n    *   Examples 1 & 2 suggest column removal.\n    *   Examples 3 & 4 suggest row removal.\n6.  **Removal Extent:**\n    *   When rows are removed, it seems to be the range covering all orange pixels (minimum orange row to maximum orange row, inclusive). This fits Example 3 and the row reduction in Example 4.\n    *   When columns are removed, Example 1"
