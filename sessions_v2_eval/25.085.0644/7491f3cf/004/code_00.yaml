Grid Structure:
  - Type: Global Border
    Properties: Surrounds the entire grid. Color determined by grid[0][0].
  - Type: Vertical Separators
    Properties: Single column wide, same color as the Global Border.
    Location: Between Zones 1&2, 2&3, 3&4.
  - Type: Zones (1, 2, 3, 4)
    Properties: Contiguous rectangular areas between borders/separators. Assumed fixed width (5 columns inner content).
    Location: Sequentially from left to right.

Objects & Properties:
  - Object: Zone Background
    Applies To: Zones 2, 3, 4 (inner area, excluding global border)
    Property: Color - Most frequent color in the zone's inner area, excluding the global border color.
  - Object: Zone 2 Pattern
    Applies To: Zone 2 (inner area)
    Property: Pixels whose color is neither the Zone 2 Background nor the Global Border color.
    Structure: Can be any shape.
  - Object: Zone 3 Pattern
    Applies To: Zone 3 (inner area)
    Property: Pixels whose color is neither the Zone 3 Background nor the Global Border color.
    Structure: Can be any shape.
  - Object: Zone 3 Modifier (Conditional)
    Derived From: Zone 3 Pattern
    Condition: Zone 3 Pattern consists *only* of green (3) pixels forming a *single, continuous horizontal line* spanning the full width of Zone 3's inner area.
    Property: The specific green pixels forming the line.

Actions & Transformations:
  - Action: Define Target State for Zone 4
    Input: Zone 2 Background Color, Zone 2 Pattern Pixels
    Output: A temporary representation of Zone 4 filled with Zone 2's Background Color, with Zone 2's Pattern Pixels overlaid at corresponding relative positions.
  - Action: Check for Modification
    Input: Zone 3 Pattern Pixels, Zone 3 Inner Area Dimensions
    Output: Boolean (True if Zone 3 Modifier condition is met).
  - Action: Apply Modification (Conditional)
    Condition: Check for Modification is True.
    Input: Target State for Zone 4, Zone 3 Modifier Pixels
    Process: Overwrite pixels in the Target State for Zone 4 at locations corresponding to the relative positions of the Zone 3 Modifier Pixels, using the modifier color (green).
  - Action: Finalize Output Grid
    Input: Input Grid, Final State for Zone 4
    Process: Replace the inner area of Zone 4 in a copy of the Input Grid with the Final State for Zone 4.
