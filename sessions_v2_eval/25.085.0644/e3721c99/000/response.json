These shapes act as \"keys\" or \"templates\".\n    *   The lower section (below the blue line) of the input grid contains scattered shapes made exclusively of gray pixels (color 5).\n    *   In the output grid, the upper section and the blue separator line remain unchanged.\n    *   In the lower section of the output grid, the gray shapes are replaced by colored shapes.\n    *   The color and shape of the replacement objects in the output correspond to one of the key/template shapes from the upper section of the input grid.\n    *   The specific key shape used for replacement seems determined by proximity: each gray shape is replaced by the color and shape of the *closest* key shape located above the blue line.\n    *   The position where the replacement shape is drawn corresponds to the location of the original gray shape, specifically anchored at the top-left corner of the gray shape's bounding box.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the row index of the horizontal line composed entirely of blue (1) pixels; this is the `separator_row`.\n    3.  Find all distinct, connected groups of non-white pixels located entirely in rows `r` where `0 < r < separator_row`. These are the `key_objects`. For each `key_object`, store its color and its shape (as a set of relative coordinates `(dr, dc)` from its top-left corner).\n    4.  Find all distinct, connected groups of gray (5) pixels located entirely in rows `r` where `r > separator_row`. These are the `target_objects`. For each `target_object`, store its set of pixel coordinates `{(r, c)}` and determine the coordinates `(min_row, min_col)` of its top-left bounding box corner.\n    5.  For each `target_object`:\n        a.  Initialize `min_distance` to infinity and `closest_key_object` to null.\n        b.  For each `key_object`:\n            i.  Calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between any pixel in the `target_object` and any pixel in the `key_object`.\n            ii. If this distance is less than `min_distance`, update `min_distance` to this distance and set `closest_key_object` to the current `key_object`. (Define a tie-breaking rule if necessary, e.g., prefer key object with lower `min_row`, then lower `min_col`).\n        c.  Retrieve the stored `(min_row, min_col)` anchor point for the current `target_object`.\n        d.  Retrieve the color and shape (relative coordinates `{(dr, dc)}`) of the `closest_key_object`.\n        e.  Iterate through the original pixel coordinates `{(r, c)}` of the `target_object` and set the corresponding pixels in the output grid to white (0).\n        f.  Iterate through the relative coordinates `{(dr, dc)}` of the `closest_key_object`'s shape. For each `(dr, dc)`, calculate the absolute coordinate `(r_new, c_new) = (min_row + dr, min_col + dc)`. If `(r_new, c_new)` is within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at `(r_new, c_new)` in the output grid to the color of the `closest_key_object`.\n    6.  Return the final modified output grid."
