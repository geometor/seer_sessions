The output grids introduce orange (7) while retaining azure (8), blue (1), and magenta (6).\n2.  **Background:** Azure (8) appears to be the background color in both input and output grids.\n3.  **Static Elements:** The blue (1) pixels and the single magenta (6) pixel seem to remain in their exact positions from the input to the output grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The key change is the transformation of *some* azure (8) pixels into orange (7) pixels.\n5.  **Spatial Relationship:** The transformation appears related to proximity. Azure pixels that change to orange are consistently located adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to either blue (1) pixels or the magenta (6) pixel in the original input grid.\n6.  **Rule:** An azure (8) pixel in the input grid becomes an orange (7) pixel in the output grid if and only if it has at least one neighbor (including diagonals) that is either blue (1) or magenta (6). If an azure (8) pixel has no blue (1) or magenta (6) neighbors, it remains azure (8). All non-azure pixels keep their original color and position.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
