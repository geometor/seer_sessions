Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids vary in size and contain multiple colors. There's always a predominant color that acts as a background, and distinct regions or pixels of other colors, including a specific region containing white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids and always have a white (0) background. They contain some of the non-background colors from the input grid, arranged in a pattern that matches their relative positions within a specific area of the input.
3.  **Key Feature:** The presence of white (0) pixels in the input seems crucial. These white pixels, along with any other non-background pixels enclosed within their bounding box, define the content and structure of the output.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the bounding box of all white (0) pixels in the input. This bounding box defines a subgrid within the input. The output grid is created based on this subgrid. Pixels from the original input background color within this subgrid are changed to white (0) in the output, while all other pixels (including the original white ones) retain their color.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains multiple colors (0-9).
      - Has a predominant background color (non-white).
      - Contains at least one white (0) pixel.
      - Contains other non-background, non-white pixels, some potentially within the area defined by white pixels.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions match the bounding box of white pixels in the input.
      - Background color is white (0).
      - Contains a subset of the non-background colors from the input grid.
      - The spatial arrangement of non-white pixels matches their relative arrangement within the white pixel bounding box in the input.
actions:
  - identify: The predominant background color of the input grid (most frequent color, ignoring white if it's most frequent).
  - locate: All white (0) pixels in the input grid.
  - calculate: The minimum bounding box (min/max row and column) enclosing all white pixels.
  - extract: The subgrid from the input corresponding to the calculated bounding box.
  - create: A new grid with the same dimensions as the extracted subgrid, initialized to white (0).
  - transform: Iterate through the extracted subgrid. For each pixel:
      - if the pixel's color is *not* the identified input background color:
          copy its color to the corresponding position in the new grid.
      - if the pixel's color *is* the identified input background color:
          leave the corresponding position in the new grid as white (0).
relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are determined by the spatial extent (bounding box) of the white pixels in the input.
  - The content of the output grid is derived from the content of the input grid within that bounding box.
  - The original input background color within the bounding box is mapped to white (0) in the output.
  - All other colors (including original white) within the bounding box are preserved in the output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the primary background color of the input grid by finding the most frequent color. If white (0) is the most frequent, choose the second most frequent color as the background color.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels in the input grid that have the color white (0).
3.  Calculate the minimum and maximum row indices and the minimum and maximum column indices among these white pixels. These define the boundaries of a rectangular subgrid (the bounding box).
4.  Determine the height and width of this bounding box.
5.  Create a new output grid with this calculated height and width, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
6.  Iterate through each position (relative row `r`, relative column `c`) within the bounding box (from row 0 to height-1, and column 0 to width-1).
7.  For each position `(r, c)`, find the corresponding absolute position (`min_row + r`, `min_col + c`) in the original input grid.
8.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at this absolute position in the input grid.
9.  Check if color `C` is the same as the primary background color identified in step 1.
10. If `C` is *not* the background color, set the pixel at position `(r, c)` in the output grid to color `C`.
11. If `C` *is* the background color, leave the pixel at position `(r, c)` in the output grid as white (0) (its initial value).
12. After iterating through all positions within the bounding box, the resulting grid is the final output.
