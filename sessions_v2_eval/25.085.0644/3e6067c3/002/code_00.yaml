Observations:
  - Task involves grids containing colored pixels.
  - Key colors observed (based on code): white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), maroon (9). # Assuming standard mapping, will confirm with examples
  - Objects:
    - Type: Rectangular boxes.
      Properties:
        - Border: Composed of blue (1) pixels, forming a closed rectangle.
        - Interior: Contains a solid block of a single color.
        - Interior Color Constraint: Cannot be blue (1) or azure (8).
    - Type: Legend Row.
      Properties:
        - Location: Typically near the bottom of the grid.
        - Structure: Alternating sequence of azure (8) and other colors (e.g., 8, C1, 8, C2,...).
        - Purpose: Defines a priority order for the non-azure colors (C1 > C2 > ...).
    - Type: Gaps.
      Properties:
        - Location: Between two adjacent rectangular boxes.
        - Composition: Consist entirely of azure (8) pixels.
        - Shape: Form a single row or single column segment.
        - Adjacency Requirement: Boxes must be separated by exactly one row/column of azure.
  - Actions:
    - Identify the legend row to determine color priorities.
    - Find all valid rectangular boxes.
    - Detect azure gaps between adjacent boxes.
    - Determine the higher priority color between the two boxes flanking a gap using the legend.
    - Fill the azure pixels within the gap with the determined higher priority color.
  - Goal: Modify the input grid by filling specific azure gaps based on color priority rules derived from a legend.
