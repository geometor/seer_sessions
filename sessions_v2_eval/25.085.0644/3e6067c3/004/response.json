            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code and the situation.\n\n**1. General Assessment**\n\nThe primary issue reported is a `SyntaxError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 40)`. This is a straightforward Python indentation error that needs correction.\n\nThe core logic described in the docstring and implemented in the functions aims to:\n1.  Find a \"legend\" row near the bottom to establish color priorities.\n2.  Identify rectangular objects enclosed by a blue border and filled with a solid, non-blue, non-azure color.\n3.  Locate single rows or columns of azure pixels that act as gaps separating adjacent boxes.\n4.  Fill these azure gaps with the color of one of the adjacent boxes, chosen based on the priority defined by the legend.\n\nThis strategy appears plausible for an ARC task involving object identification, spatial relationships, and conditional filling based on context (the legend). The error is purely syntactic, not necessarily indicative of a flaw in the transformation logic itself, although the logic might still need refinement based on other examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Fix the Syntax Error:** Correct the indentation on line 40.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Logic:** Although the immediate error is syntactic, I will re-evaluate the natural language program and the intended logic described, assuming the code *worked* as intended after the fix. This involves simulating the steps mentally based on the code's structure.\n3.  **Refine Description:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the *intended* (and now syntactically correct) process.\n\n**2. Metrics and Analysis (Simulated)**\n\nSince I cannot execute the code or see the examples, I will simulate based on the code's intended functionality after fixing the syntax error.\n\n*   **Code Correction:** The line `legend_priority[color] = i` at line 40 should be indented to be part of the `if color not in legend_priority:` block.\n\n*   **Simulated Execution Analysis:**\n    *   `_find_legend_priority`: It scans from the bottom row upwards. If a row matches the `azure, color, azure, color...` pattern (allowing trailing azures), it extracts the non-azure colors in order. This list determines priority (lower index = higher priority). Colors *not* in the legend get infinite (lowest) priority.\n    *   `_find_boxes`: It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find connected components of blue pixels. It validates if these form a single-pixel thick rectangular border around an inner area. It then checks if the inner area is filled with a single color that is *not* blue or azure. It records the inner color and the bounding box coordinates of the blue border.\n    *   `transform`:\n        *   Calls `_find_legend_priority` and `_find_boxes`.\n        *   Iterates through all pairs of identified boxes.\n        *   For each pair, it checks for horizontal or vertical adjacency with exactly *one* separating row/column.\n        *   Crucially, it checks if this separating row/column consists *only* of azure pixels *within the overlapping region* of the two boxes.\n        *   If such an azure gap is found, it determines the `fill_color` based on the legend priority of the boxes' inner colors. The color with higher priority (lower index in the legend) wins. If priorities are equal or neither color is in the legend, the color of the first box in the pair (`box_a`) is chosen due to the `<=` comparison.\n        *   The coordinates of the azure pixels forming the valid gap are recorded.\n        *   Finally, it creates a copy of the input grid and fills the recorded gap coordinates with their determined `fill_color`.\n\n**Assumed Metrics (Based on Logic):**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** Variable, likely between 3x3 and 30x30.\n*   **Legend:** May or may not be present. If present, usually 1 row high, near the bottom. Contains alternating azure and other colors.\n*   **Boxes:** Variable number. Must have a 1-pixel blue border and a solid, non-blue, non-azure interior. Minimum size is 3x3 (including border).\n*   **Gaps:** Single row or column of azure pixels. Must be exactly between two boxes and only exist in their overlapping span.\n*   **Colors:** Primarily involves blue (1) for borders, azure (8) for gaps and legend separators, and other colors (0-7, 9) for box interiors and legend priorities.\n\n**3.
