Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Identify Color Priority Legend:
    a. Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the bottom and moving upwards.
    b. Identify the first row encountered that matches the pattern: azure pixel (8), non-azure color pixel, azure pixel (8), non-azure color pixel, and so on (`8, C1, 8, C2, 8,...`). The pattern must start with azure at the beginning of the row. Trailing azure pixels at the end of the row are permitted after the last non-azure color.
    c. If such a row is found, extract the sequence of non-azure colors (`C1, C2, C3,...`). This sequence defines the color priority: `C1` has the highest priority, `C2` the next highest, and so on.
    d. Create a priority mapping where lower numbers indicate higher priority (e.g., `C1: 0, C2: 1, ...`). Assign a very low priority (e.g., infinity) to any color not found in this legend sequence.
    e. If no such legend row is found, all colors effectively have the lowest priority.
3. Find Blue-Bordered Boxes:
    a. Search the input grid to locate all distinct rectangular objects that meet the following criteria:
        i. They have a continuous, single-pixel-thick border composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.
        ii. The area strictly inside the blue border is filled entirely with a single, solid color.
        iii. This interior fill color is *not* blue (1) and *not* azure (8).
    b. For each valid box found, record its interior color and the coordinates defining the bounding box of its blue border (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).
4. Identify Adjacent Boxes, Azure Gaps, and Determine Fill Color:
    a. Iterate through all unique pairs of boxes found in the previous step.
    b. For each pair (Box A, Box B):
        i. Check if they are adjacent horizontally (side-by-side) with exactly one column separating their blue borders. Verify that this separating column consists *only* of azure (8) pixels within the vertical range where the boxes overlap.
        ii. Check if they are adjacent vertically (one above the other) with exactly one row separating their blue borders. Verify that this separating row consists *only* of azure (8) pixels within the horizontal range where the boxes overlap.
        iii. If a valid azure gap (either horizontal or vertical) is found between Box A and Box B:
            1. Compare the priority of Box A's interior color and Box B's interior color using the legend priority map established in step 2.
            2. The color with the higher priority (lower numerical value in the map) is designated as the 'fill color' for this gap. If priorities are equal (including the case where neither is in the legend), use the interior color of Box A as the fill color (due to the <= implementation).
            3. Record the coordinates of all the azure pixels within this identified gap and the determined fill color.
5. Fill Gaps:
    a. Iterate through all the recorded gaps and their associated fill colors.
    b. For each gap, change the color of the pixels at the recorded azure coordinates in the output grid copy to the determined fill color.
6. Output: Return the modified output grid.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: syntax error:
unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 76)
Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the approach.

**1. General Assessment & Strategy**

*   **Initial Error:** The immediate problem reported is a Python `IndentationError` on line 76. Looking at the code snippet around that line:
    
```python
    # Only accept if the pattern was valid AND we actually found colors
    if valid_pattern and found_color:
         priority_list = current_legend # Line 75
         break # Line 76
    ```

    Line 75 (`priority_list = current_legend`) has one level of indentation more than line 76 (`break`). Both should be indented one level under the `if` statement. This syntax error must be corrected first. The likely fix is to unindent line 75 by one level.
*   **Logic Robustness:** Beyond the syntax error, the core logic relies on several assumptions derived potentially from only one example:
    *   **Legend:** Assumes a specific `8, C1, 8, C2,...` pattern exists, is unique, and is found by scanning from the bottom up. What if the pattern differs, is elsewhere, or missing?
    *   **Boxes:** Assumes boxes are strictly defined by a single-pixel blue border with a solid, non-blue, non-azure interior. Variations in border thickness, interior patterns, or allowed colors could cause issues.
    *   **Gaps:** Assumes gaps are exactly one pixel wide and always azure.
    *   **Priority:** Assumes priority is determined solely by the order in the legend row, with a specific tie-breaking rule (first box color wins if priorities are equal or undefined).
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Correct the identified `IndentationError`.
    2.  Execute the corrected code against *all* training examples.
    3.  Analyze the outputs for *each* example:
        *   If the output is correct, confirm the logic holds for that case.
        *   If the output is incorrect, pinpoint the discrepancies. Did it fail to find the legend? Boxes? Gaps? Did it apply the wrong fill color?
    4.  Use the results of this analysis to gather detailed metrics and facts about *all* examples.
    5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on the comprehensive understanding gained from all examples, modifying the rules to be general enough to cover all cases.

**2. Metrics Gathering (Anticipated)**

Since the code failed with a syntax error, no execution metrics are available yet. We need to fix the code and run it. Once runnable, we would execute code similar to this for each example `i`:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# --- Paste the corrected _find_legend_priority, _find_boxes, and transform functions here ---
# Assume the functions are defined above in the execution context

# Placeholder for actual task data loading
# Replace with actual loading mechanism for ARC tasks
# Example: train_tasks = load_arc_task_data('task_file.json')['train']
# Using dummy data structure for illustration:
train_tasks = [
    {'input': np.array([[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]), 'output': np.array([[0,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]])}, # Dummy Example 0
    # Add other examples here...
]

metrics = []

for i, task in enumerate(train_tasks):
    input_grid = task['input']
    expected_output = task['output']
    example_metrics = {}
    example_metrics['example_index'] = i
    example_metrics['input_shape'] = input_grid.shape
    example_metrics['output_shape'] = expected_output.shape
    example_metrics['input_colors'] = sorted(list(np.unique(input_grid)))
    example_metrics['output_colors'] = sorted(list(np.unique(expected_output)))

    try:
        # --- Execute transformation steps ---
        # Correct the indentation error before running
        # Example correction (conceptual): Fix indentation in _find_legend_priority
        # Pass the corrected code to the execution environment

        # Call functions (assuming they are defined in the context)
        legend_priority = _find_legend_priority(input_grid) # Assuming corrected function
        boxes = _find_boxes(input_grid) # Assuming corrected function
        actual_output = transform(input_grid) # Assuming corrected function

        example_metrics['legend_found'] = bool(legend_priority) # True if not empty default dict with only inf
        example_metrics['legend_priorities'] = {k:v for k,v in legend_priority.items() if v != float('inf')}
        example_metrics['num_boxes_found'] = len(boxes)
        box_details = []
        for box in boxes:
             box_details.append({
                 'inner_color': box['inner_color'],
                 'bounds': box['bounds']
             })
        example_metrics['boxes'] = box_details
        example_metrics['output_matches_expected'] = np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)
        example_metrics['execution_status'] = 'Success'

    except Exception as e:
        example_metrics['execution_status'] = f'Error: {type(e).__name__} - {e}'
        example_metrics['output_matches_expected'] = False

    metrics.append(example_metrics)

# Print metrics for review
import json
print(json.dumps(metrics, indent=2, default=str)) # Use default=str for non-serializable types like numpy arrays if needed

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
[
  {
    "example_index": 0,
    "input_shape": [
      3,
      3
    ],
    "output_shape": [
      3,
      3
    ],
    "input_colors": [
      "0",
      "1"
    ],
    "output_colors": [
      "0",
      "2"
    ],
    "execution_status": "Error: NameError - name '_find_legend_priority' is not defined",
    "output_matches_expected": false
  }
]

```
*Self-Correction:* The tool code failed because the helper functions (`_find_legend_priority`, `_find_boxes`) and the main `transform` function were not defined within the tool's execution context. For actual analysis, the full, corrected code needs to be provided to the execution environment. The dummy data also doesn't reflect the task's complexity.

**Actual Metrics Gathering Strategy:** After fixing the syntax error, the `coder` phase should run the full, corrected script against each example pair (input/output) provided in the task's `train` set. The metrics to gather for *each* example include:
    *   Input/Output Grid Dimensions.
    *   Unique colors present in Input and Output.
    *   Identified Legend Row (if any) and the derived Priority Map.
    *   List of identified Boxes (coordinates, interior color).
    *   List of identified Gaps (coordinates, adjacent box colors).
    *   Chosen Fill Color for each gap.
    *   Whether the final generated output matches the expected output (`np.array_equal`).
    *   Any runtime errors encountered.

**3. YAML Fact Documentation (Based on Current Understanding)**


```yaml
task_description: Fill azure gaps between adjacent blue-bordered boxes based on a color priority legend.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels) representing colors.
  - object: legend_row
    description: A specific row in the grid defining color priority.
    properties:
      - location: Typically near the bottom, identified by scanning upwards.
      - pattern: Starts with azure (8), alternates with non-azure colors (C1, C2,...), e.g., `8, C1, 8, C2, 8, ...`. Trailing azure pixels allowed.
      - priority: Defined by the order of non-azure colors (C1 > C2 > ...). Lower index means higher priority.
  - object: box
    description: A rectangular structure in the grid.
    properties:
      - border: Continuous, single-pixel thick, composed of blue (1) pixels.
      - interior: Contiguous area inside the border.
      - interior_color: Single, solid color filling the interior. Must not be blue (1) or azure (8).
      - bounds: Min/max row/column coordinates defining the extent of the blue border.
  - object: gap
    description: A region separating adjacent boxes.
    properties:
      - location: Between two boxes, either horizontally or vertically.
      - composition: Consists entirely of azure (8) pixels.
      - thickness: Exactly one pixel wide (either one column or one row).
      - extent: Spans the overlapping dimension of the adjacent boxes' borders.
  - object: fill_color
    description: The color used to replace azure pixels in a gap.
    properties:
      - source: Determined by comparing the interior colors of the two boxes adjacent to the gap.
      - rule: The color with higher priority according to the legend_row is chosen.
      - tie_breaker: If priorities are equal or undefined (colors not in legend), the color of the box encountered first in the comparison logic (implementation-dependent, currently Box A) is chosen.

actions:
  - action: find_legend
    description: Scan the grid from bottom-to-top to locate the first row matching the legend_row pattern. Create a priority map from the non-azure colors found. Assign lowest priority to colors not in the legend.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: priority_map (color -> priority_number)
  - action: find_boxes
    description: Locate all rectangular objects in the grid that match the 'box' definition.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_boxes (each with interior_color, bounds)
  - action: identify_gaps_and_determine_fill
    description: For every pair of identified boxes, check for horizontal or vertical adjacency separated by a one-pixel azure gap. If a gap is found, determine the fill_color based on the priority_map and the boxes' interior colors.
    inputs: list_of_boxes, priority_map, input_grid
    outputs: list_of_gap_fills (each with gap_coordinates, fill_color)
  - action: fill_gaps
    description: Modify a copy of the input grid by changing the color of azure pixels at the gap_coordinates to the corresponding fill_color.
    inputs: input_grid_copy, list_of_gap_fills
    outputs: output_grid

  - Execute identify_gaps_and_determine_fill using boxes, priority_map, and input_grid to get list_of_gap_fills.
  - Execute fill_gaps using output_grid and list_of_gap_fills.
  - Return output_grid.
```


**4. Natural Language Program (Revised based on current understanding)**

1.  **Initialization**: Create a working copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Color Priority Legend**:
    *   Scan the input grid rows from bottom to top.
    *   Identify the first row that strictly follows the pattern: azure (8), Color1, azure (8), Color2, azure (8), ..., optionally ending with one or more azure (8) pixels. The pattern must start at the beginning of the row or directly after initial azure pixels. Color1, Color2, etc., must *not* be azure (8).
    *   If such a row is found, create a priority list `[Color1, Color2, ...]`. Assign priority 0 to `Color1`, 1 to `Color2`, and so on (lower number is higher priority). Colors not in this list have the lowest possible priority.
    *   If no such row is found, all colors have the lowest priority.
3.  **Find Blue-Bordered Boxes**:
    *   Search the input grid for all distinct rectangular objects that have a continuous, one-pixel thick border made entirely of blue (1) pixels.
    *   The area strictly inside the blue border must be filled with a single, solid color that is *not* blue (1) and *not* azure (8).
    *   Record the interior color and the bounding coordinates of the blue border for each valid box found.
4.  **Identify Azure Gaps and Determine Fill Color**:
    *   Examine all unique pairs of boxes found in the previous step.
    *   For each pair, check if they are adjacent either horizontally or vertically, with exactly one column or one row separating their blue borders.
    *   Verify that this separating column or row consists *only* of azure (8) pixels within the overlapping range of the boxes' borders.
    *   If such an azure gap is found:
        *   Compare the priority of the interior colors of the two adjacent boxes using the legend found in Step 2.
        *   Select the color with the higher priority (lower priority number) as the `fill_color` for this gap.
        *   If priorities are equal (including when neither color is in the legend), select the color of the first box considered in the pair comparison as the `fill_color`.
        *   Record the coordinates of the azure pixels forming this gap and the determined `fill_color`.
5.  **Fill Gaps**:
    *   Iterate through all recorded gaps. For each gap, change the color of the azure pixels at the recorded coordinates in the working grid copy to the determined `fill_color`.
6.  **Output**: Return the modified working grid.
