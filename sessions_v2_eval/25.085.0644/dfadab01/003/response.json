Identify isolated trigger pixels: Find all pixels in the input grid with specific colors (red (2), green (3), gray (5)) that are 'isolated'. An isolated pixel has all 8 of its neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) as the background color (white, 0). Pixels on edges/corners are isolated if all their existing neighbors are background. Store the locations (row, col) and the original color of these isolated pixels.\n\n2. Initialize output grid: Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n\n3. Remove specific pre-existing colors: Iterate through the output grid. Any pixel whose color matches one of the *potential output* colors (yellow (4), blue (1), magenta (6)) should be set to the background color (white, 0). This effectively removes any pre-existing shapes of these specific colors.\n\n4. Draw hollow squares: For each isolated trigger pixel identified in step 1:\n   a. Determine the corresponding output color based on the mapping: red (2) -> yellow (4), green (3) -> blue (1), gray (5) -> magenta (6).\n   b. Draw a 4x4 hollow square onto the output grid. This square is centered at the location of the original isolated pixel. The perimeter of the square uses the mapped output color, and the 2x2 interior uses the background color (white, 0). Drawing respects grid boundaries.\n\n5.
