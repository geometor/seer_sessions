Define trigger colors, background color, and color mapping:\n   - Trigger colors: Red (2), Green (3), Gray (5)\n   - Background color: White (0)\n   - Color mapping: Red(2) -> Yellow(4), Green(3) -> Blue(1), Gray(5) -> Magenta(6)\n\n2. Initialize output grid: Create a copy of the input grid.\n\n3. Identify isolated trigger pixels: Iterate through the *original* input grid. For each pixel:\n   - Check if its color is one of the trigger colors (2, 3, 5).\n   - Check if all its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) are the background color (0). Pixels on edges/corners are considered isolated if all their existing neighbors are background.\n   - Store the location (row, col) and original color of each isolated trigger pixel found.\n\n4. Draw hollow squares onto the output grid: For each isolated trigger pixel identified in step 3:\n   - Get the center coordinates (r, c) and the trigger color.\n   - Determine the corresponding output color using the mapping (2->4, 3->1, 5->6).\n   - Calculate the top-left corner coordinates for a 4x4 square centered at (r, c). This would be (r-1, c-1).\n   - Iterate through the 4x4 area defined by the top-left corner (from row r-1 to r+2, and col c-1 to c+2).\n   - For each cell (nr, nc) within this 4x4 area:\n     - Check if the cell coordinates (nr, nc) are within the grid boundaries.\n     - If within bounds:\n       - Determine if the cell is on the perimeter of the 4x4 square (nr is r-1 or r+2, OR nc is c-1 or c+2).\n       - If it is on the perimeter, set the color of the cell in the output grid (`output_grid[nr, nc]`) to the determined output color.\n       - If it is in the inner 2x2 area (not on the perimeter), set the color of the cell in the output grid (`output_grid[nr, nc]`) to the background color (0).\n\n5.
