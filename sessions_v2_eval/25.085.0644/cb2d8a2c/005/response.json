Barrier Solidification: Identifies all blue pixels (color 1) and changes them to red pixels (color 2) in a copy of the input grid. Existing red pixels (color 2) also act as barriers.\n2. Flood Fill Initiation: Locates the single green pixel (color 3) in the original input grid, which serves as the starting point for a flood fill operation.\n3. Flood Fill Execution: Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the green pixel. The fill expands through adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells that meet these criteria:\n    a. Within grid boundaries.\n    b. Not a red barrier (color 2).\n    c. Are either azure (color 8) or green (color 3).\n4. Coloring: As the flood fill progresses, any azure pixels (color 8) encountered are changed to green (color 3). The fill continues propagating through these newly greened pixels and any pre-existing green pixels (like the start point) that meet the propagation criteria.\n5. Output: Returns the modified grid after the flood fill is complete. Azure pixels reachable from the start point via a path of only azure or green cells (without crossing red barriers) become green. All other pixels retain their colors after the initial blue-to-red barrier solidification.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the barrier solidification and constrained flood fill transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # --- 1.
