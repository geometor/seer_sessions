"""
Performs a transformation on an input grid based on the following steps:
1. Barrier Solidification: Create a copy of the input grid. In this copy, change all blue pixels (1) to red pixels (2). Original red pixels (2) remain red. These red pixels form barriers.
2. Find Source: Locate the single green pixel (3) in the *original* input grid. This is the source for the fill.
3. Flood Fill: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the source pixel.
    *   The BFS explores adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
    *   A cell can be entered and processed only if it meets all these conditions:
        *   It is within the grid boundaries.
        *   It has not been visited by the BFS yet.
        *   Its color in the *modified grid* (after barrier solidification) is *not* red (2).
        *   Its color in the *original input grid* was azure (8).
    *   When a valid cell is visited:
        *   Mark it as visited.
        *   Change its color in the *modified grid* to green (3).
        *   Add it to the BFS queue to explore from it later.
4. Output: The final grid is the modified grid after the BFS is complete. Only original azure pixels reachable from the source green pixel through a path of other original azure pixels (without crossing barriers) are turned green.
