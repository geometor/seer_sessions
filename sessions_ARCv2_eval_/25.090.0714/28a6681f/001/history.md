Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task operates on each row of the input grid independently. The core mechanism involves identifying horizontal segments bounded by non-`white` pixels. Within these segments, transformations occur based on the pixel colors inside the segment and the colors of the bounding pixels.

1.  **Identifying Segments:** For each row, the relevant portion seems to be the segment starting just after the leftmost non-`white` pixel and ending just before the rightmost non-`white` pixel. Pixels outside this range (leading/trailing `white` pixels) are never modified.
2.  **Filling White Pixels:** `White` pixels located within these identified horizontal segments are consistently changed to `blue`. This happens regardless of the specific colors of the non-`white` boundary pixels, as seen in examples with boundaries like green-green, green-blue, yellow-yellow, red-red.
3.  **Conditional Clearing:** A specific condition, observed only in Example 3, introduces a secondary rule. When the boundary pixels for a horizontal segment are *both* `maroon`, any `blue` pixels (either original `blue` pixels or those just turned `blue` by the filling rule) within that segment are changed back to `white`.

The transformation can be thought of as a two-step process applied row by row: first, fill enclosed `white` areas with `blue`, and second, if the enclosure is formed by `maroon` pixels, clear any enclosed `blue` pixels back to `white`.
