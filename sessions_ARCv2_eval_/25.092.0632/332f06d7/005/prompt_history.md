**Perception**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use green (3) as a background/border color. Key active colors are red (2), white (0), and blue (1).
2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there appear to be distinct, contiguous objects composed of red pixels and white pixels. There are also objects or regions composed of blue pixels. Often, there seems to be exactly one red object and one white object.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the white object(s) and one other object (either the red object or a blue object).
    *   **White to Blue:** All white pixels in the input consistently become blue pixels in the output.
    *   **Something to White:** Exactly one other object changes its color to white.
4.  **Conditional Change:** The object that changes *to* white depends on a condition related to the shapes of the white and red objects, and the presence of blue objects with specific shapes.
    *   If the white object and the red object have the exact same shape, *and* no blue object shares this shape, then the red object becomes white.
    *   Otherwise (if white and red shapes differ, OR if a blue object shares the white object's shape), the red object remains unchanged, and a specific blue object becomes white.
5.  **Blue Object Selection (if applicable):** When a blue object is chosen to become white, the selection criteria seem to be:
    *   If a blue object exists with the same shape as the original white object, that blue object is chosen.
    *   If not, but a blue object exists with the same shape as the red object, that blue object is chosen.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: white (0)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x1)
    action: always changes color to blue (1)
  - color: red (2)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF its shape matches the white object's shape AND no blue object shares that shape.
      - remains unchanged otherwise.
  - color: blue (1)
    property: forms one or more contiguous objects/regions
    shape: variable
    action:
      - one specific blue object changes color to white (0) IF the red object does not change to white.
      - remains unchanged otherwise (except where white pixels become blue).
  - color: green (3)
    property: appears as background or border
    action: remains unchanged

relationships:
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, red object]
    purpose: determines if red object changes to white (Rule A trigger)
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, blue objects]
    purpose: determines if Rule A is overridden; identifies candidate blue object for Rule B
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [red object, blue objects]
    purpose: identifies candidate blue object for Rule B (if no blue object matches white shape)

transformation_rules:
  - rule: A (Primary Swap)
    condition: shape(white_object) == shape(red_object) AND NOT EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - change red_object pixels to white (0)
  - rule: B (White->Blue, Blue->White)
    condition: shape(white_object) != shape(red_object) OR EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - leave red_object unchanged
      - find target_blue_object:
          - IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(red_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE:
              # (Case not observed in examples, default might be no change or error)
              target_blue_object = None
      - IF target_blue_object exists:
          change target_blue_object pixels to white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the single contiguous object composed of white (0) pixels. Determine its shape and location. Let this be `W`.
2.  Identify the single contiguous object composed of red (2) pixels. Determine its shape and location. Let this be `R`.
3.  Identify all contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels. Determine their shapes and locations. Let this set be `{B}`.
4.  Compare the shape of `W` with the shape of `R`.
5.  Check if any blue object `Bi` in `{B}` has the same shape as `W`.
6.  **Decision Point:**
    *   **IF** the shape of `W` is identical to the shape of `R`, **AND** no blue object `Bi` has the same shape as `W`:
        *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `W` in the output grid to blue (1).
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `R` in the output grid to white (0).
    *   **ELSE** (the shapes of `W` and `R` differ, OR a blue object `Bi` has the same shape as `W`):
        *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
        *   Change all pixels corresponding to `W` in the output grid to blue (1).
        *   Leave the pixels corresponding to `R` unchanged (still red).
        *   Find a target blue object `Bk` to change to white:
            *   Search for a blue object `Bi` in `{B}` whose shape is identical to the shape of `W`. If found, this is `Bk`.
            *   If no such blue object is found, search for a blue object `Bj` in `{B}` whose shape is identical to the shape of `R`. If found, this is `Bk`.
        *   If a target blue object `Bk` was found, change all pixels corresponding to `Bk` in the output grid to white (0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.

"""
Identifies single contiguous objects of white (0) and red (2) pixels, and all contiguous objects of blue (1) pixels.
Compares the shapes of the white and red objects.
Also checks if any blue object has the same shape as the white object.

Transformation Rules:
1.  All white pixels always change to blue pixels.
2.  Conditional Swap/Change:
    a. If the white object and red object have the exact same shape AND no blue object shares the white object's shape, then the red object's pixels change to white.
    b. Otherwise (white/red shapes differ OR a blue object matches the white shape):
        i. The red object remains unchanged.
        ii. Find a blue object to change to white:
            - First, look for a blue object with the same shape as the original white object. If found, change its pixels to white.
            - If not found, look for a blue object with the same shape as the red object. If found, change its pixels to white.
        iii. If no suitable blue object is found based on shape matching (white's shape then red's shape), no blue object changes to white.
3. All other pixels (e.g., green background) remain unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: white (W), red (R), and blue (B) objects/pixels, and the basic transformations (W->B, and either R->W or B->W). However, the conditional logic determining *which* object (R or a specific B) turns white was incorrect, leading to failures in all examples.

The failures stemmed from misunderstandings in the priority of shape matching and the specific conditions for the R->W swap versus the B->W swap.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Conditions:** Precisely define the conditions based on shape equality (W vs. R) and the existence of blue subregions matching W's shape.
2.  **Prioritize Blue Match:** Establish that checking for a blue subregion matching W's shape is always the primary condition after the mandatory W->B change.
3.  **Refine Rules:** Update the `IF/ELSE` structure in the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the correct priority and outcomes for both `shapeW == shapeR` and `shapeW != shapeR` cases.
4.  **Verify Subregion Finding:** Ensure the concept and implementation of `find_subregion_with_shape` correctly identify contiguous blue pixels matching the target shape *within the original input grid*.
5.  **Use Metrics:** Use code execution to verify shapes and the presence/absence of matching blue subregions in each example to confirm the refined rules.

**Revised Analysis based on Metrics**

The metrics calculation seems to have an error in Example 3. Let's re-examine manually:
*   Example 3 Input:
    *   W object: Color 0 at (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3), (14,1), (14,2), (14,3). This is a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeW = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`
    *   R object: Color 2 at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). This is also a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeR = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`
    *   Shapes Match: True.
    *   Blue Pixels (Color 1): Many. Is there a 3x3 blue subregion? Yes, e.g., at (6,7) anchor: (6,7),(6,8),(6,9), (7,7),(7,8),(7,9), (8,7),(8,8),(8,9). Blue_Matches_W = True.
*   The code output incorrectly stated W_Shape_Size=3, R_Shape_Size=3x3=9, Shapes_Match=False for Example 3. This indicates a potential bug in the metric gathering code itself (likely `find_objects` or `get_object_shape` for the white object in Ex3). Let's assume the manual analysis is correct.

**Corrected Logic based on Manual Analysis & Expected Outputs:**

*   **Example 1:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,1). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue. *Implication:* The existence of a blue shape matching W does *not* always mean the blue shape changes. It only changes *if* it exists? No, that doesn't fit. Let's re-read the *entire* problem description and expected outputs.
    *   Ex1 In: W(2x2) at (9,8), R(2x2) at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1).
    *   Ex1 Out: R at (0,1) -> White. W at (9,8) -> Blue. Blue at (2,1) -> Unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White.
    *   My metrics said Blue_Matches_W was True for Ex1. Why? Ah, `find_subregion_with_shape` looks *anywhere*. The blue object at (2,1) *is* a 2x2. Okay.
    *   So, Ex1: W==R. Blue matching W *exists*. Expected output: R->White. This contradicts the previous attempt's logic.
*   **Example 2:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White.
*   **Example 3:** W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue 3x3 *exists* at (6,7). Expected output: Blue at (6,7) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White. (Consistent with Ex2).
*   **Example 4:** W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue 1x1 *exists* (many). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White. Wait, blue 1x1s *do* exist. This is confusing.

Let's reconsider "object" vs "subregion". Maybe we should use `find_objects` for blue as well?

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,1), L-shape at (3,4), complex shape... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, the one at (2,1). Expected Output: R->White.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,5), 2x2 at (7,9), large complex shape... Do any *complete* blue objects match shapeW? Yes, two of them. Expected Output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. Why that one? Position? Closest? Last?
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Blue Objects: 3x3 at (6,7), others... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, at (6,7). Expected Output: Blue at (6,7) -> White.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Blue Objects: 1x2 at (1,2), 1x1 at (2,3), 1x3 at (2,5), ... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW (1x1)? Yes, at (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8). Expected Output: R->White.

Okay, using *complete objects* found by `find_objects` seems key.

**Revised Logic Attempt 2:**

1.  Find the single white object W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).
2.  Find the single red object R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).
3.  Find *all* complete, contiguous blue objects `{B}` (list of coord sets). Calculate their shapes `{shapeBi}`.
4.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.
5.  Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_W` where `shapeBi == shapeW`.
6.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is *empty* (no blue object has the same shape as W/R):
        *   Change R -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is not empty):
        *   Select *one* target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W`. (Rule needed: First found? Lowest row/col anchor? Largest coord sum? Let's re-check Ex2 - (7,9) was chosen over (2,5). (7,9) has a higher row index). Let's tentatively choose the one whose top-left anchor (min row, then min col) is largest (bottom-most, then right-most).
        *   Change `Bk` -> White.
7.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is *not* empty:
        *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W` (using the same selection rule as 6.ELSE).
        *   Change `Bk` -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):
        *   Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_R` where `shapeBi == shapeR`.
        *   IF `B_match_R` is *not* empty:
            *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_R` (using the same selection rule).
            *   Change `Bk` -> White.
        *   ELSE (No blue object matches W or R):
            *   No further changes (only W changed to Blue).

Let's test this logic:
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue objects: 2x2@ (2,1), others. `B_match_W` contains {coords of blue@(2,1)}. Condition 6.ELSE applies. Select the only matching blue object. Change blue@(2,1) -> White. **This STILL doesn't match the expected output (R->White).**

**Third Reassessment:** There must be a simpler distinguishing feature. What's different between Ex1/Ex4 (where R->W) and Ex2/Ex3 (where B->W)?

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: B->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Match. Blue 3x3 exists. Output: B->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Match. Blue 1x1 exists. Output: R->W.

Is it about *overlap* or *adjacency*?
*   Ex1: W at (9,8), R at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1). No overlaps. R is adjacent (diag) to blue 2x2. W is far away.
*   Ex2: W at (2,10), R at (12,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,5) & (7,9). W is adjacent to the blue block containing (2,5). The chosen B(7,9) is not adjacent to W or R.
*   Ex3: W at (12,1), R at (0,0). Blue 3x3 at (6,7). None are adjacent.
*   Ex4: W at (1,1), R at (9,4). Blue 1x1s exist. W adjacent to blue 1x2 at (1,2). R not adjacent to any blue.

This isn't clarifying. Let's reconsider the simplest case: **WHEN does R turn white?** Only in Ex1 and Ex4. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`. What else is common?
*   Ex1: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.
*   Ex4: W=1x1, R=1x1. Blue 1x1 exists.

**WHEN does Blue turn white?** Only in Ex2 and Ex3. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`.
*   Ex2: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.
*   Ex3: W=3x3, R=3x3. Blue 3x3 exists.

This seems contradictory. The *only* difference is the specific grids.

Could the `find_subregion_with_shape` being correct in the metrics be the key?
If we use the subregion logic (allowing matches within larger blue areas):
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,1). Expected: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,5 and 7,9). Expected: B(7,9)->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 6,7). Expected: B(6,7)->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (many). Expected: R->W.

Okay, let's refine the rule based on *subregions* found by `find_subregion_with_shape`:

**Revised Logic Attempt 3 (Using Subregions):**

1.  Find W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).
2.  Find R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).
3.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.
4.  Find *first* blue subregion matching `shapeW` (coords `B_match_W_coords`).
5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_W_coords` is `None`:
        *   Change R -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W_coords` exists):
        *   **This is the tricky part.** Why does R->W in Ex1/Ex4 but B->W in Ex2/Ex3?
        *   Compare location? In Ex1, R is at (0,1), W is at (9,8). Matching Blue is at (2,1). In Ex4, R is at (9,4), W is at (1,1). Matching Blue is at (1,2).
        *   In Ex2, R is at (12,1), W is at (2,10). Matching Blue is at (2,5) [first], expected change is at (7,9). In Ex3, R is at (0,0), W is at (12,1). Matching Blue is at (1,10) [first], expected change is at (6,7).
        *   What if the rule is: If `shapeW == shapeR` AND a blue subregion `B` matching `shapeW` exists, THEN IF `W_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the white object *was* blue - impossible by definition) OR `R_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the red object *was* blue - impossible by definition), THEN R->White ELSE B->White? No, colors are distinct.
        *   What if it depends on *which* matching blue region is chosen? The `find_subregion` finds the first (lowest row, then lowest col).
            *   Ex1: Finds blue@(2,1). Expected: R->W.
            *   Ex2: Finds blue@(2,5). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.
            *   Ex3: Finds blue@(1,10). Expected: B@(6,7)->W. (Assuming my manual check for first blue 3x3 was wrong and code was right).
            *   Ex4: Finds blue@(1,2). Expected: R->W.
        *   Hypothesis: If `shapeW == shapeR` and a matching blue subregion `B` exists: IF this first-found `B` overlaps/is identical to the original R object's location OR the original W object's location (impossible by color constraints, but maybe relevant if colors could overlap?), THEN change R->W. ELSE change *that specific first-found B* -> W.
            *   Ex1: B@(2,1) does not overlap W@(9,8) or R@(0,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**
            *   Ex4: B@(1,2) does not overlap W@(1,1) or R@(9,4). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**

**Let's discard the subregion idea and go back to OBJECTS.** My analysis of Ex1/Ex4 matching the expected output was wrong earlier.

**Re-Re-Analysis with OBJECTS:**

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,1). Expected: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (6,7). Expected: B@(6,7)->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, multiple. Expected: R->W.

There *must* be a condition distinguishing {Ex1, Ex4} from {Ex2, Ex3} when shapes match and a matching blue object exists.

*   Could it be the *number* of matching blue objects?
    *   Ex1: One matching blue obj. Output: R->W.
    *   Ex2: Two matching blue objs. Output: B->W (the last one?).
    *   Ex3: One matching blue obj. Output: B->W.
    *   Ex4: Multiple matching blue objs. Output: R->W.
    *   This doesn't hold (Ex1 vs Ex3).

*   Is the red object (R) *also* blue somewhere else? No, R is always red.
*   Is the white object (W) *also* blue somewhere else? No.

Let's revisit the exact outputs vs inputs carefully.

**Example 1:**
Input W: (9,8),(9,9),(10,8),(10,9) - Color 0
Input R: (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: (2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2) - Color 1
Output: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.

**Example 2:**
Input W: (2,10),(2,11),(3,10),(3,11) - Color 0
Input R: (12,1),(12,2),(13,1),(13,2) - Color 2
Input B obj match W #1: (2,5),(2,6),(3,5),(3,6) - Color 1
Input B obj match W #2: (7,9),(7,10),(8,9),(8,10) - Color 1
Output: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj #1 coords remain 1. B obj #2 coords become 0.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> B(last one?)->W.

**Example 3:**
Input W: 3x3@(12,1) - Color 0
Input R: 3x3@(0,0) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: 3x3@(6,7) - Color 1
Output: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj coords become 0.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> B->W.

**Example 4:**
Input W: (1,1) - Color 0
Input R: (9,4) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: Many single pixels. Let's list anchors: (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8).
Output: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.

**FINAL HYPOTHESIS:**
The rule depends on whether the **Red object R** also exists as a **Blue object** somewhere else in the grid.

1.  Find W (coords, shapeW). Find R (coords, shapeR). Find all Blue objects {Bi} (coords, shapeBi).
2.  Mandatory: W -> Blue.
3.  Check if any Blue object `Bj` exists such that `shapeBj == shapeR`. Let this set be `B_match_R`.
4.  Check if any Blue object `Bk` exists such that `shapeBk == shapeW`. Let this set be `B_match_W`.
5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_R` is **empty** (no blue object has the same shape as R/W):
        *   Change R -> White. (This covers Ex1 & Ex4 - check data below)
    *   ELSE (`B_match_R` is not empty):
        *   Select the target Blue object `Bt` from `B_match_R` (e.g., last one found / highest anchor row/col).
        *   Change `Bt` -> White. (This covers Ex2 & Ex3 - check data below)
6.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is **not empty**:
        *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_W`. Change `Bt` -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):
        *   IF `B_match_R` is **not empty**:
            *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_R`. Change `Bt` -> White.
        *   ELSE: No further changes.

Let's re-check the data for this hypothesis:
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Hypothesis predicts B->W (e.g., the one at 7,9). **Matches expected.**
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Does a blue object match R's shape (3x3)? Yes, at (6,7). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Matches expected.**
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Does a blue object match R's shape (1x1)? Yes, many. Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**

I am fundamentally misunderstanding the condition that differentiates Ex1/Ex4 from Ex2/Ex3. It cannot be shape equality or existence of matching blue shapes alone.

What if the white object location relative to the grid matters? Or red?

Let's look at the pixels *changed* in the output compared to the input:
*   Ex1: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).
*   Ex2: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(7,9) coords (1->0).
*   Ex3: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(6,7) coords (1->0).
*   Ex4: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).

Rule: W always becomes B. One other object becomes W.
Candidate objects to become W: R, or any B object.
Selection criteria:
IF `shapeW == shapeR`:
  IF ??? : Select R to become W. (Condition true in Ex1, Ex4)
  ELSE : Select a B object (matching shape W? matching shape R?) to become W. (Condition true in Ex2, Ex3)
ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`): (No examples provided for this case!)
  Select a B object (matching shape W first, then shape R?) to become W.

What is the ??? condition?
Is R adjacent to W? Ex1: No. Ex4: No. Ex2: No. Ex3: No.
Is R identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.
Is W identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.

Maybe the crucial part is the selection *amongst* the matching blue objects.
If W==R, find all blue objects `Bk` where `shapeBk == shapeW`.
  If this set is empty -> Change R to W. (Never happens in examples).
  If this set is non-empty -> ??? determines if R->W or B->W.
    If R->W (Ex1, Ex4): What's special? In Ex1, only one B matches W. In Ex4, multiple B match W.
    If B->W (Ex2, Ex3): What's special? In Ex2, multiple B match W. In Ex3, only one B matches W.

This is highly ambiguous. Let's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex2/Ex3: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change B->W. This contradicts Ex1/Ex4.
Let's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex1/Ex4: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change R->W. This contradicts Ex2/Ex3.

Possibility: The interpretation of "shape" is wrong. But they look identical.
Possibility: Connectivity matters differently? (Used 8-way).
Possibility: There's a hidden priority (e.g. color transformation order matters).

Let's try the simplest path covering most cases:
Rule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change B->W (choose last/bottom-right if multiple). ELSE change R->W.
*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W (select 7,9). Expected B->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected B->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**

Let's try the opposite simple path:
Rule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change R->W. ELSE (no matching B exists OR shapeW != shapeR)... need logic for this part. Assume if W!=R, then B->W if match found.
*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**

Neither simple rule works. The differentiating factor is elusive. Reverting to the object-based logic and acknowledging the ambiguity in selection when W==R and B_match_W exists. The safest bet might be the logic from the *second* code attempt, which passed Ex2/Ex3 but failed Ex1/Ex4. Maybe the selection rule for B needs refinement, or there's an edge case for 1x1 or specific positioning causing Ex1/Ex4 to revert to R->W.

Given the conflict, I will document the logic that worked for Ex2/Ex3, explicitly noting the conflict with Ex1/Ex4.

**YAML Facts (Reflecting Logic Attempt Matching Ex2/Ex3)**


```yaml
task_description: Transforms grid by swapping colors based on object shapes. A white object always becomes blue. Either the red object or a blue object becomes white based on shape comparison.

objects:
  - id: W
    color: white (0)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation (relative coords from top-left).
    action: always changes color to blue (1) in output.
  - id: R
    color: red (2)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF shapeW == shapeR AND no blue object Bk exists where shapeBk == shapeW.
      - remains red (2) OTHERWISE.
  - id: B
    color: blue (1)
    property: zero or more per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - one specific blue object Bk changes color to white (0) IF (shapeW == shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW) OR (shapeW != shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW).
      - If the above conditions involving shapeW fail, AND shapeW != shapeR, one specific blue object Bj changes to white (0) IF a blue object Bj exists with shapeBj == shapeR.
      - Otherwise, blue objects remain blue (1).

selection_rule_for_B:
  - context: Multiple blue objects match the required shape (shapeW or shapeR).
  - rule: Select the blue object whose top-left bounding box corner (minimum row, then minimum column) is the largest (i.e., furthest down and to the right).

ambiguity_note:
  - The condition for R->W vs B->W when shapeW == shapeR and a matching Blue object exists is unclear. The documented logic assumes B->W in this case (matching Ex2, Ex3), but this contradicts Ex1, Ex4 where R->W occurs under the same apparent conditions. Further differentiating criteria may be missing.

**Natural Language Program (Reflecting Logic Attempt Matching Ex2/Ex3)**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single contiguous white object (W). Store its coordinates (`W_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeW`).
3.  Identify the single contiguous red object (R). Store its coordinates (`R_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeR`).
4.  Identify all contiguous blue objects ({B}). For each blue object `Bi`, store its coordinates (`Bi_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeBi`).
5.  **Mandatory Change:** Change all pixels at `W_coords` in the output grid to blue (1).
6.  Find all blue objects `Bk` from {B} such that `shapeBk == shapeW`. Let this collection be `MatchingW_BlueObjects`.
7.  Find all blue objects `Bj` from {B} such that `shapeBj == shapeR`. Let this collection be `MatchingR_BlueObjects`.
8.  **Conditional Change (Object to become White):**
    a.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
        i.  IF `MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **empty**:
            Change all pixels at `R_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
        ii. ELSE (`MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **not empty**):
            Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingW_BlueObjects` (e.g., the one with the largest top-left anchor: max row, then max col).
            Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
            *(Note: This step correctly handles Ex2, Ex3, but incorrectly handles Ex1, Ex4 based on expected outputs).*
    b.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
        i.  IF `MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **not empty**:
            Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingW_BlueObjects` (using the same selection rule).
            Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
        ii. ELSE (`MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **empty**):
            IF `MatchingR_BlueObjects` is **not empty**:
                Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingR_BlueObjects` (using the same selection rule).
                Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
            ELSE:
                No object changes to white (only W changed to blue).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
