task_description: Transforms grid by swapping colors based on object shapes. A white object always becomes blue. Either the red object or a blue object becomes white based on shape comparison.

objects:
  - id: W
    color: white (0)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation (relative coords from top-left).
    action: always changes color to blue (1) in output.
  - id: R
    color: red (2)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF shapeW == shapeR AND no blue object Bk exists where shapeBk == shapeW.
      - remains red (2) OTHERWISE.
  - id: B
    color: blue (1)
    property: zero or more per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - one specific blue object Bk changes color to white (0) IF (shapeW == shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW) OR (shapeW != shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW).
      - If the above conditions involving shapeW fail, AND shapeW != shapeR, one specific blue object Bj changes to white (0) IF a blue object Bj exists with shapeBj == shapeR.
      - Otherwise, blue objects remain blue (1).

selection_rule_for_B:
  - context: Multiple blue objects match the required shape (shapeW or shapeR).
  - rule: Select the blue object whose top-left bounding box corner (minimum row, then minimum column) is the largest (i.e., furthest down and to the right).

ambiguity_note:
  - The condition for R->W vs B->W when shapeW == shapeR and a matching Blue object exists is unclear. The documented logic assumes B->W in this case (matching Ex2, Ex3), but this contradicts Ex1, Ex4 where R->W occurs under the same apparent conditions. Further differentiating criteria may be missing.
