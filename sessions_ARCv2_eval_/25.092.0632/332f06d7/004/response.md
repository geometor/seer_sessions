**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: white (W), red (R), and blue (B) objects/pixels, and the basic transformations (W->B, and either R->W or B->W). However, the conditional logic determining *which* object (R or a specific B) turns white was incorrect, leading to failures in all examples.

The failures stemmed from misunderstandings in the priority of shape matching and the specific conditions for the R->W swap versus the B->W swap.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Conditions:** Precisely define the conditions based on shape equality (W vs. R) and the existence of blue subregions matching W's shape.
2.  **Prioritize Blue Match:** Establish that checking for a blue subregion matching W's shape is always the primary condition after the mandatory W->B change.
3.  **Refine Rules:** Update the `IF/ELSE` structure in the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the correct priority and outcomes for both `shapeW == shapeR` and `shapeW != shapeR` cases.
4.  **Verify Subregion Finding:** Ensure the concept and implementation of `find_subregion_with_shape` correctly identify contiguous blue pixels matching the target shape *within the original input grid*.
5.  **Use Metrics:** Use code execution to verify shapes and the presence/absence of matching blue subregions in each example to confirm the refined rules.

**Revised Analysis based on Metrics**

The metrics calculation seems to have an error in Example 3. Let's re-examine manually:
*   Example 3 Input:
    *   W object: Color 0 at (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3), (14,1), (14,2), (14,3). This is a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeW = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`
    *   R object: Color 2 at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). This is also a 3x3 square. Shape Size = 9. `shapeR = frozenset({(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)})`
    *   Shapes Match: True.
    *   Blue Pixels (Color 1): Many. Is there a 3x3 blue subregion? Yes, e.g., at (6,7) anchor: (6,7),(6,8),(6,9), (7,7),(7,8),(7,9), (8,7),(8,8),(8,9). Blue_Matches_W = True.
*   The code output incorrectly stated W_Shape_Size=3, R_Shape_Size=3x3=9, Shapes_Match=False for Example 3. This indicates a potential bug in the metric gathering code itself (likely `find_objects` or `get_object_shape` for the white object in Ex3). Let's assume the manual analysis is correct.

**Corrected Logic based on Manual Analysis & Expected Outputs:**

*   **Example 1:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,1). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue. *Implication:* The existence of a blue shape matching W does *not* always mean the blue shape changes. It only changes *if* it exists? No, that doesn't fit. Let's re-read the *entire* problem description and expected outputs.
    *   Ex1 In: W(2x2) at (9,8), R(2x2) at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1).
    *   Ex1 Out: R at (0,1) -> White. W at (9,8) -> Blue. Blue at (2,1) -> Unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White.
    *   My metrics said Blue_Matches_W was True for Ex1. Why? Ah, `find_subregion_with_shape` looks *anywhere*. The blue object at (2,1) *is* a 2x2. Okay.
    *   So, Ex1: W==R. Blue matching W *exists*. Expected output: R->White. This contradicts the previous attempt's logic.
*   **Example 2:** W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue 2x2 *exists* at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White.
*   **Example 3:** W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue 3x3 *exists* at (6,7). Expected output: Blue at (6,7) -> White. W->Blue. R unchanged.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND Blue matching W *exists*, THEN Blue(matching W)->White. (Consistent with Ex2).
*   **Example 4:** W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue 1x1 *exists* (many). Expected output: R->White. W->Blue.
    *   Rule inferred: If W==R AND **NO** blue object matches W's shape, THEN R->White. Wait, blue 1x1s *do* exist. This is confusing.

Let's reconsider "object" vs "subregion". Maybe we should use `find_objects` for blue as well?

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,1), L-shape at (3,4), complex shape... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, the one at (2,1). Expected Output: R->White.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Blue Objects: 2x2 at (2,5), 2x2 at (7,9), large complex shape... Do any *complete* blue objects match shapeW? Yes, two of them. Expected Output: Blue at (7,9) -> White. Why that one? Position? Closest? Last?
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Blue Objects: 3x3 at (6,7), others... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW? Yes, at (6,7). Expected Output: Blue at (6,7) -> White.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Blue Objects: 1x2 at (1,2), 1x1 at (2,3), 1x3 at (2,5), ... Does any *complete* blue object match shapeW (1x1)? Yes, at (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8). Expected Output: R->White.

Okay, using *complete objects* found by `find_objects` seems key.

**Revised Logic Attempt 2:**

1.  Find the single white object W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).
2.  Find the single red object R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).
3.  Find *all* complete, contiguous blue objects `{B}` (list of coord sets). Calculate their shapes `{shapeBi}`.
4.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.
5.  Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_W` where `shapeBi == shapeW`.
6.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is *empty* (no blue object has the same shape as W/R):
        *   Change R -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is not empty):
        *   Select *one* target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W`. (Rule needed: First found? Lowest row/col anchor? Largest coord sum? Let's re-check Ex2 - (7,9) was chosen over (2,5). (7,9) has a higher row index). Let's tentatively choose the one whose top-left anchor (min row, then min col) is largest (bottom-most, then right-most).
        *   Change `Bk` -> White.
7.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is *not* empty:
        *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_W` (using the same selection rule as 6.ELSE).
        *   Change `Bk` -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):
        *   Find the subset of blue objects `B_match_R` where `shapeBi == shapeR`.
        *   IF `B_match_R` is *not* empty:
            *   Select one target blue object `Bk` from `B_match_R` (using the same selection rule).
            *   Change `Bk` -> White.
        *   ELSE (No blue object matches W or R):
            *   No further changes (only W changed to Blue).

Let's test this logic:
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue objects: 2x2@ (2,1), others. `B_match_W` contains {coords of blue@(2,1)}. Condition 6.ELSE applies. Select the only matching blue object. Change blue@(2,1) -> White. **This STILL doesn't match the expected output (R->White).**

**Third Reassessment:** There must be a simpler distinguishing feature. What's different between Ex1/Ex4 (where R->W) and Ex2/Ex3 (where B->W)?

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Match. Blue 2x2 exists. Output: B->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Match. Blue 3x3 exists. Output: B->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Match. Blue 1x1 exists. Output: R->W.

Is it about *overlap* or *adjacency*?
*   Ex1: W at (9,8), R at (0,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,1). No overlaps. R is adjacent (diag) to blue 2x2. W is far away.
*   Ex2: W at (2,10), R at (12,1). Blue 2x2 at (2,5) & (7,9). W is adjacent to the blue block containing (2,5). The chosen B(7,9) is not adjacent to W or R.
*   Ex3: W at (12,1), R at (0,0). Blue 3x3 at (6,7). None are adjacent.
*   Ex4: W at (1,1), R at (9,4). Blue 1x1s exist. W adjacent to blue 1x2 at (1,2). R not adjacent to any blue.

This isn't clarifying. Let's reconsider the simplest case: **WHEN does R turn white?** Only in Ex1 and Ex4. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`. What else is common?
*   Ex1: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.
*   Ex4: W=1x1, R=1x1. Blue 1x1 exists.

**WHEN does Blue turn white?** Only in Ex2 and Ex3. In both, `shapeW == shapeR`.
*   Ex2: W=2x2, R=2x2. Blue 2x2 exists.
*   Ex3: W=3x3, R=3x3. Blue 3x3 exists.

This seems contradictory. The *only* difference is the specific grids.

Could the `find_subregion_with_shape` being correct in the metrics be the key?
If we use the subregion logic (allowing matches within larger blue areas):
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,1). Expected: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 2,5 and 7,9). Expected: B(7,9)->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (at 6,7). Expected: B(6,7)->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes match. Blue *subregion* matching W exists (many). Expected: R->W.

Okay, let's refine the rule based on *subregions* found by `find_subregion_with_shape`:

**Revised Logic Attempt 3 (Using Subregions):**

1.  Find W (coords `W_coords`, shape `shapeW`).
2.  Find R (coords `R_coords`, shape `shapeR`).
3.  **Mandatory Change:** W -> Blue.
4.  Find *first* blue subregion matching `shapeW` (coords `B_match_W_coords`).
5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_W_coords` is `None`:
        *   Change R -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W_coords` exists):
        *   **This is the tricky part.** Why does R->W in Ex1/Ex4 but B->W in Ex2/Ex3?
        *   Compare location? In Ex1, R is at (0,1), W is at (9,8). Matching Blue is at (2,1). In Ex4, R is at (9,4), W is at (1,1). Matching Blue is at (1,2).
        *   In Ex2, R is at (12,1), W is at (2,10). Matching Blue is at (2,5) [first], expected change is at (7,9). In Ex3, R is at (0,0), W is at (12,1). Matching Blue is at (1,10) [first], expected change is at (6,7).
        *   What if the rule is: If `shapeW == shapeR` AND a blue subregion `B` matching `shapeW` exists, THEN IF `W_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the white object *was* blue - impossible by definition) OR `R_coords == B_coords` (i.e., the red object *was* blue - impossible by definition), THEN R->White ELSE B->White? No, colors are distinct.
        *   What if it depends on *which* matching blue region is chosen? The `find_subregion` finds the first (lowest row, then lowest col).
            *   Ex1: Finds blue@(2,1). Expected: R->W.
            *   Ex2: Finds blue@(2,5). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.
            *   Ex3: Finds blue@(1,10). Expected: B@(6,7)->W. (Assuming my manual check for first blue 3x3 was wrong and code was right).
            *   Ex4: Finds blue@(1,2). Expected: R->W.
        *   Hypothesis: If `shapeW == shapeR` and a matching blue subregion `B` exists: IF this first-found `B` overlaps/is identical to the original R object's location OR the original W object's location (impossible by color constraints, but maybe relevant if colors could overlap?), THEN change R->W. ELSE change *that specific first-found B* -> W.
            *   Ex1: B@(2,1) does not overlap W@(9,8) or R@(0,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**
            *   Ex4: B@(1,2) does not overlap W@(1,1) or R@(9,4). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Incorrect.**

**Let's discard the subregion idea and go back to OBJECTS.** My analysis of Ex1/Ex4 matching the expected output was wrong earlier.

**Re-Re-Analysis with OBJECTS:**

*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,1). Expected: R->W.
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Expected: B@(7,9)->W.
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, at (6,7). Expected: B@(6,7)->W.
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Shapes Match. Blue OBJECT matching W exists? Yes, multiple. Expected: R->W.

There *must* be a condition distinguishing {Ex1, Ex4} from {Ex2, Ex3} when shapes match and a matching blue object exists.

*   Could it be the *number* of matching blue objects?
    *   Ex1: One matching blue obj. Output: R->W.
    *   Ex2: Two matching blue objs. Output: B->W (the last one?).
    *   Ex3: One matching blue obj. Output: B->W.
    *   Ex4: Multiple matching blue objs. Output: R->W.
    *   This doesn't hold (Ex1 vs Ex3).

*   Is the red object (R) *also* blue somewhere else? No, R is always red.
*   Is the white object (W) *also* blue somewhere else? No.

Let's revisit the exact outputs vs inputs carefully.

**Example 1:**
Input W: (9,8),(9,9),(10,8),(10,9) - Color 0
Input R: (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: (2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2) - Color 1
Output: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.

**Example 2:**
Input W: (2,10),(2,11),(3,10),(3,11) - Color 0
Input R: (12,1),(12,2),(13,1),(13,2) - Color 2
Input B obj match W #1: (2,5),(2,6),(3,5),(3,6) - Color 1
Input B obj match W #2: (7,9),(7,10),(8,9),(8,10) - Color 1
Output: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj #1 coords remain 1. B obj #2 coords become 0.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> B(last one?)->W.

**Example 3:**
Input W: 3x3@(12,1) - Color 0
Input R: 3x3@(0,0) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: 3x3@(6,7) - Color 1
Output: W coords become 1. R coords remain 2. B obj coords become 0.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> B->W.

**Example 4:**
Input W: (1,1) - Color 0
Input R: (9,4) - Color 2
Input B obj match W: Many single pixels. Let's list anchors: (2,3), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,4), (7,4), (7,8), (8,4), (8,8).
Output: R coords become 0. W coords become 1. B obj coords remain 1.
Rule: W==R, B_match exists -> R->W.

**FINAL HYPOTHESIS:**
The rule depends on whether the **Red object R** also exists as a **Blue object** somewhere else in the grid.

1.  Find W (coords, shapeW). Find R (coords, shapeR). Find all Blue objects {Bi} (coords, shapeBi).
2.  Mandatory: W -> Blue.
3.  Check if any Blue object `Bj` exists such that `shapeBj == shapeR`. Let this set be `B_match_R`.
4.  Check if any Blue object `Bk` exists such that `shapeBk == shapeW`. Let this set be `B_match_W`.
5.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
    *   IF `B_match_R` is **empty** (no blue object has the same shape as R/W):
        *   Change R -> White. (This covers Ex1 & Ex4 - check data below)
    *   ELSE (`B_match_R` is not empty):
        *   Select the target Blue object `Bt` from `B_match_R` (e.g., last one found / highest anchor row/col).
        *   Change `Bt` -> White. (This covers Ex2 & Ex3 - check data below)
6.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
    *   IF `B_match_W` is **not empty**:
        *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_W`. Change `Bt` -> White.
    *   ELSE (`B_match_W` is empty):
        *   IF `B_match_R` is **not empty**:
            *   Select target `Bt` from `B_match_R`. Change `Bt` -> White.
        *   ELSE: No further changes.

Let's re-check the data for this hypothesis:
*   Ex1: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,1). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**
*   Ex2: W(2x2), R(2x2). Does a blue object match R's shape (2x2)? Yes, at (2,5) and (7,9). Hypothesis predicts B->W (e.g., the one at 7,9). **Matches expected.**
*   Ex3: W(3x3), R(3x3). Does a blue object match R's shape (3x3)? Yes, at (6,7). Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Matches expected.**
*   Ex4: W(1x1), R(1x1). Does a blue object match R's shape (1x1)? Yes, many. Hypothesis predicts B->W. **Still fails.**

I am fundamentally misunderstanding the condition that differentiates Ex1/Ex4 from Ex2/Ex3. It cannot be shape equality or existence of matching blue shapes alone.

What if the white object location relative to the grid matters? Or red?

Let's look at the pixels *changed* in the output compared to the input:
*   Ex1: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).
*   Ex2: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(7,9) coords (1->0).
*   Ex3: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at B obj @(6,7) coords (1->0).
*   Ex4: Pixels at W coords (0->1). Pixels at R coords (2->0).

Rule: W always becomes B. One other object becomes W.
Candidate objects to become W: R, or any B object.
Selection criteria:
IF `shapeW == shapeR`:
  IF ??? : Select R to become W. (Condition true in Ex1, Ex4)
  ELSE : Select a B object (matching shape W? matching shape R?) to become W. (Condition true in Ex2, Ex3)
ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`): (No examples provided for this case!)
  Select a B object (matching shape W first, then shape R?) to become W.

What is the ??? condition?
Is R adjacent to W? Ex1: No. Ex4: No. Ex2: No. Ex3: No.
Is R identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.
Is W identical to a B object in shape? Ex1: Yes. Ex4: Yes. Ex2: Yes. Ex3: Yes. This doesn't differentiate.

Maybe the crucial part is the selection *amongst* the matching blue objects.
If W==R, find all blue objects `Bk` where `shapeBk == shapeW`.
  If this set is empty -> Change R to W. (Never happens in examples).
  If this set is non-empty -> ??? determines if R->W or B->W.
    If R->W (Ex1, Ex4): What's special? In Ex1, only one B matches W. In Ex4, multiple B match W.
    If B->W (Ex2, Ex3): What's special? In Ex2, multiple B match W. In Ex3, only one B matches W.

This is highly ambiguous. Let's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex2/Ex3: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change B->W. This contradicts Ex1/Ex4.
Let's assume the simplest rule that fits Ex1/Ex4: If W==R and a B matching W exists, change R->W. This contradicts Ex2/Ex3.

Possibility: The interpretation of "shape" is wrong. But they look identical.
Possibility: Connectivity matters differently? (Used 8-way).
Possibility: There's a hidden priority (e.g. color transformation order matters).

Let's try the simplest path covering most cases:
Rule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change B->W (choose last/bottom-right if multiple). ELSE change R->W.
*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W (select 7,9). Expected B->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected B->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> B->W. Expected R->W. **Fail.**

Let's try the opposite simple path:
Rule: W->B. If shapeW == shapeR AND a Blue object B exists with shapeB == shapeW, THEN change R->W. ELSE (no matching B exists OR shapeW != shapeR)... need logic for this part. Assume if W!=R, then B->W if match found.
*   Ex1: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**
*   Ex2: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex3: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected B->W. **Fail.**
*   Ex4: W=R, B match exists. Rule -> R->W. Expected R->W. **Pass.**

Neither simple rule works. The differentiating factor is elusive. Reverting to the object-based logic and acknowledging the ambiguity in selection when W==R and B_match_W exists. The safest bet might be the logic from the *second* code attempt, which passed Ex2/Ex3 but failed Ex1/Ex4. Maybe the selection rule for B needs refinement, or there's an edge case for 1x1 or specific positioning causing Ex1/Ex4 to revert to R->W.

Given the conflict, I will document the logic that worked for Ex2/Ex3, explicitly noting the conflict with Ex1/Ex4.

**YAML Facts (Reflecting Logic Attempt Matching Ex2/Ex3)**


```yaml
task_description: Transforms grid by swapping colors based on object shapes. A white object always becomes blue. Either the red object or a blue object becomes white based on shape comparison.

objects:
  - id: W
    color: white (0)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation (relative coords from top-left).
    action: always changes color to blue (1) in output.
  - id: R
    color: red (2)
    property: exactly one per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF shapeW == shapeR AND no blue object Bk exists where shapeBk == shapeW.
      - remains red (2) OTHERWISE.
  - id: B
    color: blue (1)
    property: zero or more per input grid; contiguous (8-way).
    attributes:
      coords: set of (row, col) tuples.
      shape: canonical representation.
    action:
      - one specific blue object Bk changes color to white (0) IF (shapeW == shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW) OR (shapeW != shapeR AND a blue object Bk exists with shapeBk == shapeW).
      - If the above conditions involving shapeW fail, AND shapeW != shapeR, one specific blue object Bj changes to white (0) IF a blue object Bj exists with shapeBj == shapeR.
      - Otherwise, blue objects remain blue (1).

selection_rule_for_B:
  - context: Multiple blue objects match the required shape (shapeW or shapeR).
  - rule: Select the blue object whose top-left bounding box corner (minimum row, then minimum column) is the largest (i.e., furthest down and to the right).

ambiguity_note:
  - The condition for R->W vs B->W when shapeW == shapeR and a matching Blue object exists is unclear. The documented logic assumes B->W in this case (matching Ex2, Ex3), but this contradicts Ex1, Ex4 where R->W occurs under the same apparent conditions. Further differentiating criteria may be missing.

**Natural Language Program (Reflecting Logic Attempt Matching Ex2/Ex3)**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the single contiguous white object (W). Store its coordinates (`W_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeW`).
3.  Identify the single contiguous red object (R). Store its coordinates (`R_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeR`).
4.  Identify all contiguous blue objects ({B}). For each blue object `Bi`, store its coordinates (`Bi_coords`) and calculate its canonical shape (`shapeBi`).
5.  **Mandatory Change:** Change all pixels at `W_coords` in the output grid to blue (1).
6.  Find all blue objects `Bk` from {B} such that `shapeBk == shapeW`. Let this collection be `MatchingW_BlueObjects`.
7.  Find all blue objects `Bj` from {B} such that `shapeBj == shapeR`. Let this collection be `MatchingR_BlueObjects`.
8.  **Conditional Change (Object to become White):**
    a.  **IF `shapeW == shapeR`:**
        i.  IF `MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **empty**:
            Change all pixels at `R_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
        ii. ELSE (`MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **not empty**):
            Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingW_BlueObjects` (e.g., the one with the largest top-left anchor: max row, then max col).
            Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
            *(Note: This step correctly handles Ex2, Ex3, but incorrectly handles Ex1, Ex4 based on expected outputs).*
    b.  **ELSE (`shapeW != shapeR`):**
        i.  IF `MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **not empty**:
            Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingW_BlueObjects` (using the same selection rule).
            Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
        ii. ELSE (`MatchingW_BlueObjects` is **empty**):
            IF `MatchingR_BlueObjects` is **not empty**:
                Select one target object `Bt` from `MatchingR_BlueObjects` (using the same selection rule).
                Change all pixels at `Bt_coords` in the output grid to white (0).
            ELSE:
                No object changes to white (only W changed to blue).
9.  Return the modified output grid.
