objects:
  - color: white (0)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x1)
    action: always changes color to blue (1)
  - color: red (2)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (assumption based on examples)
    shape: variable (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF its shape matches the white object's shape AND no blue object shares that shape.
      - remains unchanged otherwise.
  - color: blue (1)
    property: forms one or more contiguous objects/regions
    shape: variable
    action:
      - one specific blue object changes color to white (0) IF the red object does not change to white.
      - remains unchanged otherwise (except where white pixels become blue).
  - color: green (3)
    property: appears as background or border
    action: remains unchanged

relationships:
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, red object]
    purpose: determines if red object changes to white (Rule A trigger)
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [white object, blue objects]
    purpose: determines if Rule A is overridden; identifies candidate blue object for Rule B
  - type: shape_comparison
    between: [red object, blue objects]
    purpose: identifies candidate blue object for Rule B (if no blue object matches white shape)

transformation_rules:
  - rule: A (Primary Swap)
    condition: shape(white_object) == shape(red_object) AND NOT EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - change red_object pixels to white (0)
  - rule: B (White->Blue, Blue->White)
    condition: shape(white_object) != shape(red_object) OR EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object)
    steps:
      - change white_object pixels to blue (1)
      - leave red_object unchanged
      - find target_blue_object:
          - IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(white_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE IF EXISTS blue_object WHERE shape(blue_object) == shape(red_object):
              target_blue_object = that blue_object
          - ELSE:
              # (Case not observed in examples, default might be no change or error)
              target_blue_object = None
      - IF target_blue_object exists:
          change target_blue_object pixels to white (0)
