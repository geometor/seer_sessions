Key active colors are red (2), white (0), and blue (1).\n2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there appear to be distinct, contiguous objects composed of red pixels and white pixels. There are also objects or regions composed of blue pixels. Often, there seems to be exactly one red object and one white object.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the white object(s) and one other object (either the red object or a blue object).\n    *   **White to Blue:** All white pixels in the input consistently become blue pixels in the output.\n    *   **Something to White:** Exactly one other object changes its color to white.\n4.  **Conditional Change:** The object that changes *to* white depends on a condition related to the shapes of the white and red objects, and the presence of blue objects with specific shapes.\n    *   If the white object and the red object have the exact same shape, *and* no blue object shares this shape, then the red object becomes white.\n    *   Otherwise (if white and red shapes differ, OR if a blue object shares the white object's shape), the red object remains unchanged, and a specific blue object becomes white.\n5.  **Blue Object Selection (if applicable):** When a blue object is chosen to become white, the selection criteria seem to be:\n    *   If a blue object exists with the same shape as the original white object, that blue object is chosen.\n    *   If not, but a blue object exists with the same shape as the red object, that blue object is chosen.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
