Okay, the initial code failed on two examples (2 and 3). The failure mode was consistent: the code changed the red object to white when it should have remained red, and it failed to change a blue region to white. This occurred specifically when the white object and red object had the same shape, and a blue region *also* existed with that same shape.

The root cause, revealed by the `tool_code` analysis, was an incorrect understanding of "blue objects". The `find_objects` function, even with 8-directional connectivity, often found a single large, connected blue region rather than multiple distinct objects. The critical insight is that the transformation rule doesn't necessarily look for a *separate* blue object matching the shape, but rather for a *sub-region* within the blue pixels that matches the required shape.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Initial Hypothesis Error:** The assumption that the relevant blue element would be a disconnected, separate object was incorrect. ARC objects are defined by connectivity, and diagonal connections often merge visually distinct areas into one object.
2.  **Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation logic involves identifying potential sub-regions within the pixels of a specific color (primarily blue) that match the shape of either the white or red object.
3.  **Connectivity:** Using 8-directional connectivity for finding the full extent of colored regions seems appropriate for ARC tasks.
4.  **Sub-region Identification:** The core task is now to implement a reliable way to check if a given shape exists as a contiguous sub-part of a larger colored area.
5.  **Refined Logic:** The decision logic (when to change red vs. when to change blue) depends on the shapes of white and red *and* the existence of a blue sub-region matching the white shape. If shapes match AND no matching blue sub-region exists, red changes. Otherwise, a blue sub-region (matching white shape first, then red shape if necessary) changes.

**Metrics and Verification**

The `tool_code` executions confirmed:
*   Examples 1 & 4 worked with the initial logic because either the shapes didn't match (Ex 4) or they matched but no blue region/sub-region had that shape (Ex 1).
*   Examples 2 & 3 failed because shapes matched (2x2 in Ex2, 3x3 in Ex3) AND a blue sub-region with that same shape existed within the larger blue area. The original code failed to detect this sub-region, incorrectly triggering the "change red to white" rule.
*   The `find_objects` function (both 4-dir and 8-dir) correctly identified the full extent of connected regions based on the connectivity rule used, but this didn't align with the required "sub-region" matching logic.

```yaml
objects:
  - color: white (0)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (W)
    shape: variable, denoted shape(W)
    action: always changes color to blue (1) in the output.
  - color: red (2)
    property: forms a single contiguous object (R)
    shape: variable, denoted shape(R)
    action:
      - changes color to white (0) IF shape(W) == shape(R) AND no sub-region within blue pixels matches shape(W).
      - remains unchanged (red) otherwise.
  - color: blue (1)
    property: forms one or more contiguous regions/pixels (B)
    shape: region is variable; contains potential sub-regions.
    action:
      - A specific sub-region changes color to white (0) IF the red object does not change to white.
      - The sub-region chosen is the first one found that matches shape(W).
      - If no sub-region matches shape(W), the sub-region chosen is the first one found that matches shape(R) (only applicable if shape(W) != shape(R)).
      - Pixels originally white become blue, adding to the blue pixels.
      - Other blue pixels remain unchanged.
  - color: green (3)
    property: background/border
    action: remains unchanged

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the contiguous set of white (0) pixels. Record their coordinates (`W_coords`) and determine their relative shape (`shapeW`).
3.  Identify the contiguous set of red (2) pixels. Record their coordinates (`R_coords`) and determine their relative shape (`shapeR`).
4.  Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Record their coordinates (`B_coords`).
5.  **Mandatory Change:** Change the color of all pixels at `W_coords` to blue (1) in the output grid.
6.  **Conditional Changes:**
    *   **Compare shapes:** Check if `shapeW` is identical to `shapeR`.
    *   **Search for Blue Sub-region matching White:** Check if there exists a sub-set of coordinates within `B_coords` that, when treated as an object, has the shape `shapeW`. Let the first such found sub-set be `TargetB_W`.
    *   **IF** `shapeW` == `shapeR`:
        *   **IF** `TargetB_W` exists (a blue sub-region matching `shapeW` was found):
            *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_W` to white (0) in the output grid.
            *   Leave the red object at `R_coords` unchanged (red).
        *   **ELSE** (`TargetB_W` does not exist):
            *   Change the color of all pixels at `R_coords` to white (0) in the output grid.
    *   **ELSE** (`shapeW` != `shapeR`):
        *   Leave the red object at `R_coords` unchanged (red).
        *   **IF** `TargetB_W` exists:
            *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_W` to white (0) in the output grid.
        *   **ELSE** (`TargetB_W` does not exist):
            *   **Search for Blue Sub-region matching Red:** Check if there exists a sub-set of coordinates within `B_coords` that, when treated as an object, has the shape `shapeR`. Let the first such found sub-set be `TargetB_R`.
            *   **IF** `TargetB_R` exists:
                *   Change the color of all pixels at coordinates `TargetB_R` to white (0) in the output grid.
            *   **(ELSE)** (Neither `TargetB_W` nor `TargetB_R` exists): No further changes are made.
