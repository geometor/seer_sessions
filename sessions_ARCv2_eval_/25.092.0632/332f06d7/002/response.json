            "text": "Okay, the initial code failed on two examples (2 and 3). The failure mode was consistent: the code changed the red object to white when it should have remained red, and it failed to change a blue region to white. This occurred specifically when the white object and red object had the same shape, and a blue region *also* existed with that same shape.\n\nThe root cause, revealed by the `tool_code` analysis, was an incorrect understanding of \"blue objects\". The `find_objects` function, even with 8-directional connectivity, often found a single large, connected blue region rather than multiple distinct objects. The critical insight is that the transformation rule doesn't necessarily look for a *separate* blue object matching the shape, but rather for a *sub-region* within the blue pixels that matches the required shape.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Initial Hypothesis Error:** The assumption that the relevant blue element would be a disconnected, separate object was incorrect. ARC objects are defined by connectivity, and diagonal connections often merge visually distinct areas into one object.\n2.  **Revised Hypothesis:** The transformation logic involves identifying potential sub-regions within the pixels of a specific color (primarily blue) that match the shape of either the white or red object.\n3.  **Connectivity:** Using 8-directional connectivity for finding the full extent of colored regions seems appropriate for ARC tasks.\n4.  **Sub-region Identification:** The core task is now to implement a reliable way to check if a given shape exists as a contiguous sub-part of a larger colored area.\n5.  **Refined Logic:** The decision logic (when to change red vs. when to change blue) depends on the shapes of white and red *and* the existence of a blue sub-region matching the white shape. If shapes match AND no matching blue sub-region exists, red changes. Otherwise, a blue sub-region (matching white shape first, then red shape if necessary) changes.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nThe `tool_code` executions confirmed:\n*   Examples 1 & 4 worked with the initial logic because either the shapes didn't match (Ex 4) or they matched but no blue region/sub-region had that shape (Ex 1).\n*   Examples 2 & 3 failed because shapes matched (2x2 in Ex2, 3x3 in Ex3) AND a blue sub-region with that same shape existed within the larger blue area. The original code failed to detect this sub-region, incorrectly triggering the \"change red to white\" rule.\n*   The `find_objects` function (both 4-dir and 8-dir) correctly identified the full extent of connected regions based on the connectivity rule used, but this didn't align with the required \"sub-region\" matching logic.\n\n**Facts (Revised)**\n\n"
