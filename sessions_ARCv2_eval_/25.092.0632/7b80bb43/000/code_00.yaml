task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size_variable: True
    - colors_present: 2 (background, foreground)
  object_abstraction:
    - type: background_pixels
      properties: [color, position]
    - type: foreground_pixels
      properties: [color, position]
    - type: horizontal_foreground_segments
      properties: [row_index, start_column, end_column, length, color]
      derivation: Contiguous runs of foreground pixels in a row.
  relationships:
    - type: spatial_adjacency
      description: Between segments in the same row.
    - type: gap_between_segments
      properties: [size, content (all background?)]
      derivation: Measured horizontally between the end of one segment and the start of the next in the same row.
    - type: longest_segment_in_row
      derivation: Segment(s) with maximum length within a given row. Tie-breaking uses the leftmost segment.
    - type: right_neighbor_segment
      description: The segment immediately following a given segment in the same row.

      inputs: [grid_copy, longest_segment, right_neighbor_segment, background_color, foreground_color]
      conditions: [gap_size == 3, gap_is_background]
      effect: Modifies grid_copy by changing gap pixels to foreground_color.
transformation_goal:
  - Fill a specific horizontal gap of 3 background pixels with the foreground color in applicable rows.
  - The gap must be immediately to the right of the (leftmost) longest horizontal foreground segment in that row.
