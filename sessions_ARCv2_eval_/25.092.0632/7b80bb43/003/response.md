Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the background color (most frequent) and foreground color (the other color) in the input grid.
2. Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
3. Iterate through each row of the grid.
4. For each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of the foreground color. Record their start column, end column, and length.
5. If a row contains two or more foreground segments:
    a. Find the maximum length among all segments in that row.
    b. Identify the segment(s) with this maximum length. If there's a tie, select the leftmost one (minimum start column). This is the "Target Segment".
    c. Find the "Right Neighbor Segment": the segment whose start column is the smallest value greater than the Target Segment's end column.
    d. If a Right Neighbor Segment exists:
        i. Calculate the gap size between the Target Segment and the Right Neighbor Segment (number of columns between them).
        ii. Check if this gap size is exactly 3.
        iii. Check if all pixels within this 3-pixel gap in the original input grid are the background color.
        iv. If both conditions (gap size is 3 and gap is background color) are met, fill the 3 gap pixels in the copied grid with the foreground color.
6. Return the modified grid copy.
