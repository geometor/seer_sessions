Identify the background color (most frequent) and foreground color (the other color) in the input grid.\n2. Create a copy of the input grid to modify.\n3. Iterate through each row of the grid.\n4. For each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of the foreground color. Record their start column, end column, and length.\n5. If a row contains two or more foreground segments:\n    a. Find the maximum length among all segments in that row.\n    b. Identify the segment(s) with this maximum length. If there's a tie, select the leftmost one (minimum start column).
