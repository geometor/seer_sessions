Scattered within this background are various small objects composed of different colors. A key feature in each input grid is a distinct rectangular region composed entirely of white (0) pixels. This white rectangle also contains some non-white pixels within its boundaries.\n\nThe output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Their background color is consistently white (0). The non-white pixels present in the output grids correspond exactly in color and relative position to the non-white pixels found within the white rectangular region of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid precisely match the dimensions of the white rectangular region identified in the input.\n\nThe core transformation appears to be locating this unique white rectangular subgrid within the larger input grid and extracting it directly to form the output. The surrounding background color and any objects outside this white rectangle in the input are ignored.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
