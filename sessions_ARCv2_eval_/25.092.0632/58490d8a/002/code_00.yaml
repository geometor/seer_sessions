task_description: Identify and extract the content of the largest rectangular area defined by a border of white pixels in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size: Variable.
  - output_grid_size: Variable, determined by the size of the identified white-bordered rectangle.
  - dominant_input_background_color: Varies (green, blue, azure), appears irrelevant to the output.
  - output_background_color: The extracted rectangle retains its original background color, which is white (0) along the border and potentially inside, but can contain other colors.
objects:
  - type: Rectangular Area with White Border
    properties:
      - border_color: All pixels forming the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the rectangle must be white (0).
      - content: Can contain any color pixel, including white (0) and non-white colors.
      - role: Defines the boundaries and content of the output grid.
      - location: Varies within the input grid.
      - key_feature: The largest such rectangle by area (width * height) in the input grid. (Assumed unique maximal based on examples).
  - type: Pixels
    properties:
      - color: Various colors (white, non-white).
      - location: Some are scattered outside the target rectangle (ignored), others are located *inside* or *on the border* of the target rectangle (preserved).
      - role: Pixels inside or on the border of the identified rectangle are copied to the output grid in their relative positions.
transformation:
  - action: Scan the input grid to find all possible rectangular regions.
  - action: For each rectangle, check if all pixels on its four borders (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) are white (0).
  - action: Calculate the area (width * height) for each rectangle confirmed to have an all-white border.
  - action: Select the white-bordered rectangle with the largest area.
  - action: Extract the subgrid defined by the boundaries (inclusive) of the selected rectangle.
  - result: The extracted subgrid, including its internal content and white border, becomes the output grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the dimensions of the largest white-bordered rectangular area found in the input.
  - The content of the output grid is identical to the content within and including the border of the largest white-bordered rectangular area in the input.
