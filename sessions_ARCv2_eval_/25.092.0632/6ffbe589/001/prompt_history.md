*   **Perception:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple non-white elements (pixels or groups of pixels).
    *   One prominent, larger, connected structure or pattern exists in each input, typically surrounded by white space but sometimes near the grid edges.
    *   Other smaller, isolated non-white pixels or small groups may exist elsewhere in the input grid.
    *   The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid.
    *   The output grid contains the prominent structure from the input, seemingly extracted or cropped.
    *   The smaller, isolated elements from the input are absent in the output.
    *   The colors within the extracted structure remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   The shape and relative positions of pixels within the extracted structure are preserved.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Extract the largest contiguous non-white object from the input grid.
    
    elements:
      - role: background
        color: white (0)
      - role: object
        description: Contiguous area of non-white pixels. Multiple objects can exist.
    
    relationships:
      - type: size_comparison
        description: Objects can be compared based on the number of pixels they contain.
      - type: spatial_enclosure
        description: A bounding box can be defined for any object, representing the smallest rectangle containing all its pixels.
    
    actions:
      - name: identify_objects
        description: Find all distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid.
      - name: find_largest_object
        description: Determine which identified object has the greatest number of pixels.
      - name: calculate_bounding_box
        description: Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column coordinates for the largest object.
      - name: extract_subgrid
        description: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box of the largest object.
    
    constraints:
      - If multiple objects share the maximum size, the specific choice might need further clarification, but examples suggest there's usually one clearly largest object.
      - The output grid's dimensions are determined solely by the bounding box of the largest object.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all separate contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) as part of the same block.
    2.  For each identified block (object), count the total number of pixels it contains.
    3.  Select the object that has the largest pixel count.
    4.  Determine the minimum bounding box for this largest object. This means finding the top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, and right-most column occupied by any pixel of this object.
    5.  Create a new grid (the output grid) whose dimensions match the height and width of the calculated bounding box.
    6.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the calculated bounding box region into the corresponding positions in the new output grid.
