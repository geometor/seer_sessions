task_description: Extract the single contiguous non-white object with the most pixels from the input grid.
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
  - role: object_pixel
    description: Any non-white pixel.
  - role: object
    description: A contiguous group of non-white pixels connected horizontally or vertically. Pixels are considered part of the same object if a path exists between them using only horizontal and vertical steps onto adjacent non-white pixels.
properties:
  - object: pixel_count
    description: The total number of non-white pixels comprising the object.
  - object: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle (defined by min/max row/col) enclosing all pixels of the object.
relationships:
  - type: size_comparison
    description: Objects are compared based on their pixel_count.
actions:
  - name: find_objects
    description: Identify all distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid based on 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - name: count_pixels
    description: Calculate the pixel_count for each identified object.
  - name: select_largest_object
    description: Choose the object with the maximum pixel_count. If there's a tie, the behavior is currently undefined by examples but assumed unique or handled implicitly by the search order (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right discovery).
  - name: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Determine the bounding_box coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) for the selected largest object.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box.
constraints:
  - Only non-white pixels are part of objects.
  - Connectivity is strictly horizontal/vertical.
  - The primary selection criterion is the number of pixels in the contiguous object.
  - The output is the subgrid defined by the bounding box of the selected object.
