These border regions remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   Within the main background area, there are scattered pixels and small clusters of various colors.\n    *   The transformation specifically affects these scattered pixels/clusters.\n    *   Comparing input and output, the key observation is the disappearance or modification of pixels in the vicinity of maroon (9) pixels.\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels themselves are removed in the output.\n    *   Pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to maroon pixels are also removed or changed in the output.\n    *   The pixels that are removed/changed are replaced by the dominant background color of the central region (gray=5 in example 1, blue=1 in example 2).\n    *   Pixels not adjacent to any maroon pixel remain unchanged.\n    *   Calculation confirms that the replacement color in each example corresponds to the most frequent color in the respective input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
