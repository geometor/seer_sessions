*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions in both examples.
    *   Both examples feature a large background area filled with one dominant color (gray=5 in example 1, blue=1 in example 2).
    *   There are distinct border regions with different colors in both examples (blue/red/yellow in example 1, red/green/yellow/orange in example 2). These border regions remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   Within the main background area, there are scattered pixels and small clusters of various colors.
    *   The transformation specifically affects these scattered pixels/clusters.
    *   Comparing input and output, the key observation is the disappearance or modification of pixels in the vicinity of maroon (9) pixels.
    *   Maroon (9) pixels themselves are removed in the output.
    *   Pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to maroon pixels are also removed or changed in the output.
    *   The pixels that are removed/changed are replaced by the dominant background color of the central region (gray=5 in example 1, blue=1 in example 2).
    *   Pixels not adjacent to any maroon pixel remain unchanged.
    *   Calculation confirms that the replacement color in each example corresponds to the most frequent color in the respective input grid.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the most frequent pixel color in the input grid; this will be the 'replacement color'.
    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    3.  Identify the locations (row, column) of all maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
    4.  Create a list of all coordinates that need to be changed:
        *   For each identified maroon pixel location `(r, c)`:
            *   Add the location `(r, c)` itself to the list.
            *   Add the locations of its 8 neighbors (i.e., `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+1, c+1)`) to the list, making sure these coordinates are within the bounds of the grid.
    5.  Remove duplicate coordinates from the list of coordinates to be changed (e.g., by converting to a set and back).
    6.  For each coordinate `(r_change, c_change)` in the final list:
        *   Update the pixel value at `(r_change, c_change)` in the output grid to the 'replacement color' determined in step 1.
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
