            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids maintain the same dimensions and share a common border color that frames the grid and divides the interior into four distinct rectangular regions or panels.\n2.  **Regions:** There are consistently four panels arranged horizontally, separated by single columns of the border color. Let's label them Panel 1, Panel 2, Panel 3, and Panel 4 from left to right.\n3.  **Background Color:** Within the panels (excluding the border), there's a predominant background color (e.g., yellow in example 1, azure in example 2).\n4.  **Patterns:** Each panel (except sometimes Panel 4 in the input) contains a pattern made of non-background colors. These patterns seem to be the key objects being manipulated.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** Comparing input and output grids, Panels 1, 2, and 3 appear unchanged. The transformation exclusively affects Panel 4.\n6.  **Panel 4 Transformation:** The pattern in Panel 4 of the output seems to be a composite derived from the patterns in Panel 2 and Panel 3 of the input. Specifically, it looks like the pattern from Panel 2 is overlaid with the pattern from Panel 3. Where the patterns overlap (i.e., both Panel 2 and Panel 3 have a non-background pixel at the same relative position), the color from Panel 3's pattern seems to take precedence in the output Panel 4 (observed in example 4).\n7.  **Consistency:** This pattern of copying Panels 1-3 and combining the patterns of Panels 2 and 3 to create Panel 4 holds across all training examples, regardless of the specific colors used for the border, background, or patterns.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the border color (the color of the single-pixel frame and vertical separators).\n3.  Identify the four rectangular regions separated by the border color columns. Determine their boundaries (top-left and bottom-right corners). Let these be Region 1, Region 2, Region 3, and Region 4 from left to right.\n4.  Determine the primary background color found within the regions (ignoring the border color and pattern colors).\n5.  Isolate the pattern from Region 2: Create a list of `(relative_row, relative_col, color)` tuples for all pixels within Region 2 whose color is *not* the background color. `relative_row` and `relative_col` are offsets from the top-left corner of Region 2.\n6.  Isolate the pattern from Region 3: Create a similar list of `(relative_row, relative_col, color)` tuples for all pixels within Region 3 whose color is *not* the background color.\n7.  Get the top-left corner coordinates `(r4_start, c4_start)` of Region 4.\n8.  Clear Region 4 in the output grid: Iterate through all cells within the bounds of Region 4 in the output grid and set their color to the background color.\n9.  Apply the pattern from Region 2 to Region 4: Iterate through the list created in step 5. For each `(rel_r, rel_c, color)`, set the pixel at `(r4_start + rel_r, c4_start + rel_c)` in the output grid to `color`.\n10. Apply the pattern from Region 3 to Region 4: Iterate through the list created in step 6. For each `(rel_r, rel_c, color)`, set the pixel at `(r4_start + rel_r, c4_start + rel_c)` in the output grid to `color`. This step overwrites any pixels previously set by step 9 if the relative coordinates match.\n11. The modified grid is the final output."
