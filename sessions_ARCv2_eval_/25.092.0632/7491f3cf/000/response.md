Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids maintain the same dimensions and share a common border color that frames the grid and divides the interior into four distinct rectangular regions or panels.
2.  **Regions:** There are consistently four panels arranged horizontally, separated by single columns of the border color. Let's label them Panel 1, Panel 2, Panel 3, and Panel 4 from left to right.
3.  **Background Color:** Within the panels (excluding the border), there's a predominant background color (e.g., yellow in example 1, azure in example 2).
4.  **Patterns:** Each panel (except sometimes Panel 4 in the input) contains a pattern made of non-background colors. These patterns seem to be the key objects being manipulated.
5.  **Transformation Focus:** Comparing input and output grids, Panels 1, 2, and 3 appear unchanged. The transformation exclusively affects Panel 4.
6.  **Panel 4 Transformation:** The pattern in Panel 4 of the output seems to be a composite derived from the patterns in Panel 2 and Panel 3 of the input. Specifically, it looks like the pattern from Panel 2 is overlaid with the pattern from Panel 3. Where the patterns overlap (i.e., both Panel 2 and Panel 3 have a non-background pixel at the same relative position), the color from Panel 3's pattern seems to take precedence in the output Panel 4 (observed in example 4).
7.  **Consistency:** This pattern of copying Panels 1-3 and combining the patterns of Panels 2 and 3 to create Panel 4 holds across all training examples, regardless of the specific colors used for the border, background, or patterns.

**Facts**


```yaml
# Overall Grid Structure
grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width
    - has_border: True # A consistent color forms a 1-pixel border around the grid and vertical separators
    - border_color: variable # Changes between examples (gray, blue, magenta, yellow)
    - separator_columns: True # Columns of the border color divide the inner area
    - num_regions: 4 # The separators create four distinct rectangular regions/panels

# Regions/Panels (Panel 1, 2, 3, 4 from left-to-right)
regions:
  properties:
    - background_color: consistent_within_task # A single color acts as the background within all panels for a given task (yellow, azure, maroon, white)
    - contain_patterns: True # Panels contain distinct shapes/patterns made of non-background colors
  relationships:
    - panel_1_output: identical_to_input
    - panel_2_output: identical_to_input
    - panel_3_output: identical_to_input
    - panel_4_output: derived_from_input_panels

# Patterns (Non-background pixels within a region)
patterns:
  properties:
    - color: variable
    - shape: variable
  actions:
    - extract_pattern_2: Identify non-background pixels in input Panel 2 relative to Panel 2's origin.
    - extract_pattern_3: Identify non-background pixels in input Panel 3 relative to Panel 3's origin.
    - apply_pattern_2_to_panel_4: Place extracted Pattern 2 onto output Panel 4 (relative to Panel 4's origin) over the background color.
    - apply_pattern_3_to_panel_4: Place extracted Pattern 3 onto output Panel 4 (relative to Panel 4's origin), overwriting any existing pixels (including those from Pattern 2).

# Transformation Summary
transformation:
  description: Copy Panels 1, 2, and 3. Construct Panel 4 by overlaying the pattern from Panel 2 and then the pattern from Panel 3 onto the background color within the bounds of Panel 4.
  panel_4_rule: Output_Panel4 = Background + Pattern2 + Pattern3 (Pattern3 overwrites Pattern2 on overlap)

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid initially.
2.  Identify the border color (the color of the single-pixel frame and vertical separators).
3.  Identify the four rectangular regions separated by the border color columns. Determine their boundaries (top-left and bottom-right corners). Let these be Region 1, Region 2, Region 3, and Region 4 from left to right.
4.  Determine the primary background color found within the regions (ignoring the border color and pattern colors).
5.  Isolate the pattern from Region 2: Create a list of `(relative_row, relative_col, color)` tuples for all pixels within Region 2 whose color is *not* the background color. `relative_row` and `relative_col` are offsets from the top-left corner of Region 2.
6.  Isolate the pattern from Region 3: Create a similar list of `(relative_row, relative_col, color)` tuples for all pixels within Region 3 whose color is *not* the background color.
7.  Get the top-left corner coordinates `(r4_start, c4_start)` of Region 4.
8.  Clear Region 4 in the output grid: Iterate through all cells within the bounds of Region 4 in the output grid and set their color to the background color.
9.  Apply the pattern from Region 2 to Region 4: Iterate through the list created in step 5. For each `(rel_r, rel_c, color)`, set the pixel at `(r4_start + rel_r, c4_start + rel_c)` in the output grid to `color`.
10. Apply the pattern from Region 3 to Region 4: Iterate through the list created in step 6. For each `(rel_r, rel_c, color)`, set the pixel at `(r4_start + rel_r, c4_start + rel_c)` in the output grid to `color`. This step overwrites any pixels previously set by step 9 if the relative coordinates match.
11. The modified grid is the final output.
