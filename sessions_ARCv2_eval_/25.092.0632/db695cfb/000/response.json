Additionally, new blue pixels appear in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves adding new blue pixels that form straight line segments connecting certain key points.\n    *   If magenta pixels are present in the input, lines are drawn from each magenta pixel to every blue pixel.\n    *   If no magenta pixels are present in the input, lines are drawn between every pair of blue pixels.\n    *   The pixels along these lines (excluding the endpoints) are colored blue. Where lines overlap, the pixel remains blue.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
