task_description: Draw lines between specified points and color the path pixels blue.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Represents a value from 0-9 mapped to specific colors.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid.

identified_objects:
  - object: background_pixel
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid. Remains unchanged in the output.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray-5, azure-8, yellow-4).
  - object: blue_pixel
    description: Represents target points or connection points.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - count: One or more in the input.
      - role: Endpoint for line drawing. Remains blue in the output.
  - object: magenta_pixel
    description: Represents source points for line drawing.
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - count: Zero or more in the input.
      - role: Starting point for line drawing when present. Remains magenta in the output.
  - object: path_pixel
    description: Pixels lying on the straight line between designated start and end points, excluding the endpoints themselves.
    properties:
      - color: Initially the background color.
      - role: Becomes blue (1) in the output grid as part of the transformation.

relationships_and_actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - background_color
      - list_of_blue_pixel_locations
      - list_of_magenta_pixel_locations
  - action: conditional_line_drawing
    description: Based on the presence of magenta pixels, determine which pairs of points to connect.
    condition: magenta_pixels_exist
    if_true:
      action: draw_lines
      parameters:
        start_points: list_of_magenta_pixel_locations
        end_points: list_of_blue_pixel_locations
        line_pairs: Each magenta pixel connects to every blue pixel.
    if_false:
      action: draw_lines
      parameters:
        start_points: list_of_blue_pixel_locations
        end_points: list_of_blue_pixel_locations
        line_pairs: Every blue pixel connects to every other blue pixel (all unique pairs).
  - action: draw_lines
    description: For each specified pair of start and end points, calculate the intermediate pixels forming a straight line between them.
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - start_point_location
      - end_point_location
    outputs:
      - list_of_path_pixel_locations (excluding start and end)
    details: Uses a line drawing algorithm (e.g., Bresenham's) to find integer coordinates along the path.
  - action: color_pixels
    description: Change the color of the identified path pixels to blue.
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
      - list_of_all_path_pixel_locations
    outputs:
      - modified_output_grid
    details: Sets the color of pixels at the specified locations to blue (1). Existing blue or magenta pixels are not changed by this step if they happen to fall on a path calculation (though path pixels exclude endpoints).
