            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct rectangular subgrids (segments). These segments appear to be consistently 5x5 pixels in size across the examples.\n2.  **Separators:** The segments in the input are separated by lines (rows or columns) composed entirely of the magenta color (6). The background color within the segments is orange (7).\n3.  **Content:** Each segment contains a shape made of a single color (other than magenta or orange) placed on the orange background.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to rearrange these segments from the input grid into a new configuration in the output grid, using the same magenta color as a separator between the rearranged segments.\n5.  **Arrangement Rules:** The rearrangement logic depends on how the segments are arranged in the input:\n    *   **Input 2x2 Grid (train_1):** If the input has segments arranged in a 2x2 grid (separated by one magenta row and one magenta column), the output stacks these segments vertically. The order of stacking is specific: top-left, bottom-right, top-right, bottom-left. Magenta rows are used as separators in the output.\n    *   **Input Vertical Stack (train_2):** If the input segments are stacked vertically (separated by magenta rows), the output arranges them horizontally. The order is reversed compared to the input (bottom segment becomes leftmost, top segment becomes rightmost). Magenta columns are used as separators in the output.\n    *   **Input Horizontal Row (train_3):** If the input segments are arranged horizontally (separated by magenta columns), the output stacks them vertically. The order is preserved (left segment becomes topmost, right segment becomes bottommost). Magenta rows are used as separators in the output.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consists of the extracted segments rearranged according to the specific rule, with single magenta lines (rows or columns) separating them.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Store these segments along with their original positions (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right for 2x2; top, middle, bottom for vertical; left, middle, right for horizontal).\n4.  **Rearrange Segments:**\n    *   **If the input layout was '2x2 grid':** Create a new grid by stacking the segments vertically in the following order: top-left, bottom-right, top-right, bottom-left. Insert a single row of magenta pixels between each pair of stacked segments.\n    *   **If the input layout was 'vertical stack':** Create a new grid by arranging the segments horizontally. The order must be reversed from the input order (e.g., bottom segment first, then middle, then top). Insert a single column of magenta pixels between each pair of horizontally arranged segments.\n    *   **If the input layout was 'horizontal row':** Create a new grid by stacking the segments vertically. The order must be the same as the input order (e.g., left segment first, then middle, then right). Insert a single row of magenta pixels between each pair of stacked segments.\n5.  **Return Output Grid:** The newly constructed grid is the final output."
