Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in all input and output grids is azure (8). This serves as the background.
2.  **Key Input Colors:** The significant colors in the input grids, besides the background, are green (3), blue (1), and red (2).
3.  **Green Pixel:** In each input example, there is exactly one green (3) pixel. Its position varies.
4.  **Blue/Red Patterns:** The input grids contain patterns (often lines or segments) composed of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
5.  **Output Transformation 1 (Color Change):** Comparing inputs and outputs, all blue (1) pixels in the input are changed to red (2) in the output. Original red (2) pixels remain red (2).
6.  **Output Transformation 2 (Green Extension):** The single green (3) pixel from the input remains in the output. Additionally, new green (3) pixels appear in the output, forming lines extending horizontally and vertically from the original green pixel's location.
7.  **Extension Rule:** These green lines extend outwards from the original green pixel, overwriting the background azure (8) pixels. The extension stops just *before* hitting a red (2) pixel (either an original red pixel or a blue pixel that was transformed to red) or the boundary of the grid. The red pixels act as barriers.

**YAML Facts:**

task_description: "Change all blue pixels to red. Then, find the single green pixel and extend green lines horizontally and vertically from it, stopping at grid boundaries or red pixels."

    role: Obstacles for green line extension. Preserved in output.
  - id: transformable_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the working output grid.
2.  Iterate through every cell of the working output grid. If a cell contains blue (1), change its value to red (2).
3.  Locate the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the single green (3) pixel in the original input grid.
4.  **Extend Upwards:** Starting from the cell directly above the green pixel (`r-1`, `c`), move upwards row by row towards row 0. For each cell encountered:
    *   If the cell is outside the grid boundaries or contains red (2), stop extending upwards.
    *   If the cell contains azure (8), change it to green (3) in the working output grid and continue upwards.
5.  **Extend Downwards:** Starting from the cell directly below the green pixel (`r+1`, `c`), move downwards row by row towards the bottom boundary. For each cell encountered:
    *   If the cell is outside the grid boundaries or contains red (2), stop extending downwards.
    *   If the cell contains azure (8), change it to green (3) in the working output grid and continue downwards.
6.  **Extend Leftwards:** Starting from the cell directly to the left of the green pixel (`r`, `c-1`), move leftwards column by column towards column 0. For each cell encountered:
    *   If the cell is outside the grid boundaries or contains red (2), stop extending leftwards.
    *   If the cell contains azure (8), change it to green (3) in the working output grid and continue leftwards.
7.  **Extend Rightwards:** Starting from the cell directly to the right of the green pixel (`r`, `c+1`), move rightwards column by column towards the right boundary. For each cell encountered:
    *   If the cell is outside the grid boundaries or contains red (2), stop extending rightwards.
    *   If the cell contains azure (8), change it to green (3) in the working output grid and continue rightwards.
8.  Return the final working output grid.
