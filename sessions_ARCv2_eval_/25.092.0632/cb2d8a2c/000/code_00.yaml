task_description: "Change all blue pixels to red. Then, find the single green pixel and extend green lines horizontally and vertically from it, stopping at grid boundaries or red pixels."
grid_properties:
  background_color: 8 # azure
objects:
  - id: origin_marker
    color: 3 # green
    count: 1
    role: Starting point for line extension. Preserved in output.
  - id: barrier_pixels
    color: 2 # red
    role: Obstacles for green line extension. Preserved in output.
  - id: transformable_pixels
    color: 1 # blue
    role: Changed to red (2) in the output, becoming barrier_pixels.
