These objects consist of a rectangular frame (1 pixel thick) of a specific color, enclosing a solid rectangular core of a different color.\n3.  **Object Frames:** The frame colors observed are consistently either azure (8) or red (2).\n4.  **Object Cores:** The core colors vary (gray, blue, green, maroon, magenta, yellow, etc.).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the horizontal position of these objects. The objects themselves (frame, core color, shape) remain unchanged.\n6.  **Movement Rule:** The direction of movement depends solely on the *frame color* of the object:\n    *   Objects with an **azure (8)** frame move horizontally to the **left edge** of the grid.\n    *   Objects with a **red (2)** frame move horizontally to the **right edge** of the grid.\n7.  **Constraints:** The vertical position of each object remains unchanged. Objects move until their relevant edge (left for azure, right for red) touches the grid boundary. The background is preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
