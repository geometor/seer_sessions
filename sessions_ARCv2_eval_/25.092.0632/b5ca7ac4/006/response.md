**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: moving framed objects horizontally based on frame color (Azure/8 left, Red/2 right). However, the execution results reveal a flaw in the implementation strategy. The previous code incorrectly initialized the output grid with only the background color and then drew the moved objects. This erased any static elements or parts of the grid not belonging to the identified movable objects.

The correct approach should be to preserve the original grid structure and only modify the positions of the specific framed objects. Some objects also seem to have been missed entirely during the identification phase in Example 1, indicating a potential issue in the object detection logic (`_find_objects`) or its interaction with the `visited` array, particularly concerning how validation failures are handled.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Modify Output Grid Handling:** Change the `transform` function to initialize the `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  **Implement Erase Step:** Before drawing an object at its new location, explicitly erase its original bounding box in the `output_grid` by filling it with the `background_color`.
3.  **Refine Object Finding/Validation:** Review the `_find_objects` function, specifically the validation logic (`is_valid_object`) and how the `visited` array is updated, especially when an initially detected component fails validation. Ensure that partial or invalid frame components don't prevent later valid objects from being found. Ensure the BFS correctly identifies the full extent of the frame before validation.
4.  **Draw Moved Object:** Draw the object's `subgrid` at the calculated new position onto the modified `output_grid`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid; this will serve as the initial state of the output grid.
2.  Determine the background color of the grid (e.g., from the top-left pixel, with checks if it's a frame color).
3.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid that meet the following criteria:
    *   Minimum size of 3x3 pixels.
    *   Have a perfect, 1-pixel thick rectangular frame that is entirely colored either red (2) or azure (8).
    *   Have a solid rectangular core completely enclosed by the frame.
    *   The core color is different from both the frame color and the background color.
4.  For each identified object:
    a.  Record its original pixel values (as a subgrid) and its bounding box coordinates (top row, bottom row, left column, right column) from the *input* grid.
    b.  Determine the object's frame color.
    c.  Fill the area defined by the object's original bounding box in the *output* grid with the background color.
    d.  Calculate the target top row, which is the same as the original top row.
    e.  Calculate the target left column based on the frame color:
        i.  If the frame color is azure (8), the target left column is 0.
        ii. If the frame color is red (2), the target left column is `grid_width - object_width`.
    f.  Copy (draw) the recorded pixel values (subgrid) of the object onto the *output* grid, starting at the calculated target top row and target left column.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
