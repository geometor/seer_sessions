            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept: moving framed objects horizontally based on frame color (Azure/8 left, Red/2 right). However, the execution results reveal a flaw in the implementation strategy. The previous code incorrectly initialized the output grid with only the background color and then drew the moved objects. This erased any static elements or parts of the grid not belonging to the identified movable objects.\n\nThe correct approach should be to preserve the original grid structure and only modify the positions of the specific framed objects. Some objects also seem to have been missed entirely during the identification phase in Example 1, indicating a potential issue in the object detection logic (`_find_objects`) or its interaction with the `visited` array, particularly concerning how validation failures are handled.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Modify Output Grid Handling:** Change the `transform` function to initialize the `output_grid` as a direct copy of the `input_grid`.\n2.  **Implement Erase Step:** Before drawing an object at its new location, explicitly erase its original bounding box in the `output_grid` by filling it with the `background_color`.\n3.  **Refine Object Finding/Validation:** Review the `_find_objects` function, specifically the validation logic (`is_valid_object`) and how the `visited` array is updated, especially when an initially detected component fails validation. Ensure that partial or invalid frame components don't prevent later valid objects from being found. Ensure the BFS correctly identifies the full extent of the frame before validation.\n4.  **Draw Moved Object:** Draw the object's `subgrid` at the calculated new position onto the modified `output_grid`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
