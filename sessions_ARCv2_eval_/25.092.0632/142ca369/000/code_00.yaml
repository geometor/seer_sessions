Examples: 3
Grid_Size: Variable (e.g., 20x20, 18x18)
Colors: white(0), blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7) - subset used in each example.

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Contiguous shapes or individual pixels.
  - Colors: Various non-white colors.
  - Persistence: All input objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

Output_Objects:
  - Includes all input objects.
  - Additional pixels forming diagonal lines.

Actions:
  - For each non-white pixel in the input grid:
    - Action: Emit a diagonal line.
    - Direction: Downwards and to the right (+1 row, +1 column).
    - Color: Same as the emitting pixel.
    - Termination_Condition_1: Line reaches a grid boundary (bottom or right edge).
    - Termination_Condition_2: Line reaches a cell that was non-white in the *input* grid (stops *before* this cell).

Relationships:
  - The added diagonal lines originate *from* the input non-white pixels.
  - The path of a diagonal line is constrained by the positions of *other* non-white pixels in the *input* grid.
  - The final output grid is a combination of the original input pixels and the newly added diagonal line pixels.
