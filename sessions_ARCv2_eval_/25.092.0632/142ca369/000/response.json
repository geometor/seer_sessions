            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects or individual pixels scattered across the grid. These objects retain their original shapes and positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding new pixels to the grid. These new pixels form diagonal lines extending downwards and to the right from *each* non-white pixel present in the input grid.\n4.  **Line Behavior:**\n    *   The diagonal line originating from a pixel at `(r, c)` starts at `(r+1, c+1)`.\n    *   The line uses the same color as the originating pixel.\n    *   The line continues diagonally (`r+k, c+k`) as long as it stays within the grid boundaries.\n    *   Crucially, the line stops *before* overwriting any pixel that was *already* non-white in the *input* grid. If the path encounters a non-white pixel from the input, the line terminates just before that pixel.\n    *   If the path reaches the bottom or right edge of the grid, it stops there.\n5.  **Overlapping Lines:** The examples don't show conflicts where two different colored lines attempt to color the same initially white pixel. The rule seems deterministic based on checking the *input* grid state for blocking.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Begin a loop that continues as long as `next_row` is within the grid's height and `next_col` is within the grid's width.\n    c.

Set the color of the cell at (`next_row`, `next_col`) in the *output* grid to color `C`.\n        ii. Increment `next_row` by 1 and `next_col` by 1 to move to the next diagonal position.\n    e.

Stop tracing this specific diagonal line immediately (break out of the inner loop starting at step 3b).\n    f. Continue the loop (step 3b) until it terminates due to boundary checks or encountering a non-white input cell.\n4.  After iterating through all cells of the input grid, return the modified output grid."
