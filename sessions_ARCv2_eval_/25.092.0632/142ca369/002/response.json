            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core action: projecting diagonal lines downwards and to the right from each non-white source pixel. However, it failed to accurately implement the stopping condition. The results show that the generated lines continued even when they encountered coordinates that corresponded to non-white pixels in the *original input grid*. The lines should have terminated *before* reaching such coordinates.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the line-drawing logic to check, at each step of the diagonal projection (`nr`, `nc`), whether the corresponding cell in the *original input grid* (`input_grid[nr, nc]`) is non-white (value > 0). If it is, the line projection from the current source pixel must stop immediately *before* drawing at `(nr, nc)`. If `input_grid[nr, nc]` is white (value == 0), the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output grid* can be colored, and the projection continues to the next diagonal step (`nr+1`, `nc+1`).\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\n"
