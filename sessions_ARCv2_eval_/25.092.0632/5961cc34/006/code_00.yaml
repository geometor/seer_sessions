task_context:
  background_color: 8 (azure)
  output_color: 2 (red)
  pattern_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green)]
  marker_colors: [4 (yellow), 2 (red)] # Red marker below yellow is implicit in examples
  grid_dimensions: variable

observations:
  - element: pattern_objects
    description: Connected components composed of pattern_colors (blue or green). Considered connected if pixels share an edge (not diagonal). Blue and Green pixels connect to each other within a component.
    properties:
      - count: The number of distinct pattern_objects in the input grid.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a single pattern_object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
    relationship: The transformation rule depends on the 'count' property.

  - element: marker_object_yellow
    description: A single yellow (4) pixel, typically near the bottom of the grid.
    properties:
      - column_index: The column where the yellow pixel resides.
    relationship: Used only when the count of pattern_objects is exactly 1 to determine the output column.

  - element: output_grid
    description: The result of the transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Same as the input grid.
      - background: Same as input background (azure, 8).
      - foreground: Pixels colored with the output_color (red, 2).
    relationship:
      - If pattern_object count is 1: Foreground is a single vertical line of red (2) spanning the full height of the grid in the column specified by marker_object_yellow.column_index.
      - If pattern_object count is > 1: For each individual pattern_object, fill its calculated bounding_box area in the output grid with red (2).
      - If pattern_object count is 0: The output grid remains entirely the background color.
