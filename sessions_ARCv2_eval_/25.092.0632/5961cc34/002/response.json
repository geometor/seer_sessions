            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the two main transformation scenarios based on the count of \"pattern objects\" (connected blue/green components). The logic for the single-object case (fill marker column) worked correctly, as shown by Example 1 passing. However, the logic for the multi-object case failed in Examples 2, 3, and 4. The error stems from calculating the *union* of the bounding boxes of all pattern objects and filling that single large rectangle. The expected outputs clearly show that the bounding box of *each individual* pattern object should be filled separately.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    Modify the logic for the multi-object case. Instead of calculating the union bounding box, iterate through each identified pattern object, calculate its individual bounding box, and fill that specific rectangular area in the output grid with the output color (red, 2).\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Pattern Objects Count: 1\n        *   Yellow Marker Column: 8\n        *   Result: Correct (Filled column 8 red).\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Pattern Objects Count: 4 (Two \"plus\" shapes, two \"L\" shapes)\n        *   Yellow Marker Column: 10\n        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 3-16 and columns 2-21 and filled it red.\n        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the four objects.\n        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of four smaller boxes).\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Pattern Objects Count: 3 (Two \"plus\" shapes, one rotated \"T\" shape)\n        *   Yellow Marker Column: 16\n        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 2-17 and columns 2-20 and filled it red.\n        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the three objects.\n        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of three smaller boxes).\n    *   **Example 4:**\n        *   Pattern Objects Count: 2 (One \"plus\" shape, one rotated \"T\" shape)\n        *   Yellow Marker Column: 5\n        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 3-14 and columns 2-16 and filled it red.\n        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the two objects.\n        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of two smaller boxes).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
