*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the two main transformation scenarios based on the count of "pattern objects" (connected blue/green components). The logic for the single-object case (fill marker column) worked correctly, as shown by Example 1 passing. However, the logic for the multi-object case failed in Examples 2, 3, and 4. The error stems from calculating the *union* of the bounding boxes of all pattern objects and filling that single large rectangle. The expected outputs clearly show that the bounding box of *each individual* pattern object should be filled separately.

*   **Strategy for Resolution:**
    Modify the logic for the multi-object case. Instead of calculating the union bounding box, iterate through each identified pattern object, calculate its individual bounding box, and fill that specific rectangular area in the output grid with the output color (red, 2).

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**

    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Pattern Objects Count: 1
        *   Yellow Marker Column: 8
        *   Result: Correct (Filled column 8 red).
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Pattern Objects Count: 4 (Two "plus" shapes, two "L" shapes)
        *   Yellow Marker Column: 10
        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 3-16 and columns 2-21 and filled it red.
        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the four objects.
        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of four smaller boxes).
    *   **Example 3:**
        *   Pattern Objects Count: 3 (Two "plus" shapes, one rotated "T" shape)
        *   Yellow Marker Column: 16
        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 2-17 and columns 2-20 and filled it red.
        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the three objects.
        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of three smaller boxes).
    *   **Example 4:**
        *   Pattern Objects Count: 2 (One "plus" shape, one rotated "T" shape)
        *   Yellow Marker Column: 5
        *   Current Incorrect Logic: Calculated the union bounding box covering rows 3-14 and columns 2-16 and filled it red.
        *   Expected Logic: Fill the individual bounding boxes of the two objects.
        *   Result: Incorrect (Filled a large union box instead of two smaller boxes).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      background_color: 8 (azure)
      output_color: 2 (red)
      pattern_colors: [1 (blue), 3 (green)]
      marker_colors: [4 (yellow), 2 (red)] # Red markers below yellow seem irrelevant to the transformation logic itself but confirm the output color.
      grid_dimensions: variable

    observations:
      - element: pattern_objects
        description: Connected components composed of pattern_colors (blue or green). Considered connected if pixels share an edge (not diagonal). Blue and Green pixels connect to each other within the same component.
        properties:
          - count: The number of distinct pattern_objects in the input grid.
          - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a single pattern_object.
        relationship: The transformation rule depends on the 'count' property.

      - element: marker_objects
        description: A single yellow (4) pixel usually located near the bottom of the grid.
        properties:
          - column_index: The column where the yellow (4) marker pixel resides.
          - target_color: Implied by red pixels below yellow marker, corresponds to output_color (red, 2).
        relationship: Used only when the count of pattern_objects is exactly 1 to determine the output column.

      - element: output_grid
        description: The result of the transformation.
        properties:
          - dimensions: Same as the input grid.
          - background: Same as input background (azure, 8).
          - foreground: Pixels colored with the target_color (red, 2).
        relationship:
          - If pattern_object count is 1: Foreground is a single vertical line of red (2) spanning the full height of the grid in the column specified by the yellow marker_object's column_index.
          - If pattern_object count is > 1: For each individual pattern_object, its bounding_box is calculated, and that rectangular area is filled with red (2) in the output grid. The final output is the combination of all these filled individual bounding boxes.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, then change all non-background (non-azure) pixels to the background color (azure, 8).
    2.  Identify all distinct connected components ("pattern objects") where connectivity includes adjacent (non-diagonal) pixels colored blue (1) or green (3). Treat blue and green pixels equivalently for finding components. Count these components.
    3.  **If** the number of pattern objects is exactly 1:
        a.  Find the column index containing the yellow (4) marker pixel.
        b.  Fill the entire identified column in the output grid with red (2).
    4.  **Else if** the number of pattern objects is greater than 1:
        a.  For **each** identified pattern object:
            i.  Determine its minimum bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).
            ii. Iterate through all cells within this *individual* bounding box and set the corresponding cell in the output grid to red (2).
    5.  Return the final output grid.
