Check all pixels that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any pixel within that gray component.\n2. If any of these adjacent pixels in the input grid has the color orange (7), then all pixels belonging to that specific gray component are changed to orange (7) in the output grid.\n3. If a gray component has no adjacent orange pixels, it remains unchanged in the output grid.\n4. All other pixels (background, white borders, pixels of other colors not involved in this interaction) retain their original color from the input grid.\n\nNote: This rule addresses the consistent gray-to-orange conversion observed. Some examples contain additional changes (e.g., near borders or involving other colors) that are not covered by this primary rule and might represent noise or a secondary, less clear transformation. This implementation focuses on the dominant gray/orange interaction.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the gray-to-orange transformation based on adjacency.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    H, W = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Define 8-way connectivity structure\n    structure = np.array([[1, 1, 1],\n                          [1, 1, 1],\n                          [1, 1, 1]], dtype=bool)\n\n    # Create a mask for gray pixels (color 5)\n    gray_mask = (input_grid == 5)\n\n    # Label connected components of gray pixels\n    labeled_array, num_features = label(gray_mask, structure=structure)\n\n    # Iterate through each found gray component\n    for i in range(num_features):\n        label_id = i + 1  # Labels start from 1\n        \n        # Create a mask for the current component\n        component_mask = (labeled_array == label_id)\n        \n        # Get the coordinates of pixels in the current component\n        component_coords = np.argwhere(component_mask) # list of [r, c]\n\n        # Check if any pixel in this component is adjacent to an orange pixel (color 7)\n        is_adjacent_to_orange = False\n        for r, c in component_coords:\n            # Check 8 neighbours\n            for dr in range(-1, 2):\n                for dc in range(-1, 2):\n                    # Skip the center pixel itself\n                    if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                        continue\n                    \n                    # Calculate neighbour coordinates\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    \n                    # Check if neighbour is within grid bounds\n                    if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W:\n                        # Check if the neighbour is orange\n                        if input_grid[nr, nc] == 7:\n                            is_adjacent_to_orange = True\n                            break # Found adjacent orange, no need to check more neighbours for this component pixel (r, c)\n            \n            if is_adjacent_to_orange:\n                break # Found adjacent orange, no need to check other pixels in this component\n\n        # If the component was adjacent to orange, change all its pixels to orange in the output grid\n        if is_adjacent_to_orange:\n            output_grid[component_mask] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
