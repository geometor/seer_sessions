The background color is primarily magenta (6), sometimes with maroon (9) lines acting as dividers.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The main objects of interest are contiguous areas enclosed by white (0) pixels. Inside these enclosures, we find pixels of gray (5) and orange (7).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation primarily occurs *within* the white-enclosed areas. Specifically, it involves an interaction between orange (7) pixels and gray (5) pixels.\n4.  **Interaction Rule:** If a connected component of gray (5) pixels (connected orthogonally or diagonally) is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* orange (7) pixel within the same white-enclosed area, then *all* pixels belonging to that gray component change their color to orange (7).\n5.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency and connectivity (8-way, including diagonals) are crucial for determining which gray pixels are affected. A gray component is treated as a single unit for the color change.\n6.  **No Interaction:** Gray components within a white enclosure that are *not* adjacent to any orange pixel within that same enclosure remain unchanged. Pixels outside the white enclosures (background, dividing lines, etc.) also remain unchanged.\n7.  **Anomalies:** Examples `train_1` and `train_3` show some changes outside the white-enclosed areas (specifically in row 2 of both outputs) and an anomalous change within a white area in `train_1` (pixel (3,1)) that don't fit the primary interaction rule identified. These might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a secondary, less obvious rule. However, the orange-gray interaction within white boundaries is consistent across all relevant areas in `train_2`, `train_3`, and one area of `train_1`. The plan focuses on this dominant, consistent pattern.\n\n## Facts\n\n```"
