## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The background color is primarily magenta (6), sometimes with maroon (9) lines acting as dividers.
2.  **Key Objects:** The main objects of interest are contiguous areas enclosed by white (0) pixels. Inside these enclosures, we find pixels of gray (5) and orange (7).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation primarily occurs *within* the white-enclosed areas. Specifically, it involves an interaction between orange (7) pixels and gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Interaction Rule:** If a connected component of gray (5) pixels (connected orthogonally or diagonally) is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* orange (7) pixel within the same white-enclosed area, then *all* pixels belonging to that gray component change their color to orange (7).
5.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency and connectivity (8-way, including diagonals) are crucial for determining which gray pixels are affected. A gray component is treated as a single unit for the color change.
6.  **No Interaction:** Gray components within a white enclosure that are *not* adjacent to any orange pixel within that same enclosure remain unchanged. Pixels outside the white enclosures (background, dividing lines, etc.) also remain unchanged.
7.  **Anomalies:** Examples `train_1` and `train_3` show some changes outside the white-enclosed areas (specifically in row 2 of both outputs) and an anomalous change within a white area in `train_1` (pixel (3,1)) that don't fit the primary interaction rule identified. These might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a secondary, less obvious rule. However, the orange-gray interaction within white boundaries is consistent across all relevant areas in `train_2`, `train_3`, and one area of `train_1`. The plan focuses on this dominant, consistent pattern.

## Facts

```
yaml
Input_Output_Relationship:
  - Description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by selectively changing the color of some gray pixels to orange based on their proximity to existing orange pixels within specific regions.
  - Grid_Dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.

Objects:
  - Type: Enclosure
    Properties:
      - Color: White (0)
      - Shape: Variable, forms closed boundaries.
      - Role: Defines regions where the transformation occurs.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: Primarily Magenta (6)
      - Role: Fills the space outside enclosures and structural lines.
  - Type: Dividers
    Properties:
      - Color:

"""
Transformation Rule:

The primary transformation identifies connected components of gray pixels (color 5) using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). 
For each distinct gray component found in the input grid:
1. Check all pixels that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any pixel within that gray component.
2. If any of these adjacent pixels in the input grid has the color orange (7), then all pixels belonging to that specific gray component are changed to orange (7) in the output grid.
3. If a gray component has no adjacent orange pixels, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
4. All other pixels (background, white borders, pixels of other colors not involved in this interaction) retain their original color from the input grid.

Note: This rule addresses the consistent gray-to-orange conversion observed. Some examples contain additional changes (e.g., near borders or involving other colors) that are not covered by this primary rule and might represent noise or a secondary, less clear transformation. This implementation focuses on the dominant gray/orange interaction.
