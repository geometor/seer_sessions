Transformation Rule Description:

1.  **Identify Global Trigger Color:** Determine the active "trigger" color (`C_trigger`) for the entire grid. Red (2) takes precedence over Blue (1). If neither Red nor Blue is present in the input grid, no changes are made, and the original grid is returned.
2.  **Determine Susceptible Colors:** Based on the `C_trigger`, define the set of "susceptible" colors (`S_target`):
    *   If `C_trigger` is Red (2), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Green (3)}.
    *   If `C_trigger` is Blue (1), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Orange (7)}.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. Modifications will be made to this copy.
4.  **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column (`c`) of the grid independently.
5.  **Identify Trigger Pixels in Column:** Find the row indices of all pixels in the current column `c` that match the `C_trigger`.
6.  **Check Conditions for Transformation:** A transformation within the column occurs only if *all* the following conditions are met:
    *   There are at least two `C_trigger` pixels in the column.
    *   Let `r_min` be the row index of the *highest* `C_trigger` pixel and `r_max` be the row index of the *lowest* `C_trigger` pixel in the column.
    *   The highest trigger pixel is not too high: `r_min >= 2`.
    *   The vertical distance between the highest and lowest trigger pixels is sufficiently large: `r_max - r_min >= 5`.
7.  **Apply Transformation (if conditions met):** If all conditions in step 6 are true:
    *   Iterate through the rows `r` strictly *between* the highest and lowest trigger pixels (i.e., `r_min < r < r_max`).
    *   For each pixel at `(r, c)`, check if its color in the *input* grid belongs to the `S_target` set.
    *   If the pixel's color is susceptible, change the color of the corresponding pixel `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_trigger`.
8.  **Return Result:** After processing all columns, return the modified output grid.
