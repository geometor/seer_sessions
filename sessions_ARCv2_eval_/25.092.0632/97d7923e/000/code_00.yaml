Grid_Properties:
  - dimensionality: 2
  - background_color: white (0)
  - value_range: 0-9 (colors)

Columnar_Operation:
  - scope: Transformation is applied independently to each column.
  - vertical_dependency: Changes depend on the pixels above within the same column.

Color_Roles:
  - Trigger_Colors:
      - Red (2): Triggers changes in Example 1 and 2.
      - Blue (1): Triggers changes in Example 3.
  - Susceptible_Colors_Mapping:
      - When Red (2) is the trigger: [Gray (5), Green (3)]
      - When Blue (1) is the trigger: [Gray (5), Orange (7)]
  - Unaffected_Colors_Example:
      - Green (3) is not affected by Blue (1) trigger in Example 3.

Transformation_Rule_Summary:
  - Identify the trigger color present in the input (assume only one type, Red or Blue, per input based on examples).
  - For each column:
      - Find the lowest row index (`r_trigger`) containing the trigger color.
      - If a trigger color exists in the column:
          - For all rows `r` below `r_trigger`:
              - If the pixel at `(r, column)` has a color susceptible to the identified trigger color:
                  - Change the pixel's color to the trigger color.
              - Otherwise, keep the original color.
      - If no trigger color exists, the column remains unchanged.
