Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the entire input grid to determine the active "trigger" color (`C_trigger`):
    *   If any Red (2) pixels exist, set `C_trigger` to Red (2).
    *   Else, if any Blue (1) pixels exist, set `C_trigger` to Blue (1).
    *   Otherwise, no trigger color exists; return the unchanged input grid.
3.  Define the set of "susceptible" colors (`S_target`) based on `C_trigger`:
    *   If `C_trigger` is Red (2), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Green (3)}.
    *   If `C_trigger` is Blue (1), `S_target` = {Gray (5), Orange (7)}.
4.  Iterate through each column index `c` of the grid.
5.  Within column `c`, search from the top row downwards to find the *first* (highest) occurrence of `C_trigger`. Let its row index be `r_trigger_min`.
6.  If `C_trigger` was found in column `c` (i.e., `r_trigger_min` is defined):
    *   Iterate through all row indices `r` starting from `r_trigger_min + 1` down to the last row of the grid.
    *   For each pixel at position `(r, c)`: Check if its color in the *input* grid is present in the set `S_target`.
    *   If the input color at `(r, c)` is in `S_target`, update the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to `C_trigger`.
7.  After processing all columns, return the final output grid.
