            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the concept of a global trigger color (Red > Blue) and the corresponding susceptible colors for each trigger. However, it failed because the condition for *when* the transformation occurs within a column was incorrect. The code assumed that any susceptible pixel below the *highest* trigger pixel would be changed.\n\nThe failures in Examples 1, 2, and 3 reveal a more complex condition. Comparing the successful transformations (e.g., Ex1 Col 7, Ex2 Col 6, Ex3 Col 2) with the failed ones (where the code changed pixels but shouldn't have, e.g., Ex2 Col 2, Ex3 Col 5, Ex3 Col 7) points towards a rule involving *multiple* trigger pixels within the same column and the *distance* between them.\n\nSpecifically, the transformation of susceptible pixels seems to occur only *between* the highest and lowest trigger pixels in a column, and *only if* these trigger pixels are separated by a sufficient vertical distance (at least 3 other rows between them, meaning a difference in row index of >= 4).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify the new hypothesis:** Re-examine all columns in all examples using the refined rule: \"Change susceptible colors located strictly between the highest and lowest trigger pixels in a column, but only if the row index difference between the lowest and highest trigger pixel is 4 or more.\"\n2.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the locations of trigger pixels, calculate distances, and identify susceptible pixels within the relevant ranges for each column in the training examples.\n3.  **Update YAML:** Document the refined understanding of the trigger conditions, including the requirement for multiple triggers and the distance threshold.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly state the refined multi-step process incorporating the distance check.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
