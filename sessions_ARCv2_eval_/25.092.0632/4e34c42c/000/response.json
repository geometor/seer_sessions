These objects are composed of contiguous pixels of various non-background colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and appears to be a composite derived from specific objects found in the input. The background color of the output matches the background color of the input.\n3.  **Key Transformation Elements:**\n    *   **Object Selection:** Not all objects from the input are used in the output. A specific selection criterion seems to be applied.\n    *   **Anchor Points:** In both examples, the selected objects share a unique characteristic: they each contain exactly one pixel of a specific \"anchor\" color (`maroon` (9) in train\\_1, `azure` (8) in train\\_2). This anchor color appears only in these two selected objects in the entire input grid.\n    *   **Composition/Overlay:** The two selected objects are combined. One object appears to act as a \"base,\" and the other is \"overlaid\" onto it. The alignment for this overlay is based on the relative positions of their respective anchor pixels. The overlaid object's pixels replace the base object's pixels and background pixels at the corresponding aligned locations.\n    *   **Output Bounding Box:** The output grid represents the minimal bounding box containing the combined/overlaid shape, including any necessary background pixels that fall within this box after the overlay operation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the background color by finding the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.\n2.  Segment the input grid into distinct objects, where each object is a connected component of non-background colored pixels.\n3.  Analyze the color composition of each object. Find the unique color (`anchor_color`) that appears exactly once in precisely two different objects.\n4.  Identify these two objects as the `selected_objects`.\n5.  Locate the coordinates of the single `anchor_pixel` within each of the `selected_objects`.\n6.  Determine which `selected_object` is the `base_object` and which is the `overlay_object`. The `base_object` is the one whose `anchor_pixel` has the smaller row index, or the smaller column index if the row indices are equal.\n7.  Calculate the coordinate offset required to align the `overlay_object`'s `anchor_pixel` with the `base_object`'s `anchor_pixel`. This is `offset = anchor_coord_base - anchor_coord_overlay`.\n8.  Construct the composite shape: Imagine placing the `base_object` on an infinite grid. Then, place the `overlay_object` onto the same grid, shifted by the calculated `offset`. Pixels from the `overlay_object` overwrite any pixels (from the `base_object` or the background) at the overlapping coordinates.\n9.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all non-background pixels of this composite shape.\n10. Create the output grid with the dimensions of this bounding box.\n11. Fill the output grid by copying the pixels (including the background color within the composite shape's structure) from the relevant portion of the conceptual composite grid created in step 8."
