task_description: Compose two specific objects from the input grid based on aligning unique anchor pixels.

definitions:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  object: A contiguous group of pixels with non-background colors.
  anchor_color: A color C such that exactly two distinct objects in the input grid each contain exactly one pixel of color C.
  anchor_pixel: The single pixel of the anchor_color within an object.
  selected_objects: The two objects containing the anchor_pixel.
  base_object: The selected_object whose anchor_pixel appears first in the grid (scan top-to-bottom, then left-to-right).
  overlay_object: The selected_object whose anchor_pixel appears second in the grid.

transformation:
  - step: Identify the background_color.
  - step: Find all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - step: Determine the anchor_color by checking color frequencies within objects.
  - step: Identify the two selected_objects containing the anchor_pixel.
  - step: Identify the base_object and the overlay_object based on the position of their anchor_pixels.
  - step: Determine the coordinates of the anchor_pixel within the base_object (relative_anchor_base) and the overlay_object (relative_anchor_overlay).
  - step: Determine the absolute coordinates of the anchor_pixels in the input grid (absolute_anchor_base, absolute_anchor_overlay).
  - step: Calculate the alignment offset needed to place the overlay_object's anchor onto the base_object's anchor. offset = absolute_anchor_base - absolute_anchor_overlay.
  - step: Determine the bounding box required to contain both the base_object and the overlay_object when aligned by their anchors.
  - step: Create an output grid of the calculated bounding box size, initialized with the background_color.
  - step: Draw the base_object onto the output grid at its relative position.
  - step: Draw the overlay_object onto the output grid, shifted by the calculated offset. Pixels from the overlay_object overwrite any pixels already present at those locations in the output grid.
  - step: The final output grid is the result of these drawing operations.

example_1:
  background_color: 8 (azure)
  anchor_color: 9 (maroon)
  selected_objects_positions: # Top-left corner of bounding boxes
    - Object 1 (Base): row=6, col=6
    - Object 2 (Overlay): row=11, col=20
  absolute_anchor_base: (6, 6)
  absolute_anchor_overlay: (11, 21)
  output_size: 5x12

example_2:
  background_color: 4 (yellow)
  anchor_color: 8 (azure)
  selected_objects_positions: # Top-left corner of bounding boxes
    - Object 1 (Base): row=2, col=10
    - Object 2 (Overlay): row=24, col=2
  absolute_anchor_base: (2, 10) # Actually (2+1, 10+0) = (3, 10) within its 4x7 box? Check needed. Let's use absolute grid coords. Input anchor coords: (3,10) and (25,7)
  absolute_anchor_base (revised): (3, 10)
  absolute_anchor_overlay (revised): (25, 7)
  output_size: 5x21
