General_Observation:
  - The primary, consistent transformation involves identifying solid 3x3 squares of a single color.
  - The center pixel of these identified squares is set to white (0).
  - Other pixels and shapes generally remain unchanged.
  - Examples 2 and 3 exhibit an additional phenomenon where new hollowed squares appear at the bottom, seemingly related to the colors of the squares hollowed at the top, but the exact rule for this secondary effect is unclear or inconsistent.
