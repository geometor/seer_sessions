task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  input_output_relation: The output is a subgrid extracted from the input.
identified_objects:
  - object: background_pixels
    description: Pixels corresponding to the most frequent color in the input grid.
    properties: [color_value]
  - object: foreground_pixels
    description: All pixels in the input grid whose color is *not* the background color.
    properties: [color_value, position (row, column)]
  - object: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangular region enclosing all foreground_pixels.
    derivation: Calculated from the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all foreground_pixels.
    properties: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: determine_background_color
    description: Identify the most frequent color value in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: locate_foreground_pixels
    input: input_grid, background_color
    output: list_of_foreground_pixel_coordinates
    description: Find the (row, column) coordinates of all pixels that are not the background color.
  - step: 3
    action: calculate_bounding_box
    input: list_of_foreground_pixel_coordinates
    output: bounding_box_coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
    description: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the list of foreground pixel coordinates. Handle the case where no foreground pixels exist (though not shown in examples, might need consideration).
  - step: 4
    action: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, bounding_box_coordinates
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the rectangular region defined by the bounding_box_coordinates from the input grid. The size of the output grid will be (max_row - min_row + 1) x (max_col - min_col + 1).
relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are determined solely by the spatial extent of the foreground pixels in the input.
  - The pixel values and their relative arrangement within the output grid are identical to their values and relative arrangement within the corresponding bounding box region of the input grid.
