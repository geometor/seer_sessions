"""
Identifies non-white pixels (seeds) in the input grid.
Determines a "fill color" for each seed: magenta (6) seeds use orange (7) as their fill color, all other seeds use their own color.
Simultaneously expands each seed's fill color into adjacent white (0) pixels iteratively.
Expansion fills a white pixel if and only if all its adjacent non-white neighbors share the exact same fill color.
Expansion stops at grid boundaries, original non-white pixels, or where expansions from different fill colors would meet (leaving the conflicting pixel white).
The process continues until no more white pixels can be filled in a full iteration. Original seed pixels retain their original visual color in the final output.
