The expansion seems to follow specific rules:\n    *   Each non-white pixel in the input acts as a \"seed\".\n    *   These seeds expand into adjacent (cardinal directions: up, down, left, right) white pixels.\n    *   The expansion continues iteratively until no more white pixels can be filled.\n    *   The expansion from one seed stops when it meets the boundary of the grid, an existing non-white pixel from the input, or the expansion area of another seed.\n    *   Crucially, the color used for expansion (the \"fill color\") is usually the same as the seed color, *except* for magenta (6) seeds, which expand using orange (7). All other colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange, azure, maroon) expand using their own color.\n    *   The process appears to be simultaneous for all seeds, meaning expansions happen in parallel, respecting each other's boundaries as they form.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
