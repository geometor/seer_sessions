objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable (e.g., 20, 18, 15)
      width: variable (e.g., 20, 18, 15)
      pixels: integers 0-9, representing colors. 0 is white (background).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9
      location: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: seed_pixel
    description: A non-white (color 1-9) pixel in the input grid. Acts as an origin for expansion.
    properties:
      original_color: integer 1-9 (The color seen in the input grid)
      effective_fill_color: integer 1-9 (The color used for expansion/distance competition. Orange(7) if original_color is magenta(6), otherwise same as original_color)
      location: (row, column)
  - type: region
    description: An area in the output grid associated with a single effective_fill_color, determined by proximity to seed pixels.
    properties:
      fill_color: The effective_fill_color of the seed(s) defining the region.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Cardinal adjacency (sharing an edge) is implicitly used in distance calculations (Manhattan distance).
  - type: proximity (Manhattan Distance)
    description: The distance between two pixels (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2). This determines which seed influences a given white pixel.
  - type: boundary
    description: Occurs at pixels equidistant from two or more seeds with different effective_fill_colors. These pixels remain white (0). Also occurs at grid edges.

actions:
  - name: identify_seeds_and_effective_colors
    description: Find all non-white pixels in the input. For each seed, record its location, original color, and effective fill color (6->7, others same).
  - name: calculate_minimum_distances_and_owners
    description: For every pixel (r, c) in the grid, calculate its Manhattan distance to all seeds. Find the minimum distance. Identify all seeds achieving this minimum distance.
  - name: determine_pixel_color
    description: Assign a color to each pixel (r, c) in the output grid based on the closest seed(s).
    details:
      - If pixel (r, c) was originally a seed (input color != 0), its output color is its original_color.
      - If pixel (r, c) was originally white (input color == 0):
        - Get the effective_fill_colors of all seeds identified as closest in the previous step.
        - If there is only one unique effective_fill_color among the closest seeds, set the output pixel color to this effective_fill_color.
        - If there are multiple different effective_fill_colors among the closest seeds (a tie), set the output pixel color to white (0).
  - name: construct_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by applying the determined pixel color for every location.
