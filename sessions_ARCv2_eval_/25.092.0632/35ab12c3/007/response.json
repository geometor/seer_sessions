Determine the \"effective fill color\" for each seed: \n    - If a seed's color is magenta (6), its effective fill color is orange (7).\n    - Otherwise, the effective fill color is the seed's own color.\n3.  Initialize an output grid of the same size, filled with white (0).\n4.  For each pixel location (r, c) in the grid:\n    a. Check if the location (r, c) corresponds to an original seed location from the input grid.\n    b. If it is a seed location, set the output pixel at (r, c) to the seed's *original* color.\n    c. If it is not a seed location (i.e., it was white in the input):\n        i. Calculate the Manhattan distance from (r, c) to every seed pixel.\n        ii. Find the minimum Manhattan distance among all seeds.\n        iii. Identify all seeds that are located at this minimum distance.\n        iv. Collect the *effective fill colors* of these closest seeds.\n        v. If there is exactly one unique effective fill color among the closest seeds, set the output pixel at (r, c) to this color.\n        vi.
