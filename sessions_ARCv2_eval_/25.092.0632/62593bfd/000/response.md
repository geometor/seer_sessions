Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.

**Perception**

Both training examples involve grids with a dominant background color and several smaller, distinctly colored objects. The transformation rearranges these objects within the grid while preserving the grid dimensions, the background color, and the shapes of the objects themselves. The key difference between the two examples lies in the background color and the specific rearrangement logic applied.

*   **Example 1:** Has a white (0) background. Four objects (Yellow, Red, Blue, Green) are moved from their initial positions to specific corners of the grid. The destination corner seems determined solely by the object's color.
*   **Example 2:** Has a gray (5) background. Six objects (Blue, Green, Orange, Maroon, Red, Yellow) are moved either to the top edge or the bottom edge of the grid. The destination edge seems determined by a combination of the object's original position (which horizontal half it's in) and potentially its color or original vertical position.

The core task is to identify the non-background objects, determine the correct rearrangement rule based on the background color, calculate the new position for each object according to that rule, and
