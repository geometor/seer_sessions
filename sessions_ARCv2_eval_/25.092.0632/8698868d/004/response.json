            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because the logic for identifying target/source groups and the mechanism for color replacement were incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code incorrectly assumed targets must have noise and sources must not. It also incorrectly replaced noise pixels, failing to preserve the original target shape's pixels. The output size was correct, suggesting the assembly part was functional for this layout.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code failed more significantly, likely due to the incorrect target/source identification, incorrect noise replacement, and subsequent failure in assembling the output grid (producing the wrong size and content).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Grouping:** Implement a spatial grouping mechanism (e.g., splitting by median row/column, or taking the first N vs. second N shapes after sorting) instead of relying on noise presence.\n2.  **Refine Color Replacement:** Implement the correct replacement logic: For each target frame, iterate through its bounding box in the input grid. If a pixel belongs to the target object, keep its color. If a pixel is the noise color, replace it with the paired source object's color.\n3.  **Verify Noise Detection:** Ensure the `determine_noise_color` heuristic correctly identifies the background/noise color in both examples.\n4.  **Verify Assembly:** Ensure the assembly logic correctly uses the original relative positions and sizes of the target frames to construct the final grid.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
