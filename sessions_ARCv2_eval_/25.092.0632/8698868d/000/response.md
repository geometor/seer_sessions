Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct, roughly rectangular blocks of solid color ("frames") separated by a background color. Within each frame, some pixels match the surrounding background color, appearing as "noise" or "holes".
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs and consist of reassembled versions of *some* of the input frames. The background color and some of the original frames are absent in the output.
3.  **Transformation Core:** The core transformation involves identifying the frames and the background/noise color. For a selected subset of frames (let's call them "target frames"), the internal noise pixels are replaced by colors derived from *other* frames in the input (let's call them "source frames").
4.  **Frame Selection and Pairing:** In both examples, the input frames seem divisible into two sets based on spatial arrangement (e.g., top half vs. bottom half, or first group vs. second group). One set acts as the target frames, whose structure is preserved in the output. The other set acts as the source frames, providing the colors to fill the noise in the target frames. The pairing between target and source frames appears based on their relative positions within their respective sets.
5.  **Color Replacement:** For each target frame, its internal noise pixels (pixels matching the background color within the frame's bounding box) are recolored using the solid color of its paired source frame.
6.  **Assembly:** The modified target frames are then assembled into the output grid, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement from the input.

```yaml
task_description: Identify distinct colored rectangular shapes (frames) separated by a background/noise color. Some frames contain noise pixels matching the background color. Identify a second set of frames. Pair frames from the first set (targets) with frames from the second set (sources) based on relative position. For each target frame, replace its internal noise pixels with the color of its paired source frame. Assemble the modified target frames to create the output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Noise Color:** Determine the primary background color that separates the main colored shapes and also appears as noise *inside* those shapes.
2.  **Segment Shapes:** Identify all distinct, contiguous colored shapes (frames) that are not the noise color. Record their primary color, bounding box, and relative position.
3.  **Group Shapes:** Divide the identified frames into two groups (Group A and Group B) based on their spatial layout (e.g., top half vs. bottom half, or first cluster vs. second cluster). Ensure both groups have the same number of frames and a similar relative spatial arrangement. Group A will be the 'target' frames used for the output structure, and Group B will be the 'source' frames providing filler colors.
4.  **Pair Shapes:** For each frame in Group A, find its corresponding frame in Group B based on their relative positions within their respective groups (e.g., top-left of Group A pairs with top-left of Group B, top-right with top-right, etc.).
5.  **Modify Target Frames:** For each frame in Group A:
    a.  Determine the color of its paired frame from Group B (`filler_color`).
    b.  Iterate through all pixels within the bounding box of the Group A frame.
    c.  If a pixel's color matches the `noise_color`, change its color to the `filler_color`.
6.  **Assemble Output:** Create a new grid by arranging the modified frames from Group A. Maintain the same relative spatial arrangement they had in the input grid. Discard the frames from Group B. The dimensions of the output grid will be determined by the combined dimensions of the modified Group A frames.
