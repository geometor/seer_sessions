The width of the output grid is less than or equal to the width of the input grid.\n3.  **Colors:** The grids use a palette of colors (0-9). Each example features a dominant background color (blue in #1, white in #2, gray in #5) and other foreground colors.\n4.  **Vertical Lines:** A key feature in the input grids is the presence of one or more solid vertical lines. These lines span the full height of the grid and consist of a single color distinct from the background color. In example #1, the lines are green (3); in #2, they are red (2); in #3, there's one yellow (4) line.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a cropping operation based on the location of the *first* (leftmost) vertical line marker. The output grid consists of all columns from the input grid *before* this marker line. The marker line itself is excluded.\n6.  **Marker Line Definition:** A column acts as a marker if all its cells have the same color, and this color is different from the color of the cell at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` of the input grid (which seems to represent the background in these examples).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the color of the top-left pixel (at row 0, column 0), call it `background_color_ref`.\n4.  Initialize a variable `marker_column_index` to -1 (or some indicator that no marker has been found yet).\n5.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to W-1:\n    a.  Check if the column `c` is a vertical line marker:\n        i.  Get the color of the first pixel in the column, `column_color = grid[0][c]`.\n        ii. If `column_color` is the same as `background_color_ref`, this column cannot be a marker; continue to the next column `c+1`.\n        iii. Assume the column is a marker (`is_marker = True`).\n        iv. Iterate through each row index `r` from 1 to H-1:\n            1.  If the color `grid[r][c]` is different from `column_color`, set `is_marker = False` and break this inner loop (checking rows).\n        v.  If `is_marker` is still `True` after checking all rows, then column `c` is the first vertical line marker found. Set `marker_column_index = c` and break the outer loop (checking columns).\n6.  If no marker column was found (`marker_column_index` is still -1), handle this case (e.g., return the original grid or an empty grid, though examples suggest a marker always exists). Based on the examples, assume `marker_column_index` will be found and hold a value between 0 and W-1.\n7.  Create the output grid by taking a slice of the input grid: select all rows (from 0 to H-1) and columns from 0 up to (but not including) `marker_column_index`.\n8.  Return the created output grid."
