task_description: Crop the input grid horizontally based on the position of the first vertical line marker.

definitions:
  - name: vertical_line_marker
    description: A column in the grid where all cells have the same color, and this color is different from the color of the cell at position (0, 0) in the input grid.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W
    - contains_pixels: Yes
    - contains_vertical_line_markers: Yes, at least one in examples.

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H (same as input)
    - width: W_out (where W_out is the column index of the first vertical_line_marker)
    - content: A subgrid of the input grid.

transformation:
  action: Identify the first vertical_line_marker
  details:
    - Iterate through columns from left (index 0) to right.
    - The first column that meets the criteria for vertical_line_marker determines the crop point.
    - Let the index of this first marker column be `C_marker`.
  action: Crop the input grid
  details:
    - Select all rows (0 to H-1).
    - Select columns from index 0 up to (but not including) `C_marker`.
    - The resulting subgrid is the output.

relationship:
  - The output grid is the portion of the input grid to the left of the first identified vertical_line_marker.
  - The height remains unchanged.
