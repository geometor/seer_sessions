These specific pixels are absent in the output.\n    *   In the output grids, a new vertical line pattern appears, composed of alternating 'red' (2) and 'yellow' (4) pixels.\n    *   The position (column) and vertical extent (end row) of this new line pattern seem related to the positions of the input's isolated 'red' and 'yellow' pixels.\n    *   The order of colors in the alternating pattern also seems determined by the relative positions (specifically, the column index) of the input's isolated 'red' and 'yellow' pixels.\n    *   Other shapes and patterns in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid, except where they are overwritten by the new vertical pattern.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
