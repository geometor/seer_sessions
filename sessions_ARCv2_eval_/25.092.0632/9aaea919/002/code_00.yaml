Grid:
  Properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
Objects:
  - Type: Bar
    Properties:
      - color: Red (2) or Green (3)
      - shape: Contiguous block of 5 pixels, either 1x5 (horizontal) or 5x1 (vertical).
      - count: Exactly one Red bar and one Green bar are expected.
      - location: Position defined by the set of pixels. Minimum column index is relevant for comparison.
  - Type: PlusSign
    Properties:
      - color: Any color except the background, Red (2), or Green (3) bars' colors (potentially overlapping with plus-sign colors like Green).
      - shape: A 13-pixel shape forming a cross within a 5x5 bounding box (center pixel + 2 pixels in each cardinal direction). Corners of the bounding box are empty (background color).
      - location: Position defined by the set of pixels. Minimum row index is relevant for identifying the 'topmost'.
Actions:
  - Identify_Objects:
      - Find the background color.
      - Find all connected components (objects) of non-background colors.
      - Classify objects into Bars (Red/Green) and PlusSigns based on color and shape.
      - Store locations (pixel sets) and colors of all identified objects.
  - Determine_Target:
      - Get the horizontal positions (e.g., minimum column index) of the Red bar and Green bar.
      - Compare positions:
          - If Red bar is left of Green bar:
              - Target Color = Maroon (9) if Maroon PlusSigns exist.
              - Else, Target Color = Green (3) if Green PlusSigns exist.
              - Target Mode = All (for Maroon) or Topmost (for Green).
          - If Red bar is right of Green bar:
              - Target Color = Magenta (6) if Magenta PlusSigns exist.
              - Else, Target Color = Green (3) if Green PlusSigns exist.
              - Target Mode = All (for Magenta) or Topmost (for Green).
  - Modify_Grid:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - Remove_Bars: Change all pixels belonging to the Red bar and Green bar to the background color.
      - Modify_PlusSigns:
          - If a Target Color was determined:
              - If Target Mode is 'All': Find all PlusSigns of the Target Color and change their pixels to Gray (5).
              - If Target Mode is 'Topmost': Find all PlusSigns of the Target Color, identify the one with the minimum top row index, and change its pixels to Gray (5).
