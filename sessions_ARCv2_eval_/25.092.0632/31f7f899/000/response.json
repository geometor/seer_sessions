            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of varying sizes (13x13, 15x15, 7x7).\n2.  **Background Color:** The dominant color in all grids is azure (8), acting as a background.\n3.  **Separator Line:** A distinct, single horizontal line of magenta (6) pixels is present in all input grids. This line remains unchanged in the output grids.\n4.  **Other Objects/Pixels:** Various other colored pixels (gray 5, red 2, orange 7, blue 1, yellow 4, maroon 9) exist in the input grids, typically located above or below the magenta line.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves a vertical \"filling\" or \"propagation\" effect within each column. Colors other than the background (azure 8) and the separator (magenta 6) seem to spread vertically towards the magenta line.\n6.  **Propagation Details:**\n    *   The propagation occurs independently in each column.\n    *   Colors spread both upwards (from below the magenta line towards it) and downwards (from above the magenta line towards it).\n    *   The propagation replaces only the background (azure 8) pixels. Existing non-background, non-separator pixels remain unless overwritten by a *propagating* color in that column section.\n    *   The color that propagates in a given direction (up or down) within a column is determined by the non-background, non-separator pixel closest to the magenta line in that direction.\n    *   The magenta line itself acts as a barrier, stopping the propagation.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Identify the separator color, which is magenta (6).\n4.  Locate the row index (`separator_row`) of the horizontal magenta (6) line.\n5.  Iterate through each column index (`col`) of the grid.\n6.  **Process Above Separator:**\n    a.  Scan downwards from `row = separator_row - 1` to `row = 0`.\n    b.  Find the first pixel `(row, col)` whose color is neither the background color (8) nor the separator color (6). Let this color be `color_above` and its row index be `source_row_above`.\n    c.  If such a `color_above` is found:\n        i. Iterate from `r = source_row_above` up to `separator_row - 1`.\n        ii. If the pixel `(r, col)` in the *output* grid currently has the background color (8), change its color to `color_above`.\n7.  **Process Below Separator:**\n    a.  Scan upwards from `row = separator_row + 1` to the last row of the grid.\n    b.  Find the first pixel `(row, col)` whose color is neither the background color (8) nor the separator color (6). Let this color be `color_below` and its row index be `source_row_below`.\n    c.  If such a `color_below` is found:\n        i. Iterate from `r = source_row_below` down to `separator_row + 1`.\n        ii. If the pixel `(r, col)` in the *output* grid currently has the background color (8), change its color to `color_below`.\n8.  Return the modified output grid. (The separator row remains unchanged as it was copied initially and is never targeted for modification)."
