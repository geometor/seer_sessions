            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided ARC task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 30 rows by 24 columns.\n2.  **Horizontal Bands:** The grids appear segmented into distinct horizontal bands. These bands are often characterized by a dominant background color and sometimes a frame or border of a different color around the inner area.\n3.  **Source Band:** The topmost band containing patterns or shapes (i.e., colors different from its own background) seems to act as a \"source\" of information or patterns. In the output, this source band is typically cleared or reset to its background color.\n4.  **Target Bands:** Bands located below the source band, particularly those with distinct frames, act as \"target\" areas. The transformation involves drawing shapes into these target bands.\n5.  **Frames:** Target bands often have a frame (1-pixel border) of one color and a background (inner area) of another color. These frame and background colors are crucial for the transformation.\n6.  **Objects/Patterns:** The source band contains various shapes or objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. Some objects might enclose other objects or pixels of different colors.\n7.  **Transformation Logic:** The core logic seems to involve selecting specific shapes or pixels from the source band based on their color and transferring their *shape* or *location* into a corresponding target band. The color used for drawing in the target band is determined by the target band's *frame* color. The selection criteria appear to link the *color* of the source object/pixels to the *background color* of the target band.\n8.  **Object Selection Refinements:**\n    *   When multiple objects in the source band share the same color, and that color matches a target band's background, a selection rule (e.g., choosing the largest object) seems to apply (observed in train_2).\n    *   Objects fully enclosed within another object in the source band seem to be ignored when selecting the primary object shape (observed in train_1).\n    *   There appears to be a special case for yellow (color 4): when a target band's background is yellow, *all* yellow pixels from the source band (regardless of the object they formed) are copied, using the target's frame color (observed in train_2).\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

A band boundary occurs where row composition changes significantly (e.g., uniform color row, change in framing).\n    *   Designate the first band containing multiple colors as the \"source band\". Record its background color (`source_bg`).\n    *   Identify subsequent bands that have a distinct frame color and background color as \"target bands\". For each target band, record its background color (`target_bg`) and frame color (`target_frame`). Store the row range for the source and each target band.\n3.  **Analyze Source Band:**\n    *   Within the row range of the source band, identify all contiguous objects formed by pixels that are not `source_bg`.\n    *   Filter out any object that is completely enclosed within another identified object. Let the remaining objects be the \"primary source objects\". Record their color, shape (coordinates), and size (pixel count).\n4.  **Clear Source in Output:** For all pixels `(r, c)` within the source band's row range in the output grid, set their color to `source_bg`.\n5.  **Process Target Bands:** Iterate through each identified target band:\n    *   **Check for Yellow Background:** If the current `target_bg` is yellow (4):\n        *   Find all pixel coordinates `(r, c)` within the source band's row range where the *input* grid color is yellow (4).\n        *   For each such coordinate `(r, c)`, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the current `target_frame` color.\n    *   **Standard Processing:** If the current `target_bg` is *not* yellow (4):\n        *   Find all \"primary source objects\" whose color matches the current `target_bg`.\n        *   If one or more matching objects are found:\n            *   If exactly one object matches, select it.\n            *   If multiple objects match, select the one with the largest size (pixel count).\n            *   If an object is selected, for every coordinate `(r, c)` defining the shape of the selected object, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the current `target_frame` color.\n6.  **Finalize:** The modified output grid is the result."
