Some inputs feature single pixels of a specific color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"coloring\" operation originating from specific pixels.\n5.  **Fill Propagation:** The fill color spreads outwards from its initial locations into the background color pixels.\n6.  **Boundaries:** The fill operation is constrained by pixels of colors other than the background and fill colors, as well as the grid boundaries. These non-background, non-fill pixels act as barriers.\n7.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   **Background Color:** The dominant color in the input grid that gets partially replaced.\n    *   **Fill Color:** The color that expands or spreads into the background area. This color is present in the input, sometimes as small features or single pixels.\n    *   **Barrier Colors:** All other colors present in the input grid remain unchanged and block the spread of the fill color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the `background_color` as the color with the highest frequency.\n3.  Identify the `fill_color` by comparing the input and output grids; it's the color that expands into the `background_color` areas. (Alternatively, assume the fill color is the one that is present in the input but not the background and not the most numerous of the remaining colors, often appearing as small features).\n4.  Identify `barrier_colors` as all colors present in the input grid that are neither the `background_color` nor the `fill_color`.\n5.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n6.  Initialize a queue or list for processing, adding the coordinates of all pixels in the input grid that have the `fill_color` (these are the `fill_seeds`). Maintain a set of visited coordinates to avoid redundant processing. Add the initial `fill_seeds` coordinates to the visited set.\n7.  While the processing queue is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a coordinate (row, col).\n    b.  For each of its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right):\n        i.  Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if the neighbor has not been visited yet.\n        iii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *original input grid* is the `background_color`.\n        iv.
