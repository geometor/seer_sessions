"""
Performs a flood fill operation starting from pixels of a specific 'fill color'.
The fill spreads into the 'background color' (most frequent color in the grid),
and is stopped by other 'barrier colors' (all other colors present) and the grid boundaries.
The fill color itself is identified heuristically based on patterns observed
in the training examples, as it's not explicitly defined. For instance, if the
background is blue (1), the fill color might be maroon (9); if white (0), then yellow (4);
if orange (7), then green (3). If only one non-background color exists, it's assumed
to be the fill color.
