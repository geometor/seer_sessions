            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous transformation attempt incorrectly implemented a flood-fill algorithm based on adjacency to blue pixels. The evaluation results clearly show that this converted too many gray (8) pixels to orange (7). The expected outputs indicate a simpler rule: only gray pixels *directly adjacent* (including diagonals) to blue (1) pixels in the input grid are changed to orange (7). All other pixels, including gray pixels not directly adjacent to blue, retain their original color. The magenta (6) pixel acts as a distractor and is unaffected by the transformation, nor does it affect its neighbors.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to the initial hypothesis and the first natural language program, which correctly described this simpler adjacency rule. The focus will be on precisely defining this rule and ensuring the implementation checks neighbors only in the original input grid, without any subsequent propagation or flood fill.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
