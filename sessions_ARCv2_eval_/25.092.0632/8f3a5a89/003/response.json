Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid. This preserves the \n    original positions and colors of non-gray pixels (blue=1, magenta=6).\n2.  Identify all gray (8) pixels in the input grid that are directly adjacent \n    (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one blue (1) pixel.\n3.  Use these identified adjacent gray pixels as starting points (seeds) for a \n    flood-fill (specifically, Breadth-First Search - BFS).\n4.  Maintain a queue for the BFS and a way to track visited/processed pixels \n    to avoid redundant work and infinite loops (can use the output grid itself).\n5.  Start the BFS:\n    a.  Add all seed gray pixel coordinates to the queue.\n    b.  Mark these seed pixels as orange (7) in the output grid immediately.\n6.  While the queue is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a pixel coordinate (r, c).\n    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (nr, nc) in the input grid.\n    c.  For each valid neighbor (within grid bounds):\n        i.  If the neighbor is gray (8) in the *input* grid AND its corresponding \n            pixel in the *output* grid is still gray (8) (meaning it hasn't \n            been processed/queued yet):\n            -   Set the neighbor's pixel in the output grid to orange (7).\n            -   Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates (nr, nc).\n7.  Once the queue is empty, the flood fill is complete. All gray pixels reachable \n    from a blue pixel via a path of gray pixels will have been turned orange.\n8.  Return the final output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the flood-fill transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_array = np.copy(input_array)\n\n    # Define relative coordinates for the 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n    neighbors = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        ( 0, -1),          ( 0, 1),\n        ( 1, -1), ( 1, 0), ( 1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Use a queue for the Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Find initial seed gray pixels adjacent to blue pixels and add them to the queue\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Only consider gray pixels in the input\n            if input_array[r, c] == 8:\n                is_adjacent_to_blue = False\n                # Check neighbors in the input array\n                for dr, dc in neighbors:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and input_array[nr, nc] == 1:\n                        is_adjacent_to_blue = True\n                        break\n                \n                # If adjacent to blue and not already processed (which it won't be yet)\n                if is_adjacent_to_blue:\n                    # Mark as orange in the output and add to queue\n                    output_array[r, c] = 7 \n                    queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform the BFS flood fill\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors of the current pixel (which is now orange)\n        for dr, dc in neighbors:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                # Check if the neighbor was originally gray in the input AND\n                # is still gray in the output (meaning it hasn't been visited/colored orange yet)\n                if input_array[nr, nc] == 8 and output_array[nr, nc] == 8:\n                    # Color the neighbor orange in the output\n                    output_array[nr, nc] = 7\n                    # Add the neighbor to the queue to process its neighbors later\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return output_array.tolist()\n```"
