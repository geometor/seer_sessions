"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the color of contiguous gray (8) regions based on adjacency to blue (1) pixels.

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid. This preserves the 
    original positions and colors of non-gray pixels (blue=1, magenta=6).
2.  Identify all gray (8) pixels in the input grid that are directly adjacent 
    (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one blue (1) pixel. These 
    are the initial "seed" pixels for the transformation.
3.  Use these identified adjacent gray pixels as starting points for a 
    flood-fill (specifically, Breadth-First Search - BFS) within their respective
    contiguous gray regions.
4.  Maintain a queue for the BFS. Use the output grid itself to track visited/processed 
    pixels (pixels changed from 8 to 7).
5.  Start the BFS:
    a.  Add all seed gray pixel coordinates to the queue.
    b.  Mark these seed pixels as orange (7) in the output grid immediately.
6.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a pixel coordinate (r, c).
    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (nr, nc) in the *input* grid.
    c.  For each valid neighbor (within grid bounds):
        i.  If the neighbor was originally gray (8) in the *input* grid AND its corresponding 
            pixel in the *output* grid is still gray (8) (meaning it belongs to the 
            same contiguous gray region but hasn't been colored orange yet):
            -   Set the neighbor's pixel in the output grid to orange (7).
            -   Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates (nr, nc) to continue the flood fill.
7.  Once the queue is empty, the flood fill is complete. All gray pixels reachable 
    from a blue pixel via a path of exclusively gray pixels will have been turned orange.
8.  Return the final output grid.
