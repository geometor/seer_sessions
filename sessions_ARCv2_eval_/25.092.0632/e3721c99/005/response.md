"""
The transformation identifies a horizontal separator line (all blue=1 pixels) dividing the grid into an upper 'key area' and a lower 'work area'.
It finds all distinct contiguous objects in the key area, excluding background (0) and separator (1) pixels. For each such key object, it records its normalized shape (tuple of relative coordinates) and its color.
It then finds all contiguous gray (5) objects in the work area.
For each gray object found in the work area, it calculates its normalized shape. If this shape exactly matches the shape of a key object from the key area, all pixels comprising that gray object in the output grid are replaced with the color of the matching key object.
All other elements (key area content, separator line, background pixels in work area, and gray objects in the work area whose shape does not match any key pattern shape) remain unchanged in the output grid.
