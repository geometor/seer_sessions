task_context:
  grid_size: dynamic (30x30 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)
  separator:
    exists: True
    color: blue (1)
    type: horizontal_line, full_width
    location: variable row, separates grid into upper (key) and lower (work) areas
key_area:
  location: region above the separator line
  content: contains multiple distinct objects (key patterns) on background
  key_pattern_colors: any color except background (0) and separator (1) # Includes gray (5) if present
  purpose: provides shape-color mapping templates
work_area:
  location: region below the separator line
  input_content: contains target objects (gray=5) on background
  output_content: target gray objects whose shape matches a key pattern are replaced by the key pattern's color. Unmatched gray objects remain gray.
target_objects:
  input_color: gray (5)
  location: work_area
  property: contiguous shape (relative pixel coordinates normalized to top-left)
action:
  type: shape-based_color_replacement
  input: gray (5) objects in work_area
  output: potentially colored objects in work_area
  rule: >
    1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2. Identify the horizontal separator line (all blue=1 pixels).
    3. Define the key area (above separator) and work area (below separator).
    4. Find all contiguous objects in the key area, excluding background (0) and separator (1) pixels.
    5. For each key object found, determine its normalized shape (tuple of relative coordinates) and store it mapped to its color (shape -> color).
    6. Find all contiguous gray (5) objects in the work area.
    7. For each gray object found:
       a. Determine its normalized shape (tuple of relative coordinates).
       b. Check if this exact shape exists as a key in the stored key patterns map.
       c. If a match is found: Retrieve the corresponding color from the map. Iterate through all pixel coordinates of the *current* gray object and update the *output grid* at these coordinates with the retrieved color.
    8. If no match is found, the gray object remains unchanged in the output grid.
