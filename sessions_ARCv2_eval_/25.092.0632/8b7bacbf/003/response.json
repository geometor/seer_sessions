Find the unique special 'fill_color' (4 or 7) in the input grid.\n2. Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n3. Identify all white pixels (0) that are not connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels.\n4. Group these border-disconnected white pixels into contiguous regions (components).\n5. For each such region:\n    a. Find all non-white pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the region.\n    b. Check if all these adjacent non-white pixels have the exact same color.\n    c. If the boundary color is uniform, fill all pixels within this white region in the output grid with the 'fill_color'.\n6.
