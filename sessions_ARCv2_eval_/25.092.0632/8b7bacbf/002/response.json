            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task: filling enclosed white regions with a special color (yellow/4 or orange/7) found elsewhere in the grid. The provided code implemented a strategy based on identifying white regions disconnected from the grid border using a flood-fill (BFS) approach starting from border white pixels.\n\nHowever, testing revealed that this strategy was overly inclusive, incorrectly filling some white regions in examples `train_1`, `train_2`, and `train_3`. Example `train_4` was processed correctly. The errors indicate that the definition of \"enclosed\" requires refinement. The failing examples show that regions merely disconnected from the border aren't necessarily the target; the nature of the boundary matters.\n\nSpecifically, the incorrectly filled regions in the failing examples appear to be bounded by multiple distinct objects or colors, or by a combination of objects and the grid border itself, whereas the correctly filled regions seem to be \"holes\" truly *inside* a single contiguous shape/color boundary.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Refine the definition of a fillable region: A region must be composed of white pixels (0), must not be reachable by other white pixels from the grid border, AND its immediate boundary (adjacent non-white pixels) must consist of pixels of only *one* specific non-white color.\n2.  Modify the algorithm:\n    *   First, identify all white pixels reachable from the border via a path of white pixels (using BFS/DFS).\n    *   Then, iterate through the remaining white pixels (those not reachable from the border).\n    *   For each such starting pixel, perform a new BFS/DFS to find its connected component of white pixels (which are also unreachable from the border).\n    *   During this component search, examine the colors of all adjacent non-white pixels.\n    *   If all non-white neighbours for the entire component belong to the *same* color, then fill this component with the special `fill_color`.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
