            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core mechanism: using a 5x5 key region to define a 3x3 replacement pattern and a target color, then applying this pattern to the source region (columns 6+). However, the results show a misunderstanding of how the *rest* of the output grid (pixels not matching the target color) is determined.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Key: 4/7 -> Target: 3):** The code incorrectly preserved all non-target pixels from the source. The actual output shows that non-target pixels were mostly replaced with Gray (5).\n*   **Example 2 (Key: 1/2 -> Target: 8):** The code incorrectly preserved non-target pixels (Maroon/9). The actual output shows that all non-target pixels were replaced with Azure (8). This indicates a special rule associated with the Blue(1)/Red(2) key.\n*   **Example 3 (Key: 3/8 -> Target: 5):** The code *correctly* preserved the non-target pixels (Yellow/4) in this case.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the logic for constructing the output grid. Instead of starting with a copy of the source region, determine a 'background' color first.\n2.  Identify the special case: If the key colors are Blue(1) and Red(2), the background is Azure(8).\n3.  For other key color pairs, analyze the *unique* colors present in the *source* region, excluding the `TargetColor`.\n    *   If exactly *one* unique color remains, use that as the background (as seen in Example 3 where only Yellow(4) remained besides the target Gray(5)).\n    *   If *multiple* unique colors remain (or zero, though unlikely based on examples), use Gray(5) as the default background (as potentially needed for Example 1 where Gray(5), Azure(8), and Blue(1) remained besides target Green(3), and the output used Gray(5)).\n4.  Initialize the output grid entirely with this determined background color.\n5.  Iterate through the source grid. Only where the source pixel matches the `TargetColor`, overwrite the corresponding pixel in the output grid with the appropriate color from the tiled 3x3 `replacement_pattern`.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
