Examples:
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Blue (1)
      Subgrids: 9 identical 7x7 blocks.
      Dimensions: 19x19
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids.
      Content: Identical to the rightmost column of subgrids (columns 12-18) from the input.
      Dimensions: 19x7
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x4 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Green (3)
      Subgrids: 12 identical 7x7 blocks.
      Dimensions: 19x25
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids.
      Content: Identical to the rightmost column of subgrids (columns 18-24) from the input.
      Dimensions: 19x7

DerivedGeneralizations:
  - Object: Input Grid, Output Grid, Subgrids, Separator Lines
  - Properties:
      - Input grid has a width (`iw`) and height (`ih`).
      - Input grid is tiled with repeating subgrids of width (`sw`) and height (`sh`).
      - Subgrids are separated by single-pixel lines of `SeparatorColor`.
      - Output grid has height `ih` and width `sw`.
  - Action: Extraction
  - Relationship:
      - The output grid is extracted from the input grid.
      - The extracted region corresponds to the rightmost `sw` columns of the input grid.
      - The subgrid width `sw` can be determined by finding the column index of the first vertical separator line (index `sw-1`) and adding 1.
