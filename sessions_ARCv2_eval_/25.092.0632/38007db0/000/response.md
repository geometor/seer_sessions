Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids appear to be composed of smaller, repeating rectangular units (subgrids) arranged in a larger grid format (e.g., 3x3 in train_1, 3x4 in train_2).
2.  **Separators:** These subgrids are separated by single-pixel-wide lines (horizontal and vertical) of a specific color (blue=1 in train_1, green=3 in train_2). This separator color also forms the border of each subgrid.
3.  **Subgrid Content:** Each subgrid contains an internal pattern distinct from the separators/borders.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a vertical slice of the input grid. Specifically, it corresponds exactly to the rightmost column of subgrids from the input.
5.  **Dimensions:** The height of the output grid is identical to the height of the input grid. The width of the output grid is identical to the width of a single subgrid in the input.

**Facts**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Blue (1)
      Subgrids: 9 identical 7x7 blocks.
      Dimensions: 19x19
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids.
      Content: Identical to the rightmost column of subgrids (columns 12-18) from the input.
      Dimensions: 19x7
  - Input:
      GridType: Input Matrix
      Structure: Composed of repeating 7x7 subgrids arranged in a 3x4 pattern.
      SeparatorColor: Green (3)
      Subgrids: 12 identical 7x7 blocks.
      Dimensions: 19x25
    Output:
      GridType: Output Matrix
      Structure: A single column of 3 subgrids.
      Content: Identical to the rightmost column of subgrids (columns 18-24) from the input.
      Dimensions: 19x7

DerivedGeneralizations:
  - Object: Input Grid, Output Grid, Subgrids, Separator Lines
  - Properties:
      - Input grid has a width (`iw`) and height (`ih`).
      - Input grid is tiled with repeating subgrids of width (`sw`) and height (`sh`).
      - Subgrids are separated by single-pixel lines of `SeparatorColor`.
      - Output grid has height `ih` and width `sw`.
  - Action: Extraction
  - Relationship:
      - The output grid is extracted from the input grid.
      - The extracted region corresponds to the rightmost `sw` columns of the input grid.
      - The subgrid width `sw` can be determined by finding the column index of the first vertical separator line (index `sw-1`) and adding 1.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the width (`sw`) of the repeating subgrids within the input grid. This can be found by identifying the color used for the separating grid lines and finding the column index of the first vertical line composed entirely of that color; the width `sw` is that index plus one.
2.  Determine the total width (`iw`) of the input grid.
3.  Calculate the starting column index (`start_col`) for the rightmost subgrid column by subtracting the subgrid width (`sw`) from the total input width (`iw`): `start_col = iw - sw`.
4.  Extract the portion of the input grid that includes all rows and the columns from `start_col` up to (but not including) `iw`.
5.  The extracted portion is the final output grid.
