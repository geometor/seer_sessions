task_description: Extracts non-background pixels from an input grid based on row-major scan order and arranges them into a single output column.
elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - variable height and width (e.g., 16x16 in examples)
      - contains multiple colors
      - possesses a single background color
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      - width is always 1 (single column)
      - height equals the count of foreground pixels in the input grid
      - contains only foreground colors from the input grid, preserving their scan order
  - name: background_pixel
    type: pixel (integer value and position)
    properties:
      - located at input_grid[0][0]
      - its color value defines the background color for the entire grid
  - name: foreground_pixels
    type: ordered collection of pixels (integer values)
    properties:
      - includes all pixels in the input_grid whose color is not the background color
      - order is determined by row-major scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
relationships:
  - The background color is determined solely by the pixel at input_grid[0][0].
  - The output_grid's height is directly determined by the total number of foreground_pixels.
  - The sequence of color values in the output_grid column exactly matches the sequence of foreground_pixels collected during the scan.
actions:
  - identify_background: Read the color value from input_grid[0][0].
  - scan_and_filter: Iterate through input_grid row by row, then column by column. For each pixel, compare its color to the background color. If different, add it to a temporary list.
  - construct_output: Create a new grid with 1 column and rows equal to the number of pixels in the temporary list. Populate this column with the pixel values from the list, in order.
