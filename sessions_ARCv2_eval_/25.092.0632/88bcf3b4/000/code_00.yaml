Task: Modify pixels of one color based on adjacency to pixels of another color.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a single Background_Color (most frequent color).
    - Contains exactly three distinct Non_Background_Colors.
  Objects:
    - Pixels forming contiguous areas.

Color_Roles:
  - Identify the three Non_Background_Colors present in the input.
  - Target_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the highest numerical index.
  - Unaffected_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the middle numerical index.
  - Source_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the lowest numerical index.

Transformation:
  Action: Modify pixels based on color role and adjacency.
  Rule:
    - Iterate through each pixel (cell) in the input grid.
    - If the pixel color is Source_Color:
      - Check the 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals).
      - Condition: If any neighbor has the Target_Color.
        - Result_True: Change the pixel's color to Target_Color in the output grid.
        - Result_False: Change the pixel's color to Background_Color in the output grid.
    - Else (pixel color is Target_Color, Unaffected_Color, or Background_Color):
      - Result: Keep the original pixel color in the output grid.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
    - Contains pixels modified according to the Transformation Rule.
    - Pixels originally of Target_Color or Unaffected_Color remain unchanged.
    - Background largely remains, potentially expanding into areas previously occupied by Source_Color pixels.
