            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of colored pixels. The size of the grid remains the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each grid has a dominant background color (white/0 in ex 1, 4, 5; orange/7 in ex 2; blue/1 in ex 3). This background color remains largely unchanged in the output, except where specific transformations occur.\n3.  **Objects:** Within the grid, there are distinct \"objects\" composed of contiguous pixels of non-background colors. In all examples, there appear to be exactly three distinct non-background colors present in the input grid.\n4.  **Color Roles:** By comparing inputs and outputs, it seems the three non-background colors play specific roles based on their numerical value (color index):\n    *   **Target Color:** The color with the highest numerical index among the three non-background colors. Pixels of this color remain unchanged and seem to influence the transformation.\n    *   **Unaffected Color:** The color with the middle numerical index. Pixels of this color remain completely unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Source Color:** The color with the lowest numerical index. Pixels of this color are the ones that undergo transformation.\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation operates on the pixels of the Source color.\n    *   If a pixel with the Source color is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to *any* pixel with the Target color in the input grid, its color changes to the Target color in the output grid.\n    *   If a pixel with the Source color is *not* adjacent to any pixel with the Target color, its color changes to the Background color in the output grid.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds across all five training examples. The identification of Source, Target, and Unaffected colors based on their numerical index (min, max, mid) and the subsequent adjacency-based transformation rule correctly predicts the output from the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
