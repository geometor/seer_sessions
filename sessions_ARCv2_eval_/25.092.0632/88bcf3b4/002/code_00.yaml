Task: Modify pixels of two specific colors based on adjacency to a third color.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a single Background_Color (most frequent color).
    - Contains exactly three distinct Non_Background_Colors.
  Objects:
    - Pixels forming contiguous areas.

Color_Roles:
  - Identify the Background_Color (most frequent).
  - Identify the three Non_Background_Colors.
  - Sort Non_Background_Colors numerically by index.
  - Source_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the lowest index.
  - Mid_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the middle index.
  - Target_Color: The Non_Background_Color with the highest index.

Transformation:
  Action: Modify pixels based on color role and adjacency to Target_Color.
  Rule:
    - Iterate through each pixel (cell) in the input grid.
    - Determine the pixel's color in the input grid.
    - Case 1: Pixel color is Source_Color:
      - Check the 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) in the input grid.
      - Condition: If any neighbor has the Target_Color.
        - Result_True: Change the pixel's color to Mid_Color in the output grid.
        - Result_False: Change the pixel's color to Background_Color in the output grid.
    - Case 2: Pixel color is Mid_Color:
      - Check the 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) in the input grid.
      - Condition: If any neighbor has the Target_Color.
        - Result_True: Change the pixel's color to Target_Color in the output grid.
        - Result_False: Change the pixel's color to Background_Color in the output grid.
    - Case 3: Pixel color is Target_Color:
      - Result: Keep the Target_Color in the output grid.
    - Case 4: Pixel color is Background_Color:
      - Result: Keep the Background_Color in the output grid.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
    - Contains pixels modified according to the Transformation Rule.
    - Pixels originally of Target_Color or Background_Color remain unchanged unless they were covered by a transformed pixel.
    - Background potentially expands into areas previously occupied by Source_Color or Mid_Color pixels that were not adjacent to Target_Color pixels.
