task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on surrounding color and grid properties.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - element: region
    description: A contiguous area of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the region.
      - connectivity: Pixels are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way adjacency).
  - element: hole
    description: A contiguous region of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - boundary_pixels: The set of non-white pixels directly adjacent (8-way) to the hole region.
      - surrounding_color_uniformity: Whether all boundary pixels share the same single color C.
      - surrounding_color: The uniform color C of the boundary pixels, if uniformity holds.

actions:
  - action: identify_holes
    description: Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
  - action: analyze_boundary
    description: For each white region, determine the set of adjacent non-white pixels and check if they are all of a single color C.
  - action: determine_fill_color
    description: Based on the surrounding color C and grid properties (shape and size), determine the fill color F according to specific rules.
  - action: fill_hole
    description: Change the color of all pixels within an identified hole region to the determined fill color F (if F is non-white).

relationships:
  - relationship: enclosure
    description: A white region is enclosed if all its adjacent non-white pixels have the same color C.
  - relationship: color_mapping
    description: A mapping exists between the surrounding color C and the fill color F.
    details:
      - C=2 (Red) -> F=7 (Orange)
      - C=3 (Green) -> F=3 (Green)
      - C=7 (Orange) -> F=7 (Orange)
      - C=8 (Gray) -> F=1 (Blue)
      - C=4 (Yellow) -> depends on grid shape/size
  - relationship: grid_property_dependency
    description: The fill rule for holes surrounded by Yellow (4) depends on whether the grid is square and its dimensions.
    details:
      - If grid is square (H=W), F = H / 2.
      - If grid is not square, F = 0 (no fill).
