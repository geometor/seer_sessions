**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The output grid generally resembles the input grid, with specific modifications.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change involves filling regions of `white` (0) pixels within the input grid with a specific non-`white` color.
3.  **Identifying Regions to Fill:** The `white` regions that get filled appear to be "holes" â€“ contiguous areas of `white` pixels that are completely surrounded (including diagonals) by pixels of a single, uniform non-`white` color.
4.  **Determining Fill Color:** The color used to fill a hole depends on the color (`C`) of the surrounding pixels. There's a specific mapping rule:
    *   If the surrounding color `C` is Green (3), the fill color `F` is Green (3).
    *   If `C` is Orange (7), `F` is Orange (7).
    *   If `C` is Red (2), `F` is Orange (7).
    *   If `C` is Gray (8), `F` is Blue (1).
    *   If `C` is Yellow (4), the rule is conditional:
        *   If the grid is square (height equals width), the fill color `F` is determined by the grid dimension (Height / 2 or Width / 2). For example, in a 12x12 grid, F=6 (Magenta); in a 10x10 grid, F=5 (Gray).
        *   If the grid is not square, holes surrounded by Yellow (4) are *not* filled (remain `white` (0)).
5.  **No Other Changes:** Pixels that are not part of these fillable `white` holes remain unchanged from input to output. Shapes and other colored pixels retain their original positions and colors.

    details:
      - If grid is square (H=W), F = H / 2.
      - If grid is not square, F = 0 (no fill).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all distinct contiguous regions of `white` (0) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections). Keep track of visited `white` pixels to process each region only once.
3.  For each `white` region found:
    a.  Identify all pixels that are adjacent (8-way) to any pixel within this `white` region.
    b.  From these adjacent pixels, collect only the ones that are *not* `white` (color > 0). Let this set be the `boundary_pixels`.
    c.  Check if the `boundary_pixels` set is non-empty and if all pixels in this set have the exact same color. Let this uniform color be `C`.
    d.  If such a uniform surrounding color `C` exists, determine the fill color `F` based on the following rules:
        i.  If `C` is Green (3), set `F` to Green (3).
        
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Identify contiguous regions of white (0) pixels in the input grid using 8-way adjacency.
For each distinct white region found:
1. Identify all non-white pixels that are adjacent (8-way, including diagonals) to any pixel within the white region. These form the 'boundary pixels'.
2. Check if the set of boundary pixels is non-empty and if all boundary pixels share the exact same color, C.
3. If a uniform surrounding color C exists, determine the fill color F based on the following rules:
    - If C is Green (3), set F to Green (3).
    - If C is Orange (7), set F to Orange (7).
    - If C is Red (2), set F to Orange (7).
    - If C is Gray (8), set F to Blue (1).
    - If C is Yellow (4):
        - Check if the input grid is square (height equals width).
        - If the grid is square, set F to the color value equal to the grid's height (or width) divided by 2 using integer division (e.g., a 10x10 grid results in F=5).
        - If the grid is not square, set F to white (0), meaning the hole is not filled.
    - For any other uniform surrounding color C not listed above, set F to white (0) (no fill).
4. If a non-white fill color F (F > 0) is determined for the white region, change the color of all pixels belonging to that specific white region to F in the output grid.
5. Pixels that are not part of a fillable white region (either because they were not white initially, or the white region didn't meet the filling criteria) remain unchanged from the input grid.
Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, and apply the modifications based on the rules above.
