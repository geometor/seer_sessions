Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The inputs are relatively large grids (around 22x22) containing various colored pixels, including a distinct border and scattered 'noise' pixels. The outputs are significantly smaller grids.
2.  **Background:** The color white (0) seems to function as the primary background color within the main area of the input grid, separating different elements.
3.  **Borders:** The input grids often have distinct borders made of single colors (yellow in train\_1, complex in train\_2, red/yellow in train\_3). These borders do not seem to directly contribute to the output grid's content, other than potentially framing the area of interest.
4.  **Noise:** Scattered pixels of various colors (often gray (5) or the border color) appear near the edges or randomly within the background area. These noise pixels are not part of the final output.
5.  **Target Object:** The core feature in each input grid is a large, contiguous or near-contiguous object composed of one or more colors (not white). This object appears to be the sole source of the output grid's content.
    *   In `train_1`, the object is primarily blue (1).
    *   In `train_2`, the object is primarily red (2).
    *   In `train_3`, the object is primarily azure (8).
6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be an extraction process. The task involves identifying the main, largest non-background object within the input grid, determining its spatial extent (bounding box), and copying the pixels within that bounding box to form the output grid. The relative positions of the pixels within the extracted object are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Extract the largest contiguous non-background object.

Input:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22).
      - Contains:
          - Background Pixels: Predominantly white (0) in the central area.
          - Border Pixels: Frame the grid, variable colors.
          - Noise Pixels: Scattered, non-contiguous, non-background pixels, often near edges.
          - Target Object(s): Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.

Output:
  - Grid: Output grid containing the extracted object.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Smaller than the input, determined by the target object's bounding box.
      - Content: Pixels corresponding exactly to the target object from the input grid.

Identification:
  - Background Color: White (0) is the relevant background for object identification (ignoring outer grid borders).
  - Target Object Definition: The single largest contiguous object composed of any color(s) *except* the background color (white). Contiguity includes adjacent (side-by-side and diagonal) pixels.

Action:
  - Find Objects: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
  - Select Largest: Determine which of these objects contains the most pixels.
  - Define Bounding Box: Find the minimum rectangular area (top-left row/col, bottom-right row/col) that encloses all pixels of the selected largest object.
  - Extract: Copy the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels found within the input grid.
  - Borders and noise pixels in the input are ignored during the extraction process.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous groups of pixels whose color is *not* the background color (white). Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same contiguous group.
3.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified contiguous group.
4.  Select the group with the largest size. If there's a tie, assume based on the examples that there will be only one largest group relevant to the task's core pattern.
5.  Determine the minimum bounding box of the selected largest group: find the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index occupied by the pixels of this group.
6.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of the bounding box.
7.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the calculated bounding box (from `min_row`, `min_col` to `max_row`, `max_col` inclusive) into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully identified connected components but failed to correctly isolate the *target* object from surrounding "noise" or border elements. The discrepancies between the transformed and expected outputs indicate that the criteria for selecting the target component (simply the largest non-background component not touching the absolute edge) are incorrect.

The key issue seems to be accurately identifying *which* non-background component is the correct one to extract. Observing the examples:
*   **Example 1:** The target object is primarily blue (1). Yellow (4) and magenta (6) elements near it are excluded.
*   **Example 2:** The target object is primarily red (2). Green (3) elements near it are excluded.
*   **Example 3:** The target object is primarily azure (8). Yellow (4) elements near it are excluded.

This suggests the core object has a primary color, and this primary color might be identifiable by its frequency within the central area of the grid, distinct from border or noise colors.

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  **Isolate Inner Grid:** Define an "inner grid" by excluding the absolute 1-pixel border of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target Color:** Determine the most frequent non-white (0) color within this inner grid. This will be designated the `target_color`.
3.  **Find Target Component:** Identify all contiguous components (using 8-way adjacency) of non-white pixels in the *entire* input grid. Select the largest component that contains *at least one pixel* of the `target_color`.
4.  **Extract Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box of this selected component.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Shapes:** The transformed output shapes consistently differ from the expected output shapes, confirming the bounding box calculation is based on the wrong component or includes extraneous pixels.
*   **Dominant Inner Color:**
    *   Example 1: Dominant inner color is blue (1), matching the primary color of the object in the expected output.
    *   Example 2: Dominant inner color is red (2), matching the primary color of the object in the expected output.
    *   Example 3: Dominant inner color is azure (8), matching the primary color of the object in the expected output.
*   **Color Frequencies:** The frequencies of colors within the expected outputs correspond closely to the frequencies of those same colors within the dominant inner object of the input (e.g., Example 1: Expected has 133 blue(1), 7 red(2), 5 green(3), 14 azure(8); Inner Freq has 133 blue(1), 7 red(2), 5 green(3), 14 azure(8), plus others like yellow(4) and magenta(6) which are correctly excluded in the output). This strongly supports the hypothesis that the target object is the one containing the dominant inner color.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Extract the largest object containing the dominant internal color.

Input:
  - Grid: Input grid (e.g., 22x22).
  - Properties:
      - Contains:
          - Background Pixels: White (0).
          - Border Pixels: Form an outer frame (1-pixel thick).
          - Inner Area: The grid excluding the 1-pixel border.
          - Noise Pixels: Scattered non-background pixels, potentially inside or outside the target object's bounding box, distinct from the target object's primary color.
          - Potential Target Object(s): Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.

Identification:
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Target Color: The non-background color with the highest frequency count within the inner area (input grid excluding the 1-pixel border).
  - Target Object Definition: The single largest contiguous component (8-way adjacency) of non-background pixels that contains *at least one pixel* of the `Target Color`.

Action:
  - Define Inner Area: Conceptually remove the outermost row/column from the input grid.
  - Find Target Color: Count frequencies of non-background colors in the inner area and identify the most frequent one (`target_color`).
  - Find Components: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background pixels in the *original* input grid.
  - Select Target Component: Filter the components to find those containing at least one pixel of `target_color`. From this filtered list, select the component with the largest number of pixels.
  - Define Bounding Box: Find the minimum rectangular area enclosing the selected target component.
  - Extract: Copy the portion of the original input grid defined by the bounding box.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The content is determined by the largest connected object that incorporates the most frequent color found inside the input's border.
  - Pixels belonging to the absolute border or noise components not connected to the target object (even if they are within its bounding box area conceptually) are excluded.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the background color as white (0).
2.  Define the "inner grid" as the input grid excluding the top row, bottom row, leftmost column, and rightmost column.
3.  Scan the inner grid and count the occurrences of each non-background color. Identify the color with the highest count; this is the `target_color`.
4.  Scan the *entire original* input grid to find all contiguous components of non-background pixels, using 8-way adjacency (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections).
5.  Filter these components: Keep only those components that contain at least one pixel matching the `target_color`.
6.  From the filtered list of components, select the component that has the largest size (most pixels). This is the `target_component`.
7.  Determine the minimum bounding box of the `target_component`: find the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index occupied by its pixels.
8.  Create a new output grid by extracting the rectangular region defined by the bounding box from the *original* input grid.
