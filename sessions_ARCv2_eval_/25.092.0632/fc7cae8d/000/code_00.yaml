Task: Extract the largest contiguous non-background object.

Input:
  - Grid: Input grid containing pixels of various colors.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 22x22).
      - Contains:
          - Background Pixels: Predominantly white (0) in the central area.
          - Border Pixels: Frame the grid, variable colors.
          - Noise Pixels: Scattered, non-contiguous, non-background pixels, often near edges.
          - Target Object(s): Contiguous areas of non-background pixels.

Output:
  - Grid: Output grid containing the extracted object.
  - Properties:
      - Dimensions: Smaller than the input, determined by the target object's bounding box.
      - Content: Pixels corresponding exactly to the target object from the input grid.

Identification:
  - Background Color: White (0) is the relevant background for object identification (ignoring outer grid borders).
  - Target Object Definition: The single largest contiguous object composed of any color(s) *except* the background color (white). Contiguity includes adjacent (side-by-side and diagonal) pixels.

Action:
  - Find Objects: Identify all contiguous groups of non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
  - Select Largest: Determine which of these objects contains the most pixels.
  - Define Bounding Box: Find the minimum rectangular area (top-left row/col, bottom-right row/col) that encloses all pixels of the selected largest object.
  - Extract: Copy the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box.

Relationship:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels found within the input grid.
  - Borders and noise pixels in the input are ignored during the extraction process.
