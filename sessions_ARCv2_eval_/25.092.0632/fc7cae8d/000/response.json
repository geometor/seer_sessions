The outputs are significantly smaller grids.\n2.  **Background:** The color white (0) seems to function as the primary background color within the main area of the input grid, separating different elements.\n3.  **Borders:** The input grids often have distinct borders made of single colors (yellow in train\\_1, complex in train\\_2, red/yellow in train\\_3). These borders do not seem to directly contribute to the output grid's content, other than potentially framing the area of interest.\n4.  **Noise:** Scattered pixels of various colors (often gray (5) or the border color) appear near the edges or randomly within the background area. These noise pixels are not part of the final output.\n5.  **Target Object:** The core feature in each input grid is a large, contiguous or near-contiguous object composed of one or more colors (not white). This object appears to be the sole source of the output grid's content.\n    *   In `train_1`, the object is primarily blue (1).\n    *   In `train_2`, the object is primarily red (2).\n    *   In `train_3`, the object is primarily azure (8).\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be an extraction process. The task involves identifying the main, largest non-background object within the input grid, determining its spatial extent (bounding box), and copying the pixels within that bounding box to form the output grid. The relative positions of the pixels within the extracted object are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous groups of pixels whose color is *not* the background color (white). Consider pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same contiguous group.\n3.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified contiguous group.\n4.  Select the group with the largest size. If there's a tie, assume based on the examples that there will be only one largest group relevant to the task's core pattern.\n5.  Determine the minimum bounding box of the selected largest group: find the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index occupied by the pixels of this group.\n6.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of the bounding box.\n7.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the calculated bounding box (from `min_row`, `min_col` to `max_row`, `max_col` inclusive) into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions."
