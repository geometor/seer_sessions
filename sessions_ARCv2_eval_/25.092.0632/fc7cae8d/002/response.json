            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core task as extracting an object based on its bounding box. However, the rule \"extract the largest contiguous non-background object\" failed because it often selected components that included border elements or noise pixels connected to the main object, resulting in an incorrect bounding box and extracted grid.\n\nThe failure occurred because the definition of the \"target object\" was too simple. The target object isn't just the *largest* non-white object; it seems to be the largest non-white object that is \"internal\" to the grid, meaning it doesn't touch the absolute outer border pixels. The borders and scattered noise pixels, even if connected to the target object, should be ignored.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the object identification process:\n1.  Identify all non-background (non-white) contiguous components.\n2.  Filter out components that touch the absolute outer edge of the input grid.\n3.  From the remaining \"internal\" components, select the largest one (by pixel count).\n4.  Determine the bounding box of this selected component.\n5.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
