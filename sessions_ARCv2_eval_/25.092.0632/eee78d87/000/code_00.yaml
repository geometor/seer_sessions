Input Properties:
  - Grid Size: 6x6
  - Background Color: Dominant color in the grid (Orange=7 in examples).
  - Foreground Object: Present if any pixel color differs from the background color.
  - Foreground Properties: Color and shape vary but seem irrelevant to the output pattern beyond their existence.

Output Properties:
  - Grid Size: 16x16
  - Base Pattern:
      - Background: White (0)
      - Structure: A 5x5 arrangement of 2x2 blocks separated by single white lines (rows/cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are white).
      - Block Color: Matches the background color of the input grid.
  - Conditional Overlay:
      - Trigger: Presence of any non-background pixel in the input grid.
      - Overlay Color: Maroon (9)
      - Overlay Pattern: A fixed, specific pattern centered within the 16x16 grid. The exact coordinates are:
          - Rows 5, 10: Cols 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
          - Rows 6, 9: Cols 5, 8, 11
          - Rows 7, 8: Cols 6, 7, 9, 10

Transformation Rule:
  - Step 1: Identify the background color of the input grid.
  - Step 2: Generate a 16x16 base grid with a pattern of 5x5 blocks (each 2x2) using the identified background color, separated by white lines.
  - Step 3: Check if the input grid contains any pixel whose color is different from the background color.
  - Step 4: If such a pixel exists, overlay the fixed maroon pattern onto the base grid. Otherwise, the base grid is the final output.
