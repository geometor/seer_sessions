Input Properties:
  - Grid Size: 6x6
  - Background Color (BG): The most frequent color in the input grid (Orange=7 in examples).
  - Foreground Color (FG): The color of any pixel different from the BG. Assumed to be only one such color per input. Can be None if all pixels are BG.
    - FG examples: Green(3), Blue(1), Magenta(6).

Output Properties:
  - Grid Size: 16x16
  - Structure: A grid divided by lines and blocks.
      - Lines: Rows and Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.
      - Blocks: 2x2 areas between the lines (e.g., rows 1-2, cols 1-2 is the top-left block).
  - Base Pattern Determination: Depends on the input FG.
      - Pattern A (FG=Green(3) or FG=None): Lines are White(0), Blocks are BG Color.
      - Pattern B (FG=Blue(1) or FG=Magenta(6)): Lines are BG Color, Blocks are White(0).
  - Conditional Overlay:
      - Trigger: Presence of an FG (FG is not None).
      - Overlay Color: Maroon (9).
      - Overlay Pattern: A fixed pattern of 24 pixels at specific coordinates, overwriting the base pattern color at those locations.
      - Overlay Coordinates (row, col):
          - (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10)
          - (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9), (10, 10)
          - (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 11)
          - (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 11)
          - (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 9), (7, 10)
          - (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 10)

Transformation Rule:
  - Step 1: Identify the Background Color (BG) and Foreground Color (FG) from the input grid.
  - Step 2: Determine the colors for lines and blocks based on the FG:
      - If FG is Blue(1) or Magenta(6): line_color = BG, block_color = White(0).
      - Else (FG is Green(3) or None): line_color = White(0), block_color = BG.
  - Step 3: Create a 16x16 grid. Iterate through each cell (r, c):
      - If r or c is a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15), set the cell to line_color.
      - Otherwise, set the cell to block_color.
  - Step 4: If FG is not None, overwrite the cells at the predefined 24 overlay coordinates with Maroon(9).
  - Step 5: The resulting 16x16 grid is the final output.
