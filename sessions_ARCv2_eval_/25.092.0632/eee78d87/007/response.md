"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid based on the following rules:

1.  Identifies the background color (BG - most frequent) and foreground color (FG - any other color present, assuming only one type matters) in the input grid.
2.  Determines a base pattern style for the 16x16 output grid based on the FG:
    *   **Pattern A** (If FG is Green(3) or no FG exists): White(0) lines and BG-colored 2x2 blocks. Lines are rows/columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.
    *   **Pattern B** (If FG is Blue(1)): BG-colored lines and White(0) 2x2 blocks.
    *   **Pattern C** (If FG is Magenta(6)): A checkerboard pattern where 3x3 regions alternate between applying Pattern A rules and Pattern B rules locally. The top-left (0,0) 3x3 region uses Pattern B rules. Regions where the sum of block row index and block column index `(r//3 + c//3)` is even use Pattern B rules; odd sums use Pattern A rules.
3.  Creates the 16x16 output grid and fills it cell by cell according to the determined base pattern style (A, B, or C).
4.  Identifies a specific, fixed pattern of Maroon(9) overlay coordinates based on the FG color (Green, Blue, or Magenta).
5.  If an FG exists in the input, overlays the corresponding Maroon(9) pattern onto the base grid, overwriting the base colors at those specific coordinates.
6.  Returns the final 16x16 grid.
