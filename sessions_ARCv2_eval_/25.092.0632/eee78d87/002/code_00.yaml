Input Properties:
  - Grid Size: 6x6
  - Background Color (BG): The most frequent color (Orange=7 in examples).
  - Foreground Object: Present if any pixel color differs from BG.
  - Foreground Color (FG): The color of the non-background pixels (Green=3, Blue=1, Magenta=6 in examples).

Output Properties:
  - Grid Size: 16x16
  - Structure: A base grid composed of a 5x5 arrangement of 2x2 blocks separated by single lines (rows/cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are lines; others form blocks).
  - Base Pattern Coloration: Depends on the input Foreground Color (FG). Uses Input Background Color (BG=Orange=7) and White(0).
    - If FG is Green(3): Pattern A -> Lines=White(0), Blocks=Orange(7).
    - If FG is Blue(1): Pattern B -> Lines=Orange(7), Blocks=White(0).
    - If FG is Magenta(6): Pattern C -> Checkerboard. Blocks/lines alternate color based on their position in the 5x5 meta-grid. If block (i,j) (where i,j range 0-4) has i+j is even, use Pattern B locally; if i+j is odd, use Pattern A locally.
    - If no FG exists (assumption): Use Pattern A (White lines, Orange blocks).
  - Conditional Overlay:
    - Trigger: Presence of any non-background pixel in the input grid.
    - Overlay Color: Maroon (9).
    - Overlay Action: Replaces the base pattern color with Maroon at specific, fixed coordinates.
    - Overlay Coordinates (row, col):
      - (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10)
      - (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 9), (10, 10)
      - (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 11)
      - (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 11)
      - (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 9), (7, 10)
      - (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (8, 10)

Transformation Rule:
  - Step 1: Identify the Background Color (BG) and any Foreground Color (FG) in the input grid.
  - Step 2: Create a 16x16 output grid.
  - Step 3: Determine the base pattern type based on FG:
    - FG=3: Generate Pattern A (White lines, BG blocks).
    - FG=1: Generate Pattern B (BG lines, White blocks).
    - FG=6: Generate Pattern C (Checkerboard using BG and White).
    - No FG: Generate Pattern A (Default assumption).
  - Step 4: Populate the output grid with the selected base pattern.
  - Step 5: Check if an FG exists in the input grid.
  - Step 6: If FG exists, overlay the fixed maroon pattern onto the base grid by changing the color to Maroon(9) at the specified coordinates.
  - Step 7: Return the final 16x16 grid.
