Identifies the background color (BG - most frequent) and foreground color (FG - any other color, assuming only one) in the input grid.\n2. Determines a base pattern for the 16x16 output grid based on the FG:\n    - Pattern A (FG=Green(3) or No FG): White(0) lines, BG blocks. Lines are rows/cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15. Blocks are the 2x2 areas in between.\n    - Pattern B (FG=Blue(1) or FG=Magenta(6)): BG lines, White(0) blocks.\n3. Creates the 16x16 output grid and fills it with the determined base pattern.\n4. If an FG exists in the input, overlays a fixed pattern of 24 Maroon(9) pixels onto the base grid at specific coordinates, overwriting the base color.\n5.
