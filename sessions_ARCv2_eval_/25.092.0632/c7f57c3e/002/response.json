            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed because the transformation rules derived solely from the first example were too simplistic and did not account for variations seen in the second example. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Background Dependency:** The core logic correctly identified that the rules depend on the background color (Yellow vs. Green), but the specific rules for each background needed refinement.\n2.  **Yellow Background Case (Example 1):**\n    *   The Green -> Azure swap was mostly correct.\n    *   The Azure -> Green/Red transformation was more complex than a simple swap; it depended on the position of the Azure pixel within its contiguous block (min row pixel -> Red, others -> Green).\n    *   The Red -> Azure transformation was not just simple adjacency to original Green pixels; it seemed to involve adjacency to other Red pixels that were also changing, suggesting a potential propagation or block-based change. However, closer inspection revealed the expected output contradicts a simple block-change rule for the Red block at (6,4)/(7,4). The rule seems to be: change Red to Azure if adjacent to original Green OR adjacent to another Red that changes to Azure.\n3.  **Green Background Case (Example 2):**\n    *   The identification of the trigger (Magenta) and primary target (min-row Yellow) was correct.\n    *   The handling of *other* Yellow pixels was incorrect. Instead of changing all Yellows to Magenta, only the target Yellow changes to Magenta, the Magenta trigger changes to background Green, a new Magenta appears at the top, and the remaining Yellows either stay Yellow (if isolated) or change to background Green (if part of a multi-pixel Yellow block).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nRefine the logic for each background case based on the detailed analysis of failures and metric verification. Implement the revised hypotheses derived from comparing inputs, expected outputs, and actual outputs. Specifically, address the conditional changes for Azure and Red pixels in the Yellow background case, and the different outcomes for Yellow pixels in the Green background case.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` in the previous thought block to verify pixel locations, adjacencies, object sizes, and specific color changes between input and expected output for both examples.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Yellow Background):** Verified locations of Green, Azure, Red pixels. Calculated adjacency between Red and original Green pixels. Identified contiguous blocks of Azure and Green pixels and their sizes. Confirmed the specific color changes for each Azure and Green pixel/block, and for each Red pixel based on adjacency rules. Crucially identified that the single Azure pixel at the minimum row index within its block becomes Red, while others become Green. Also confirmed the recursive/propagating nature of the Red->Azure change based on adjacency.\n*   **Example 2 (Green Background):** Verified the single Magenta trigger location and all Yellow target locations. Confirmed the min-row Yellow pixel selection logic. Verified the expected output colors for each original Yellow pixel, confirming that the target becomes Magenta, isolated others stay Yellow, and non-isolated others become background Green.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
