            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels with different colors. Each task uses a specific background color (Blue=1 in train_1, Azure=8 in train_2, Green=3 in train_3).\n2.  **Objects:** Within the grids, there are distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of non-background colors. Some objects consist of multiple colors.\n3.  **Key Colors:** In train_1 and train_3, certain objects seem to be composed of two specific colors that are important for the transformation:\n    *   Train_1: Yellow (4) and Azure (8)\n    *   Train_3: Red (2) and Blue (1)\n4.  **Transformation as Movement:** The primary transformation appears to be the horizontal movement (translation) of specific objects. The background and some other objects remain stationary.\n5.  **Identifying Moving Objects:** The objects that move seem to contain specific pairs of colors (Yellow/Azure in train_1, Red/Blue in train_3). Objects made of only one color (like the lone Yellow pixel in train_1 or the Yellow line in train_2) or different pairs do not move according to this rule.\n6.  **Movement Pattern:**\n    *   **Direction:** The direction of movement (left or right) alternates based on the top-to-bottom order of the moving objects. The first object moves right, the second left, the third right, and so on.\n    *   **Column Parity Modification:** This alternating pattern is potentially modified by the column index of a specific 'marker' pixel within the object (Yellow in train_1, Red in train_3). If the marker pixel's column index is even, the direction alternates as usual. If it's odd, the direction repeats the direction of the previous object in the sequence (observed in train_3).\n    *   **Magnitude:** The amount of horizontal shift is constant for a given task but differs between tasks (3 columns in train_1, 2 columns in train_3). This magnitude seems linked to the specific color pair involved.\n7.  **Train_2 Anomaly:** Train_2 doesn't clearly fit the pattern observed in train_1 and train_3. While there are objects with multiple colors (Green/Blue), their movement isn't a simple horizontal shift, and the Magenta pixels exhibit unusual behavior (potentially merging or moving based on a different rule). It's possible train_2 follows a different logic or a more complex version of the observed pattern. However, focusing on the clearer pattern in train_1 and train_3 seems more productive for defining a general rule.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Determine the 'marker' color and the 'moved' color specific to this task (e.g., Yellow=4 and Azure=8 for train_1; Red=2 and Blue=1 for train_3). This pair might be deduced by finding objects composed of exactly two non-background colors where one color appears as a single pixel within or adjacent to a larger shape of the other color.\n4.  Determine the horizontal shift magnitude specific to this task (e.g., 3 for the Yellow/Azure pair, 2 for the Red/Blue pair).\n5.  Find all distinct, contiguous objects in the input grid that contain *both* the marker color and the moved color. Keep track of the location of the marker pixel(s) within each object. If an object has multiple marker pixels, use the topmost, leftmost one for ordering.\n6.  Create a list of these identified objects, sorted primarily by the row index and secondarily by the column index of their marker pixel.\n7.  Initialize the shift direction for the first object in the sorted list as 'Right'.\n8.  Iterate through the sorted list of objects:\n    a.  Determine the current object's horizontal shift direction:\n        i.  If it's the first object, the direction is 'Right'.\n        ii. If it's not the first object, check the column index of its marker pixel.\n        iii. If the marker column index is even, flip the direction from the previous object (Right -> Left, Left -> Right).\n        iv. If the marker column index is odd, keep the same direction as the previous object.\n    b.  Calculate the horizontal shift amount: positive magnitude for 'Right', negative magnitude for 'Left'.\n    c.  For every pixel belonging to the current object (both marker and moved colors) in the input grid:\n        i.  Calculate its new column index by adding the horizontal shift amount.\n        ii. Keep the row index the same.\n        iii. Clear the pixel's original location in the output grid (set to background color).\n        iv. Place the pixel's original color at the new (row, column) location in the output grid. Handle potential overwrites carefully if objects might overlap after moving (though this doesn't seem to occur in the examples).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
