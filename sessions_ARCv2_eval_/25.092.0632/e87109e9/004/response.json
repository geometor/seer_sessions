The results clearly show that the actual transformation involves a more complex definition of which colors are \"paintable\". Specifically, colors present in the top \"Palette\" section, when paired with white (0), seem to play a crucial role alongside the canvas background color. The flood fill expands from the initial azure (8) pixels onto adjacent pixels (8-way connectivity) *only* if those adjacent pixels have a color that is either the canvas background color or one of the colors identified in the palette. All other colors act as barriers. The strategy is to refine the definition of \"paintable colors\" based on this combined logic and re-test.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n"
