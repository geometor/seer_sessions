task_description: "Flood fill with azure color, constrained by barrier colors defined in a palette and the canvas background."

input_elements:
  - element: Palette
    location: Top 6 rows (if grid height > 6)
    properties:
      - border: Gray (5)
      - content: Contains pairs of [Color, White (0)]
    purpose: Defines potential 'barrier' colors (those paired with white).
  - element: Canvas
    location: Rows below the Palette (or entire grid if no Palette)
    properties:
      - background_color: Dominant color in this section (excluding azure 8).
      - content: Contains various colored objects/regions.
      - includes: Azure (8) 'seed' pixels.
    purpose: The area where the transformation takes place.
  - element: Azure_Seed
    location: Within the Canvas
    color: Azure (8)
    purpose: Starting points for the flood fill.
  - element: Barrier_Object
    location: Within the Canvas
    color: Any color that is NOT the canvas background color. Includes colors identified in the Palette.
    purpose: Blocks the spread of the azure flood fill.

transformation:
  - action: Identify_Paintable_Background
    inputs: [Canvas]
    outputs: [Paintable background color]
    logic: >
      Find the most frequent color in the Canvas section, excluding azure (8).
  - action: Locate_Azure_Seeds
    inputs: [Canvas]
    outputs: [List of seed coordinates]
    logic: Find all coordinates `(r, c)` where `Canvas[r, c]` is azure (8).
  - action: Flood_Fill_on_Background
    inputs: [Canvas, Azure_Seeds, Paintable background color]
    outputs: [Modified Canvas]
    logic: >
      Starting from the Azure_Seed pixels, recursively change adjacent (8-way connectivity)
      pixels to Azure (8) ONLY IF their current color is exactly the Paintable background color.
      All other colors (including original azure seeds and identified palette barrier colors) act as barriers and stop the fill.
  - action: Remove_Palette
    inputs: [Input Grid]
    outputs: [Output Grid]
    logic: The final output grid consists only of the modified Canvas section.

output_elements:
  - element: Modified_Canvas
    properties:
      - background_color: May be partially or fully overwritten by azure.
      - azure_regions: Expanded areas originating from Azure_Seed, covering only areas that were originally the paintable background color.
      - barrier_regions: Regions with barrier colors remain unchanged.
