## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying isolated pixels (red, green, gray) and drawing a corresponding hollow 4x4 square (yellow, blue, magenta) centered on the isolated pixel's location. The code copies the input grid and modifies it.

However, the results show consistent failures across all training examples. The key issues appear to be:
1.  **Incorrect Grid Update:** The code draws onto a copy of the input grid. This leads to conflicts where existing pixels are either incorrectly preserved (like the original trigger pixel) or incorrectly overwritten. The expected outputs suggest a more complex interaction with existing grid elements.
2.  **Handling of Pre-existing Shapes:** The expected outputs show that shapes in the input grid whose colors match the *output* colors of the transformation (yellow, blue, magenta) are removed (Examples 1, 2, 3), while other shapes might be preserved unless overwritten by a new square. The current code does not account for this removal rule.
3.  **Potential Edge Case Anomaly:** In Example 2, an apparently isolated green pixel at the bottom-right corner (9,9) does *not* result in a blue square in the expected output, contrary to the stated isolation rule. This needs further investigation but might be an anomaly in the example or point to a subtle condition not yet captured.

**Strategy:**
The transformation rule needs refinement. The most promising hypothesis based on the examples is:
1.  Identify isolated trigger pixels (red, green, gray) in the input.
2.  Create a working grid, initially a copy of the input.
3.  Remove any pixels from the working grid that have one of the *output* colors (yellow, blue, magenta). Set these locations to the background color (white).
4.  Draw the new hollow 4x4 squares (corresponding yellow, blue, or magenta) onto the working grid, centered at the locations of the identified isolated trigger pixels. These squares should have the mapped color on the perimeter and the background color inside.

This strategy addresses the removal of specific pre-existing shapes and ensures the squares are drawn onto a "cleaned" background, resolving the overwriting issues. The anomaly in Example 2 (9,9) will be monitored; the refined logic might still produce a square there, indicating a potential issue with the example's expected output or a yet undiscovered rule modification.
