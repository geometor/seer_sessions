Define trigger, output, and background colors:\n   - Trigger colors: Red (2), Green (3), Gray (5)\n   - Output colors: Blue (1), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)\n   - Background color: White (0)\n   - Color mapping: Red -> Yellow, Green -> Blue, Gray -> Magenta\n\n2. Initialize output grid: Create a copy of the input grid.\n\n3. Clear existing output colors: Iterate through the output grid. Set any pixel matching an output color (1, 4, 6) to the background color (0).\n\n4. Identify isolated trigger pixels: Iterate through the *original* input grid. For each pixel:\n   - Check if its color is one of the trigger colors (2, 3, 5).\n   - Check if all its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) are the background color (0). Pixels on edges/corners are considered isolated if all their existing neighbors are background.\n   - Store the location (row, col) and original color of each isolated trigger pixel found.\n\n5. Draw hollow squares: For each isolated trigger pixel identified in step 4:\n   - Get the center coordinates (r, c) and the trigger color.\n   - Determine the corresponding output color using the mapping (2->4, 3->1, 5->6).\n   - Calculate the top-left corner coordinates for a 4x4 square centered at (r, c). This would be (r-1, c-1).\n   - Iterate through the 4x4 area defined by the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell within this 4x4 area:\n     - Check if the cell coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n     - If the cell is on the perimeter of the 4x4 square (first/last row or first/last column relative to the 4x4 box), set its color in the output grid to the determined output color.\n     - If the cell is in the inner 2x2 area of the 4x4 square, set its color in the output grid to the background color (0).\n\n6.
