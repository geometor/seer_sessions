task_description: Fill horizontally between marker pixels on each row.
grid_properties:
  - size_input: [16, 16] # Example 1 & 2
  - size_output: [16, 16] # Example 1 & 2
  - background_color: 8 # azure
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Input can have background color and one other 'marker' color (e.g., 4 or 3).
      - position: row, column
  - type: segment
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal
      - definition: A sequence of pixels in the same row.
relationships:
  - type: horizontal_between
    description: Pixels located on the same row between two marker pixels.
    conditions:
      - Requires at least two marker pixels on the row.
      - Applies between consecutive marker pixels (when sorted by column index) on that row.
actions:
  - name: identify_marker_color
    description: Find the color present in the input grid that is not the background color (8).
  - name: scan_rows
    description: Process each row independently.
  - name: find_marker_pixels_in_row
    description: For a given row, identify the column indices of all pixels matching the marker color.
  - name: fill_between_markers
    description: If two or more marker pixels are found in a row, sort their column indices. For each adjacent pair of indices (col1, col2) in the sorted list, change the color of pixels in that row from column col1 + 1 to col2 - 1 to red (2).
output_generation:
  - The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid.
  - The fill_between_markers action modifies the grid copy.
