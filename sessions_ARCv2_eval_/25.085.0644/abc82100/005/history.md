"""
The transformation rule depends on the specific set of non-white colors present in the input grid, checked in a specific priority order:

1.  **Magenta/Orange Swap & Flip (Trigger: {6, 7} present):**
    *   Swap Magenta (6) pixels to Orange (7) and Orange (7) pixels to Magenta (6) in place.
    *   For Red (2) pixels at (r, c), place Yellow (4) at the horizontally flipped position (r, width - 1 - c) in the output.
    *   For Yellow (4) pixels at (r, c), place Red (2) at the horizontally flipped position (r, width - 1 - c) in the output.
    *   All other non-white pixels (e.g., Azure 8) become white (0).

2.  **Blue/Yellow Conditional Conversion (Trigger: {1, 4} present, and Rule 1 did not apply):**
    *   Convert Yellow (4) pixels to Red (2).
    *   Convert Blue (1) pixels to Orange (7).
    *   Convert Azure (8) pixels based on row: If the row index `r` is less than or equal to the median row index (floor((height - 1) / 2)), convert to Red (2); otherwise, convert to Orange (7).
    *   All other non-white pixels (e.g., original Red 2, Orange 7, Magenta 6) become white (0).
    *   Note: This rule primarily addresses color transformation; the spatial placement in the output might require more complex logic based on observed patterns in Example 3.

3.  **Red/Yellow Swap (Trigger: {2, 4} present, and Rules 1, 2 did not apply):**
    *   Swap Red (2) pixels to Yellow (4) and Yellow (4) pixels to Red (2).
    *   All other non-white pixels become white (0).

4.  **Blue/Red Swap (+ Azure Handling) (Trigger: {1, 2} present, and Rules 1, 2, 3 did not apply):**
    *   Check if Azure (8) is also present.
    *   **Case 4a (Azure present: {1, 2, 8}):**
        *   Swap Blue (1) pixels to Red (2).
        *   Swap Red (2) pixels to Blue (1).
        *   Convert Azure (8) pixels to Blue (1).
        *   All other non-white pixels become white (0). (Derived from Ex 4, but known to be inconsistent with Ex 1).
    *   **Case 4b (Azure absent: {1, 2} only):**
        *   Swap Blue (1) pixels to Red (2).
        *   Swap Red (2) pixels to Blue (1).
        *   All other non-white pixels become white (0).

5.  **Default (No specific trigger matched):**
    *   The output grid is entirely white (0).

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task using a prioritized set of rules based on the unique non-white colors present in the input grid. However, the execution results show that the code fails on all training examples, indicating significant flaws in the implemented logic or the understanding of the transformation rules.

Key issues observed:

1.  **Incorrect Rule Logic:** The transformations applied within each rule (color swaps, flips, conditional conversions) do not consistently match the expected outputs across different examples.
2.  **Contradictory Rules:** The logic derived for the color set {1, 2, 8} from Example 4 seems to contradict the required transformation for the same color set in Example 1. This suggests the trigger condition is more complex than just the presence of these colors.
3.  **Spatial Transformation Errors:** Rule 1 (involving Magenta/Orange/Red/Yellow) requires a horizontal flip combined with color swaps. The implementation seems to handle this incorrectly, particularly in how the flipped elements replace original elements. Rule 2 (involving Blue/Yellow/Azure) likely involves a complex spatial rearrangement in Example 3 that is not captured by the current pixel-wise color conversion.
4.  **Handling of Extra Colors:** How colors not explicitly mentioned in a rule's core trigger (e.g., Azure in Rule 1, Red/Orange in Rule 2, Azure in Rule 3/4) are handled needs careful verification. The default assumption of mapping them to white might be incorrect or need refinement based on context.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-analyze Each Example:** Carefully compare input and output grids for each example, focusing on:
    *   Exact color mappings (input color at (r, c) -> output color at (r', c')).
    *   Spatial transformations (translation, rotation, flipping, scaling, rearrangement).
    *   Conditional logic (depending on position, neighbours, presence/count/shape of other colors).
2.  **Identify Consistent Patterns:** Look for rules that hold true across multiple examples or identify the differentiating factors that cause rules to change (e.g., grid dimensions, relative color counts, object shapes).
3.  **Address Contradictions:** The {1, 2, 8} case (Ex 1 vs Ex 4) requires finding the hidden condition that distinguishes them. Potential factors include relative counts of colors or the size/shape of contiguous color objects.
4.  **Refine Rule Priority and Logic:** Update the natural language program based on the revised understanding, ensuring the rules are distinct, correctly prioritized, and accurately described. Pay special attention to the interaction between color changes and spatial changes.
5.  **Focus on Object Properties:** Incorporate the concept of "objects" (contiguous blocks of color) where relevant, especially for the conditional logic in the {1, 2, 8} case.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather the unique non-white colors for each example's input and expected output.
