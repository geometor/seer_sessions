Grid:
  background_color: 8  # azure
Input_Features:
  - Objects:
      - type: container
        color: 3       # green
        description: Often forms boundaries or encloses other pixels.
      - type: source
        color: Non_8_Non_3 # Any color except azure(8) and green(3)
        description: Pixels whose color is projected. Found colors include 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9.
Relationships:
  - containment: Source pixels are often located spatially within container objects.
Transformation:
  - name: Projection
  - inputs: Source pixels (location and color) from the input grid.
  - action: For each source pixel, extend its color in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
  - extent: The projection stops only at the grid boundaries.
  - effect: Overwrite the color of all pixels along the projection path (including background and container pixels) with the source pixel's color.
Output_Grid:
  - composition: Starts as a copy of the input grid, then modified by the projection action. Original non-projected pixels remain unless overwritten.
