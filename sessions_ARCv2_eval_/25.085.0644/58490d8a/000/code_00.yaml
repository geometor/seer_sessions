task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - Contains multiple colors (0-9).
      - Has a predominant background color (non-white).
      - Contains at least one white (0) pixel.
      - Contains other non-background, non-white pixels, some potentially within the area defined by white pixels.
  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - Dimensions match the bounding box of white pixels in the input.
      - Background color is white (0).
      - Contains a subset of the non-background colors from the input grid.
      - The spatial arrangement of non-white pixels matches their relative arrangement within the white pixel bounding box in the input.
actions:
  - identify: The predominant background color of the input grid (most frequent color, ignoring white if it's most frequent).
  - locate: All white (0) pixels in the input grid.
  - calculate: The minimum bounding box (min/max row and column) enclosing all white pixels.
  - extract: The subgrid from the input corresponding to the calculated bounding box.
  - create: A new grid with the same dimensions as the extracted subgrid, initialized to white (0).
  - transform: Iterate through the extracted subgrid. For each pixel:
      - if the pixel's color is *not* the identified input background color:
          copy its color to the corresponding position in the new grid.
      - if the pixel's color *is* the identified input background color:
          leave the corresponding position in the new grid as white (0).
relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are determined by the spatial extent (bounding box) of the white pixels in the input.
  - The content of the output grid is derived from the content of the input grid within that bounding box.
  - The original input background color within the bounding box is mapped to white (0) in the output.
  - All other colors (including original white) within the bounding box are preserved in the output.
