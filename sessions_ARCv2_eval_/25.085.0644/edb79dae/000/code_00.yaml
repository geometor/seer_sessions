Example 1:
  Input:
    Grid Size: 23x24
    Objects:
      - Gray Frame: { Color: 5, BoundingBox: [8, 3, 22, 22], Shape: Rectangle, Size: 15x20 }
      - Inner Content: { BoundingBox: [9, 4, 21, 21], Size: 13x18, BackgroundColor: 8 (Azure) }
        - Contains Shapes: { Colors: [1 (Blue), 3 (Green)], ShapePattern: 3x3 block with center hole }
      - Outer Content: { Colors: [1, 4, 8, 3, 2], Location: Outside Frame }
  Output:
    Grid Size: 15x19
    Objects:
      - Gray Frame: { Color: 5, BoundingBox: [0, 0, 14, 18], Shape: Rectangle, Size: 15x19 }
      - Inner Content: { BoundingBox: [1, 1, 13, 17], Size: 13x17, BackgroundColor: 8 (Azure) }
        - Contains Shapes: { Colors: [4 (Yellow), 2 (Red)], ShapePattern: 3x3 block with center hole }
  Transformations:
    - Frame Extraction: Input Gray Frame identified.
    - Inner Content Extraction: Content within [9, 4, 21, 21] extracted.
    - Background Identification: Inner background detected as Azure (8).
    - Trimming: Rightmost column of inner content (all Azure) removed. Resulting size 13x17.
    - Output Resizing: Output grid created with size 13+2 x 17+2 = 15x19.
    - Framing: Output grid filled with Gray (5).
    - Color Mapping (Azure Background Rule): { 1: 4, 3: 2, 8: 8 }
    - Content Placement: Transformed trimmed inner content placed at offset (1, 1) in output.

Example 2:
  Input:
    Grid Size: 22x23
    Objects:
      - Gray Frame: { Color: 5, BoundingBox: [8, 5, 20, 22], Shape: Rectangle, Size: 13x18 }
      - Inner Content: { BoundingBox: [9, 6, 19, 21], Size: 11x16, BackgroundColor: 1 (White) }
        - Contains Shapes: { Colors: [2 (Red), 3 (Green), 6 (Magenta)], ShapePattern: 4x4 block with specific holes }
      - Outer Content: { Colors: [2, 4, 1, 3, 8, 6, 7], Location: Outside Frame }
  Output:
    Grid Size: 13x18
    Objects:
      - Gray Frame: { Color: 5, BoundingBox: [0, 0, 12, 17], Shape: Rectangle, Size: 13x18 }
      - Inner Content: { BoundingBox: [1, 1, 11, 16], Size: 11x16, BackgroundColor: 1 (White) }
        - Contains Shapes: { Colors: [4 (Yellow), 7 (Orange), 8 (Azure)], ShapePattern: 4x4 block with specific holes }
  Transformations:
    - Frame Extraction: Input Gray Frame identified.
    - Inner Content Extraction: Content within [9, 6, 19, 21] extracted.
    - Background Identification: Inner background detected as White (1).
    - Trimming: No rows/columns consist entirely of White. No trimming performed. Size remains 11x16.
    - Output Resizing: Output grid created with size 11+2 x 16+2 = 13x18.
    - Framing: Output grid filled with Gray (5).
    - Color Mapping (White Background Rule): { 2: 4, 3: 7, 6: 8, 1: 1 }
    - Content Placement: Transformed inner content placed at offset (1, 1) in output.

Derived Rules:
  - Task involves extracting content within the largest gray rectangular frame.
  - The transformation rule for colors inside the frame depends on the most frequent color (background) within that frame.
  - Before transformation, rows/columns at the edges of the inner content are removed if they entirely consist of the background color.
  - The output grid is sized to fit the potentially trimmed inner content plus a new 1-pixel gray border.
