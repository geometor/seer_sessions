```python
"""
Transforms an input grid of horizontal color stripes into a larger square output grid 
with nested frames. The size of the output grid is determined by the maximum dimension 
of the input grid (D = max(H, W) * 2 - 2). The color of each pixel in the output grid 
is determined by its minimum distance to the nearest edge, which corresponds to the 
color of the input grid's row at that distance index (specifically, the color of the 
first pixel in that row).
