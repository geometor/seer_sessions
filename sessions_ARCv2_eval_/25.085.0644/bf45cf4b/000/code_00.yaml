task_context:
  input_description: Each input grid contains a background color and at least two distinct non-background objects/patterns.
  output_description: The output grid is a tiling based on one of the patterns found in the input.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.

identified_objects:
  - name: pattern_tile
    description: A non-background object forming a solid rectangular block. This object serves as the repeating unit for the output.
    properties:
      - height (ph)
      - width (pw)
      - pixel_content (the grid of colors within the tile)
    identification_rule: Find contiguous non-background objects; select the one whose bounding box contains only non-background colors and is rectangular.

  - name: control_object
    description: The other significant non-background object in the input. Its bounding box dimensions determine the tiling factors.
    properties:
      - bounding_box_height (ch): The height of the minimum bounding box enclosing the object.
      - bounding_box_width (cw): The width of the minimum bounding box enclosing the object.
    identification_rule: The primary non-background object that is *not* the pattern_tile.

transformation:
  type: Tiling
  input_elements_used:
    - pattern_tile
    - control_object (specifically its bounding box dimensions)
  output_construction:
    - rule: Create a new grid by repeating the pattern_tile `ch` times vertically and `cw` times horizontally.
    - output_height: `ch * ph`
    - output_width: `cw * pw`

relationships:
  - The dimensions of the control_object's bounding box directly determine the number of vertical (`ch`) and horizontal (`cw`) repetitions of the pattern_tile in the output grid.
