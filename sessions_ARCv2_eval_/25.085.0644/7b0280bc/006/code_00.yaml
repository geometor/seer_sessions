task_description: |
  Transforms certain objects located 'inside' a background region based on their color, shape, and proximity to specific 'trigger' pixels located near the 'outside' boundary.

definitions:
  background_color: The color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid.
  outside_region: The set of all background_color pixels reachable from any border pixel of the grid by traversing only adjacent (4-directionally) background_color pixels.
  inside_region: All pixels that are not the background_color AND do not belong to the outside_region.
  inside_object: A contiguous group of pixels within the inside_region sharing the same color (connected 4-directionally).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the object.
      - coordinates: The set of (row, col) tuples for each pixel in the object.
      - shape: Determined by bounding box and pixel count (e.g., line/dot, 2x2 square).
  trigger_color_map:
    - background: 8 (Azure) -> trigger: 0 (White)
    - background: 9 (Maroon) -> trigger: 4 (Yellow)
    - background: 7 (Orange) -> trigger: 6 (Magenta)
  trigger_pixels: All pixels in the input grid whose color matches the trigger_color determined by the background_color.

transformation_rules:
  - when: background_color == 8 (Azure)
    trigger_color: 0 (White)
    target_objects:
      - if: object_color == 0 (White) AND shape == line/dot
        action: change object_color to 5 (Gray)
      - if: object_color == 2 (Red) AND shape == 2x2_square
        action: change object_color to 3 (Green)
  - when: background_color == 9 (Maroon)
    trigger_color: 4 (Yellow)
    target_objects:
      - if: object_color == 4 (Yellow) AND shape == line/dot
        action: change object_color to 5 (Gray)
      - if: object_color == 7 (Orange) AND shape == 2x2_square
        action: change object_color to 3 (Green)
  - when: background_color == 7 (Orange)
    trigger_color: 6 (Magenta)
    target_objects:
      - if: object_color == 6 (Magenta) AND shape == line/dot
        action: change object_color to 5 (Gray)
      - if: object_color == 1 (Blue) AND shape == 2x2_square
        action: change object_color to 3 (Green)

conditions_for_action:
  apply_action: True # Default, applies if all sub-conditions met
  condition_1_adjacency: |
    The target_object must have at least one pixel that is adjacent (8-directionally, including diagonals)
    to a trigger_pixel.
  condition_2_trigger_location: |
    At least one of the trigger_pixels identified in condition_1_adjacency must itself be adjacent
    (4-directionally, up/down/left/right) to a pixel belonging to the outside_region.

output_grid_generation:
  - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
  - Identify background_color, trigger_color, outside_region, inside_region, and inside_objects.
  - Find all trigger_pixels.
  - For each inside_object:
    - Check if it matches any target_object definition based on background_color, object_color, and shape.
    - If it matches, check condition_1_adjacency.
    - If condition_1 is met, check condition_2_trigger_location for the relevant trigger_pixels.
    - If condition_2 is also met, apply the specified color change action to all pixels of the inside_object in the output_grid.
  - Return the final output_grid.
