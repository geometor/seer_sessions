1.  Identify the horizontal blue line that separates the grid into an upper and lower section.
2.  Copy the input grid to create the output grid. The upper section and the blue line itself will remain unchanged.
3.  Identify all distinct, connected, non-white objects in the upper section (above the blue line). For each object, record its color, its shape (relative coordinates of its pixels from its top-left corner), its absolute pixel coordinates, and the coordinates of its top-left corner. These are the 'key' objects.
4.  Identify all distinct, connected, gray objects in the lower section (below the blue line). For each object, record its absolute pixel coordinates and the coordinates of its top-left corner. These are the 'target' objects.
5.  For each target object:
    a.  Calculate the minimum Euclidean distance from any pixel of the target object to any pixel of *every* key object identified in step 3.
    b.  Select the key object that has the overall minimum distance to the target object.
    c.  If two or more key objects are equidistant (have the same minimum distance), select the key object whose top-left corner has the smallest row index. If there is still a tie, select the one among the tied objects whose top-left corner has the smallest column index.
    d.  In the output grid, set all pixels originally belonging to the current target object to white (0).
    e.  Using the top-left corner of the *original* target object as an anchor point, draw the shape of the selected key object (from step 5c) onto the output grid using the selected key object's color. Ensure drawing stays within grid bounds.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
