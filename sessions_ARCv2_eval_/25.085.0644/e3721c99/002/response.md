assessment:
  The provided Python code failed during execution due to an external dependency error (`No module named 'scipy'`). This prevents direct validation of the code's output against the expected outputs.
  However, the code includes a detailed docstring and comments describing the intended transformation logic.
  The strategy will be to:
  1. Assume the `scipy` dependency issue can be resolved in the coding phase.
  2. Analyze the provided training examples (input/output pairs) directly.
  3. Compare the observed transformations in the examples with the logic described in the Python code's docstring.
  4. Gather metrics and structural information from the examples using `tool_code`.
  5. Refine the natural language program based on the combined understanding from the examples and the code's intended logic.

metrics:
  Executing code to analyze the examples provided in the task description (assuming access to the `task` object).

**Correction**: The `get_objects_from_grid` helper function used in the metrics calculation did not correctly handle connectivity and assigned colors incorrectly in some cases (e.g., if multiple colors were involved, only the starting pixel's color was used, and connectivity didn't check color matching). This led to inaccurate shape/color matching in the `code_output`. However, the core structure (separator, key objects above, target objects below) remains consistent. The logic described in the Python code's docstring (using `scipy.ndimage.label`) is more robust for object identification. The analysis below relies on visual inspection of the examples and the intended logic from the Python code, rather than the potentially flawed `code_output` metrics.


```yaml
facts:
  - grid:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.
      - Grids are separated into an upper and lower section by a solid horizontal blue line (color 1).
  - objects_above_separator:
      - Located in the input grid, strictly above the blue line.
      - Are contiguous shapes of a single, non-white color (colors 2-9).
      - These act as 'key' shapes or templates.
      - Properties: color, shape (relative pixel coordinates), position (bounding box, top-left corner).
  - objects_below_separator:
      - Located in the input grid, strictly below the blue line.
      - Are contiguous shapes made exclusively of gray pixels (color 5).
      - These act as 'target' locations.
      - Properties: shape, position (bounding box, top-left corner).
  - transformation:
      - The upper section of the grid (including the blue line) remains unchanged in the output.
      - The lower section of the grid is modified.
      - Each gray 'target' object in the input is removed (pixels set to white/0).
      - For each removed target object, a 'key' object's shape is drawn in the output.
  - replacement_rule:
      - Selection: The specific 'key' object used for replacement is determined by proximity. Calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between any pixel of the target object and any pixel of each key object. The key object with the smallest minimum distance is chosen.
      - Tie-breaking: If multiple key objects have the same minimum distance, the one with the top-most (smallest row index) top-left corner is chosen. If there's still a tie, the one with the left-most (smallest column index) top-left corner among those is chosen.
      - Placement: The chosen key object's shape is drawn using the key object's original color.
      - Anchor: The shape is drawn relative to an anchor point. This anchor point is the top-left corner of the bounding box of the original gray target object.
```



```natural_language_program
1.  Identify the horizontal blue line that separates the grid into an upper and lower section.
2.  Copy the input grid to create the output grid. The upper section and the blue line itself will remain unchanged.
3.  Identify all distinct, connected, non-white objects in the upper section (above the blue line). For each object, record its color, its shape (relative coordinates of its pixels from its top-left corner), its absolute pixel coordinates, and the coordinates of its top-left corner. These are the 'key' objects.
4.  Identify all distinct, connected, gray objects in the lower section (below the blue line). For each object, record its absolute pixel coordinates and the coordinates of its top-left corner. These are the 'target' objects.
5.  For each target object:
    a.  Calculate the minimum Euclidean distance from any pixel of the target object to any pixel of *every* key object identified in step 3.
    b.  Select the key object that has the overall minimum distance to the target object.
    c.  If two or more key objects are equidistant (have the same minimum distance), select the key object whose top-left corner has the smallest row index. If there is still a tie, select the one among the tied objects whose top-left corner has the smallest column index.
    d.  In the output grid, set all pixels originally belonging to the current target object to white (0).
    e.  Using the top-left corner of the *original* target object as an anchor point, draw the shape of the selected key object (from step 5c) onto the output grid using the selected key object's color. Ensure drawing stays within grid bounds.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
