task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: The background color is consistently white (0) in both input and output.
    - primary_color: The active color is azure (8).
  objects:
    - object_type: pixel_cluster
      color: azure (8)
      location: Sparse locations in the input grid.
      role: Act as sources or seeds for generating output patterns.
    - object_type: pixel_lines
      color: azure (8)
      location: Horizontal and vertical lines in the output grid.
      role: Represent the transformed output pattern.
  relationships:
    - type: generation
      description: Output azure pixels are generated based on input azure pixel locations.
    - type: extension
      direction: Cardinal (up, down, left, right)
      origin: Each azure pixel in the input grid.
      termination:
        - Grid boundary.
        - Alignment (same row or column) with another azure pixel from the input grid.
  actions:
    - action: identify_sources
      input: Input grid
      output: Set of coordinates of all azure (8) pixels.
    - action: project_rays
      input: Source coordinates, grid dimensions, set of all source coordinates.
      output: Sets of coordinates covered by rays in each cardinal direction.
      details: For each source, trace rays up, down, left, and right. Stop a ray if it hits the grid boundary or reaches a coordinate occupied by *another* source pixel.
    - action: populate_output
      input: Grid dimensions, source coordinates, projected ray coordinates.
      output: Output grid.
      details: Create a white grid of the correct dimensions. Fill in azure (8) at all source coordinates and all coordinates covered by the projected rays.
