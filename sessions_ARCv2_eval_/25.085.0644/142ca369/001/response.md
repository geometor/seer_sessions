def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by extending diagonal lines (down and to the right)
    from each non-white pixel.

    1. Creates an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterates through each cell (row, col) of the input grid.
    3. If a cell contains a non-white color C:
        a. Starts tracing a path diagonally down-right from (row + 1, col + 1).
        b. For each step (r, c) along the path:
            i. Checks if (r, c) is within grid bounds.
            ii. Checks if the cell (r, c) in the *output* grid is currently white (0).
            iii. If within bounds and the target cell is white, colors it with C and continues to the next diagonal step (r+1, c+1).
            iv. If out of bounds or the target cell is not white, stops tracing for the current originating pixel.
    4. Returns the modified output grid.
