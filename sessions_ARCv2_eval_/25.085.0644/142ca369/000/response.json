            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) sparsely populated with small objects or individual pixels of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange). These colored pixels appear randomly placed.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain all the original colored pixels from the input grids in their original positions. Additionally, new pixels appear, forming diagonal lines extending from the original colored pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Each non-white pixel in the input grid seems to \"cast\" a diagonal line downwards and to the right. This line has the same color as the pixel it originates from.\n4.  **Line Termination:** The diagonal lines continue until they either hit the bottom or right edge of the grid, or until they encounter another non-white pixel (either an original pixel or a pixel generated by another line). The line stops *just before* the obstructing pixel or the edge. The obstructing pixel is not overwritten.\n5.  **Interaction:** When lines from different source pixels would potentially intersect or overlap, the pixel that gets \"drawn\" first along its path seems to block the subsequent line(s). The order of processing might matter, but given the down-right direction, processing row by row, column by column seems consistent with the examples. Any pixel location `(r, c)` can only be occupied by the line originating from the \"highest and leftmost\" pixel `(r0, c0)` such that `r - r0 == c - c0` and the path from `(r0, c0)` to `(r, c)` is clear.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
