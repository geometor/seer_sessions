Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) sparsely populated with small objects or individual pixels of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange). These colored pixels appear randomly placed.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain all the original colored pixels from the input grids in their original positions. Additionally, new pixels appear, forming diagonal lines extending from the original colored pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Each non-white pixel in the input grid seems to "cast" a diagonal line downwards and to the right. This line has the same color as the pixel it originates from.
4.  **Line Termination:** The diagonal lines continue until they either hit the bottom or right edge of the grid, or until they encounter another non-white pixel (either an original pixel or a pixel generated by another line). The line stops *just before* the obstructing pixel or the edge. The obstructing pixel is not overwritten.
5.  **Interaction:** When lines from different source pixels would potentially intersect or overlap, the pixel that gets "drawn" first along its path seems to block the subsequent line(s). The order of processing might matter, but given the down-right direction, processing row by row, column by column seems consistent with the examples. Any pixel location `(r, c)` can only be occupied by the line originating from the "highest and leftmost" pixel `(r0, c0)` such that `r - r0 == c - c0` and the path from `(r0, c0)` to `(r, c)` is clear.

**Facts:**


```yaml
identity:
  - The background color is white (0).
  - All non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved in the output grid at their original locations.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (non-white values 1-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color (same as originating pixel)
      - direction (diagonal, down and right)
      - origin (position of a non-white input pixel)
      - termination_condition (grid boundary or existing non-white pixel)
actions:
  - Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - For each non-white pixel:
    - Trace a path diagonally down-right (increment row and column by 1).
    - For each step along the path:
      - Check if the target position is within grid bounds.
      - Check if the target position in the output grid is currently white (0).
      - If within bounds and target is white, color the target position with the originating pixel's color.
      - If out of bounds or target is non-white, stop tracing for the current originating pixel.
relationships:
  - Each non-white pixel in the input serves as an origin for a potential diagonal line in the output.
  - The color of the line matches the color of its origin pixel.
  - Lines are blocked by grid boundaries and any pre-existing non-white pixels in the output grid (including pixels from previously drawn lines or original input pixels).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid initially as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid, for example, row by row from top to bottom, and within each row, column by column from left to right.
3.  If the cell `(row, col)` contains a non-white color `C`:
    a.  Initialize the current tracing position `(r, c)` to `(row + 1, col + 1)`.
    b.  Start a loop that continues as long as the position `(r, c)` is within the bounds of the grid:
        i.   Check the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid.
        ii.  If the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid is white (0):
            1.  Set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to `C`.
            2.  Move to the next diagonal position: increment `r` by 1 and `c` by 1.
        iii. If the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid is *not* white:
            1.  Stop tracing the line originating from `(row, col)`. Break out of the inner loop (step 3b).
    c.  If the loop terminates because `(r, c)` went out of bounds, the line tracing for `(row, col)` is complete.
4.  After iterating through all cells of the input grid, the output grid contains the final transformed image. Return the output grid.
