The output corresponds to the content *including* the green(3) frame.\n    *   In `train_2`, there's a blue(1) frame and a green(3) frame. The output corresponds to the content *including* the green(3) frame.\n    *   The content inside the frames differs between the examples and often includes smaller patterns or objects.\n    *   The task appears to be about locating and extracting a specific framed region from the input grid. The identifying characteristic of the target region seems to be the color of its frame, which is consistently green(3) in the provided examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
