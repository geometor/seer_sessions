observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation # or pattern_generation
  - input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
      - separators:
          - type: lines (rows or columns)
          - color: blue (1)
          - function: partitioning the grid
          - orientation: horizontal (e.g., example 1) or vertical (e.g., examples 2, 3, 4) - consistent within an example
      - sections:
          - definition: contiguous regions separated by blue lines/columns
          - content: typically contain a single dominant color (not white 0, not blue 1) plus background white (0)
          - dominant_color: the unique non-0, non-1 color within a section
  - output_features:
      - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
      - size: smaller than input grid; dimensions vary per example
      - content: composed solely of two colors derived from the input
  - transformation_steps:
      - step_1: Identify separator orientation (horizontal blue rows or vertical blue columns).
      - step_2: Segment the input grid into sections based on the separators.
      - step_3: Determine the dominant color for each section (ignoring white 0 and blue 1).
      - step_4: Select the dominant colors of the second-to-last section (C1) and the last section (C2).
      - step_5: Construct the output grid using a specific pattern filled with C1 and C2.
  - relationships:
      - output_colors: The two colors present in the output are the dominant colors of the last two sections identified in the input.
      - output_pattern: The spatial arrangement of C1 and C2 in the output grid appears to be a fixed template specific to each example, rather than algorithmically generated from input features in an obvious general way.
