Scan the input grid to locate all rectangular blocks composed of a single, non-background color (solid blocks).\n    3.  For each solid block found, check if it is completely enclosed by a one-pixel thick border consisting solely of the background color. Consider adjacent pixels (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) just outside the block's perimeter.\n    4.  Select only those solid blocks that meet the bordering criteria.

Determine the minimum bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that encompasses all the selected blocks and their borders.\n    6.  Calculate the height and width of the output grid based on this bounding box.\n    7.  Create a new grid of the calculated dimensions, initially filled with the background color.\n    8.
