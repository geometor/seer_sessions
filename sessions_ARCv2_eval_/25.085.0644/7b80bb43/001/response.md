    Transforms the input grid by filling horizontal gaps of background color 
    between two pixels of the same foreground color, provided there is at 
    least one foreground pixel directly above or below the gap.

    1. Determine the background color (B) as the most frequent color.
    2. Create a copy of the input grid.
    3. Iterate through each row R.
    4. For each pixel (R, C1) with a non-background color (C):
       a. Search rightwards in the same row for the next pixel (R, C2) with color C.
       b. If found, check if all pixels between C1+1 and C2-1 are background color B.
       c. If they are background color B (forming a gap), check if any pixel 
          immediately above or below this gap (from (R-1, C1+1) to (R-1, C2-1) or 
          from (R+1, C1+1) to (R+1, C2-1)) has the foreground color C.
       d. If such an adjacent foreground pixel exists, fill the gap in the output grid 
          by changing pixels from (R, C1+1) to (R, C2-1) to color C.
    5. Return the modified grid.
