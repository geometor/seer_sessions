task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with a uniquely occurring color.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (height x width, between 1x1 and 30x30)
      - pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - type: color
    properties:
      - value: integer 0-9
      - role: background (white: 0), boundary (non-white), fill (unique color), target (white: 0)
  - type: region
    properties:
      - contiguity: pixels of the same color connected orthogonally or diagonally (based on observation, boundaries seem solid regardless of diagonal connection)
      - type: enclosed_white_region
        description: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels that cannot reach the grid border without crossing a non-white pixel.
      - type: boundary
        description: A contiguous structure of non-white pixels surrounding an enclosed region.
  - type: unique_color_pixel
    properties:
      - color: The color that appears exactly once in the input grid.
      - role: Determines the fill color for enclosed regions.

transformation:
  - action: identify_fill_color
    input: input_grid
    output: fill_color
    description: Scan the grid and count occurrences of each non-white color. The color appearing exactly once is the 'fill_color'.
  - action: identify_enclosed_regions
    input: input_grid
    output: set_of_enclosed_white_pixel_coordinates
    description: Find all white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by non-white pixels (cannot reach the grid boundary via a path of only white pixels using orthogonal steps).
  - action: apply_fill
    input: input_grid, fill_color, set_of_enclosed_white_pixel_coordinates
    output: output_grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. Change the color of pixels at the 'set_of_enclosed_white_pixel_coordinates' to the 'fill_color'.

relationship:
  - The fill color used in the output is determined by the color that uniquely appears once in the input.
  - The locations filled are white pixels strictly inside boundaries formed by non-white pixels.
