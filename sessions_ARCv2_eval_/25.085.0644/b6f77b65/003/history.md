Transform the input grid based on the color C of the pixel at (0,0).

**CRITICAL Realization:** The code execution output reveals the flaw! My manual object identification was wrong. `find_objects` is finding only *one* large connected object in each of Examples 2-5 (because they are connected through adjacent non-white pixels, which I missed). Since this single object inevitably contains the indicator color (which exists *somewhere* in the grid other than (0,0)), the condition `if not obj['has_indicator_color']` is *always* false for this single object. Therefore, *no* pixels (except the indicator at (0,0)) are copied to the output grid, resulting in the mostly empty `Transformed Output`.

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate the rule:** The rule cannot be "remove objects containing the indicator color". The expected outputs show shifting happens even when the indicator color is present elsewhere.
2.  **Focus on the shift:** The shift amount calculation seems correct and consistent.
    *   Maroon (9) -> Shift 0
    *   Magenta (6) -> Shift 2
    *   Others (e.g., Yellow 4, Orange 7) -> Shift 3
3.  **Focus on what is *not* shifted:** In the examples where shifting occurs (2-5), compare the input and expected output carefully. What pixels *don't* make it to the output (aside from those shifted off the bottom)?
    *   **Ex 2 (Indicator 4, Shift 3):**
        *   Input Yellow line `(6,3),(6,4),(6,5)` is gone.
        *   Input Yellow line `(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)` is gone.
        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.
    *   **Ex 3 (Indicator 6, Shift 2):**
        *   Input Magenta line `(9,1),(10,1),(11,1)` is gone.
        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 2.
    *   **Ex 4 (Indicator 4, Shift 3):**
        *   Input Yellow line `(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(11,1)` is gone.
        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.
    *   **Ex 5 (Indicator 7, Shift 3):**
        *   Input Gray/Orange `U` shape (containing 7) is gone. Note: pixels are (6,7),(7,7),(8,7), (6,9),(7,9),(8,9), (6,8). All contain 7 or are part of object containing 7. Wait, no. (6,8) is gray(5). (6,9) is gray(5). (7,9) is gray(5). Okay, my mental check was wrong, let's use the actual coords.
            *   Object 4 (my old numbering): Pixels `(6,7)`(O), `(7,7)`(O), `(8,7)`(O), `(6,8)`(G), `(6,9)`(G), `(7,9)`(G), `(8,9)`(G). Colors {Orange(7), Gray(5)}. Contains Orange(7). This whole object seems gone.
        *   Input Orange line `(8,10),(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)` is gone.
        *   All other non-white pixels seem to be shifted down by 3.

4.  **Refined Hypothesis:** Identify all distinct connected non-white objects (ignoring the pixel at (0,0)). For *each pixel* in the input grid (excluding (0,0)), determine the object it belongs to. If that object contains the indicator color `C`, *do not* copy this pixel to the output. If the object does *not* contain the indicator color `C`, copy the pixel to the output grid, shifted down by `S` rows (if it remains within bounds).

This matches the original code's *intent* but clarifies why it failed: the implementation incorrectly grouped pixels. The `find_objects` implementation is correct for finding connected components, but the interpretation of "object" might need refinement, or perhaps the filtering step needs to happen differently.

Wait, let's re-read the code output for `find_objects`. It found *one* object for each grid (Ex 2-5). This means all non-white pixels (except (0,0)) are connected in those examples. If that's true, and the indicator color `C` is present *anywhere* in that single large object, then the rule "remove objects containing C" would indeed remove *everything*. This matches the code's output but *not* the expected output.

**Possible Scenarios:**

1.  **Connectivity Definition:** Is connectivity 4-directional or 8-directional? The code uses 4-directional. Does the problem imply 8-directional? Let's check Ex 2 again. Are all non-white pixels connected via 4-way adjacency?
    *   Pixel (2,5) (Blue) connects to (2,6) (Gray).
    *   (2,6) connects to (2,7) (Gray) -> (2,8) (Gray) -> (2,9) (Azure).
    *   (2,9) connects to (3,9) (Azure) -> (4,9) (Azure) -> (5,9) (Azure).
    *   ... This seems very likely that they are all connected with 4-way adjacency.
2.  **The "Object" concept:** Maybe an "object" isn't just a connected component of *any* non-white color. Maybe it's a connected component of the *same* color? Let's re-read the priors: "An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color." This contradicts the BFS implementation which groups *any* adjacent non-white pixels.

**Revised Hypothesis 2:**

1.  Determine indicator color `C` and shift `S` as before.
2.  If `S == 0`, return copy.
3.  If `S > 0`:
    *   Find all distinct connected objects composed of pixels of the *same* color (ignoring the pixel at (0,0) and white pixels).
    *   For each such monochromatic object:
        *   If the object's color is equal to the indicator color `C`, *remove* this object (do not copy its pixels).
        *   If the object's color is *not* equal to the indicator color `C`, shift all pixels of this object down by `S` rows, copying them to the output grid (within bounds).
    *   Copy the indicator pixel `C` to `(0,0)` in the output.

Let's test this hypothesis on Example 2 (Indicator 4 - Yellow, Shift 3):
*   Monochromatic objects (ignoring (0,0)):
    *   Blue 'L' shape (color 2) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Gray block (color 5) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Azure 'L' shape (color 8) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Maroon line (color 9) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Yellow line (color 4) at row 6 -> Color matches indicator -> Remove
    *   Orange line (color 7) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Red pixels (color 2) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Green pixels (color 3) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Magenta line (color 6) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Gray block (color 5) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Blue line (color 1) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Orange block (color 7) -> Keep & Shift
    *   Yellow line (color 4) at rows 9-11 -> Color matches indicator -> Remove
*   Result: Shift all objects except the two Yellow ones. This matches the expected output for Example 2.

Let's test on Example 3 (Indicator 6 - Magenta, Shift 2):
*   Monochromatic objects: Same as above.
*   Indicator is Magenta (6).
*   Remove the Magenta line (color 6). Shift all others. This matches the expected output for Example 3.

Let's test on Example 4 (Indicator 4 - Yellow, Shift 3):
*   Monochromatic objects (different grid now):
    *   Gray/Blue 'U' shape (Is this monochromatic? No. It contains 5 and 1). Let's re-run the "find monochromatic objects" idea.
        *   Find connected pixels of color 5. Find connected pixels of color 1. etc.
    *   Grid:
        
```
        4 ........
        ..........
        ....51111...
        ....5...1...
        ....5...1...
        ..6333.557..
        ..6..3.5.7..

        .4222222227.
        .4........7.
        .4........7.
        .4........7.
        ```

    *   Color 5 objects: {(2,4),(3,4),(4,4)}, {(5,7),(6,7),(7,7)}, {(5,8)}
    *   Color 1 objects: {(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(4,8)}
    *   Color 6 objects: {(5,2),(6,2),(7,2)}
    *   Color 3 objects: {(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(6,5),(7,5)}
    *   Color 7 objects: {(5,9),(6,9),(7,9)}, {(8,10),(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)}
    *   Color 4 objects: {(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(11,1)} -> Matches indicator -> Remove
    *   Color 2 objects: {(8,2),(8,3),...,(8,9)}
*   Result: Remove the Yellow object (color 4). Shift all others down by 3. This matches the expected output for Example 4.

Let's test on Example 5 (Indicator 7 - Orange, Shift 3):
*   Same monochromatic objects as Example 4.
*   Indicator is Orange (7).
*   Remove the Orange objects: {(5,9),(6,9),(7,9)} and {(8,10),(9,10),(10,10),(11,10)}.
*   Shift all others down by 3. This matches the expected output for Example 5.

**Conclusion:** The revised hypothesis (finding monochromatic objects and removing those whose color matches the indicator) works for all examples. The previous code failed because its `find_objects` grouped connected pixels of *different* colors, violating the "object = same color" prior and leading to incorrect filtering.

**Metrics Gathering (Based on Revised Hypothesis):**

## General Assessment

The previous code failed on examples 2 through 5 because it incorrectly identified objects. It used a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find connected components of *any* non-white color. However, the analysis of failed examples, combined with the ARC prior knowledge ("An object can be considered a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color"), strongly suggests that objects should be defined as connected components of pixels of the *same* color (monochromatic objects).

The previous code found only one large connected object in examples 2-5. Since the indicator color was present somewhere within this large object, the filtering rule (`if not obj['has_indicator_color']`) caused the entire object (effectively all non-white pixels except the indicator at (0,0)) to be discarded, leading to empty outputs.

The new strategy is to redefine object detection to find monochromatic objects. The transformation rule then becomes: identify the indicator color C and corresponding shift S. Find all monochromatic objects (ignoring (0,0)). Remove objects whose color is C. Shift all remaining objects down by S.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered using the `find_mono_objects` function based on the revised understanding:

Observations from metrics:
*   The number of monochromatic objects found aligns with the visual inspection and the logic required to produce the expected outputs.
*   The number and total pixels of objects removed matches the pixels that disappear in the expected outputs for examples 2-5.
*   The number and total pixels of objects kept corresponds to the pixels that are shifted in the expected outputs.
*   Example 1 (shift 0) correctly shows 0 objects removed.

## Facts


```yaml
perception:
  input_grid_properties:
    - The grid has a height and width, up to 30x30.
    - Pixel values range from 0 (white) to 9.
    - The pixel at coordinate (0, 0) serves as an indicator.
  objects:
    - Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, connected via 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
    - White pixels (color 0) are considered background and do not form objects.
    - The indicator pixel at (0, 0) is treated specially and is not part of any other object identification process.
  relationships:
    - The color of the indicator pixel at (0, 0), let's call it C, determines a downward shift amount, S.
    - Other monochromatic objects in the grid may or may not have the same color C.
transformation:
  actions:
    - Determine the shift amount S based on the indicator color C:
      - If C is Maroon (9), S = 0.
      - If C is Magenta (6), S = 2.
      - For any other color C, S = 3.
    - If S = 0, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
    - If S > 0:
      - Create a new output grid of the same size, filled with white (0).
      - Copy the indicator pixel C from input (0, 0) to output (0, 0).
      - Identify all monochromatic objects in the input grid (excluding the pixel at (0, 0)).
      - For each identified monochromatic object:
        - If the object's color is equal to C, discard the object (do not transfer its pixels).
        - If the object's color is not equal to C, transfer all its pixels to the output grid, shifting each pixel's row coordinate down by S. Pixels shifted beyond the grid's bottom boundary are discarded.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the color `C` of the pixel at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` of the input grid.
2.  Determine a downward shift amount `S` based on the color `C`:
    *   If `C` is Maroon (9), set `S` to 0.
    *   If `C` is Magenta (6), set `S` to 2.
    *   Otherwise (for any other color `C`), set `S` to 3.
3.  If the shift amount `S` is 0, the transformation is complete, and the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
4.  If the shift amount `S` is greater than 0, perform the following steps:
    a. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    b. Copy the indicator color `C` from the input grid's `(0, 0)` position to the output grid's `(0, 0)` position.
    c. Identify all distinct monochromatic objects in the input grid. A monochromatic object is a group of one or more connected pixels (using 4-way adjacency) that all share the same non-white color. Do not include the pixel at `(0, 0)` when identifying these objects.
    d. For each identified monochromatic object:
        i. Check if the color of the object is the same as the indicator color `C`.
        ii. If the object's color is *not* equal to `C`, then for each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to this object, calculate its new position `(r_new, c_new) = (r + S, c)`. If `r_new` is less than the grid height, set the pixel at `(r_new, c_new)` in the output grid to the object's color.
        iii. If the object's color *is* equal to `C`, do nothing with this object (effectively removing it).
    e. The resulting output grid is the final result of the transformation.
