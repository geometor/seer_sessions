This appears to function as the background color.\n3.  **Foreground Elements:** The input grids contain various distinct clusters or shapes made of different colors (Orange 7, Red 2, White 0, Yellow 4 in Example 1; Yellow 4, Green 3, Maroon 9 in Example 2). These shapes are scattered across the grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grids simplify the input significantly. Most of the distinct input shapes disappear. A single composite shape often remains, or the grid becomes mostly background.\n5.  **Color Interaction:**\n    *   In Example 1, the output retains Orange (7), Red (2), and White (0) pixels from the input, seemingly combined into a single spatial arrangement reflecting their original positions. The Yellow (4) pixels are completely removed and replaced by the Azure (8) background.\n    *   In Example 2, the output retains Green (3) and Maroon (9) pixels, again combined based on their input positions. The Yellow (4) pixels are again removed and replaced by the Azure (8) background.\n6.  **Key Observation:** It appears that pixels of a specific color, Yellow (4), are systematically removed or ignored. All other non-background colors present in the input are preserved in their original locations, effectively creating a union of these preserved color pixels on the background.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color, which is Azure (8).\n2.

Check if the input pixel's color is *neither* the background color (Azure 8) *nor* the specific color to be discarded (Yellow 4).\n5.  If the color meets this condition (i.e., it's any other color), update the pixel at the corresponding (row, column) coordinates in the output grid with this color.\n6.  If the color does *not* meet the condition (i.e., it is Azure 8 or Yellow 4), leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid as the background color (Azure 8).\n7.  After checking all input pixels, the resulting output grid is the final transformation."
