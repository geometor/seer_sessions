Okay, let's analyze the situation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Syntax Error**: The primary issue reported is a Python `SyntaxError: '{' was never closed (<unknown>, line 311)`. This means the code could not be parsed or executed, so we haven't yet tested the underlying logic against the examples. The error message indicates an unclosed dictionary literal (`{...`) somewhere in the code. Although the error is reported at line 311, the actual mistake might be earlier, as the parser sometimes only detects the imbalance later on.
2.  **Likely Location**: Based on a review of the code, a potential candidate for the unclosed brace is the `region_map` dictionary literal within the `pair_frames_contents` function (around lines 210-215 in the provided snippet).
    ```
python
    # Define the mapping based on example 2: Content Region -> Frame Region
    region_map = {
        "TR": "TL", # Content in TR maps to Frame in TL
        "BR": "TR", # Content in BR maps to Frame in TR
        "BL": "ML", # Content in BL maps to Frame in ML (Need to adjust region definition if ML needed)
        "MR": "MR"  # Content in MR maps to Frame in MR (Need to adjust region definition if MR needed)
    # <<< Missing '}' here
    } # <<< Add this closing brace
