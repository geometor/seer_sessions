constants:
  background_color: 4 # Yellow
  line_color: 1       # Blue

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background: Predominantly filled with background_color.

structural_elements:
  - name: horizontal_divider
    type: line
    color: line_color
    orientation: horizontal
    count: 1
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - name: vertical_divider
    type: line
    color: line_color
    orientation: vertical
    count: 1
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
  - name: intersection_point
    type: point
    location: Intersection of horizontal_divider and vertical_divider.
  - name: quadrants
    type: regions
    count: 4
    definition: Areas defined by the horizontal_divider and vertical_divider.
    names: [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]

objects:
  - name: source_pattern
    location: top_left quadrant (relative to intersection_point)
    definition: Contiguous or grouped pixels excluding background_color and line_color within the top_left quadrant.
    persistence: Unchanged in the output grid's top_left quadrant.
  - name: target_patterns
    location: top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right quadrants
    definition: Pixels excluding background_color and line_color within these quadrants in the input.
    persistence: Replaced in the output grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_dividers
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [horizontal_divider, vertical_divider, intersection_point]
  - name: identify_source_pattern
    inputs: [input_grid, top_left_quadrant_bounds]
    outputs: [source_pattern]
  - name: clear_target_quadrants
    inputs: [output_grid_copy, top_right_bounds, bottom_left_bounds, bottom_right_bounds]
    action: Set pixels (excluding dividers) within these bounds to background_color.
  - name: reflect_and_copy
    inputs: [source_pattern, intersection_point]
    outputs: [reflected_patterns]
    sub_actions:
      - reflect_horizontal: Reflect source_pattern across vertical_divider's column.
      - reflect_vertical: Reflect source_pattern across horizontal_divider's row.
      - reflect_both: Reflect source_pattern across both dividers (180 rotation).
    placement:
      - horizontal_reflection -> top_right quadrant
      - vertical_reflection -> bottom_left quadrant
      - both_reflection -> bottom_right quadrant

relationships:
  - The dividers define the quadrants.
  - The source_pattern is located relative to the intersection_point.
  - The output patterns in the target quadrants are reflections of the source_pattern relative to the dividers/intersection_point.
