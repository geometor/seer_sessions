Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the general structure of the transformation: identify background and foreground colors, find foreground objects, select one object, create a new grid based on the selected object's bounding box, add a border using the foreground color, and place the object inside.

However, the crucial step – **selecting the correct foreground object** – was flawed. The rule "prefer largest non-border object, else largest overall object" failed in all examples. The transformed outputs consistently selected the wrong object, leading to incorrect output grids.

The strategy is to re-examine the relationship between the input grids and the expected output grids, specifically focusing on the characteristics of the *correctly* selected object in each example. We need a new hypothesis for the selection criteria. A potential hypothesis is that the target object is the one whose minimal bounding box contains the largest number of background-colored pixels. We will use code execution to gather metrics and test this hypothesis.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's gather metrics for each example to understand the properties of the foreground objects and the correct target object.
