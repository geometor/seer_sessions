            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the general structure of the transformation: identify background and foreground colors, find foreground objects, select one object, create a new grid based on the selected object's bounding box, add a border using the foreground color, and place the object inside.\n\nHowever, the crucial step \u2013 **selecting the correct foreground object** \u2013 was flawed. The rule \"prefer largest non-border object, else largest overall object\" failed in all examples. The transformed outputs consistently selected the wrong object, leading to incorrect output grids.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the relationship between the input grids and the expected output grids, specifically focusing on the characteristics of the *correctly* selected object in each example. We need a new hypothesis for the selection criteria. A potential hypothesis is that the target object is the one whose minimal bounding box contains the largest number of background-colored pixels. We will use code execution to gather metrics and test this hypothesis.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example to understand the properties of the foreground objects and the correct target object.\n\n"
