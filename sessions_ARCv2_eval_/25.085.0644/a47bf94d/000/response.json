            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids contain various shapes and patterns composed of different colored pixels against a white background. Some recurring shapes are solid 3x3 squares of a single color (e.g., green, red, blue, yellow, magenta). Other shapes are more complex or irregular (e.g., azure 'L' shapes, gray/maroon patterns).\n\nComparing the input and output grids, the key transformation appears to be applied selectively to the solid 3x3 squares. Specifically, the central pixel of each identified 3x3 solid square is changed to white (0) in the output grid, effectively creating a hollow square or frame. All other pixels and shapes in the grid remain unchanged in their color and position. The transformation is applied consistently across all examples, regardless of the color of the 3x3 square or its proximity to other shapes.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
