task_context:
  grid_size: constant (30x30 in examples)
  background_color: dominant color, unchanged between input and output
  object_types:
    - shape: plus_sign
      size: 3x3 (center + 4 orthogonal neighbors)
      location: various positions within the grid
      colors: multiple (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 observed)
    - shape: horizontal_line
      size: 1x5
      location: restricted to the bottom-most row (row_index = height - 1)
      colors: multiple (2, 3 observed)
transformation_rules:
  - condition: object is horizontal_line at bottom row
    action: replace object pixels with background_color
  - condition: object is plus_sign
    action: apply color mapping
      map:
        9: 5  # Maroon -> Gray
        6: 5  # Magenta -> Gray
        3: 5  # Green -> Gray
      default: keep original color (for 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8)
  - condition: pixel is background
    action: keep original color
