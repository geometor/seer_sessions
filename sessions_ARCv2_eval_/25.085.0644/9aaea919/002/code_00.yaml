task_description: Process grid objects based on shape, color, and location.
grid_properties:
  background_color: Typically White(0), determined as the most frequent color in the input grid.
  objects: Contiguous areas of non-background color. Assumed 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).

object_types:
  - type: bottom_line
    description: A horizontal line object located entirely within the bottom row of the grid.
    properties:
      height: 1
      width: 5
      pixel_count: 5
      location: min_row == max_row == grid_height - 1
    action:
      condition: Object matches 'bottom_line' description.
      effect: Change all pixels of the object to the background color.
      color_independent: Yes (applies regardless of the line's original color).

  - type: plus_sign
    description: An object shaped like a plus sign within a 3x3 bounding box.
    properties:
      height: 3 (bounding box)
      width: 3 (bounding box)
      pixel_count: 5
      shape_check: Central pixel exists, plus 4 orthogonal neighbors, all within the object.
    action:
      condition: Object matches 'plus_sign' description AND its original color is Maroon(9), Magenta(6), or Green(3).
      effect: Change all 5 pixels of the object to Gray(5).
      color_dependent: Yes (only specific colors trigger the change).
      no_change_colors: Blue(1), Red(2), Orange(7) (and presumably others like Yellow(4), Azure(8) if they formed a plus sign).

  - type: other
    description: Any object not matching 'bottom_line' or 'plus_sign' descriptions.
    action:
      condition: Object does not match other defined types.
      effect: No change. Pixels remain their original color.

execution_notes:
  - The initial code failed due to a missing `scipy` dependency required for `label` and `find_objects`.
  - Object identification (finding contiguous components) is a necessary step. If `scipy` is unavailable, an alternative implementation (e.g., BFS/DFS based connected components) is required.
  - Input grids must be rectangular. The analysis assumed padding if rows had different lengths in the raw data.
