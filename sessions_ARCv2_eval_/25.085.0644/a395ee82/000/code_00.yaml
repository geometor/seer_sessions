task_elements:
  - item: Grids
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - size: variable (up to 30x30)
      - background_color: dominant color, persists in output
  - item: Pattern Object
    properties:
      - type: connected group of pixels
      - color: specific color, differs from background and marker
      - identification: typically the largest connected non-background object
      - role: template shape to be copied
  - item: Marker Pixels
    properties:
      - type: small group(s) or single pixels
      - color: specific color, differs from background and pattern
      - identification: typically the color of the smallest non-background object(s)
      - role: target locations for copying the pattern
  - item: Other Pixels
    properties:
      - type: isolated pixels or small groups
      - color: potentially same as pattern or other colors
      - role: noise, removed in the output

actions:
  - action: Identify Background Color
    actor: system
    details: Find the most frequent pixel color in the input grid.
  - action: Identify Pattern Object
    actor: system
    details: Find the largest connected group of non-background pixels. Determine its shape, color, and original location.
  - action: Identify Marker Pixels
    actor: system
    details: Find all pixels matching the color of the smallest connected non-background object(s). Record their locations.
  - action: Initialize Output Grid
    actor: system
    details: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color.
  - action: Place Original Pattern
    actor: system
    target: Output Grid
    details: Copy the identified pattern object onto the output grid at its original input location.
  - action: Copy Pattern to Markers
    actor: system
    target: Output Grid
    details: For each identified marker pixel location, copy the pattern object onto the output grid, ensuring the center of the pattern aligns with the marker pixel's location. Overwrite existing pixels as needed.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    entity1: Marker Pixel
    entity2: Copied Pattern Object
    details: The center of the copied pattern object is placed at the location of the marker pixel.
  - type: identity
    entity1: Input Background Color
    entity2: Output Background Color
    details: The background color remains unchanged.
  - type: transformation
    entity1: Marker Pixels
    entity2: Output Grid
    details: Marker pixels are removed or overwritten in the output.
  - type: transformation
    entity1: Other Pixels (Noise)
    entity2: Output Grid
    details: Pixels not belonging to the background, pattern, or markers are replaced by the background color.
