Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

Observing the three training pairs, a common theme emerges: a "fill" operation occurs, changing the color of certain background pixels based on boundaries and a specific "source" color found elsewhere in the input grid.

1.  **Example 1:** The input has a blue background (1), a green shape (3) acting as a boundary, two gray pixels (5) also acting as boundaries within the green shape, and a single maroon pixel (9) inside the green shape. The output shows the area inside the green shape, previously blue, filled with maroon (9), starting from the original maroon pixel and stopping at the green and gray boundaries. This suggests a flood fill operation.
2.  **Example 2:** The input has a white background (0), scattered gray pixels (5), and a single yellow pixel (4). The output shows the area to the left of the leftmost gray pixel in each row filled with yellow (4), replacing the white background. The gray pixels act as rightward boundaries for the fill in each row. The fill color comes from the unique yellow pixel.
3.  **Example 3:** The input has an orange background (7), various maroon pixels (9) forming shapes including two prominent vertical lines, a small green L-shape (3), and single magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels. The output shows the area *between* the two main vertical maroon lines filled with green (3), replacing the orange background. Other non-background pixels (maroon, magenta, green, azure) within this area are preserved. The fill color seems derived from the green L-shape object. The maroon lines act as boundaries for the filled region.

In all cases:
*   A background color is identified (most frequent color).
*   Boundary elements are identified (non-background colors forming shapes or lines).
*   A specific fill color is identified (often from a unique, non-boundary, non-background pixel or small object).
*   A region is filled with this fill color, replacing the background color, respecting the boundaries and any other existing non-background pixels. The method of defining the region varies (flood fill from source, fill left-of boundary, fill between boundaries).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: fill_operation

elements:
  - role: background
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid. It is the color that gets replaced during the fill.
    examples:
      - train_1: blue (1)
      - train_2: white (0)
      - train_3: orange (7)
  - role: boundary
    description: Pixels or contiguous objects of non-background color that define the limits of the fill area. Can be enclosing shapes, lines, or blocking pixels.
    examples:
      - train_1: green (3) shape, gray (5) pixels
      - train_2: gray (5) pixels
      - train_3: maroon (9) vertical lines
  - role: fill_color_source
    description: A unique pixel or small object whose color is neither the background nor the primary boundary color. This determines the color used for filling.
    examples:
      - train_1: maroon (9) pixel
      - train_2: yellow (4) pixel
      - train_3: green (3) L-shape object
  - role: fill_area
    description: The region within the grid where the background color is replaced by the fill color. Its definition depends on the boundary and source location.
    examples:
      - train_1: Area inside the green shape, bounded by green and gray.
      - train_2: Area to the left of the leftmost gray pixel in each row.
      - train_3: Area between the two main vertical maroon lines.
  - role: preserved_pixels
    description: Any non-background pixels existing in the input grid are generally preserved in the output, acting as barriers if they fall within the fill area.
    examples:
      - train_1: green (3), gray (5) pixels
      - train_2: gray (5) pixels
      - train_3: maroon (9), magenta (6), green (3), azure (8) pixels

actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    description: Determine the background color (most frequent), potential boundary colors, and potential fill source colors.
  - name: determine_boundaries_and_region
    description: Analyze the geometry of non-background objects to identify the primary boundaries and the specific region they define for filling (e.g., inside, between, left-of).
  - name: determine_fill_color
    description: Select the fill color from the source pixel/object identified.
  - name: perform_fill
    description: Replace the background color pixels within the determined fill region with the fill color, without changing boundary or other preserved pixels. The fill mechanism might be flood fill or regional replacement.

relationships:
  - type: boundary_containment
    description: Boundary objects define the extent of the fill_area.
  - type: color_determination
    description: The fill_color_source determines the color used in the perform_fill action.
  - type: replacement
    description: The perform_fill action replaces background pixels within the fill_area.
  - type: preservation
    description: Boundary pixels and other non-background, non-source pixels are usually preserved during the transformation.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-background colors and the pixels/objects associated with them.
3.  Analyze the shapes and positions of the non-background objects to determine the primary boundary structure (e.g., an enclosing loop, parallel lines, scattered blockers). Note the color(s) forming this primary boundary.
4.  Identify the fill color source: Find the color(s) that are neither the background color nor the primary boundary color(s). If there is only one such color, that is the fill color. If there are multiple, select the color belonging to the largest distinct object among them (or apply task-specific criteria if needed, like in example 3 where green (3) is chosen over magenta (6) and azure (8)).
5.  Determine the fill region and mechanism based on the boundary structure and the location of the fill color source (if applicable):
    *   If the boundary forms a closed loop and the fill source is inside, the region is the area inside the loop reachable from the source without crossing the boundary or other non-background pixels. The mechanism is flood fill from the source.
    *   If the boundary consists of elements acting as barriers relative to the grid edges (like in example 2), the region is defined relative to these barriers (e.g., pixels to the left of the first barrier in each row).
    *   If the boundary consists of structures defining a channel or space between them (like in example 3), the region is the area between these structures.
6.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
7.  Iterate through all pixels within the determined fill region in the output grid. If a pixel's color matches the background color, change it to the identified fill color. Leave all other pixels (boundary pixels, preserved pixels) unchanged.
