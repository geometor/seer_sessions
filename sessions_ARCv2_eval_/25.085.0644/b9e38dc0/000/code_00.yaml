task_type: fill_operation

elements:
  - role: background
    description: The most frequent pixel color in the input grid. It is the color that gets replaced during the fill.
    examples:
      - train_1: blue (1)
      - train_2: white (0)
      - train_3: orange (7)
  - role: boundary
    description: Pixels or contiguous objects of non-background color that define the limits of the fill area. Can be enclosing shapes, lines, or blocking pixels.
    examples:
      - train_1: green (3) shape, gray (5) pixels
      - train_2: gray (5) pixels
      - train_3: maroon (9) vertical lines
  - role: fill_color_source
    description: A unique pixel or small object whose color is neither the background nor the primary boundary color. This determines the color used for filling.
    examples:
      - train_1: maroon (9) pixel
      - train_2: yellow (4) pixel
      - train_3: green (3) L-shape object
  - role: fill_area
    description: The region within the grid where the background color is replaced by the fill color. Its definition depends on the boundary and source location.
    examples:
      - train_1: Area inside the green shape, bounded by green and gray.
      - train_2: Area to the left of the leftmost gray pixel in each row.
      - train_3: Area between the two main vertical maroon lines.
  - role: preserved_pixels
    description: Any non-background pixels existing in the input grid are generally preserved in the output, acting as barriers if they fall within the fill area.
    examples:
      - train_1: green (3), gray (5) pixels
      - train_2: gray (5) pixels
      - train_3: maroon (9), magenta (6), green (3), azure (8) pixels

actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    description: Determine the background color (most frequent), potential boundary colors, and potential fill source colors.
  - name: determine_boundaries_and_region
    description: Analyze the geometry of non-background objects to identify the primary boundaries and the specific region they define for filling (e.g., inside, between, left-of).
  - name: determine_fill_color
    description: Select the fill color from the source pixel/object identified.
  - name: perform_fill
    description: Replace the background color pixels within the determined fill region with the fill color, without changing boundary or other preserved pixels. The fill mechanism might be flood fill or regional replacement.

relationships:
  - type: boundary_containment
    description: Boundary objects define the extent of the fill_area.
  - type: color_determination
    description: The fill_color_source determines the color used in the perform_fill action.
  - type: replacement
    description: The perform_fill action replaces background pixels within the fill_area.
  - type: preservation
    description: Boundary pixels and other non-background, non-source pixels are usually preserved during the transformation.
