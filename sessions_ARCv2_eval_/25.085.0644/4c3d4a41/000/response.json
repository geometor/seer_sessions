            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (8x20). They are visually divided into two main sections: a left section (columns 0-8) and a right section (columns 9-19).\n2.  **Left Section (Stencil Area):** In the input, this section contains a shape made of gray pixels (5) on a white background (0). In the output, this entire section (columns 0-8) is cleared to white (0).\n3.  **Right Section (Target Area):** This section contains a large rectangular frame made of gray pixels (5). Inside the frame, there are various colored pixels and white pixels. This frame structure appears identical in both input and output grids.\n4.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs within the right section (Target Area). Some pixels inside the frame change their color from their original input color to gray (5) in the output. The pixels that change correspond positionally to the gray pixels found in the left section (Stencil Area) of the input grid. Specifically, a pixel at `(row, col)` in the right section changes to gray if the pixel at `(row, col - 9)` in the input grid was gray. Pixels in the right section whose corresponding left-side pixel was *not* gray retain their original color. The gray frame pixels themselves remain gray.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
