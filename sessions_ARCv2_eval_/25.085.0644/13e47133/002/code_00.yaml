task_description: Apply flood fill from initiator pixels and conditionally reflect the top-left quadrant to the bottom-left.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    property: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - object: divider
    property: Pixels with the color Red (2).
    description: Used to define boundaries and quadrants. Includes a complete vertical line and a partial horizontal line starting from the vertical one.
  - object: background
    property: The most frequent color in the input grid, excluding the divider color (Red).
  - object: initiator
    property: Any pixel in the input grid that is NOT the background color and NOT the divider color (Red).
  - object: quadrant_intersection
    property: The pixel (h, v) where the horizontal divider segment begins along the vertical divider line.
    derived_from:
      vertical_divider_index (v): Index of the first column composed entirely of Red pixels.
      horizontal_divider_start_row (h): Index of the first row r such that grid[r, v] and grid[r, v+1] are both Red.
  - object: quadrants
    property: Four regions defined by the quadrant_intersection (h, v).
    values:
      - Top-Left (TL): Rows 0 to h-1, Columns 0 to v-1.
      - Top-Right (TR): Rows 0 to h-1, Columns v+1 to end.
      - Bottom-Left (BL): Rows h to end, Columns 0 to v-1.
      - Bottom-Right (BR): Rows h to end, Columns v+1 to end.
    note: The divider lines themselves (row h, col v) are boundaries, not typically part of the fillable area of these quadrants.

actions:
  - action: identify_elements
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [background_color, quadrant_intersection (h, v), initiators]
    description: Find the background color, the key divider intersection point, and all initiator pixels.
  - action: flood_fill
    inputs: [grid_to_fill, initiator_list, background_color, divider_color]
    outputs: [filled_grid]
    description: For each initiator, fill adjacent background pixels with the initiator's color. The fill spreads in 4 directions and stops at grid edges, divider pixels (Red), or pixels that are not the background color. This action modifies the grid_to_fill.
  - action: conditional_reflection
    inputs: [input_grid, filled_grid, quadrant_intersection (h, v), background_color, divider_color]
    outputs: [final_grid]
    condition: Check the Bottom-Left quadrant (Rows >= h, Cols < v) of the *input_grid*. If this region contains NO initiator pixels (i.e., only background or divider colors), then proceed with the action.
    action:
      1. Extract the Top-Left quadrant (Rows < h, Cols < v) from the *filled_grid*.
      2. Flip this extracted region vertically.
      3. Replace the Bottom-Left quadrant (Rows >= h, Cols < v) of the *filled_grid* with the flipped region.
    description: If the input BL quadrant was empty of initiators, reflect the processed TL quadrant into the BL quadrant of the output. Otherwise, the filled_grid is the final_grid.

workflow:
  1. Create a copy of the input_grid (output_grid).
  2. Identify background_color, quadrant_intersection (h, v), and initiators from input_grid.
  3. Perform flood_fill on output_grid using the identified elements.
  4. Apply conditional_reflection, potentially modifying output_grid further based on the input_grid check.
  5. Return the final output_grid.
