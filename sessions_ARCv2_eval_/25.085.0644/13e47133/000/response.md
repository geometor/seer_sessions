Okay, let's break down the task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples use 20x20 grids.
2.  **Dividing Lines:** Red lines (color 2) act as separators, forming distinct regions. In Example 1, there's a vertical line and two horizontal lines. In Example 2, there's one vertical and one horizontal line. These lines persist unchanged in the output.
3.  **Background Color:** The most common color, excluding the red lines, appears to be a background that gets modified. It's blue (1) in Example 1 and yellow (4) in Example 2.
4.  **Initiator Pixels:** Within the regions defined by the red lines, there are isolated pixels of various colors (neither red nor the background color). Examples include orange (7), azure (8), green (3), yellow (4), blue (1), gray (5), white (0).
5.  **Transformation - Flood Fill:** In regions *with* initiator pixels, the background color seems to be replaced by the initiator pixel's color, spreading outwards (like a flood fill) until it hits a region boundary (red line or grid edge) or a non-background pixel. If multiple initiators are in a region, each performs its fill, respecting the boundaries set by other non-background pixels, including those filled by other initiators.
6.  **Transformation - Reflection:** A specific pattern occurs for the bottom-left region in both examples. This region *lacks* initiator pixels in the input. In the output, its content is a vertically flipped version of the *transformed* top-left region.
7.  **Constancy:** The red dividing lines and any non-background pixels (that aren't initiators causing a fill) within a filled region seem to remain unchanged (e.g., the azure (8) pixel within the orange-filled top-left region in Example 1; the yellow(4) pixel within the green-filled bottom-right region in Example 1).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Grid Elements**:
    a.  Scan the input grid to find the color forming complete horizontal and vertical lines (divider color, red=2). Note the indices of these divider rows and columns.
    b.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent pixel color in the input grid, excluding the divider color.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Process Regions via Flood Fill**:
    a.  Define the regions based on the divider lines and grid edges.
    b.  For each region:
        i.  Identify all initiator pixels within this region (pixels that are neither the background color nor the divider color).
        ii. If initiator pixels are found:
            - For each initiator pixel: Perform a flood fill on the output grid starting from the initiator's position. Use the initiator's color as the fill color. Only replace pixels that currently match the background color. The fill must respect the region's boundaries (divider lines, grid edges) and must not overwrite any pixel that isn't the background color.
4.  **Apply Reflection Rule**:
    a.  Check the original input grid to see if the bottom-left region (identified by the divider indices) contained any initiator pixels.
    b.  If the bottom-left region contained NO initiator pixels:
        i.  Take the corresponding top-left region from the *current state* of the output grid (which includes any fills performed in step 3).
        ii. Vertically flip this top-left region's content.
        iii. Overwrite the bottom-left region in the output grid with this flipped content.
5.  **Return Result**: The modified output grid is the final result.
