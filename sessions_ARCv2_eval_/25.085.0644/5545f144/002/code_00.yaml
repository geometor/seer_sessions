task_description: Identify vertical lines of uniform color spanning the grid height, which act as separators. Extract a subgrid based on the separator color and position.

definitions:
  - object: separator
    definition: A column in the grid where all pixels have the same color and the column spans the full height of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the pixels in the column.
      - index: The column index (0-based).
      - count: There can be one or more separators in a grid. Based on examples, all separators within a single grid share the same color.

actions:
  - action: find_separators
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_separator_indices, separator_color
    description: Iterate through columns, check if each column meets the 'separator' definition. Store indices and the common color.

  - action: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, list_of_separator_indices, separator_color
    output: output_grid
    logic:
      - condition: If no separators are found
        result: Return an empty grid with the same height as the input. (Inferred behavior, not explicitly shown but logical).
      - condition: If separator_color is red (2)
        steps:
          - Find the maximum index in list_of_separator_indices (rightmost separator). Let this be `max_idx`.
          - Extract the portion of the input_grid to the right of this separator.
          - The subgrid includes columns from `max_idx + 1` to the end.
          - If `max_idx` is the last column index, the output is an empty grid (same height).
        result: The extracted subgrid.
      - condition: If separator_color is not red (2)
        steps:
          - Find the minimum index in list_of_separator_indices (leftmost separator). Let this be `min_idx`.
          - Extract the portion of the input_grid to the left of this separator.
          - The subgrid includes columns from 0 to `min_idx - 1`.
          - If `min_idx` is 0, the output is an empty grid (same height).
        result: The extracted subgrid.
