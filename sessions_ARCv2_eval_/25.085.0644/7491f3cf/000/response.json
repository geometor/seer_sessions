            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are always the same size (7x25 in the examples). They feature a consistent single-color border (color varies between tasks) that remains unchanged.\n2.  **Internal Zones:** Inside the border, the grid is divided into four distinct rectangular zones of equal size (5 columns wide), separated by single columns of the border color. Let's label them Zone 1 (cols 1-5), Zone 2 (cols 7-11), Zone 3 (cols 13-17), and Zone 4 (cols 19-23), using 0-based indexing for columns.\n3.  **Zone Content:** Each zone typically contains a background color (which might be the same across multiple zones or unique) and a foreground pattern composed of one or more other colors.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects Zone 4. Zones 1, 2, 3, and the borders remain identical between input and output.\n5.  **Core Logic - Copying:** The primary action seems to be copying a pattern from one of the earlier zones (Zone 2 or Zone 3) into Zone 4, overwriting the original content of Zone 4 but preserving Zone 4's original background color.\n6.  **Source Selection Logic:** The choice of whether to copy from Zone 2 or Zone 3 depends on the content of Zone 3:\n    *   If Zone 3 contains non-background pixels that are *not* green (color 3), then Zone 3 is the source pattern (e.g., `train_3`).\n    *   Otherwise (if Zone 3's non-background pixels are *only* green, or if it has no non-background pixels), Zone 2 is the *primary* source pattern (e.g., `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`).\n7.  **Modification Logic:** In cases where Zone 2 is the primary source, Zone 3 might act as a modifier *if* its non-background content consists solely of green (color 3) pixels forming a single horizontal line spanning the zone's width.\n    *   If Zone 3 acts as a modifier, after copying Zone 2's pattern to Zone 4, the green pattern from Zone 3 is overlaid onto Zone 4, replacing any pixels at corresponding locations (e.g., `train_2`, `train_4`).\n    *   If Zone 2 is the source but Zone 3 does not meet the criteria to be a modifier (e.g., its green pixels aren't a horizontal line, like in `train_1`), then only Zone 2's pattern is copied, and Zone 3 has no effect on the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Define the column ranges for Zone 1 ([1-5]), Zone 2 ([7-11]), Zone 3 ([13-17]), and Zone 4 ([19-23]).\n4.  Determine the background color for Zone 2 and Zone 3 (the most frequent color within each zone's columns, excluding the border color).\n5.  Analyze Zone 3:\n    a.  Find all pixels within Zone 3's columns (13-17) whose color is neither the border color nor the Zone 3 background color. Let this set be `Z3_pattern_pixels`.\n    b.  Check if any pixel in `Z3_pattern_pixels` has a color other than green (3).\n    c.  **If yes (non-green pattern found in Z3):**\n        i.  Set Source Zone = Zone 3.\n        ii. Set Modifier Zone = None.\n    d.  **If no (all pattern pixels in Z3 are green, or Z3 has no pattern pixels):**\n        i.  Check if `Z3_pattern_pixels` forms a single continuous horizontal line spanning exactly 5 columns wide (columns 13 through 17) on a single row.\n        ii. **If yes (green horizontal line found):**\n            1.  Set Source Zone = Zone 2.\n            2.  Set Modifier Zone = Zone 3.\n        iii. **If no (green pattern isn't a horizontal line, or no pattern):**\n            1.  Set Source Zone = Zone 2.\n            2.  Set Modifier Zone = None.\n6.  Perform the copy operation:\n    a.  Iterate through each row `r` from 1 to height-2.\n    b.  Iterate through each column `c_src` within the Source Zone's column range.\n    c.  Get the color `color_src` at `(r, c_src)`.\n    d.  Get the background color `bg_src` of the Source Zone.\n    e.  If `color_src` is not `bg_src` and not the border color:\n        i.  Calculate the target column `c_tgt`: If Source Zone is Zone 2, `c_tgt = c_src + 12`. If Source Zone is Zone 3, `c_tgt = c_src + 6`.\n        ii. Set the pixel color at `(r, c_tgt)` in the output grid to `color_src`.\n7.  Perform the modification operation (only if Modifier Zone is Zone 3):\n    a.  Iterate through each row `r` from 1 to height-2.\n    b.  Iterate through each column `c_mod` in Zone 3's range (13-17).\n    c.  Get the color `color_mod` at `(r, c_mod)`.\n    d.  Get the background color `bg_mod` of Zone 3.\n    e.  If `color_mod` is not `bg_mod` and not the border color (it must be green=3):\n        i.  Calculate the target column `c_tgt = c_mod + 6`.\n        ii. Set the pixel color at `(r, c_tgt)` in the output grid to `color_mod`.\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
