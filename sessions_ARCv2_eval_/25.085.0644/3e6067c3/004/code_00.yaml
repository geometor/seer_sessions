Objects:
  - Type: Grid
    Description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - Type: Legend
    Description: A specific row pattern defining color priority.
    Properties:
      - location: Typically a single row near the bottom of the grid.
      - structure: Alternating azure (8) and non-azure pixels, e.g., [8, C1, 8, C2, 8, ...]. Trailing azures allowed.
      - priority_map: Derived mapping where colors appearing earlier (C1, C2, ...) have higher priority (lower numerical value). Colors not present have lowest priority.
  - Type: Box
    Description: A rectangular object identified in the grid.
    Properties:
      - border: A continuous, single-pixel thick perimeter of blue (1) pixels.
      - interior: The area enclosed by the border.
      - interior_color: A single color filling the interior, which is not blue (1) or azure (8).
      - bounds: The minimum and maximum row and column indices of the border.
  - Type: Gap
    Description: A specific region of azure pixels separating two adjacent Boxes.
    Properties:
      - structure: A single row or single column composed entirely of azure (8) pixels.
      - location: Situated directly between the borders of two adjacent Boxes.
      - extent: Spans the overlapping row or column range of the adjacent Boxes.
      - fill_color: The color designated to replace the azure pixels, determined by priority.

Actions:
  - Action: Scan Grid (for Legend)
    Input: Grid
    Output: Priority Map (or default if no legend found)
    Details: Iterates rows from bottom to top, searching for the specific azure-alternating pattern. Extracts non-azure colors to create the priority map.
  - Action: Find Boxes
    Input: Grid
    Output: List of Box objects
    Details: Uses BFS to find connected blue components. Validates if they form a rectangular border enclosing a valid solid interior. Stores box properties.
  - Action: Identify Gaps and Determine Fill Color
    Input: List of Boxes, Priority Map, Grid
    Output: List of Gaps (coordinates and fill_color)
    Details: Examines pairs of Boxes. Checks for horizontal/vertical adjacency with a single separating row/column. Verifies this separation consists only of azure pixels within the overlapping region. Compares the interior colors of the adjacent Boxes using the Priority Map to determine the fill_color for the gap.
  - Action: Fill Gaps
    Input: Grid, List of Gaps
    Output: Modified Grid
    Details: Creates a copy of the input Grid. Iterates through the identified Gaps and replaces the azure pixels at the specified coordinates with the determined fill_color.
