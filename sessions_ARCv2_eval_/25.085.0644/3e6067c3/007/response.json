Initialize: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2. Identify Color Priority Legend:\n    a. Scan the input grid row by row, starting from the bottom and moving upwards.\n    b. Identify the first row encountered that matches the pattern: starts with azure (8), then alternates between a non-azure color pixel (C1, C2, ...) and azure (8), potentially ending with trailing azure (8) pixels (`8, C1, 8, C2, 8,...`). The pattern `8, C1...` must start at column 0.\n    c. If such a row is found, extract the sequence of non-azure colors (`C1, C2, C3,...`). This sequence defines the color priority: `C1` has the highest priority, `C2` the next highest, and so on.\n    d. Create a priority mapping where lower numbers indicate higher priority (e.g., `C1: 0, C2: 1, ...`). Assign a very low priority (e.g., infinity) to any color not found in this legend sequence.\n    e. If no such legend row is found, all colors effectively have the lowest priority.\n3. Find Blue-Bordered Boxes:\n    a. Search the input grid to locate all distinct rectangular objects that meet the following criteria:\n        i. They have a continuous, single-pixel-thick border composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.\n        ii. The area strictly inside the blue border is filled entirely with a single, solid color.\n        iii. This interior fill color is *not* blue (1) and *not* azure (8).\n    b. For each valid box found, record its interior color and the coordinates defining the bounding box of its blue border (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).\n4. Identify Adjacent Boxes, Azure Gaps, and Determine Fill Color:\n    a. Iterate through all unique pairs of boxes found in the previous step.\n    b. For each pair (Box A, Box B):\n        i. Check if they are adjacent horizontally (side-by-side) with exactly one column separating their blue borders. Verify that this separating column consists *only* of azure (8) pixels within the vertical range where the boxes overlap.\n        ii. Check if they are adjacent vertically (one above the other) with exactly one row separating their blue borders. Verify that this separating row consists *only* of azure (8) pixels within the horizontal range where the boxes overlap.\n        iii. If a valid azure gap (either horizontal or vertical) is found between Box A and Box B:\n            1. Compare the priority of Box A's interior color and Box B's interior color using the legend priority map established in step 2.\n            2. The color with the higher priority (lower numerical value in the map) is designated as the 'fill color' for this gap. If priorities are equal (including the case where neither is in the legend), use the interior color of Box A as the fill color (due to the <= implementation comparison order).\n            3. Record the coordinates of all the azure pixels within this identified gap and the determined fill color.\n5. Fill Gaps:\n    a. Iterate through all the recorded gaps and their associated fill colors.\n    b. For each gap, change the color of the pixels at the recorded azure coordinates in the output grid copy to the determined fill color. Only change pixels that are currently azure.\n6. Output: Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_legend_priority(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the legend row and returns a dictionary mapping color to priority (lower is better).\n    Scans from bottom-up for a row starting with 8, then alternating non-8 color and 8.\n    Example: 8 C1 8 C2 8 C3 8 8 ...\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    priority_list = []\n\n    # Scan rows from bottom up\n    for r in range(height - 1, -1, -1):\n        row = grid[r]\n        current_legend = []\n        valid_pattern = False\n        found_color = False\n\n        # Check if pattern starts correctly (must start with 8 at column 0)\n        if width == 0 or row[0] != 8:\n             continue # Does not start with 8, cannot be the legend row\n\n        # Check the rest of the pattern 8, C, 8, C...\n        for c in range(width):\n            pixel = row[c]\n            is_even_idx = (c % 2 == 0)\n\n            if is_even_idx: # Expect 8\n                if pixel != 8:\n                    # We expect an 8 here.
