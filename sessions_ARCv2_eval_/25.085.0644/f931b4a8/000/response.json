            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All input grids appear to be square and have dimensions that are powers of 2 (8x8 or 16x16). They can be naturally divided into four equal quadrants.\n2.  **Quadrant Focus:** The transformation consistently depends on the content of the bottom-left (BL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants of the input grid. The top two quadrants (TL, TR) seem irrelevant to the output generation.\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** The specific transformation rule applied depends on the content of the BR quadrant. I can identify three distinct cases based on the examples:\n    *   **Case 1: BR is solid white (0).** The output is simply the BL quadrant. (Example: train_4)\n    *   **Case 2: BR is a solid color, but not white.** The output is constructed using the solid color of BR and the solid color of BL. (Example: train_5)\n    *   **Case 3: BR contains a pattern involving white (0) and other colors.** The output is derived from the BR pattern, but with the white pixels replaced by a color derived from the BL quadrant. The final output size and structure (tiling vs. padding) depend on the initial quadrant size. (Examples: train_1, train_2, train_3)\n4.  **Color Replacement:** In Case 3, the white (0) pixels in the BR pattern are replaced. The replacement color is determined by the BL quadrant \u2013 specifically, it appears to be the most frequent non-white color present in the BL quadrant. If the BL quadrant is a single solid color, that color is used.\n5.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   **Extraction:** In Case 1, the BL quadrant is directly extracted.\n    *   **Row Construction:** In Case 2, the output is a small grid (3 rows high) built from rows of the solid colors found in BL and BR.\n    *   **Pattern Manipulation & Resizing:** In Case 3, the modified BR pattern (after color replacement) is either tiled or padded to create the final output:\n        *   If the quadrants are 4x4, the 4x4 modified pattern is tiled 4x4 times to produce a 16x16 output.\n        *   If the quadrants are 8x8, the 8x8 modified pattern is padded with 2 rows/columns of the replacement color on the bottom and right to produce a 10x10 output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
