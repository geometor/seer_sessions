            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implements a transformation involving connecting yellow pixels horizontally and then expanding other colors via BFS with specific color change rules and conflict resolution. The code successfully transformed the input it was likely derived from (possibly a hidden example similar to the provided ones) but fails on all three provided training examples.\n\nThe key discrepancies appear to be:\n\n1.  **Connection Rule:** The code connects only Yellow (4) pixels. However, the expected outputs suggest that *any* pair of same-colored non-white pixels on the same row should be connected horizontally if the path between them is white, filling with that specific color. This connection process should likely be iterative.\n2.  **BFS Expansion/Conflict/Obstacles:** The transformed outputs show expansion filling almost the entire grid, wildly differing from the expected outputs where expansion is more constrained and respects boundaries/other regions. This suggests potential issues in:\n    *   How obstacles (non-white cells after connection, including the connection lines themselves) are defined or respected.\n    *   How conflicts (multiple sources reaching a cell simultaneously) are detected and resolved (expected output suggests contested cells remain white).\n    *   The initialization of the BFS (ensuring sources start correctly).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the connection rule to handle all non-white colors.\n2.  Re-verify the source identification and color mapping rules (these seem correct based on initial analysis).\n3.  Carefully re-examine and potentially refine the BFS logic, especially obstacle handling and conflict resolution, ensuring it matches the behavior implied by the expected outputs.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze each example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Grid: 20x20\n*   Output Grid: 20x20\n*   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Expected Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Orange(7)\n*   Input Sources (Original Non-White/Non-Yellow): Blue(1), Green(3), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Color Mapping Conditions: `has_magenta_source`=True, `has_orange_anywhere`=True.\n*   Expected Mapping: Azure(8)->Blue(1), Magenta(6)->Orange(7). Others expand as self.\n*   Connection (Expected): Yellow(4) at (17, 5) and (17, 12) should connect with Yellow(4). Path (17, 6) to (17, 11) is white. -> Connects.\n*   Discrepancy: The transformed output shows massive, incorrect expansion. Green expands left, Orange (from Magenta) expands up/left, Blue (from Azure) expands right, covering almost everything. Expected output shows localized expansion respecting other sources and the yellow line.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Grid: 18x18\n*   Output Grid: 18x18\n*   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6), Azure(8)\n*   Expected Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6), Azure(8)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Green(3), Yellow(4), Magenta(6)\n*   Input Sources (Original Non-White/Non-Yellow): Blue(1), Green(3), Magenta(6), Azure(8)\n*   Color Mapping Conditions: `has_magenta_source`=True, `has_orange_anywhere`=False.\n*   Expected Mapping: Azure(8)->Blue(1). Magenta expands as Magenta(6). Others expand as self.\n*   Connection (Expected): Magenta(6) at (5, 11) and (5, 13) should connect with Magenta(6). Path (5, 12) is white. -> Connects. Also Magenta at (6, 14) and (8, 16) maybe? No, different rows. Yellow at (4, 10)? No pair.\n*   Discrepancy: Similar to Ex1, expansion in transformed output is excessive and incorrect. Blue(1) (from Azure(8)) expands widely. Magenta(6) expands widely. Green(3) expands widely. Expected output shows contained expansion respecting obstacles (including the Magenta connection line) and potential conflicts.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input Grid: 15x15\n*   Output Grid: 15x15\n*   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Expected Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Transformed Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Input Sources (Original Non-White/Non-Yellow): Blue(1), Red(2), Orange(7), Azure(8)\n*   Color Mapping Conditions: `has_magenta_source`=False, `has_orange_anywhere`=True.\n*   Expected Mapping: Azure(8)->Azure(8). Magenta rule N/A. Others expand as self.\n*   Connection (Expected):\n    *   Blue(1) at (2, 2) and (2, 13). Path white? Yes. -> Connect with Blue(1).\n    *   Blue(1) at (12, 2) and (12, 13). Path white? Yes. -> Connect with Blue(1).\n    *   Red(2) at (6, 7) and (6, 9). Path white? Yes. -> Connect with Red(2).\n    *   Orange(7) at (4, 4) and (4, 10). Path white? Yes. -> Connect with Orange(7).\n    *   Orange(7) at (10, 4) and (10, 6). Path white? Yes. -> Connect with Orange(7).\n*   Discrepancy: The connection rule in the code (only yellow) is fundamentally wrong for this case. The transformed output shows chaotic expansion, likely due to incorrect connection and potentially BFS issues. The expected output shows Azure(8), Blue(1), and Orange(7) expanding, while Red(2) forms a connection but doesn't appear to expand outwards, possibly due to being blocked or contested by Orange(7) expansion.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Create a working copy for the connection phase.\n2.  **Iterative Connection:**\n    *   Repeatedly scan the current working grid:\n        *   For each row, identify all pairs of pixels `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` (where `c1 < c2`) that have the *same* non-White (0) color `C`.\n        *   Check if all pixels in the range `(r, c1+1)` to `(r, c2-1)` are currently White (0).\n        *   If the path is clear (all White), fill the pixels from `(r, c1+1)` to `(r, c2-1)` with color `C` in the working grid. Mark that a change was made in this pass.\n    *   Continue these passes until a full pass completes with no new connections made.\n    *   Store the resulting grid as `grid_with_connections`.\n3.  **Source Identification and Mapping:**\n    *   Refer back to the *original* input grid.\n    *   Identify all non-White (0) pixels. These are the \"expansion sources\". Record their locations `(sr, sc)` and original colors.\n    *   Determine global conditions from the *original* input grid:\n        *   `has_magenta_source`: True if any identified source has original color Magenta (6).\n        *   `has_orange_anywhere`: True if *any* pixel (source or not) in the original grid has color Orange (7).\n    *   Create a mapping for how each source's original color determines its expansion color:\n        *   If a source's original color is Azure (8) AND `has_magenta_source` is true, its expansion color is Blue (1).\n        *   If a source's original color is Magenta (6) AND `has_orange_anywhere` is true, its expansion color is Orange (7).\n        *   Otherwise, a source's expansion color is its own original color.\n4.  **Simultaneous Expansion (BFS):**\n    *   Initialize data structures to track distance from the nearest source and the owner (source coordinate tuple) for each cell, initially marking all as unreached/unowned. Also track contested cells.\n    *   Create a queue for the BFS, initially populated with all source locations `(sr, sc)` found in Step 3, marked with distance 0. Set the owner of each source location to its own coordinate tuple `(sr, sc)`.\n    *   Process the BFS level by level (incrementing distance):\n        *   In each step, determine all potential next cells `(nr, nc)` reachable from the cells processed in the *previous* step.\n        *   A cell `(nr, nc)` is a potential target if it is within grid bounds, is White (0) in `grid_with_connections`, and has not yet been reached or contested.\n        *   Keep track of which source(s) attempt to reach each potential target `(nr, nc)` *in this specific step*.\n        *   After checking all cells at the current level:\n            *   For each potential target `(nr, nc)`:\n                *   If exactly one unique source reached it in this step, assign ownership to that source, record the new distance, and add `(nr, nc)` to the queue for the next level.\n                *   If multiple *different* sources reached it in this step, mark `(nr, nc)` as \"CONTESTED\". It remains White (0) and does not get added to the queue (acts as an obstacle).\n    *   Continue the BFS until the queue is empty.\n5.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   Start with a copy of `grid_with_connections`.\n    *   Iterate through the grid cells `(r, c)`.\n    *   If cell `(r, c)` was successfully claimed by a source `(sr, sc)` during the BFS (i.e., its owner is a coordinate tuple), find the corresponding expansion color determined in Step 3 for the source `(sr, sc)` and update the cell `(r, c)` in the final grid to this expansion color.\n    *   If the cell `(r, c)` was marked as \"CONTESTED\", ensure it is White (0) in the final grid.\n    *   Otherwise (if the cell was part of `grid_with_connections` and was never reached or contested), it retains its color from `grid_with_connections`.\n    *   Return the final grid."
