Task: Expand or connect colored pixels based on specific rules.

Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Properties:
      - Color: Integer (0-9, representing White, Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Gray, Magenta, Orange, Azure, Maroon)
      - Position: (row, column)
      - Role: Can be Source, Obstacle, Background(White), or Filled.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right).
  - Source-Expansion: Certain source colors expand into adjacent white pixels.
  - Source-Obstacle: Expansion stops when encountering any non-white pixel.
  - Source-Source Interaction: Simultaneous expansion; conflicts (meeting at the same step) result in no fill.
  - Horizontal Connection: Yellow (4) pixels can connect horizontally.

Actions/Transformations:
  - Yellow Connection:
    - Identify pairs of Yellow (4) pixels on the same row.
    - If the segment between them consists only of White (0) pixels, fill the segment with Yellow (4).
    - This step seems to occur first, and the filled pixels act as obstacles for subsequent expansion.
  - Determine Expansion Colors:
    - Default: Source color C expands as color C.
    - Exception 1: If any Magenta (6) source exists in the input, Azure (8) sources expand as Blue (1).
    - Exception 2: If any Orange (7) pixel exists in the input, Magenta (6) sources expand as Orange (7).
  - Simultaneous Expansion (BFS):
    - Initialize: Start BFS from all non-Yellow source pixels simultaneously.
    - Propagation: Expand one step (Manhattan distance) into adjacent, originally White (0) cells per iteration.
    - Conflict Resolution: If a White cell is reached by multiple different sources in the same iteration, it remains White (0) and is marked as contested.
    - Termination: Expansion stops at grid boundaries, original non-white pixels, Yellow-filled pixels, and contested cells.
  - Output Generation:
    - Copy the input grid.
    - Apply Yellow connection fills.
    - Apply BFS expansion fills according to the determined expansion colors and conflict resolution.

Input Grid Properties Check:
  - `has_magenta_source`: True if any input pixel == 6.
  - `has_orange_anywhere`: True if any input pixel == 7.
