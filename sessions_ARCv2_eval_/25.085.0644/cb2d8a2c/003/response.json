Barrier Solidification: Identifies all blue pixels (color 1) and changes them to red pixels (color 2) in a copy of the input grid. These red pixels act as barriers.\n2. Flood Fill Initiation: Locates the single green pixel (color 3) in the original input grid, which serves as the starting point for a flood fill operation.\n3. Flood Fill Execution: Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the green pixel. The fill expands through adjacent cells that are not red barriers (color 2) and are within the grid boundaries.\n4. Coloring: As the flood fill progresses, any azure pixels (color 8) encountered are changed to green (color 3). The fill continues through these newly greened pixels and any pre-existing green pixels (like the start point).\n5. Output: Returns the modified grid after the flood fill is complete. Azure pixels reachable from the start point without crossing red barriers become green. All other pixels retain their colors (after the initial blue-to-red conversion).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the barrier solidification and flood fill transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # --- 1.
