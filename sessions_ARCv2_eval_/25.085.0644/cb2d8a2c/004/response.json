            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task using a flood-fill algorithm. The core idea is:\n1.  Identify barriers: Blue pixels (1) in the input become Red pixels (2) in the output, acting as walls.\n2.  Identify start point: The single Green pixel (3) in the input.\n3.  Flood Fill: Starting from the Green pixel, spread outwards.\n4.  Coloring Rule: Change any Azure pixel (8) encountered during the flood fill to Green (3).\n5.  Propagation Rule: The fill should spread through adjacent non-barrier cells.\n\nHowever, the results show that the `transform` function incorrectly floods almost the entire grid with Green (3), ignoring the intended boundaries and the rule to only color Azure (8) pixels.\n\nThe error lies in the propagation logic within the Breadth-First Search (BFS). The current code adds *any* non-barrier, unvisited neighbor to the queue (`q.append((nr, nc))`), regardless of its color. This allows the \"fill\" (conceptually) to spread through all empty space (like white 0, gray 5, or even existing azure 8 cells *before* they are checked/colored). The coloring step (`if output_grid[nr, nc] == 8: output_grid[nr, nc] = 3`) correctly changes *only* Azure pixels when encountered, but the fill itself has already spread too far via other colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\nModify the BFS logic. The fill should only propagate *into* and *through* cells that are either the target color (Azure, 8) or the fill color itself (Green, 3). Neighbors of other colors (excluding barriers) should stop the fill along that path.\n\nSpecifically, the condition to add a neighbor `(nr, nc)` to the queue should be more restrictive: the neighbor must be within bounds, not visited, not a barrier (Red, 2), AND its current color in the `output_grid` must be either Azure (8) or Green (3).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the mismatch more closely using code execution. We'll focus on Example 1 to pinpoint the error.\n\n"
