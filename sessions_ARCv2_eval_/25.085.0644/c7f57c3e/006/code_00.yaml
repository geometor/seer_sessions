task_description: Applies a cyclical color transformation to three specific non-background colors, leaving other colors unchanged.
background_color_determination: The color covering the most pixels in the input grid.
involved_colors_selection:
  - Identify all unique non-background colors in the input grid.
  - For each non-background color:
      - Count the number of distinct contiguous objects (4-neighbor adjacency).
      - Calculate the total area (pixel count).
  - Create a list of these colors with their properties (color value, object count, area).
  - Sort this list based on the following criteria, in order:
      1. Object count (ascending).
      2. Total area (ascending).
      3. Color value (descending - based on previous code, needs confirmation if ascending works too).
  - Select the first three colors from the sorted list. Let them be C1, C2, and C3.
transformation_rule:
  - If fewer than three non-background colors are identified, the grid remains unchanged.
  - Otherwise, apply the following color changes to every pixel in the grid:
      - Pixels with color C1 change to color C3.
      - Pixels with color C2 change to color C1.
      - Pixels with color C3 change to color C2.
  - All other colors (background and any non-background colors not among C1, C2, C3) remain unchanged.
edge_cases:
  - Grids with fewer than 3 unique colors (background + 2 others) are returned unchanged.
  - Grids where fewer than 3 non-background colors form objects are returned unchanged.
