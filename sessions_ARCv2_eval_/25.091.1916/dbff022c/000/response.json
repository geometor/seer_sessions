            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The output grid largely mirrors the input grid, with specific modifications.\n2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct shapes (objects) formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-white color. Some shapes are single-colored (like the yellow 'U', green 'H', orange 'C' in example 1), while others are multi-colored conglomerates.\n3.  **Key Feature:** The core transformation involves filling enclosed white (0) areas within single-colored shapes. Multi-colored shapes seem unaffected by this filling process.\n4.  **Enclosed Areas:** These are regions of white pixels completely surrounded by pixels of a single non-white color or other enclosed white pixels. They do not touch the grid boundary or larger background white areas.\n5.  **Fill Color Logic:** The color used to fill these enclosed white areas seems determined by a rule involving the color of the enclosing shape and potentially the colors of adjacent shapes.\n    *   In some cases (e.g., the green 'H' and orange 'C' in example 1), the fill color matches the color of the enclosing shape itself.\n    *   In other cases (e.g., the yellow 'U' in example 1 fills with magenta; the azure 'H' in example 2 fills with blue), the fill color is *different* from the enclosing shape.\n    *   Observing the cases where the fill color differs, it appears to be influenced by the color of pixels from *other* shapes that are directly adjacent (orthogonally) to the enclosed white region. If such \"foreign\" colored pixels touch the white hole, the most frequent *foreign* color seems to be chosen. If there's a tie in frequency, the lowest color index among the tied foreign colors seems to be selected (e.g., Example 1, Yellow U: Magenta(6) and Orange(7) both touch the hole once, Magenta(6) is chosen). If no foreign colors touch the hole, the shape's own color is used.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

An enclosed white pixel is one that cannot reach any boundary pixel of the grid by traveling only through adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. This can be found by performing a flood fill starting from all white pixels on the grid's border; any white pixel not reached by this flood fill is enclosed.\n3.  Group the identified enclosed white pixels into connected regions (where connectivity is defined by orthogonal adjacency).\n4.  For each distinct enclosed white region:\n    a.  Determine the single primary color (`C_primary`) of the shape that immediately surrounds this region (i.e., the color of the non-white pixels orthogonally adjacent to the region's pixels).\n    b.  Examine all non-white pixels that are orthogonally adjacent to *any* pixel within the current enclosed white region.\n    c.  Create a list of colors from these adjacent non-white pixels, excluding any pixels that have the color `C_primary`. Let this list be `Foreign_Colors`.\n    d.  If the `Foreign_Colors` list is empty, set the `Fill_Color` for this region to `C_primary`.\n    e.  If the `Foreign_Colors` list is not empty:\n        i.
