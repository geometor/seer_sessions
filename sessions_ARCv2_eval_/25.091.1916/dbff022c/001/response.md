"""
Identifies enclosed regions of white pixels (0) within single-colored shapes in the input grid. 
Determines a fill color for each enclosed region based on the colors of adjacent pixels from other shapes. 
If no other shapes are adjacent to the enclosed region, it's filled with the color of the surrounding shape. 
If other shapes are adjacent, the fill color is the most frequent adjacent color from those other shapes (ties broken by lowest color index).
The output grid is the input grid with these enclosed regions filled.
