They feature a distinct border pattern on the left: a magenta (6) column followed by an orange (7) column.\n2.  **Content:** The main area of the grids consists of horizontal segments of various single colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, white, maroon, azure) separated by rows that are predominantly orange (7), often following the `6 7 7 7...` pattern. Some rows contain more complex patterns mixing colors.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing specific orange (7) pixels to magenta (6) pixels. The locations of these changes vary between examples.\n4.  **Key Colors:** Magenta (6) and Orange (7) seem to play structural roles (borders, separators). The transformation specifically targets orange pixels and changes them to magenta. Other colors define data segments.\n5.  **Neighborhood Influence:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the changes from orange (7) to magenta (6) seem to depend on the neighboring pixels. An orange pixel changes if it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel that is *not* orange.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Examine all 8 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), considering grid boundaries (neighbors outside the grid do not exist).\n    b.  Count how many of the *existing* neighbors have a color that is *not* orange (7).\n    c.  If this count is greater than zero (i.e., at least one neighbor is *not* orange), set the corresponding output pixel `output[r][c]` to magenta (6).\n    d.  If the count is zero (all existing neighbors are orange), set the output pixel `output[r][c]` to orange (7) (i.e., copy the input color).\n5.  **Else (if `input[r][c]` is not orange):** Copy the color from the input pixel to the output pixel: `output[r][c] = input[r][c]`.\n6.  Return the completed output grid."
