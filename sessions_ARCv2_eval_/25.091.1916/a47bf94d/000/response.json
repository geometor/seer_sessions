            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The grid size appears consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (e.g., 22x22 in train\\_1, 19x22 in train\\_2, 22x22 in train\\_3).\n2.  **Background:** The predominant background color is white (0).\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain various distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-white colors.\n    *   Some objects are simple geometric shapes, specifically 3x3 solid squares (e.g., green(3) and red(2) in train\\_1; blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4) in train\\_2; red(2), yellow(4), magenta(6) in train\\_3).\n    *   Other objects have more complex or irregular shapes (e.g., the large azure(8)/maroon(9)/gray(5) structures, the yellow(+) and magenta(+) shapes in train\\_1, the blue(+) shape in train\\_3).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core change between input and output seems to specifically target the 3x3 solid square objects.\n5.  **Transformation Effect:** When a 3x3 solid square is transformed, its internal structure changes: the four edge pixels (not corners) are turned white (0), while the four corner pixels and the single center pixel retain their original color. This creates a \"hollowed-out\" or \"checkerboard-like\" pattern within the 3x3 area.\n6.  **Color Specificity:** The transformation appears to apply only to 3x3 squares of certain colors. Colors like azure(8), maroon(9), and gray(5) seem unaffected, even if they form parts of larger structures. The shapes that are *not* 3x3 squares (like the yellow and magenta crosses in train\\_1, blue cross in train\\_3) are also unaffected, regardless of their color.\n7.  **Positional Invariance:** The transformation happens *in place*. The position of the transformed 3x3 shape in the output grid corresponds exactly to the position of the original 3x3 square in the input grid. All other unaffected objects and pixels also remain in their original positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, the output grid contains the final transformed image. Return the output grid."
