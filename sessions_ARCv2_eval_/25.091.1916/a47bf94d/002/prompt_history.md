Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The grid size appears consistent within each example pair but varies between examples (e.g., 22x22 in train\_1, 19x22 in train\_2, 22x22 in train\_3).
2.  **Background:** The predominant background color is white (0).
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain various distinct objects composed of contiguous blocks of non-white colors.
    *   Some objects are simple geometric shapes, specifically 3x3 solid squares (e.g., green(3) and red(2) in train\_1; blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4) in train\_2; red(2), yellow(4), magenta(6) in train\_3).
    *   Other objects have more complex or irregular shapes (e.g., the large azure(8)/maroon(9)/gray(5) structures, the yellow(+) and magenta(+) shapes in train\_1, the blue(+) shape in train\_3).
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core change between input and output seems to specifically target the 3x3 solid square objects.
5.  **Transformation Effect:** When a 3x3 solid square is transformed, its internal structure changes: the four edge pixels (not corners) are turned white (0), while the four corner pixels and the single center pixel retain their original color. This creates a "hollowed-out" or "checkerboard-like" pattern within the 3x3 area.
6.  **Color Specificity:** The transformation appears to apply only to 3x3 squares of certain colors. Colors like azure(8), maroon(9), and gray(5) seem unaffected, even if they form parts of larger structures. The shapes that are *not* 3x3 squares (like the yellow and magenta crosses in train\_1, blue cross in train\_3) are also unaffected, regardless of their color.
7.  **Positional Invariance:** The transformation happens *in place*. The position of the transformed 3x3 shape in the output grid corresponds exactly to the position of the original 3x3 square in the input grid. All other unaffected objects and pixels also remain in their original positions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: Modify specific 3x3 square objects within a grid by changing their internal pattern while preserving other objects and the background.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions: Variable (up to 30x30)

objects:
  - type: colored_pixels
  - properties:
      - color: blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)
      - shape: Can be diverse, including solid 3x3 squares, crosses, irregular structures.
      - contiguity: Pixels of the same color forming an object are connected (usually side-by-side, potentially diagonal).

target_objects:
  - criteria:
      - is_solid_square: True
      - size: 3x3 pixels
      - color: Not in [white(0), gray(5), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Based on observed unaffected colors/shapes
  - examples:
      - train_1: green(3) square, red(2) square
      - train_2: blue(1) square, red(2) square, green(3) square, yellow(4) square
      - train_3: red(2) square, yellow(4) square, magenta(6) square

actions:
  - name: identify_target_squares
    description: Scan the input grid to find all objects meeting the target_objects criteria.
  - name: transform_square
    description: For each identified target square, modify its 3x3 area in the output grid.
    details:
      - Preserve original color at the 4 corners and the center pixel.
      - Change the 4 edge pixels (top-middle, bottom-middle, left-middle, right-middle) to white(0).
  - name: preserve_others
    description: All pixels and objects not part of a target square transformation remain unchanged in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_output_mapping: Pixel-wise copy, except for the internal pixels of identified 3x3 target squares.
  - position: Transformed squares maintain their original top-left coordinate. Other objects remain in their original positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible 3x3 subgrid within the input grid. Define a potential square by its top-left corner coordinate (row `r`, column `c`).
3.  For each 3x3 subgrid starting at `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if all 9 pixels within this subgrid have the *same* color. Let this color be `C`.
    b.  Check if the color `C` is *not* white (0), gray (5), azure (8), or maroon (9).
    c.  If both conditions (a and b) are true, then this is a target 3x3 square. Proceed to transform the corresponding 3x3 area in the *output* grid:
        i.   Set the pixel at `(r, c+1)` (top-middle) in the output grid to white (0).
        ii.  Set the pixel at `(r+1, c)` (left-middle) in the output grid to white (0).
        iii. Set the pixel at `(r+1, c+2)` (right-middle) in the output grid to white (0).
        iv.  Set the pixel at `(r+2, c+1)` (bottom-middle) in the output grid to white (0).
        v.   Ensure the pixels at `(r, c)`, `(r, c+2)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+2, c)`, and `(r+2, c+2)` in the output grid retain the original color `C` (they should already have it from the initial copy, but this confirms the intent).
4.  After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, the output grid contains the final transformed image. Return the output grid.
