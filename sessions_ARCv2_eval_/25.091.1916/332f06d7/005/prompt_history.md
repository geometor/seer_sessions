*   **Perception:** The task involves conditional color replacement based on the input grid's properties. The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0). White pixels always change to blue (1). Red pixels change to white (0) only if a specific condition related to the grid's size is met. Other colors, like blue (1) and green (3), are present but remain unchanged and do not seem to directly influence the transformation rule, except potentially as context that was considered during analysis. The key insight is identifying that the grid dimensions act as the condition for the transformation of red pixels.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - height: integer between 1 and 30
          - width: integer between 1 and 30
          - pixels: colored cells with values 0-9
      - element: pixel_color_white
        value: 0
        transformation: changes to blue (1)
        condition: always
      - element: pixel_color_red
        value: 2
        transformation: changes to white (0)
        condition: depends on grid size
    conditions:
      - condition_name: grid_size_check
        property: grid dimensions (height H, width W)
        rule: (H < 14) AND (W < 14)
    relationships:
      - The transformation rule for red pixels (2) is gated by the grid_size_check condition.
      - If grid_size_check is true, red pixels change to white (0).
      - If grid_size_check is false, red pixels remain red (2).
      - The transformation rule for white pixels (0) is independent and always results in blue (1).
      - All other pixel colors remain unchanged.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    3.  Evaluate the condition: Is H less than 14 AND W less than 14?
    4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row, column):
        a.  Get the color value `C` of the input cell.
        b.  If `C` is 0 (white), set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 1 (blue).
        c.  Else if `C` is 2 (red):
            i.  If the condition (H < 14 AND W < 14) is true, set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 0 (white).
            ii. If the condition is false, set the corresponding cell in the new grid to 2 (red).
        d.  Else (for any other color `C`), set the corresponding cell in the new grid to `C`.
    5.  The new grid is the output.

## Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis identified a conditional transformation based on grid size (H < 14 and W < 14). White(0) always changes to Blue(1). For small grids, Red(2) changes to White(0). For large grids, the initial hypothesis was that Blue(1) changes to White(0), but the results showed this was incorrect (Examples 2 and 3 failed).

The failures occurred in the large grid examples (H >= 14 or W >= 14). In these cases, the transformation of Blue(1) to White(0) is not universal but selective. By comparing the input and output grids for Examples 2 and 3, a new pattern emerged: Blue(1) pixels seem to change to White(0) only when they are "internal" to a blue region, specifically when all their 8 neighbors are either Blue(1) or the background Green(3). Red(2) pixels remain unchanged in large grids.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rules into two distinct cases based on the grid size condition (H < 14 AND W < 14) and implement the specific neighbor-checking logic for Blue(1) pixels in the large grid case.

## Metrics

Let's confirm the grid dimensions for each example using code execution.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Dimensions of inputs for each training example
dims = {
    "train_1": (12, 12),
    "train_2": (14, 14),
    "train_3": (16, 16),
    "train_4": (10, 10),
}

results = {}
for name, (H, W) in dims.items():
    is_small = H < 14 and W < 14
    results[name] = {"H": H, "W": W, "is_small": is_small}

print(results)
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
{'train_1': {'H': 12, 'W': 12, 'is_small': True}, 'train_2': {'H': 14, 'W': 14, 'is_small': False}, 'train_3': {'H': 16, 'W': 16, 'is_small': False}, 'train_4': {'H': 10, 'W': 10, 'is_small': True}}

```
The metrics confirm the split:
*   Examples 1 and 4 are "small" grids (H<14 and W<14 is True).
*   Examples 2 and 3 are "large" grids (H<14 and W<14 is False).

This supports the two-case structure for the transformation rules.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - height: H (integer between 1 and 30)
      - width: W (integer between 1 and 30)
      - pixels: colored cells with values 0-9
  - element: pixel_color_white
    value: 0
    transformation: changes to Blue(1)
    condition: always, regardless of grid size
  - element: pixel_color_red
    value: 2
    transformation: changes to White(0)
    condition: grid is small (H < 14 AND W < 14)
  - element: pixel_color_red
    value: 2
    transformation: remains Red(2) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: remains Blue(1) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is small (H < 14 AND W < 14)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: changes to White(0)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14) AND all 8 neighbors are either Blue(1) or Green(3)
  - element: pixel_color_blue
    value: 1
    transformation: remains Blue(1) (unchanged)
    condition: grid is large (H >= 14 OR W >= 14) AND at least one neighbor is NOT Blue(1) and NOT Green(3)
  - element: other_pixel_colors
    value: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    transformation: remain unchanged
    condition: always
relationships:
  - The transformation logic depends entirely on a grid size check: (Height < 14 AND Width < 14).
  - Two distinct sets of rules apply based on whether the grid is 'small' or 'large'.
  - White(0) pixels are always transformed to Blue(1).
  - Red(2) pixels are transformed only in small grids.
  - Blue(1) pixels are transformed (conditionally based on neighbors) only in large grids.
  - Green(3) acts as a contextual color for the Blue(1) transformation in large grids but is otherwise unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid as a copy of the input grid. This handles pixels that remain unchanged by default.
3.  Check if the grid is "small": `is_small = (H < 14 AND W < 14)`.
4.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at position (row, column):
    a.  Get the color value `C` of the input cell.
    b.  **Rule 1 (Universal):** If `C` is 0 (White), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 1 (Blue).
    c.  **Rule 2 (Small Grid Specific):** If `is_small` is true AND `C` is 2 (Red), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0 (White).
    d.  **Rule 3 (Large Grid Specific):** If `is_small` is false AND `C` is 1 (Blue):
        i.  Examine all 8 neighbors (adjacent and diagonal) of the current cell in the *input* grid. Be careful with boundary conditions (stay within grid limits).
        ii. Count how many neighbors have a color value that is *not* 1 (Blue) and *not* 3 (Green).
        iii. If this count is 0 (meaning all neighbors are either Blue(1) or Green(3)), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0 (White).
        iv. Otherwise (if at least one neighbor is neither Blue(1) nor Green(3)), the cell remains Blue(1) (already handled by the initial copy).
    e.  (Implicit) If none of the above conditions match, the pixel color remains unchanged (handled by the initial copy).
5.  The final output grid contains the transformed pixels.
