transformations:
  - applies_to: White (0) pixels
    condition: Always (regardless of grid category)
    action: Change color to Blue (1).
  - applies_to: Red (2) pixels
    condition: Grid category is Small.
    action: Change color to White (0).
  - applies_to: Red (2) pixels
    condition: Grid category is Large.
    action: No change.
  - applies_to: Blue (1) pixels
    condition: Grid category is Small.
    action: No change.
  - applies_to: Blue (1) pixels
    condition: Grid category is Large.
    action: Change color to White (0) IF the pixel is part of a solid rectangular block of Blue(1)s AND all cells immediately neighboring this block's perimeter (including diagonals) in the input grid are either Blue(1) or Green(3). Otherwise, no change.
  - applies_to: Green (3) pixels
    condition: Always.
    action: No change.
  - applies_to: Other (4-9) pixels
    condition: Always.
    action: No change.

objects:
  - type: Solid Rectangular Block
    composed_of: Blue (1) pixels
    relevance: Subject to transformation in Large grids based on neighbor conditions.

neighbor_condition (for Blue rectangles in Large grids):
  - requirement: All cells adjacent to the perimeter of the Blue(1) rectangle must be Blue(1) or Green(3).
  - scope: Checks 8 directions (including diagonals) around the entire perimeter.
