**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified that White(0) pixels always become Blue(1) and that grid dimensions play a role. The distinction between "small" grids (H<14 and W<14) and "large" grids (H>=14 or W>=14) appears valid. The rule for small grids (Red(2) -> White(0)) worked correctly for Examples 1 and 4.

The failures occurred in the large grid examples (2 and 3). The previous assumption about the transformation of Blue(1) pixels in large grids (based on neighbor checks for individual pixels) was incorrect. It resulted in too many Blue(1) pixels being changed to White(0).

The key insight seems to be related to specific *shapes* within the grid. In the large grid examples, only solid rectangular blocks composed entirely of Blue(1) pixels, whose immediate surrounding neighbors (perimeter cells) are all either Blue(1) or Green(3), are transformed to White(0).

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the grid dimension categories.
2.  Refine the rules based on the small/large grid distinction.
3.  For large grids, implement logic to:
    *   Identify all possible solid rectangular blocks consisting solely of Blue(1) pixels.
    *   For each such rectangle, check the colors of all cells directly adjacent to its perimeter (including diagonals).
    *   If all these neighboring cells are either Blue(1) or Green(3) in the *input* grid, then change the pixels within that rectangular block to White(0) in the *output* grid.
4.  Ensure the White(0) -> Blue(1) rule applies universally.
5.  Ensure the Red(2) -> White(0) rule applies only to small grids.
6.  Ensure Red(2) pixels and other colors remain unchanged in large grids, except for the specific Blue(1) rectangles identified above.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Determine the grid category: "Small" if H < 14 and W < 14, otherwise "Large".
4.  **First Pass (Universal White Transformation):** Iterate through every cell (r, c) of the input grid. If the input pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is White(0), set the corresponding output pixel `output_grid[r, c]` to Blue(1).
5.  **Second Pass (Category-Specific Transformations):**
    a.  **If the grid category is "Small":**
        i.  Iterate through every cell (r, c). If the input pixel `input_grid[r, c]` is Red(2), set the corresponding output pixel `output_grid[r, c]` to White(0). *(Note: White pixels were already handled in the first pass)*.
    b.  **If the grid category is "Large":**
        i.  Identify all possible solid rectangular blocks composed entirely of Blue(1) pixels in the *input* grid. Iterate through potential top-left corners (r1, c1) and bottom-right corners (r2, c2).
        ii. For each potential rectangle defined by `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`:
            1.  Verify it contains *only* Blue(1) pixels in the `input_grid`.
            2.  If it's a solid Blue(1) rectangle, check all its neighboring cells in the `input_grid`. A neighbor is any cell `(nr, nc)` such that `r1-1 <= nr <= r2+1` and `c1-1 <= nc <= c2+1`, excluding the cells within the rectangle itself (`r1 <= nr <= r2` and `c1 <= nc <= c2`). Handle boundary conditions (neighbors outside the grid do not invalidate the condition).
            3.  Check if *all* valid neighboring cells have a color of Blue(1) or Green(3).
            4.  If the neighbor condition is met, iterate through all cells `(r, c)` within this rectangle (`r1 <= r <= r2`, `c1 <= c <= c2`) and set the corresponding `output_grid[r, c]` pixel to White(0). *(Important: This overwrites the Blue(1) value copied initially or potentially set in the first pass if the original was White(0) - although 0->1 is handled first, so this shouldn't be an issue)*.
6.  The final `output_grid` contains the result.
