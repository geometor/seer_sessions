*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified that white (0) pixels change to blue (1) and that grid dimensions play a role. However, it incorrectly assumed the grid size condition *only* applied to red (2) pixels and that white (0) always changed to blue (1). The failing examples (`train_2`, `train_3`) reveal a more complex interaction: the transformation rule itself changes based on whether the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W) are both less than 14. In larger grids (H>=14 or W>=14), the roles of white (0) and blue (1) pixels seem to swap compared to smaller grids, while red (2) pixels remain unchanged.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Calculate the dimensions (H, W) for each training example.
    2.  Re-analyze the pixel transformations in each example, specifically comparing the behavior in grids where `H < 14 and W < 14` versus those where `H >= 14 or W >= 14`.
    3.  Formulate two distinct sets of transformation rules based on this size condition.
    4.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect these two conditional rule sets.

*   **Metrics:**
