            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis identified a conditional transformation based on grid size (H < 14 and W < 14). White(0) always changes to Blue(1). For small grids, Red(2) changes to White(0). For large grids, the initial hypothesis was that Blue(1) changes to White(0), but the results showed this was incorrect (Examples 2 and 3 failed).\n\nThe failures occurred in the large grid examples (H >= 14 or W >= 14). In these cases, the transformation of Blue(1) to White(0) is not universal but selective. By comparing the input and output grids for Examples 2 and 3, a new pattern emerged: Blue(1) pixels seem to change to White(0) only when they are \"internal\" to a blue region, specifically when all their 8 neighbors are either Blue(1) or the background Green(3). Red(2) pixels remain unchanged in large grids.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rules into two distinct cases based on the grid size condition (H < 14 AND W < 14) and implement the specific neighbor-checking logic for Blue(1) pixels in the large grid case.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's confirm the grid dimensions for each example using code execution.\n\n"
