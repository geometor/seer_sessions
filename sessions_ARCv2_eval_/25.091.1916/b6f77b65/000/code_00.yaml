Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: 12x12 (consistent across examples)
  - background_color: white (0)

Control Element:
  - type: pixel
  - location: top-left corner (0, 0)
  - function: determines the transformation parameters (shift vector)
  - persistence: the control pixel at (0, 0) remains unchanged in the output.

Transformation:
  - type: translation (shift)
  - scope: applies to all pixels except the background (0) and the control pixel at (0, 0).
  - vector_determination: depends on the color value of the control pixel.
  - observed_mappings:
      - control_color: 9 (maroon) -> shift_vector: (0, 0)  # (delta_row, delta_col)
      - control_color: 4 (yellow) -> shift_vector: (3, 0)  # Down by 3 rows
      - control_color: 6 (magenta) -> shift_vector: (2, -3) # Down by 2 rows, Left by 3 columns
      - control_color: 7 (orange) -> shift_vector: (5, 2)  # Down by 5 rows, Right by 2 columns
  - boundary_handling: pixels shifted outside the grid dimensions are discarded.
  - vacated_area_fill: areas left empty by the shift are filled with the background_color (white, 0).

Objects:
  - The non-background pixels form distinct shapes/objects.
  - These objects are translated rigidly as part of the overall grid shift.
