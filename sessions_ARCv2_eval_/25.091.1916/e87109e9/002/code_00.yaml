task_context:
  description: "Perform a flood fill operation on a specific subgrid of the input."
  input_dimensionality: 2D
  output_dimensionality: 2D
  input_size: (25, 25)
  output_size: (19, 24)

input_elements:
  - type: header_section
    location: Rows 0-5, Columns 0-24
    role: Discarded informational content (palette).
  - type: boundary_column
    location: Rows 6-24, Column 0
    role: Discarded boundary/padding.
  - type: canvas_subgrid
    location: Rows 6-24, Columns 1-24
    role: The area where the transformation occurs. Corresponds directly to the output grid dimensions.

objects_in_canvas:
  - type: seed_pixel
    color: Azure (8)
    role: Starting point for the fill operation.
    properties: Fixed position within the initial canvas_subgrid.
  - type: background_pixel
    color: Dynamically identified (most frequent color in canvas_subgrid excluding Azure 8).
    role: Target pixel type for the fill operation.
    properties: Changes color to Azure (8) if reachable by the flood fill.
  - type: barrier_pixel
    color: Any color in canvas_subgrid that is NOT the background_color and NOT Azure (8).
    role: Obstacle that stops the flood fill.
    properties: Color remains unchanged.

actions:
  - action: extract_subgrid
    origin: Input grid
    source_location: Rows 6-24, Columns 1-24
    result: Initial state of the output grid (19x24).
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: Extracted subgrid
    method: Find the most frequent pixel value, excluding Azure (8).
    output: The background_color value.
  - action: identify_seeds
    input: Extracted subgrid
    method: Find coordinates of all pixels with Azure (8).
    output: List of seed coordinates.
  - action: flood_fill
    target_grid: Extracted subgrid (modified in-place or copied).
    start_points: Seed coordinates.
    fill_color: Azure (8)
    target_color: Identified background_color.
    rules:
      - Fill proceeds in 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
      - Only adjacent pixels matching the target_color are filled.
      - Fill stops at grid boundaries.
      - Fill stops at pixels that are not the target_color (barrier_pixels).
    result: Final state of the output grid.

output_specification:
  source: The result of the flood_fill action on the extracted_subgrid.
  dimensions: 19x24.
