            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently have a distinct structure:\n    *   A top section (first 6 rows) acting as a header or palette. This section is bordered by gray (5) pixels and contains smaller squares, each with a gray border, a unique color sample (like blue, magenta, yellow, red), and a white interior. This section seems informational and not part of the direct transformation canvas.\n    *   A bottom section (rows 6 onwards) acting as the main canvas or drawing area. This area has a dominant background color and contains various shapes or objects made of different colors, including small squares of azure (8).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids (19x24 vs 25x25). They correspond dimensionally to the bottom section of the input grid, excluding the first column (input rows 6-24, columns 1-24). The top header/palette section of the input is completely absent in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation occurs within the bottom section (drawing area) of the input grid.\n    *   The azure (8) pixels present in the initial drawing area act as starting points or \"seeds\".\n    *   A specific color within the drawing area acts as the \"background\" that gets painted over. This background color varies between examples (green in train_1, blue in train_2, orange in train_3). It appears to be the most prevalent color in the drawing area, excluding the initial azure pixels.\n    *   The azure color (8) \"expands\" or \"fills\" outwards from the initial seed pixels in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n    *   This expansion only affects pixels matching the identified background color.\n    *   The expansion stops when it hits the grid boundaries or any pixel whose color is *not* the background color. Other colored shapes within the drawing area act as barriers to the azure expansion.\n4.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   Gray (5): Used as a border/separator in the input's header section. Does not appear in the transformation logic itself.\n    *   White (0): Used as filler within the palette squares in the input's header.\n    *   Azure (8): The \"paint\" color and the initial \"seed\" color for the transformation.\n    *   Other colors (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Magenta, Orange, etc.): Can form shapes/objects within the drawing area that act as barriers to the azure expansion, or can be the background color itself.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Drawing Grid:** Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting from row index 6 down to the last row, and from column index 1 across to the last column. Let this be the `working_grid`. The dimensions of `working_grid` will be 19x24.\n2.  **Identify Background Color:** Analyze the `working_grid` to find the most frequent pixel color, ignoring any azure (8) pixels. This identified color is the `background_color`.\n3.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the `working_grid` that initially have the azure color (8). Collect their row and column coordinates into a list of `seed_pixels`.\n4.  **Initialize Expansion:** Create a copy of the `working_grid` which will become the `output_grid`. Create a queue for the expansion process and add all coordinates from `seed_pixels` to it. Also, create a set or boolean grid called `visited` (same dimensions as `working_grid`) to keep track of pixels that have been processed or are seeds; initialize it by marking all `seed_pixels` locations as visited.\n5.  **Perform Expansion (Flood Fill):**\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Remove a coordinate `(r, c)` from the front of the queue.\n        *   Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(nr, nc)`.\n        *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:\n            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the boundaries of the `output_grid`.\n            *   Check if the pixel at `output_grid[nr, nc]` currently has the `background_color`.\n            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` has *not* been marked as visited.\n            *   If all three conditions are true:\n                *   Change the color of the pixel at `output_grid[nr, nc]` to azure (8).\n                *   Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited.\n                *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the queue.\n6.  **Final Output:** Once the queue is empty, the expansion is complete. The final state of the `output_grid` is the result of the transformation."
