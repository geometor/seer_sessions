task_context:
  grid_dimensionality: 2D
  grid_size_input: 25x25 (consistent across examples)
  grid_size_output: 19x24 (consistent across examples)
  input_structure:
    - header_section:
        location: Rows 0-5
        content: Gray borders, contains color samples (palette)
        role: Informational, discarded in output
    - canvas_section:
        location: Rows 6-24
        content: Main drawing area with background color, objects, and azure seed pixels
        role: Area undergoing transformation
  output_derivation: Derived from a subgrid of the input's canvas_section
  subgrid_definition: Input rows 6-24, Input columns 1-24

objects:
  - type: seed_pixels
    color: Azure (8)
    location: Within the canvas_section of the input
    role: Starting points for expansion
  - type: background_pixels
    color: Varies (most frequent color in the initial drawing subgrid, excluding azure)
    location: Within the canvas_section of the input
    role: Pixels eligible to be changed to azure
  - type: barrier_pixels
    color: Any color except the identified background color and azure (within the drawing subgrid)
    location: Within the canvas_section of the input
    role: Pixels that block the expansion of azure

actions:
  - action: identify_subgrid
    input: Input grid
    output: Drawing grid (input[6:25, 1:25])
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: Drawing grid
    criteria: Most frequent color excluding azure (8)
    output: Background color value
  - action: identify_seed_pixels
    input: Drawing grid
    criteria: Pixels with azure color (8)
    output: List of seed pixel coordinates
  - action: expand_color
    source_pixels: Seed pixels
    target_color: Azure (8)
    affected_pixels: Background pixels
    mechanism: Flood fill or BFS outwards in 4 cardinal directions
    stopping_conditions: Grid boundaries, non-background pixels
    output: Modified drawing grid

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions (19x24) match the dimensions of the input grid's subgrid defined by rows 6-24 and columns 1-24.
  - The initial azure pixels in the subgrid determine where the expansion starts.
  - The expansion process transforms background pixels into azure pixels.
  - Non-background pixels (barriers) and grid boundaries limit the extent of the azure expansion.
