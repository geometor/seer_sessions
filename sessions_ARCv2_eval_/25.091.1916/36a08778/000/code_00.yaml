  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - color: magenta (6)

objects_input:
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    description: Typically form vertical lines (columns). Act as delimiters or barriers.
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    description: Typically form horizontal lines or rectangular blocks. Act as target regions.
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    description: Fills the remaining space, acting as a background or empty space.

transformation:
  - action: change_color
    input_object: orange (7) pixel
    output_object: magenta (6) pixel
    condition:
      type: spatial_relationship
      description: Within a single row, the orange pixel must be located horizontally between at least one magenta (6) pixel and at least one red (2) pixel.
      details:
        - For a given orange pixel at (row, col_orange):
        - There must exist a magenta pixel at (row, col_magenta).
        - There must exist a red pixel at (row, col_red).
        - The orange pixel's column index must satisfy: min(col_magenta, col_red) < col_orange < max(col_magenta, col_red).

unchanged_elements:
  - Pixels that were originally red (2) remain red (2).
  - Pixels that were originally magenta (6) remain magenta (6).
  - Orange (7) pixels that do not meet the transformation condition remain orange (7).
