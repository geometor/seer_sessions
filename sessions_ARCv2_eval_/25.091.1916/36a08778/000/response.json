Magenta pixels seem to act as barriers or markers. Red pixels seem to represent target objects or areas.\n2.  **Objects:**\n    *   Red objects: Contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels, typically horizontal lines or rectangles.\n    *   Magenta barriers: Vertical lines of magenta (6) pixels.\n    *   Orange background: The remaining areas filled with orange (7) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some orange (7) pixels to magenta (6) pixels in the output grid. The original red (2) and magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and color.\n4.  **Pattern:** The change from orange to magenta appears conditional. Specifically, an orange pixel changes to magenta if it lies horizontally *between* a magenta pixel and a red pixel within the same row. The change seems to \"fill\" the orange space bounded by a magenta barrier on one side and a red object on the other, within that specific row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
