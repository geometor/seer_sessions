The input grid always contains a background color (orange, 7) and some pixels of another color arranged in a pattern. The output grid is constructed based on analyzing 2x2 blocks within the input grid. The output grid has a tiled structure with white (0) borders separating 5x5 regions. Within each 5x5 region, a central 2x2 pattern is determined by the content of the corresponding 2x2 input block. If the 2x2 input block contains only the background orange color (7), the central 2x2 output pattern is solid orange (7). If the 2x2 input block contains *any* non-orange pixel, the central 2x2 output pattern becomes a specific checkerboard pattern of maroon (9) and orange (7). The specific non-orange color in the input does not influence the output pattern, only its presence does.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
