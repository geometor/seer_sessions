            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and contain a dominant background color (green, blue, or azure in the examples). Scattered across this background are various shapes or objects made of different colors.\n2.  **Key Feature - White Rectangle:** A crucial element in each input is a large, contiguous rectangular area filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Pixels Inside White Rectangle:** Within this white rectangle, there are a few isolated, single pixels of other colors. These colors also appear as larger objects elsewhere in the grid.\n4.  **Objects Outside White Rectangle:** Outside the white rectangle, there are distinct objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same colors found as single pixels inside the white rectangle.\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Its background is always white (color 0). The size of the output grid seems directly related to the size of the white rectangle found in the input.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to involve:\n    *   Identifying the white rectangle.\n    *   Using the single pixels *inside* the white rectangle to determine *which* colors appear in the output and *on which row* they appear (relative to the white rectangle's top edge).\n    *   Counting the number of distinct objects of that same color *outside* the white rectangle to determine *how many* pixels of that color appear on the corresponding row in the output.\n    *   Placing these colored pixels in the output grid at specific columns (1, 3, 5, etc.) on their designated row, separated by white pixels.\n    *   The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the input's white rectangle. Placement is clipped if the calculated column exceeds the grid's width.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine its height (H) and width (W).\n2.  **Prepare Output:** Create a new grid of dimensions H x W and fill it completely with white (0) pixels. This will be the output grid.\n3.  **Identify Markers:** Examine the interior of the white box found in step 1. Identify all individual pixels within this box that are *not* white. For each such \"marker\" pixel, note its color (let's call it `marker_color`) and its row number relative to the top edge of the white box (let's call it `relative_row`).\n4.  **Count External Objects:** For each unique `marker_color` identified in step 3:\n    *   Search the entire input grid *outside* the white box.\n    *   Count how many separate, connected groups of pixels (where connection includes diagonals) have the same `marker_color`. Let this count be `N`.\n5.  **Populate Output Row:** For each `marker_color` and its corresponding `relative_row` and object count `N`:\n    *   In the output grid, go to the `relative_row`.\n    *   Starting from column index 1, place `N` pixels of `marker_color`, alternating with white pixels. That is, attempt to place pixels at columns 1, 3, 5, ..., up to `2*N - 1`.\n    *   Only place a pixel if its target column index is less than the output grid's width (W). If `2*k - 1 >= W` for some `k`, stop placing pixels for this row/color combination.\n6.  **Final Result:** The populated H x W grid is the final output."
