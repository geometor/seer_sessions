## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components of the task: finding a white rectangle, using internal markers to determine row and color, and using external object counts to determine the number of pixels placed. The primary failure was likely due to library unavailability (`skimage`) or potential bugs in the custom implementations of `find_largest_rectangle` and `find_connected_components`.

The strategy moving forward is:

1.  **Refine Algorithms:** Implement robust, dependency-free versions of `find_largest_rectangle` and `find_connected_components` (using BFS/DFS).
2.  **Clarify Rules:** Ensure the definitions of "inside the white rectangle," "external object," and "connected components" (8-way) are precise. Confirm that the count of external objects is *per color*, and this count is applied to *all* rows marked by that color.
3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to extract key details from each example to confirm assumptions about rectangle size, marker locations, object counts, and output structure.

## Metrics Extraction

Let's extract metrics for each training example to solidify our understanding.
