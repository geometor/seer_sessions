"""
Identify the largest rectangular region in the input grid composed solely of white (0) pixels.
The output grid dimensions match this white rectangle.
Identify non-white 'marker' pixels within the interior of this white rectangle. Note their color and row relative to the white rectangle's top edge.
For each unique marker color found, count the number of distinct connected objects (8-way connectivity, including diagonals) of that same color located entirely outside the white rectangle in the input grid.
In the output grid, for each marker color, go to its corresponding relative row. Place pixels of the marker color starting at column 1, then column 3, column 5, etc., for the number of external objects counted. Alternate columns are kept white. Stop placing pixels if the column index goes beyond the output grid's width.
