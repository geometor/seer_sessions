Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and contain a dominant background color (green, blue, or azure in the examples). Scattered across this background are various shapes or objects made of different colors.
2.  **Key Feature - White Rectangle:** A crucial element in each input is a large, contiguous rectangular area filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
3.  **Pixels Inside White Rectangle:** Within this white rectangle, there are a few isolated, single pixels of other colors. These colors also appear as larger objects elsewhere in the grid.
4.  **Objects Outside White Rectangle:** Outside the white rectangle, there are distinct objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same colors found as single pixels inside the white rectangle.
5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Its background is always white (color 0). The size of the output grid seems directly related to the size of the white rectangle found in the input.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to involve:
    *   Identifying the white rectangle.
    *   Using the single pixels *inside* the white rectangle to determine *which* colors appear in the output and *on which row* they appear (relative to the white rectangle's top edge).
    *   Counting the number of distinct objects of that same color *outside* the white rectangle to determine *how many* pixels of that color appear on the corresponding row in the output.
    *   Placing these colored pixels in the output grid at specific columns (1, 3, 5, etc.) on their designated row, separated by white pixels.
    *   The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the input's white rectangle. Placement is clipped if the calculated column exceeds the grid's width.

## Facts

      For k from 1 to N:

        If c_out < W (width of output_grid):
          Set output_grid[r_rel][c_out] = C.
    output: modified output_grid

workflow:
  - step: 1. identify_white_rectangle from input_grid.
  - step: 2. initialize_output grid based on white_rectangle dimensions (H, W).
  - step: 3. find_marker_pixels inside the white_rectangle.
  - step: 4. For each unique marker_pixel (C, r_rel):
      a. count_external_objects (N) of color C outside the white_rectangle.
      b. place_pixels_in_output grid at row r_rel using color C and count N, clipping columns if they exceed W-1.
  - step: 5. Return the final output_grid.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Find the White Box:** Locate the largest rectangular region in the input grid that consists entirely of white (0) pixels. Determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  **Prepare Output:** Create a new grid of dimensions H x W and fill it completely with white (0) pixels. This will be the output grid.
3.  **Identify Markers:** Examine the interior of the white box found in step 1. Identify all individual pixels within this box that are *not* white. For each such "marker" pixel, note its color (let's call it `marker_color`) and its row number relative to the top edge of the white box (let's call it `relative_row`).
4.  **Count External Objects:** For each unique `marker_color` identified in step 3:
    *   Search the entire input grid *outside* the white box.
    *   Count how many separate, connected groups of pixels (where connection includes diagonals) have the same `marker_color`. Let this count be `N`.
5.  **Populate Output Row:** For each `marker_color` and its corresponding `relative_row` and object count `N`:
    *   In the output grid, go to the `relative_row`.
    *   Starting from column index 1, place `N` pixels of `marker_color`, alternating with white pixels. That is, attempt to place pixels at columns 1, 3, 5, ..., up to `2*N - 1`.
    *   Only place a pixel if its target column index is less than the output grid's width (W). If `2*k - 1 >= W` for some `k`, stop placing pixels for this row/color combination.
6.  **Final Result:** The populated H x W grid is the final output.

"""
Identify the largest rectangular region in the input grid composed solely of white (0) pixels.
The output grid dimensions match this white rectangle.
Identify non-white 'marker' pixels within the interior of this white rectangle. Note their color and row relative to the white rectangle's top edge.
For each unique marker color found, count the number of distinct connected objects (8-way connectivity, including diagonals) of that same color located entirely outside the white rectangle in the input grid.
In the output grid, for each marker color, go to its corresponding relative row. Place pixels of the marker color starting at column 1, then column 3, column 5, etc., for the number of external objects counted. Alternate columns are kept white. Stop placing pixels if the column index goes beyond the output grid's width.
