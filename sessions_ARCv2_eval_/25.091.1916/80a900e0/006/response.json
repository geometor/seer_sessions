            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempts to implement a propagation simulation where specific colors (Red, Yellow, Azure) \"flow\" downwards from their starting positions, overwriting background pixels (White, Blue) while respecting obstacles (Green). The simulation iterates until a stable state is reached.\n\nThe results show that the implementation leads to excessive propagation, where colors spread much further than intended in the examples. The core issue seems to lie in the condition check for valid propagation targets (`is_valid_target`). The check needs to ensure that a target cell meets *all* the following criteria *simultaneously* within the context of the current iteration:\n1.  Is within the grid boundaries.\n2.  Was *originally* a background color (0 or 1) in the input grid.\n3.  Is *currently* a background color (0 or 1) in the grid state *at the beginning of the current iteration*.\n4.  Has not *already* been claimed as a target by another pixel's propagation *within the same iteration step* (this is handled by writing to `next_output_grid` and checking its state).\n\nThe previous code's `is_valid_target` checked conditions 1, 2, and 4 but missed condition 3 (checking the state at the beginning of the iteration, `output_grid`). This likely allowed propagation into cells that had already been overwritten by propagated colors in previous iterations, causing the uncontrolled spread.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the `is_valid_target` function (or the logic directly within the loops) to incorporate the check against the `output_grid` (the state at the start of the iteration) in addition to the `input_np` check.\n2.  Ensure the Red/Yellow logic correctly implements the \"try down first, *if invalid*, try diagonal\" rule. \"Invalid\" must incorporate all conditions mentioned above.\n3.  Verify Azure logic propagates independently down-left and down-right, subject to the same validity checks for each direction.\n4.  Retain the iterative approach using `output_grid` and `next_output_grid` and the `np.array_equal` check for stability.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n"
