**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
2.  **Background Pattern:** A prominent checkerboard pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels forms the background in the input grids.
3.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Other colors (green=3, azure=8, red=2, yellow=4) appear as individual pixels or small clusters on top of the checkerboard background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement or propagation of certain foreground colors downwards, while others remain static. The background pattern is overwritten by the moving colors along their paths.
5.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**
    *   Green (3) pixels are static obstacles; they do not move and are not overwritten.
    *   Red (2) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-left.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-right.
    *   Azure (8) pixels propagate simultaneously down-left and down-right.
6.  **Propagation Rule:** The moving/propagating pixels only overwrite cells that were originally part of the blue/white checkerboard background. They stop when they hit the grid boundary, a static green pixel, or a cell already occupied by another propagated pixel from the same or a different source.
7.  **Iteration:** The propagation process seems iterative, continuing until all mobile pixels have reached a stable position (boundary, obstacle, or occupied cell).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width
    - background: checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and white (0)
    - foreground_pixels: scattered pixels of other colors (green, red, yellow, azure)

Pixels:
  Types:
    - Background: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - Static: [green (3)]
      - Properties: remains in original position, acts as an obstacle
    - Mobile/Propagating: [red (2), yellow (4), azure (8)]
      - Properties: propagates downwards, overwrites background pixels

Actions:
  - Propagation:
    - Condition: Applies to Mobile pixels (red, yellow, azure).
    - Trigger: A pixel of a mobile color exists at cell (r, c).
    - Rule: The pixel's color potentially propagates to adjacent cells in the row below (r+1).
    - Target_Condition: Propagation only occurs into cells that were originally background pixels (blue or white) in the input grid.
    - Color_Rules:
      - Red (2):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c-1).
        - Paints target cell red (2) if propagation successful.
      - Yellow (4):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c+1).
        - Paints target cell yellow (4) if propagation successful.
      - Azure (8):
        - Tries (r+1, c-1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful.
        - Tries (r+1, c+1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful. (These happen independently/simultaneously based on the source pixel at (r, c)).
    - Iteration: The propagation process repeats until no more pixels can propagate in a full pass over the grid.

Output_Grid:
  - Starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Background pixels are potentially overwritten by propagating colors.
  - Static (green) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Final state reflects the settled positions of all propagated colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a static reference copy of the input grid to remember the original state, especially which cells were background (blue or white).
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the output grid until a full pass results in no changes:
    a.  For each row `r` from 0 to height-2 (iterate top-down):
    b.  For each column `c` from 0 to width-1:
    c.  Examine the pixel color `P` at `output[r, c]`.
    d.  **If `P` is Red (2):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-left: `target = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).
    e.  **If `P` is Yellow (4):**
        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-right: `target = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).
    f.  **If `P` is Azure (8):**
        i.  Check the cell down-left: `target_left = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target_left` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_left]` to Azure (8).
        ii. Check the cell down-right: `target_right = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target_right` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_right]` to Azure (8). (Note: Both checks are performed independently based on the state of `output[r, c]`).
4.  Once an iteration completes with no changes made to the output grid, the process is finished. Return the final output grid.
```python

"""
Transforms an input grid based on color-specific propagation rules over a checkerboard background.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify background pixels (blue=1, white=0) from the original input grid.
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixels can propagate further in a full pass:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state based on the current state.
    b.  For each pixel in the current grid:
        i.  If the pixel is Red (2):
            - Try to propagate Red to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Red in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Red to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1) under the same conditions.
        ii. If the pixel is Yellow (4):
            - Try to propagate Yellow to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Yellow in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Yellow to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1) under the same conditions.
        iii. If the pixel is Azure (8):
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid.
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid. (These are independent attempts).
    c.  Update the main grid with the next state.
    d.  If no changes were made in this pass, terminate the iteration.
4.  Return the final grid state. Green (3) pixels are static and act as blockers but are never overwritten.

"""
Transforms an input grid based on color-specific propagation rules over a checkerboard background.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify background pixels (blue=1, white=0) from the original input grid.
3.  Repeatedly iterate through the grid until no pixels can propagate further in a full pass:
    a.  Create a temporary grid for the next state based on the current state.
    b.  For each pixel in the current grid:
        i.  If the pixel is Red (2):
            - Try to propagate Red to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Red in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Red to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1) under the same conditions.
        ii. If the pixel is Yellow (4):
            - Try to propagate Yellow to the cell directly below (r+1, c).
            - If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Yellow in the next state grid.
            - If propagation straight down fails, try propagating Yellow to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1) under the same conditions.
        iii. If the pixel is Azure (8):
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-left (r+1, c-1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid.
            - Try to propagate Azure to the cell down-right (r+1, c+1). If the target cell is within bounds, was originally background, and is currently background in the next state grid, change it to Azure in the next state grid. (These are independent attempts).
    c.  Update the main grid with the next state.
    d.  If no changes were made in this pass, terminate the iteration.
4.  Return the final grid state. Green (3) pixels are static and act as blockers but are never overwritten.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implementation based on the first example produced incorrect results for both training examples. The core misunderstanding was the nature of the transformation: it's not simply propagation/copying of colors downwards, but rather a *movement* of specific colored pixels (Red, Yellow, Azure) step-by-step, where the pixel vacates its original position (which reverts to its original background color) and occupies a new position determined by color-specific rules, provided the target position is currently background. Static Green pixels act as obstacles. The process iterates until no more pixels can move.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-analyze the examples focusing on the start and end positions of mobile pixels and the state of their original locations in the output.
2.  Confirm that Red (2) tries to move down, then down-left. Yellow (4) tries to move down, then down-right. Azure (8) tries to move *both* down-left and down-right in each step.
3.  Verify that movement only occurs into cells that are currently background (Blue=1 or White=0).
4.  Confirm that when a pixel moves, its original cell reverts to the background color it had in the *initial* input grid.
5.  Implement an iterative simulation where, in each step, all potential valid moves are identified based on the current grid state. Then, these moves are executed simultaneously (handling conflicts where multiple pixels target the same cell), updating the grid for the next iteration. The original position is cleared *after* the move is confirmed.
6.  Use a stable iteration approach (e.g., calculating all moves based on state N, then applying them to create state N+1) to avoid cascading effects within a single iteration.
7.  Address conflicts: If multiple pixels attempt to move into the same target cell in one iteration step, a consistent rule is needed. Processing pixels row-by-row (top-down) provides a natural priority, potentially resolving conflicts implicitly. A pixel attempting to move into a cell already claimed by a higher-priority pixel in the same step will fail.
