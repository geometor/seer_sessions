Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width
    - background: checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and white (0)
    - foreground_pixels: scattered pixels of other colors (green, red, yellow, azure)

Pixels:
  Types:
    - Background: [blue (1), white (0)]
    - Static: [green (3)]
      - Properties: remains in original position, acts as an obstacle
    - Mobile/Propagating: [red (2), yellow (4), azure (8)]
      - Properties: propagates downwards, overwrites background pixels

Actions:
  - Propagation:
    - Condition: Applies to Mobile pixels (red, yellow, azure).
    - Trigger: A pixel of a mobile color exists at cell (r, c).
    - Rule: The pixel's color potentially propagates to adjacent cells in the row below (r+1).
    - Target_Condition: Propagation only occurs into cells that were originally background pixels (blue or white) in the input grid.
    - Color_Rules:
      - Red (2):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c-1).
        - Paints target cell red (2) if propagation successful.
      - Yellow (4):
        - Tries (r+1, c).
        - If blocked or non-background, tries (r+1, c+1).
        - Paints target cell yellow (4) if propagation successful.
      - Azure (8):
        - Tries (r+1, c-1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful.
        - Tries (r+1, c+1). Paints target cell azure (8) if successful. (These happen independently/simultaneously based on the source pixel at (r, c)).
    - Iteration: The propagation process repeats until no more pixels can propagate in a full pass over the grid.

Output_Grid:
  - Starts as a copy of the input grid.
  - Background pixels are potentially overwritten by propagating colors.
  - Static (green) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Final state reflects the settled positions of all propagated colors.
