            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background Pattern:** A prominent checkerboard pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels forms the background in the input grids.\n3.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Other colors (green=3, azure=8, red=2, yellow=4) appear as individual pixels or small clusters on top of the checkerboard background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the movement or propagation of certain foreground colors downwards, while others remain static. The background pattern is overwritten by the moving colors along their paths.\n5.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**\n    *   Green (3) pixels are static obstacles; they do not move and are not overwritten.\n    *   Red (2) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-left.\n    *   Yellow (4) pixels move/propagate downwards. If directly below is blocked (or not background), they try to move/propagate down-right.\n    *   Azure (8) pixels propagate simultaneously down-left and down-right.\n6.  **Propagation Rule:** The moving/propagating pixels only overwrite cells that were originally part of the blue/white checkerboard background. They stop when they hit the grid boundary, a static green pixel, or a cell already occupied by another propagated pixel from the same or a different source.\n7.  **Iteration:** The propagation process seems iterative, continuing until all mobile pixels have reached a stable position (boundary, obstacle, or occupied cell).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a static reference copy of the input grid to remember the original state, especially which cells were background (blue or white).\n3.  Repeatedly iterate through the output grid until a full pass results in no changes:\n    a.  For each row `r` from 0 to height-2 (iterate top-down):\n    b.  For each column `c` from 0 to width-1:\n    c.  Examine the pixel color `P` at `output[r, c]`.\n    d.  **If `P` is Red (2):**\n        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).\n        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-left: `target = (r+1, c-1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Red (2).\n    e.  **If `P` is Yellow (4):**\n        i.  Check the cell directly below: `target = (r+1, c)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).\n        ii. Else (if straight down is blocked or invalid), check the cell down-right: `target = (r+1, c+1)`. If `target` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target]` to Yellow (4).\n    f.  **If `P` is Azure (8):**\n        i.  Check the cell down-left: `target_left = (r+1, c-1)`.

If `target_right` is within grid bounds AND the corresponding cell in the *reference input grid* is background (blue or white), change `output[target_right]` to Azure (8).
