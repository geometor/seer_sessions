**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels (colors 0-9). The grid dimensions remain the same from input to output in each example.
2.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain various objects:
    *   Single pixels of different colors (Red, Green, Gray).
    *   Small squares (Magenta 2x2).
    *   More complex shapes (Blue L-shape in train_2, Yellow 4x4 hollow square in train_3).
3.  **Output Objects:** The output grids also contain various objects, primarily geometric shapes:
    *   Solid squares (Gray 2x2).
    *   Hollow squares (Yellow 4x4, Blue 3x3).
    *   Unchanged squares (Magenta 2x2).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying specific objects in the input and replacing them (or generating corresponding objects) in the output grid. The output grid appears to be constructed based on these transformations, rather than modifying the input grid in place.
5.  **Object Mapping:**
    *   Single Red (2) pixels seem to generate Yellow (4) 4x4 hollow squares.
    *   Single Green (3) pixels seem to generate Blue (1) 3x3 hollow squares.
    *   Single Gray (5) pixels seem to generate Gray (5) 2x2 solid squares.
    *   Magenta (6) 2x2 squares seem to persist unchanged.
6.  **Positional Logic:**
    *   For Red -> Yellow and Gray -> Gray transformations, the top-left corner of the output shape appears at the location of the input single pixel.
    *   For Green -> Blue transformations, the position depends on the input pixel's coordinates (r, c): If both r and c are odd, the output Blue square's top-left is at (r+1, c+1); otherwise, it's at (r, c). (Observed by comparing train_1 and train_2).
    *   Magenta 2x2 squares remain in their original position.
7.  **Ignored Objects:** Not all input objects result in an output object. Specifically:
    *   The Blue L-shape (train_2) is ignored.
    *   The Yellow 4x4 hollow square (train_3) is ignored.
    *   Certain single pixels are also ignored, even though they match the color rules (e.g., Gray(5,5) and Green(11,2) in train_1; Green(9,9) in train_2; Red(4,4) in train_3). The reason for ignoring these specific single pixels is not immediately clear from the examples, but the transformation rules seem to apply only to the *other* single pixels of those colors.
