- task: fill_enclosed_squares
- feature: color_frequency_analysis
  description: Identify a unique color present only once in the input grid.
  target_color_property: unique_occurrence
  role: fill_color
- feature: identify_patterns
  description: Locate all 2x2 squares consisting entirely of white pixels (0).
  target_pattern: 2x2_square
  target_pattern_color: white (0)
  role: potential_fill_area
- feature: define_trigger_colors
  description: Determine which colors can trigger the fill operation.
  triggering_colors: [red (2), green (3), gray (5)] # Based on examples
  non_triggering_colors: [white (0), blue (1), fill_color]
  role: frame_colors
- feature: neighborhood_analysis
  description: For each 2x2 white square, analyze its 8 immediate neighbors.
  condition: Count the number of neighbors whose color is one of the frame_colors.
  threshold: 3
  role: fill_condition_check
- action: conditional_fill
  description: If the fill condition (>= 3 frame color neighbors) is met for a 2x2 white square, change the color of all 4 pixels in that square to the fill_color.
  input: 2x2_white_square
  condition: neighbor_count >= 3
  output: 2x2_square_filled_with_fill_color
- output_grid: preservation
  description: Pixels not part of a filled 2x2 square retain their original color from the input grid.
