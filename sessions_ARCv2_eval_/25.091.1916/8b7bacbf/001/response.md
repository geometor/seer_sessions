"""
This transformation identifies a unique color (excluding white) in the input grid, 
which serves as a 'fill color'. It then locates all 2x2 squares composed entirely of 
white pixels (0). For each such white square, it examines the 8 neighboring pixels. 
If 3 or more of these neighbors belong to a defined set of 'frame colors' (all colors 
present except white, blue, and the fill color), the 2x2 white square in the output 
grid is filled with the unique 'fill color'. All other pixels retain their 
original color.
