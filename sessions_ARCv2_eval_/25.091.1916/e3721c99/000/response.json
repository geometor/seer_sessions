            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task provided in `train_1`.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (30x30).\n2.  **Separator:** A distinct horizontal line of blue pixels (1) exists at row index 5, dividing the grid into an upper 'key' section and a lower 'work' section. This separator remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Key Section:** The upper section contains four distinct objects, each with a unique color and shape:\n    *   Yellow (4): A 3x3 solid square.\n    *   Green (3): A 3x3 square with the center pixel missing.\n    *   Blue (1): A 3x5 rectangle with holes in the middle row.\n    *   Red (2): A 3x7 rectangle with holes in the middle row.\n    These key objects remain unchanged in the output. They serve as a legend or template.\n4.  **Work Section:** The lower section contains multiple scattered objects made of gray pixels (5).\n5.  **Transformation:** In the output grid, the key objects and the blue separator line are identical to the input. However, all the gray objects in the lower section have been replaced (recolored). Each gray object takes on the color of one of the key objects (Yellow, Green, Blue, or Red).\n6.  **Matching Logic:** The core task is to determine which key color should replace each gray object. The visual appearance (size, exact shape, pixel count) of the gray objects differs significantly from the key objects. However, the output colors suggest a classification or matching based on some underlying structural property or pattern represented by the key objects. The gray objects seem to be more complex or distorted versions of shapes related to the key patterns. The transformation appears to be: find which key shape pattern is somehow \"represented\" or \"contained within\" the gray shape, and then color the entire gray shape with that key's color.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Identify the horizontal blue separator line that spans the width of the grid.\n3.  Identify the 'key objects' located above the separator line. For each key object, determine its color and extract its pixel coordinates relative to its top-left bounding box corner (this defines its shape pattern). Store these as (Color, Relative_Pixel_Set, Pixel_Count).\n4.  Identify all distinct gray objects located below the separator line.\n5.  For each gray object:\n    a.  Determine its absolute pixel coordinates and its pixel coordinates relative to its top-left bounding box corner (its shape pattern).\n    b.  Create a list of `fitting_keys`.\n    c.  For each key object identified in step 3:\n        i.  Check if the key object's relative pixel pattern can be found entirely within the gray object's relative pixel pattern. This involves testing if, for any possible offset (shift) of the key pattern within the gray object's bounding box, all pixels of the shifted key pattern correspond to actual pixels within the gray pattern.\n        ii. If the key pattern fits inside the gray pattern, add the key's (Color, Pixel_Count) to the `fitting_keys` list.\n    d.  If the `fitting_keys` list is not empty:\n        i.  If `fitting_keys` contains exactly one entry, select that entry's color.\n        ii. If `fitting_keys` contains multiple entries, select the entry with the maximum `Pixel_Count`.\n        iii. Determine the `target_color` based on the selection.\n        iv. For every absolute pixel coordinate belonging to the current gray object, set the color of that coordinate in the output grid to the `target_color`.\n    e.  (Assumption: Every gray object will have at least one fitting key based on the examples).\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
