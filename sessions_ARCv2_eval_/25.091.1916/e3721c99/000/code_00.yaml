- grid_division:
    type: horizontal_line
    color: blue (1)
    location: row_index 5
    purpose: separates key_area from work_area
- area: key_area
    location: above separator line (rows 0-4)
    contents:
      - object_type: key_shape
        color: yellow (4)
        pattern_description: solid 3x3 square
        pixel_count: 9
      - object_type: key_shape
        color: green (3)
        pattern_description: hollow 3x3 square (center missing)
        pixel_count: 8
      - object_type: key_shape
        color: blue (1)
        pattern_description: 3x5 rectangle with holes
        pixel_count: 13
      - object_type: key_shape
        color: red (2)
        pattern_description: 3x7 rectangle with holes
        pixel_count: 18
    persistence: remains unchanged in output
- area: work_area
    location: below separator line (rows 6-29)
    contents_input:
      - object_type: target_shape
        color: gray (5)
        count: multiple instances
        properties: varied shapes, sizes, and pixel counts
    contents_output:
      - object_type: colored_shape
        color: matches one of the key_shape colors (yellow, green, blue, red)
        location: replaces corresponding gray target_shape
        count: same number as input target_shapes
- transformation:
    action: recolor
    target: gray objects in work_area
    rule: based on matching a gray object to a key object
    matching_criterion: A key object's shape pattern fits entirely within the gray object's shape pattern (allowing translation).
    tie_breaker: If multiple key patterns fit, choose the one with the largest pixel count (Red > Blue > Yellow > Green).
    result: The entire gray object is recolored with the matched key object's color.
