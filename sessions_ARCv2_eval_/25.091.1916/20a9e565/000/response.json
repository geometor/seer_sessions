            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Large (30x30) grids primarily composed of white (0) background. They contain multiple distinct objects made of solid colors (1-9, excluding 5). There are also separate objects made of gray (5).\n2.  **Colored Objects:** These objects vary in shape, size, and color across examples. Some inputs feature repeating patterns of colored objects (Example 2).\n3.  **Gray Objects:** These appear distinct from the colored objects. In examples 1 and 3, they form shapes resembling numerical digits ('2' and '7', respectively). In example 2, there are two separate small gray shapes, one near the colored patterns and another ('L' shape) further away. These gray objects seem crucial as indicators or instructions.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs.\n    *   In examples 1 and 3, the output grid depicts the *same digit* that was formed by the gray objects in the input, using the *color corresponding to that digit's value*. (Input gray '2' -> Output red '2'; Input gray '7' -> Output orange '7'). The dimensions and exact pixel pattern of the output digit vary.\n    *   In example 2, the output is a 14x2 grid containing a vertical pattern using the colors (maroon-9, azure-8, yellow-4) that were prominent in the repeating patterns of the input grid. This output pattern appears related to, but not identical to, the repeating 2-column units in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n```"
