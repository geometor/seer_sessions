def transform(input_grid):

    Transforms the input grid based on the set of colors present (excluding white/0 and gray/5).

    The transformation rule assumes that the specific combination of non-background, 
    non-gray colors uniquely determines the output grid structure and colors. 
    The gray (5) pixels present in the input signal that a transformation should occur, 
    but their shape or location is not used to determine the specific output in this model.

    Based on the training examples:
    - If colors {1, 2, 4} are present, output a specific 3x6 red '2' shape.
    - If colors {4, 8, 9} are present, output a specific 14x2 pattern using those colors.
    - If colors {2, 3, 7} are present, output a specific 17x3 pattern based on orange '7'.
