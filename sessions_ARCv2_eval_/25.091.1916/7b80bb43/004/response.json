            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: filling horizontal gaps between foreground pixels with the foreground color. However, the generated code implemented this rule too broadly, filling *all* such gaps regardless of their length.\n\nThe comparison between the expected outputs and the actual outputs generated by the initial code reveals that the transformation is much more specific. In both training examples, only horizontal gaps consisting of *exactly three* background pixels, bounded on the left and right by foreground pixels within the same row, are filled. All other gaps, whether shorter or longer, and all other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the rule and the corresponding code to target only these specific \"3-pixel gaps\". This involves modifying the row scanning logic to search for the precise pattern: `Foreground-Pixel, Background-Pixel, Background-Pixel, Background-Pixel, Foreground-Pixel`.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze the discrepancies caused by the initial, overly general gap-filling logic.\n\n"
