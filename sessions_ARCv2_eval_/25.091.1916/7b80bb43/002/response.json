            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core concept of filling horizontal gaps between foreground pixels. However, the generated code applied this rule too broadly, filling *all* horizontal gaps composed solely of background pixels, regardless of their length. The validation results clearly show that only specific gaps should be filled.\n\nBy comparing the input, expected output, and the incorrect transformed output for both examples, a crucial constraint emerges: the gap must consist of *exactly three* background pixels. Gaps of other lengths are left untouched.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule by adding this specific condition: a horizontal sequence of background pixels is filled with the foreground color *if and only if* it is immediately preceded and followed by a foreground pixel on the same row, and the sequence consists of exactly three background pixels.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze the specific gaps that *should* be filled according to the expected outputs.\n\n*   **Train 1:**\n    *   Input Row 7: `... 6 1 1 1 6 ...` (Indices 14 to 20)\n    *   Output Row 7: `... 6 6 6 6 6 ...`\n    *   Gap: `1 1 1` at indices (7, 15), (7, 16), (7, 17).\n    *   Gap length: 3.\n*   **Train 2:**\n    *   Input Row 9: `... 3 0 0 0 3 ...` (Indices 20 to 24)\n    *   Output Row 9: `... 3 3 3 3 3 ...`\n    *   Gap: `0 0 0` at indices (9, 21), (9, 22), (9, 23).\n    *   Gap length: 3.\n\n"
