            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the first training example (`train_1`).\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 18x18.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color is Yellow (4), which acts as a static background, remaining unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct shapes or objects composed of non-Yellow colors scattered on the grid. These objects maintain their general position and overall structure in the output.\n4.  **Stable Color:** Blue (1) pixels within the objects appear to be completely static; their positions and color remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Changing Colors:** The colors Red (2), Green (3), and Azure (8) are the ones involved in the transformation. Their positions within the objects change color in the output based on a rule.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The change in color for a Red, Green, or Azure pixel seems to depend primarily on the color of the pixel directly *below* it in the input grid.\n7.  **Specific Rules Observed:**\n    *   Azure (8) changes to Red (2) if the pixel below is Azure (8).\n    *   Azure (8) changes to Green (3) if the pixel below is Yellow (4) (background).\n    *   Red (2) changes to Azure (8) if the pixel below is Green (3).\n    *   Red (2) changes to Azure (8) if the pixel below is Red (2).\n    *   Green (3) changes to Azure (8) if the pixel below is Yellow (4) (background).\n    *   Green (3) changes to Azure (8) if the pixel below is Green (3).\n8.  **Exception:** There's a specific exception to the Red (2) transformation. A Red (2) pixel does *not* change color if it is horizontally adjacent to Blue (1) pixels on both its left and right sides (forming a `1 2 1` horizontal pattern). In the example, Input[2, 13] is Red(2), Input[2, 12] and Input[2, 14] are Blue(1), and Input[3, 13] is Azure(8). According to the general rule for Red(2) (change if below is not Azure/Yellow/Blue), it should change, but it doesn't due to the flanking Blue pixels.\n9.  **Boundary Condition:** The rule implicitly relies on looking at the row below. Therefore, pixels in the last row of the grid cannot change based on this rule and remain the same (unless they are part of the exception logic, which doesn't apply here).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
