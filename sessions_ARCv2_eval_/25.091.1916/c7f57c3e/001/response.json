Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  For each pixel (r, c) where r is less than the last row index:\n    a. Get the `current_color` at `input_grid[r, c]`.\n    b. Get the `below_color` at `input_grid[r+1, c]`.\n    c. **Exception Rule:** If `current_color` is Red (2) AND it has a Blue (1) pixel immediately to its left (c > 0 and input_grid[r, c-1] == 1) AND a Blue (1) pixel immediately to its right (c < width-1 and input_grid[r, c+1] == 1), then this pixel does NOT change. Continue to the next pixel.\n    d. **Rule 1:** If `current_color` is Azure (8) AND `below_color` is Azure (8), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Red (2).\n    e. **Rule 2:** If `current_color` is Azure (8) AND `below_color` is Yellow (4), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Green (3).\n    f. **Rule 3:** If `current_color` is Red (2) AND `below_color` is Green (3), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Azure (8). (This rule is skipped if the Exception Rule applied).\n    g. **Rule 4:** If `current_color` is Green (3) AND (`below_color` is Yellow (4) OR `below_color` is Green (3)), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Azure (8).\n3.  Pixels not matching any change condition, pixels affected by the exception rule, and pixels in the last row retain their original color from the input grid.\n4.
