task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed 16x16 for all examples.
  background_color: 7 (orange)
  object_definition: A contiguous group of pixels (connected cardinally or diagonally) with colors other than the background_color.

transformation_elements:
  target_indicator_color: 0 (white)
  removal_condition_1: The object must contain at least one pixel of the target_indicator_color (white).
  removal_condition_2: The object must be fully enclosed by the background_color (orange). No pixel of the object can be adjacent (cardinally or diagonally) to the grid boundary or to a pixel of a different object.
  action: If both removal conditions are met, replace all pixels belonging to the identified object with the background_color (orange).
  otherwise: Pixels belonging to objects not meeting both conditions, or pixels that are already the background_color, remain unchanged.
