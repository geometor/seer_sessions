Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: variable height and width (e.g., 16x16)
    - pixels: integer values 0-9 representing colors
    - background_color: the most frequent color in the grid
    - foreground_pixels: pixels whose color is not the background_color
  Relationships:
    - foreground_pixels are distinct from the background_color

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: Nx1 (single column)
    - N: equals the total number of foreground_pixels in the input grid
    - pixels: contains the color values of the foreground_pixels from the input grid

Transformation:
  Action: Extract foreground pixels
  Steps:
    1. Identify the background_color (most frequent color) in the input grid.
    2. Scan the input grid row by row, from top to bottom.
    3. Within each row, scan column by column, from left to right.
    4. If a pixel's color is not the background_color, add its color value to an ordered list.
    5. Reshape the ordered list into a single-column grid (Nx1).
  Relationship:
    - The order of pixels in the output column matches the row-by-row, left-to-right scanning order of foreground pixels in the input grid.
