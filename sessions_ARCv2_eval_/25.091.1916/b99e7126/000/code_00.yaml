grid_properties:
  structure: Tiled grid of 4x4 blocks.
  block_composition: Each 4x4 block has a 1-pixel border and a 3x3 inner pattern.
  border_color: Consistent within each example (e.g., red=2, blue=1). Remains unchanged in output.
objects:
  - type: PatternBlock
    description: A 4x4 section of the grid, consisting of a 3x3 pattern and its surrounding 1-pixel border.
  - type: BasePattern
    description: The most frequently occurring 3x3 pattern within the grid's blocks.
    example_1: [[4,4,4],[4,1,4],[4,4,4]] (yellow/blue)
    example_2: [[8,8,8],[3,8,3],[8,8,8]] (azure/green)
    example_3: [[4,2,4],[2,4,2],[4,2,4]] (yellow/red)
  - type: VariantPattern
    description: A 3x3 pattern that differs from the BasePattern, present in one or more blocks in the input.
    example_1: [[3,1,3],[3,1,3],[3,3,3]] (green/blue)
    example_2: [[1,8,1],[1,1,1],[1,8,1]] (blue/azure)
    example_3: [[4,8,4],[8,8,8],[8,4,8]] (yellow/azure)
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: Two PatternBlocks are adjacent if they share a horizontal or vertical side (sharing only a corner does not count).
action:
  - type: PatternReplacement
    description: If a BasePattern block is adjacent to a VariantPattern block in the input grid, the BasePattern block's 3x3 pattern is replaced by the VariantPattern's 3x3 pattern in the output grid.
    condition: Adjacency between BasePattern block and VariantPattern block (based on input state).
    target: The 3x3 area of the BasePattern block.
    result: The target area becomes identical to the VariantPattern's 3x3 area.
constraints:
  - Border pixels are never modified.
  - The replacement is based solely on the input grid's configuration.
