Input Grid:
  - BackgroundColor: azure (8)
  - Contains various shapes and patterns.

Potential Objects/Features:
  - TriggerPair:
      Type: Adjacency pattern
      Color1: yellow (4)
      Color2: red (2)
      Relationship: Directly adjacent (vertically or horizontally)
      Configuration_Vertical: yellow (4) at (r, c) is immediately above red (2) at (r+1, c).
      Configuration_Horizontal: yellow (4) at (r, c) is immediately left of red (2) at (r, c+1).
      SearchOrder: Row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Only the first occurrence matters.
      Role: Initiates the transformation and determines affected columns and pattern start colors.
  - Blocker:
      Type: Color pattern
      Color: blue (1)
      Role: Defines the lower boundary (exclusive) for the generated pattern in specific columns. The topmost blue pixel in a column sets the boundary for that column.
  - AffectedColumns:
      Definition:
        - If TriggerPair is Configuration_Vertical at column 'c', the AffectedColumn is ['c'].
        - If TriggerPair is Configuration_Horizontal involving columns 'c' and 'c+1', the AffectedColumns are ['c', 'c+1'].
  - GeneratedPattern:
      Type: Vertical alternating color sequence
      Colors: [yellow (4), red (2)]
      StartColor (per AffectedColumn):
        Rule: Determined by the color of the TriggerPair pixel residing within that specific AffectedColumn.
        - If the column contains the yellow (4) part of the trigger, the pattern starts with yellow (4).
        - If the column contains the red (2) part of the trigger, the pattern starts with red (2).
      Extent (per AffectedColumn):
        StartRow: 0 (top edge of the grid)
        EndRow: Row index of the topmost blue (1) pixel found in that column. If no blue (1) is found, EndRow is the grid height.
      Sequence: The pattern alternates between yellow (4) and red (2), beginning with the determined StartColor for that column.

Transformation:
  - Action: Create a copy of the input grid.
  - Action: Locate the first occurrence of a TriggerPair (scanning row-major).
  - Action: If no TriggerPair found, return the copied grid.
  - Action: Identify the AffectedColumns based on the located TriggerPair.
  - Action: For each AffectedColumn:
      - Determine the StartColor based on the TriggerPair pixel within that column (4 if yellow, 2 if red).
      - Find the row index (R_blue) of the topmost blue (1) pixel in that column (or grid height if none).
      - Generate the alternating pattern sequence (StartColor, other_color, StartColor, ...) for rows 0 to R_blue - 1.
      - Overwrite the pixels in the copied grid for that AffectedColumn from row 0 to R_blue - 1 with the generated sequence.
  - Rule: All pixels not part of the GeneratedPattern in AffectedColumns remain unchanged.
