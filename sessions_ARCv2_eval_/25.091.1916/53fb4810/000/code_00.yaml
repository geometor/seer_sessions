Input Grid:
  - BackgroundColor: azure (8)
  - Contains various shapes and patterns.

Potential Objects/Features:
  - TriggerPair:
      Type: Adjacency pattern
      Color1: yellow (4)
      Color2: red (2)
      Relationship: Directly adjacent (vertically or horizontally)
      Configuration_Vertical: yellow (4) is immediately above red (2)
      Configuration_Horizontal: yellow (4) is immediately left of red (2)
      Role: Initiates the transformation.
  - Blocker:
      Type: Color pattern
      Color: blue (1)
      Role: Defines the lower boundary for the generated pattern in specific columns.
  - AffectedColumns:
      Definition: The column(s) containing the pixels of the TriggerPair.
  - GeneratedPattern:
      Type: Vertical alternating color sequence
      Colors: [yellow (4), red (2)]
      StartColor:
        Condition: TriggerPair is Configuration_Vertical (4 above 2)
        Value: red (2) (the lower color in the pair)
        Condition: TriggerPair is Configuration_Horizontal (4 left of 2)
        Value: yellow (4) (the left color in the pair)
      Extent:
        StartRow: 0 (top edge of the grid)
        EndRow: Row index of the topmost blue (1) pixel in the column, minus 1.

Transformation:
  - Action: Locate the first occurrence of a TriggerPair (either vertical or horizontal configuration).
  - Action: Identify the AffectedColumns based on the located TriggerPair.
  - Action: Determine the StartColor for the GeneratedPattern based on the TriggerPair's configuration.
  - Action: For each AffectedColumn:
      - Find the row index (R_blue) of the topmost blue (1) pixel.
      - Generate the alternating pattern sequence (starting with StartColor) long enough to fill rows 0 to R_blue - 1.
      - Overwrite the pixels in the AffectedColumn from row 0 to R_blue - 1 with the generated sequence.
  - Rule: All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
