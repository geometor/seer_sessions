Input Grid:
  - BackgroundColor: azure (8)
  - Contains various shapes and patterns.

Potential Objects/Features:
  - TriggerPair:
      Type: Adjacency pattern
      Color1: yellow (4)
      Color2: red (2)
      Relationship: Directly adjacent (vertically or horizontally)
      Configuration_Vertical: yellow (4) is immediately above red (2) at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` respectively.
      Configuration_Horizontal: yellow (4) is immediately left of red (2) at `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` respectively.
      Role: Initiates the transformation. Process the first one found scanning row by row, then column by column.
  - Blocker:
      Type: Color pattern
      Color: blue (1)
      Role: Defines the lower boundary (exclusive) for the generated pattern in specific columns.
  - AffectedColumns:
      Definition: The column(s) containing the pixels of the identified TriggerPair.
        - If Configuration_Vertical at col `c`, AffectedColumns = [`c`]
        - If Configuration_Horizontal at cols `c` and `c+1`, AffectedColumns = [`c`, `c+1`]
  - GeneratedPattern:
      Type: Vertical alternating color sequence
      Colors: [yellow (4), red (2)]
      Extent:
        StartRow: 0 (top edge of the grid)
        EndRow: Row index of the topmost blue (1) pixel in the column, minus 1. If no blue pixel, use grid height - 1.
      StartingColor:
        - Case 1: TriggerPair is Configuration_Vertical (4 above 2) at col `c`.
            - Column `c`: Starts with red (2), alternates with yellow (4).
        - Case 2: TriggerPair is Configuration_Horizontal (4 left of 2) at cols `c`, `c+1`.
            - Column `c` (yellow trigger pixel): Starts with yellow (4), alternates with red (2).
            - Column `c+1` (red trigger pixel): Starts with red (2), alternates with yellow (4).

Transformation:
  - Action: Locate the first occurrence of a TriggerPair (either vertical or horizontal configuration) scanning row-major order.
  - Action: Identify the AffectedColumns based on the located TriggerPair.
  - Action: For each AffectedColumn `tc`:
      - Find the row index (`R_blue`) of the topmost blue (1) pixel in `tc`. If none, `R_blue` is the grid height.
      - Determine the `StartColor` and `AlternateColor` based on the TriggerPair configuration and the specific column `tc` (see GeneratedPattern->StartingColor).
      - Generate the alternating pattern sequence long enough to fill rows 0 to `R_blue - 1`.
      - Overwrite the pixels in the AffectedColumn `tc` from row 0 to `R_blue - 1` with the generated sequence, starting with `StartColor`.
  - Rule: All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
