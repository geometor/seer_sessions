Okay, let's break down the task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (7x25 in all examples). They feature a border frame (1 pixel thick) using a specific color (gray, blue, magenta, yellow).
2.  **Internal Structure:** Inside the border, the grid is divided vertically by columns of the border color into four distinct rectangular sections or patterns. Let's call these P1, P2, P3, and P4 from left to right.
3.  **Pattern Content:**
    *   Patterns P1, P2, and P3 each consist of two colors: a 'background' color and a 'foreground' color forming a distinct shape.
    *   The background color is the same for P1, P2, and P3 within a single example.
    *   Pattern P4 initially consists solely of the background color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing the content of the P4 region. The first three patterns (P1, P2, P3) remain unchanged. The P4 region in the output is replaced by a *copy* of one of the first three patterns (P1, P2, or P3) from the input.
5.  **Selection Rule:** The key is to determine *which* of the first three patterns (P1, P2, or P3) is copied into P4. Observing the examples, the selection seems based on the *foreground* colors present in P1, P2, and P3.
    *   If red (color 2) is the foreground color of any of P1, P2, or P3, the pattern containing red is copied. In the examples, red is always in P2 when present.
    *   If red (2) is not present among the foreground colors, check for blue (color 1). If blue (1) is the foreground color of any of P1, P2, or P3, the pattern containing blue is copied. In the examples, blue is in P3 when red is absent (Example 3).
    *   The examples suggest a priority: check for red (2) first, then blue (1).

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_description: Replace the fourth pattern block with a copy of one of the first three, based on foreground color priority.

grid_properties:
  - size: Constant 7x25 for all examples.
  - structure: Contains a 1-pixel border frame and internal vertical separators of the same border color.
  - separators: Vertical columns of the border color divide the inner area (rows 1-5) into four equally sized rectangular regions (5x5 pixels each).
    - Region 1 (P1): Columns 1-5
    - Region 2 (P2): Columns 7-11
    - Region 3 (P3): Columns 13-17
    - Region 4 (P4): Columns 19-23

object_definitions:
  - object: Border
    definition: The outermost frame (row 0, row 6, col 0, col 24) and the vertical separator columns (col 6, col 12, col 18).
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray, blue, magenta, yellow).
  - object: Pattern_Region
    definition: One of the four 5x5 areas (P1, P2, P3, P4) defined by the separators.
  - object: Background_Color
    definition: The color that fills the P4 region in the input. This color also appears as part of P1, P2, and P3.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (yellow, azure, maroon, white). Coincides with the color filling P4.
  - object: Foreground_Object
    definition: The connected pixels within P1, P2, or P3 that are *not* the Background_Color.
    properties:
      - color: The distinguishing color of the pattern (e.g., magenta in P1/Ex1, red in P2/Ex1, green in P3/Ex1).
      - shape: Forms a distinct shape within the 5x5 region.

relationships:
  - P1, P2, P3 each contain one Background_Color and one Foreground_Object color.
  - P4 contains only the Background_Color in the input.
  - The Background_Color is consistent across P1, P2, P3, and P4 within a single example.
  - The Foreground_Object colors for P1, P2, P3 are unique within those three patterns for each example.

actions:
  - action: Identify
    parameters: [Border Color, Separator Columns, Pattern Regions (P1, P2, P3, P4), Background_Color, Foreground_Object Colors (F1, F2, F3)]
  - action: Select_Pattern_To_Copy
    logic: |
      Check Foreground_Object colors {F1, F2, F3}:
      1. If Red (2) is present, select the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) whose Foreground_Object color is Red (2).
      2. Else if Blue (1) is present, select the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) whose Foreground_Object color is Blue (1).
      (Assumption: One of these conditions will always be met based on examples).
  - action: Copy_Paste
    source: The selected pattern region (P1, P2, or P3) from the input grid.
    destination: The P4 pattern region in the output grid.
  - action: Preserve
    elements: Border, Separator Columns, P1, P2, P3 regions remain unchanged from input to output.

transformation_summary: The fourth internal pattern area, initially filled with the background color, is overwritten by copying the pattern from the first three areas that contains the highest priority foreground color (Priority: Red > Blue).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Determine the border color (the color of the frame and vertical separators). Locate the vertical separator columns (columns 6, 12, 18). These define four 5x5 pattern regions: P1 (cols 1-5), P2 (cols 7-11), P3 (cols 13-17), and P4 (cols 19-23), all within rows 1-5.
2.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the background color (the single color filling P4). For each of P1, P2, and P3, find the foreground color (the color that is not the background color). Let these be F1, F2, and F3.
3.  **Select Source Pattern:**
    *   Check if any of F1, F2, F3 is red (color 2). If yes, identify the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) that has red as its foreground color. This is the source pattern.
    *   If red is not found, check if any of F1, F2, F3 is blue (color 1). If yes, identify the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) that has blue as its foreground color. This is the source pattern.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. Overwrite the P4 region (rows 1-5, columns 19-23) in the copied grid with the contents of the source pattern region identified in step 3. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
