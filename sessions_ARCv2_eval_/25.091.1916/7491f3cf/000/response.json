            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (7x25 in all examples). They feature a border frame (1 pixel thick) using a specific color (gray, blue, magenta, yellow).\n2.  **Internal Structure:** Inside the border, the grid is divided vertically by columns of the border color into four distinct rectangular sections or patterns. Let's call these P1, P2, P3, and P4 from left to right.\n3.  **Pattern Content:**\n    *   Patterns P1, P2, and P3 each consist of two colors: a 'background' color and a 'foreground' color forming a distinct shape.\n    *   The background color is the same for P1, P2, and P3 within a single example.\n    *   Pattern P4 initially consists solely of the background color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves replacing the content of the P4 region. The first three patterns (P1, P2, P3) remain unchanged. The P4 region in the output is replaced by a *copy* of one of the first three patterns (P1, P2, or P3) from the input.\n5.  **Selection Rule:** The key is to determine *which* of the first three patterns (P1, P2, or P3) is copied into P4. Observing the examples, the selection seems based on the *foreground* colors present in P1, P2, and P3.\n    *   If red (color 2) is the foreground color of any of P1, P2, or P3, the pattern containing red is copied. In the examples, red is always in P2 when present.\n    *   If red (2) is not present among the foreground colors, check for blue (color 1). If blue (1) is the foreground color of any of P1, P2, or P3, the pattern containing blue is copied. In the examples, blue is in P3 when red is absent (Example 3).\n    *   The examples suggest a priority: check for red (2) first, then blue (1).\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Let these be F1, F2, and F3.\n3.  **Select Source Pattern:**\n    *   Check if any of F1, F2, F3 is red (color 2). If yes, identify the pattern (P1, P2, or P3) that has red as its foreground color.
