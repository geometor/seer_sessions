task_description: >
  Replace the fourth pattern block (P4) with a composite pattern derived from two
  of the first three pattern blocks (P1, P2, P3), based on foreground color priorities.

grid_properties:
  - size: Constant 7x25 for all examples.
  - structure: Contains a 1-pixel border frame and internal vertical separators of the same border color.
  - separators: Vertical columns of the border color (cols 6, 12, 18) divide the inner area (rows 1-5) into four 5x5 pixel regions (P1, P2, P3, P4).
    - P1: Columns 1-5
    - P2: Columns 7-11
    - P3: Columns 13-17
    - P4: Columns 19-23

object_definitions:
  - object: Border_Separator
    definition: The outermost frame and the internal vertical separator columns.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (gray, blue, magenta, yellow).
  - object: Pattern_Region
    definition: One of the four 5x5 areas (P1, P2, P3, P4).
  - object: Background_Color
    definition: The color filling the P4 region in the input grid. Also present in P1, P2, P3.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (yellow, azure, maroon, white). Symbol: Bg.
  - object: Foreground_Object
    definition: The connected pixels within P1, P2, or P3 that are *not* the Background_Color.
    properties:
      - color: The distinguishing color of the pattern (e.g., F1, F2, F3).
      - shape: Forms a distinct shape within the 5x5 region.
  - object: Primary_Pattern
    definition: The pattern (P1, P2, or P3) selected based on the first priority rule applied to foreground colors F1, F2, F3. Symbol: P_prim.
    properties:
      - foreground_color: Symbol F_prim.
  - object: Secondary_Patterns
    definition: The two patterns from {P1, P2, P3} that were *not* selected as the Primary_Pattern. Symbols: P_sec1, P_sec2.
    properties:
      - foreground_colors: Symbols F_sec1, F_sec2.
  - object: Background_Source_Pattern
    definition: The pattern selected from the Secondary_Patterns based on the second priority rule applied to F_sec1, F_sec2. Symbol: P_bg_src.
    properties:
      - foreground_color: Symbol F_bg_src.
  - object: Output_P4_Region
    definition: The 5x5 region in the output grid corresponding to the input P4 location.

relationships:
  - P1, P2, P3 each contain Bg and one unique foreground color (F1, F2, F3).
  - Input P4 contains only Bg.
  - Output_P4_Region contains two colors: F_prim and F_bg_src.
  - The spatial arrangement of F_prim in Output_P4_Region matches the spatial arrangement of F_prim in P_prim.
  - The spatial arrangement of F_bg_src in Output_P4_Region matches the spatial arrangement of Bg in P_prim.

actions:
  - action: Identify_Regions_And_Colors
    parameters: [Border_Separator, P1, P2, P3, P4, Bg, F1, F2, F3]
  - action: Select_Primary_Pattern
    logic: |
      Apply Priority 1 (Red(2) > Blue(1)) to foreground colors {F1, F2, F3}.
      Identify the pattern P_prim and its foreground color F_prim.
  - action: Identify_Secondary_Patterns
    logic: Identify the two patterns {P_sec1, P_sec2} and their foreground colors {F_sec1, F_sec2} from {P1, P2, P3} excluding P_prim.
  - action: Select_Background_Source_Pattern
    logic: |
      Apply Priority 2 (Green(3) > Yellow(4)) to secondary foreground colors {F_sec1, F_sec2}.
      Identify the pattern P_bg_src and its foreground color F_bg_src.
  - action: Construct_Output_P4
    logic: |
      Create a new 5x5 grid for Output_P4_Region.
      Iterate through each cell (r, c) of P_prim:
        If P_prim[r, c] == F_prim, set Output_P4_Region[r, c] = F_prim.
        If P_prim[r, c] == Bg, set Output_P4_Region[r, c] = F_bg_src.
  - action: Assemble_Output_Grid
    logic: |
      Copy the input grid.
      Replace the P4 region in the copy with the constructed Output_P4_Region.

transformation_summary: >
  Identify four pattern regions (P1-P4) and their foreground (F1-F3) / background (Bg) colors.
  Select a Primary Pattern (P_prim) using Red(2)>Blue(1) priority on F1-F3.
  Select a Background Source Pattern (P_bg_src) from the remaining two using Green(3)>Yellow(4) priority on their foreground colors.
  Construct the output P4 by taking the shape of P_prim, keeping its foreground color (F_prim), but replacing its background color (Bg) with the foreground color of P_bg_src (F_bg_src).
