The fourth \nregion (P4) initially contains only the background color.\n\nThe transformation rule modifies only the P4 region in the output:\n\n1. Identify the common background color (Bg) from the input P4.\n2. Identify the foreground colors F1, F2, F3 for patterns P1, P2, P3 respectively.\n3. Select a 'Primary Pattern' (P_prim) from P1, P2, P3 based on its foreground \n   color, using the priority: Red (2) > Blue (1). Let the foreground color of \n   P_prim be F_prim.\n4. Identify the two patterns *not* selected as primary ('Secondary Patterns').\n5. Select a 'Background Source Color' (F_bg_src) from the foreground colors of \n   the Secondary Patterns, using the priority: Green (3) > Yellow (4).\n6. Construct the new 5x5 pattern for the output P4 region. This new pattern uses \n   the spatial structure (shape) of P_prim. Pixels in the new P4 corresponding \n   to F_prim pixels in P_prim are set to F_prim. Pixels corresponding to Bg \n   pixels in P_prim are set to F_bg_src.\n\nThe border, separators, and the contents of P1, P2, and P3 remain unchanged \nin the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_foreground(pattern_array, background_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique color in a pattern array that is not the background color.\n    \n    Args:\n        pattern_array (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the pattern region.\n        background_color (int): The background color value.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or None: The foreground color value, or None if only the background \n                     color is found or the pattern is empty/invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n    #
