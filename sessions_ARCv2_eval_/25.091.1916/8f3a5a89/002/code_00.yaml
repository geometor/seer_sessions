  steps:
    - Find the magenta (6) pixel.
    - Perform a flood fill (e.g., BFS) starting from any gray (8) pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the magenta pixel.
    - This flood fill identifies the single connected component of gray (8) pixels associated with the magenta pixel (Component M). Blue (1) pixels act as boundaries for the fill.
    - Create a copy of the input grid for the output.
    - Iterate through the input grid:
      - If a pixel is gray (8) and does *not* belong to Component M (identified in the flood fill), change its color to orange (7) in the output grid.
      - Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color in the output grid (gray for Component M, blue for barriers, magenta for the start point).
