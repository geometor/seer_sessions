Transformation Rule:

1. Identify all distinct connected shapes composed of Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels using 8-way connectivity. Treat these colors as equivalent for shape definition.
2. Count the total number of these distinct shapes.
3. Locate the single Yellow (4) pixel and identify its column index (the "Key Column").
4. Based on the shape count:
    a. If the count is exactly 1:
        - Create an output grid filled with the background color (Azure, 8).
        - Fill the entire Key Column with Red (2).
    b. If the count is greater than 1:
        - Create an output grid filled with the background color (Azure, 8).
        - Collect all coordinates (row, col) of the Blue (1) and Green (3) pixels.
        - If 3 or more such pixels exist:
            - Calculate the convex hull of these points.
            - Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col) enclosing the hull vertices.
            - Iterate through all integer grid coordinates (pixels) within this bounding box.
            - For each coordinate, check if it lies inside or on the boundary of the convex hull polygon using matplotlib.path.
            - If it does, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Red (2).
            - Ensure original shape pixels are also colored Red (2) in the output.
        - If fewer than 3 such pixels exist (cannot form a polygon):
            - Color only the original Blue/Green pixel locations Red (2) in the output grid.
    c. If the count is 0:
        - Return the background grid.
