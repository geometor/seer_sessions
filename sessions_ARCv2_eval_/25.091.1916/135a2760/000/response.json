The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged between input and output.\n2.  **Borders:** The grids feature distinct border structures. In `train_1`, there's an outer green border (3) and an inner red border (2). In `train_2`, there's an outer yellow border (4) and an inner red border (2). These borders seem static and are preserved in the output. `train_2` appears to contain multiple independent sub-problems, each framed by these borders.\n3.  **Patterned Areas:** Inside the inner borders, there are rows containing sequences of pixels that form patterns. These patterns consist primarily of two alternating colors.\n4.  **Pattern Disruptions:** The core transformation seems to involve locating and correcting disruptions in these alternating patterns. Specifically, sequences where the same color repeats two (`X X`) or three (`X X X`) times in a row.\n5.  **Correction Logic:** When a repetition (`X X` or `X X X`) is found, it's replaced by a sequence that restores the local alternation, using the *two* specific colors designated for that patterned area. If the two alternating colors are `C1` and `C2`, and a sequence of `X X` or `X X X` is found (where `X` is either `C1` or `C2`), let `Y` be the *other* color (`Y` is `C2` if `X` is `C1`, and `Y` is `C1` if `X` is `C2`). The sequence `X X` is replaced by `Y X`, and the sequence `X X X` is replaced by `Y X Y`.\n6.  **Scope:** The correction seems to happen independently within each row segment bounded by the inner border color.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
