The inner border color defines the regions of interest.\n2.  **Iterate Rows:** Process each row independently.\n3.  **Find Pattern Segments:** Within a row, locate the contiguous sequence of pixels between the first and last occurrence of the inner border color.\n4.  **Determine Alternating Colors:** Within this segment, identify the two most frequent colors (excluding the inner border color). These are the expected alternating colors (C1, C2).\n5.  **Scan and Correct:** Iterate through the segment:\n    *   If three consecutive pixels have the same color `X` (`X X X`), change the first and third `X` to the other alternating color `Y`.\n    *   If two consecutive pixels have the same color `X` (`X X`), change the first `X` to the other alternating color `Y`.\n6.  **Output:** The output grid is the input grid with the corrected segments.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_border_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"Identifies the outer and inner border colors.\"\"\"\n    outer_border_color = grid[0, 0]\n    inner_border_color = -1\n    # Scan inward from the top-left corner until a different color is found\n    # This assumes borders are at least 1 pixel thick\n    if grid.shape[0] > 1 and grid.shape[1] > 1:\n       inner_border_color = grid[1, 1]\n       if inner_border_color == outer_border_color: # Handle cases where inner border might not be at (1,1)\n           # More robust search might be needed if borders aren't simple frames\n           # For now, assume the second layer inwards reveals the inner border\n            rows, cols = grid.shape\n            for r in range(1, rows -1):\n                for c in range(1, cols -1):\n                    if grid[r,c] != outer_border_color:\n                        inner_border_color = grid[r,c]\n                        # Check if neighbors match inner_border_color to confirm it's part of a border\n                        is_border = True\n                        for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:\n                             nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                             if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                                 if grid[nr, nc] != inner_border_color and grid[nr, nc] != outer_border_color:\n                                      is_border = False\n                                      break\n                        if is_border:\n                             return outer_border_color, inner_border_color\n            # Fallback if no clear inner border found in this simple way\n            return outer_border_color, -1 # Or handle error\n    return outer_border_color, inner_border_color\n\n\ndef get_alternating_colors(segment, inner_border_color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the two most frequent colors in a segment, excluding the border color.\"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(segment)\n    if inner_border_color in counts:\n        del counts[inner_border_color]\n    \n    most_common = counts.most_common(2)\n    if len(most_common) == 2:\n        return most_common[0][0], most_common[1][0]\n    elif len(most_common) == 1:\n        # Handle cases with only one non-border color?
