Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. The grids vary in size across examples (12x12, 22x22, 16x16).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use only two colors: white (0) as the background and azure (8) for the patterns.
3.  **Initial State:** The input grid contains a small, initial pattern of azure pixels on a white background. The shapes differ in each example ('+', 'H', 'T').
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is generated by iteratively expanding the initial azure pattern according to a specific rule. The original azure pixels from the input remain azure in the output.
5.  **Growth Rule:** The pattern grows based on the neighborhood of each pixel. Observing the examples, particularly the way white pixels turn azure, suggests a cellular automaton rule. A white pixel seems to turn azure only if it has a specific number of azure neighbors in the previous step. Comparing the input and output, and considering common cellular automaton rules, the rule appears to be:
    *   An existing azure pixel (8) remains azure.
    *   A white pixel (0) becomes azure (8) if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current state.
    *   Otherwise, a white pixel remains white.
    This is often referred to as the B3/S_all rule (Birth if 3 neighbors / Survive always).
6.  **Iterations:** The rule is applied iteratively. The number of iterations seems related to the grid size. A plausible hypothesis is that the number of iterations is half the maximum dimension of the grid (height or width), rounded down.
    *   Example 1 (12x12): `max(12, 12) // 2 = 6` iterations.
    *   Example 2 (22x22): `max(22, 22) // 2 = 11` iterations.
    *   Example 3 (16x16): `max(16, 16) // 2 = 8` iterations.
7.  **Grid Boundaries:** The growth occurs within the boundaries of the original grid dimensions.

**YAML Block of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a cellular automaton growth rule iteratively to an initial pattern.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_used: [white (0), azure (8)]
  - background_color: white (0)

  - color: azure (8)
  - location: Contained within the input grid.
  - role: Serves as the seed for the growth process.
transformation_rule:
  type: Cellular Automaton
  rule_name: B3/S_all (Birth=3 neighbors, Survival=always)
  details:
    - A white (0) cell becomes azure (8) in the next step if it has exactly 3 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current step.
    - An azure (8) cell remains azure (8) in the next step.
    - All other white (0) cells remain white (0).
  iterations:
    dependency: Grid dimensions
    calculation: floor(max(grid_height, grid_width) / 2)
    application: The rule is applied iteratively for the calculated number of steps.
output_pattern:
  - color: azure (8)
  - generation: Result of applying the transformation rule for the specified iterations, starting from the initial pattern.
  - relation_to_input: Contains the initial azure pattern as a subset.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the number of iterations `k = max(H, W) // 2`.
3.  Initialize the current grid state with the input grid.
4.  Repeat the following process `k` times:
    a.  Create a new grid, `next_grid`, of the same dimensions (H x W), initially copying the `current_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.
    c.  If the cell `current_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
        i.  Count the number of azure (8) neighbors for the cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Consider all 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), staying within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If the count of azure neighbors is exactly 3, set the corresponding cell in the `next_grid` to azure (8): `next_grid[r, c] = 8`.
    d.  After checking all cells, update the `current_grid` to be the `next_grid`.
5.  The final state of the `current_grid` after `k` iterations is the output grid.
