**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis implementing the B3/S_all cellular automaton rule for `k = max(grid_height, grid_width) // 2` iterations failed. The code produced outputs identical to the inputs for examples 1 and 3, and only minor changes for example 2, indicating that the conditions for cell "birth" (white changing to azure) were rarely met under the B3 rule.

Further analysis using code execution confirmed that key white cells adjacent to the initial patterns in examples 1 and 3 only had 2 azure neighbors, not the required 3 for the B3 rule. This strongly suggests the B3 birth condition is incorrect.

The strategy is to revise the hypothesized cellular automaton rule. Given that the outputs show significant growth and density, a less restrictive birth condition seems likely. The "Seeds" rule (B2/S_all - Birth if 2 neighbors, Survival always) is a plausible candidate. We will test this rule while keeping the original iteration count logic (`k = max(H, W) // 2`), as there's no clear evidence yet to change it.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Code execution was used to verify the neighbor counts for specific white cells near the initial patterns in the input grids:


``` python
import numpy as np

def count_azure_neighbors(grid, r, c):
    height, width = grid.shape
    count = 0
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:
                if grid[nr, nc] == 8:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Example 1 Input
grid1 = np.array([
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
])

# Example 3 Input
grid3 = np.array([
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], #r=5
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], #r=6
    [0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], #r=7
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], #r=8
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], #r=9
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
])

# Check neighbors for cell (3,4) in grid1 (White, expected to become Azure)
count1_3_4 = count_azure_neighbors(grid1, 3, 4)
# Check neighbors for cell (5,5) in grid3 (White, expected to become Azure)
count3_5_5 = count_azure_neighbors(grid3, 5, 5)

print(f'Grid 1, Cell (3,4) - Neighbors: {count1_3_4}')
print(f'Grid 3, Cell (5,5) - Neighbors: {count3_5_5}')
```
```
Grid 1, Cell (3,4) - Neighbors: 2
Grid 3, Cell (5,5) - Neighbors: 2

```
*   **Example 1:** Cell (3, 4) is white in the input. The expected output shows it becomes azure. Code confirms it has exactly 2 azure neighbors in the input grid.
*   **Example 3:** Cell (5, 5) is white in the input. The expected output shows it becomes azure. Code confirms it has exactly 2 azure neighbors in the input grid.

This evidence strongly supports changing the birth rule from B3 (requires 3 neighbors) to B2 (requires 2 neighbors). The survival rule (S_all - azure cells always survive) seems consistent with the observations, as the initial patterns appear fully preserved within the outputs.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the number of iterations `k = max(H, W) // 2`.
3.  Initialize the `current_grid` state with the input grid.
4.  Repeat the following process `k` times:
    a.  Create a new grid, `next_grid`, of the same dimensions (H x W), initially copying the `current_grid`.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.
    c.  If the cell `current_grid[r, c]` is white (0):
        i.  Count the number of azure (8) neighbors for the cell `(r, c)` in the `current_grid`. Consider all 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), staying within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If the count of azure neighbors is exactly 2, set the corresponding cell in the `next_grid` to azure (8): `next_grid[r, c] = 8`. *(Rule updated from 3 neighbors to 2)*
    d.  After checking all cells, update the `current_grid` to be the `next_grid`.
5.  The final state of the `current_grid` after `k` iterations is the output grid.
