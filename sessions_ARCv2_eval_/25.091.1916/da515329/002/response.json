            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis implementing the B3/S_all cellular automaton rule for `k = max(grid_height, grid_width) // 2` iterations failed. The code produced outputs identical to the inputs for examples 1 and 3, and only minor changes for example 2, indicating that the conditions for cell \"birth\" (white changing to azure) were rarely met under the B3 rule.\n\nFurther analysis using code execution confirmed that key white cells adjacent to the initial patterns in examples 1 and 3 only had 2 azure neighbors, not the required 3 for the B3 rule. This strongly suggests the B3 birth condition is incorrect.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the hypothesized cellular automaton rule. Given that the outputs show significant growth and density, a less restrictive birth condition seems likely. The \"Seeds\" rule (B2/S_all - Birth if 2 neighbors, Survival always) is a plausible candidate. We will test this rule while keeping the original iteration count logic (`k = max(H, W) // 2`), as there's no clear evidence yet to change it.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nCode execution was used to verify the neighbor counts for specific white cells near the initial patterns in the input grids:\n\n"
