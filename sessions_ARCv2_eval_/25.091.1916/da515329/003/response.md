"""
Apply a cellular automaton growth rule iteratively to an initial pattern.
The rule is B2/S_all (Birth=2 neighbors, Survival=always):
- A white (0) cell becomes azure (8) in the next step if it has exactly 2 azure neighbors (including diagonals) in the current step.
- An azure (8) cell remains azure (8) in the next step.
- All other white (0) cells remain white (0).
The rule is applied iteratively for k steps, where k = floor(max(grid_height, grid_width) / 2).
