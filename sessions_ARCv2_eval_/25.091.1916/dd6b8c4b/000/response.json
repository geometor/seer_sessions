            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels. Orange (7) often acts as a background or border.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The central element is a contiguous object composed of green (3) pixels, usually containing a single red (2) pixel. Other colors like magenta (6) and maroon (9) exist but don't seem to be the primary focus of the transformation itself, though they might influence it.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing *some* or *all* of the green (3) pixels within the green/red object to maroon (9). The red (2) pixel always remains unchanged. Pixels outside this object also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Conditionality:** The specific green pixels that change depend on the context. Comparing the three examples reveals that the *same* internal green/red structure (a 3x3 block with red in the center-left position relative to the block) results in different outputs. This implies the transformation is influenced by factors *external* to the green/red object itself.\n5.  **External Influence:** The key difference between the examples lies in the colors of the pixels immediately surrounding (cardinally adjacent to) the green/red object.\n    *   In `train_1`, the object is bordered by orange (7) on the top, bottom, and left"
