            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue is the code timeout, indicating inefficiency rather than incorrect logic. The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: 1x5 Red or Green lines on the bottom row act as triggers, potentially modifying 3x5 cross shapes located directly above them. The Red lines cause the cross above to turn Gray(5), while Green lines cause no change. All trigger lines are then removed.\n\nThe timeout likely originates from the `_find_cross_shapes` function scanning the entire grid for potential cross centers. A more efficient strategy is:\n\n1.  Scan *only* the bottom row to find the 1x5 Red/Green trigger lines.\n2.  For each trigger line found, calculate the precise expected location of the center/bounding box of a potential 3x5 cross shape directly above it.\n3.  Verify if a cross shape of the correct structure and *any* non-background color exists at that specific location in the input grid.\n4.  If a cross is found above a Red line, update its color to Gray in the output grid.\n5.  Remove all identified trigger lines from the output grid by replacing them with the background color.\n\nThis avoids iterating through the entire grid looking for crosses and focuses only on the relevant areas defined by the trigger lines.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's verify the shapes and relationships using Example 1.\n"

The code execution reveals the Red(2) line is at columns 3-7 and the Green(3) line is at columns 15-19 on the bottom row (row 29). The cross shapes are located much higher up in the grid. Let's re-examine the input/output for Example 1.\n\n*   **Input Ex1:** Red line (2) cols 3-7. Green line (3) cols 15-19. Many crosses exist: Maroon(9) at (22,5) & (26,5), White(0) at (22,11) & (26,11), Blue(1) at (22,17) & (26,17), Yellow(4) at (18,23), (22,23), (26,23).\n*   **Output Ex1:** Red and Green lines removed. Maroon(9) crosses at (22,5) & (26,5) changed to Gray(5). Blue(1) crosses at (22,17) & (26,17) changed to Blue(1) (no change). White(0) and Yellow(4) crosses unchanged.\n\n**Revised Relationship:** The relationship isn't \"directly above\". It seems to be based purely on column alignment. A cross shape changes color if its column range overlaps with the column range of a trigger line on the bottom row, regardless of the vertical distance.\n\n*   Maroon(9) cross at (22, 5) spans columns 3-7. Red(2) line spans columns 3-7. Overlap -> Change to Gray(5).\n*   Maroon(9) cross at (26, 5) spans columns 3-7. Red(2) line spans columns 3-7. Overlap -> Change to Gray(5).\n*   Blue(1) cross at (22, 17) spans columns 15-19. Green(3) line spans columns 15-19. Overlap -> No change (due to Green line).\n*   Blue(1) cross at (26, 17) spans columns 15-19. Green(3) line spans columns 15-19. Overlap -> No change (due to Green line).\n*   Other crosses (White, Yellow) do not have column ranges overlapping with any trigger line.\n\nThis \"column overlap\" rule holds for all three examples. The inefficiency timeout remains the key problem to solve. The strategy of finding lines first, then finding *all* crosses, and *then* checking for column overlap seems necessary but potentially slow if cross finding is inefficient.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Find all trigger lines (1x5 Red/Green on bottom row) and store their color and column range.\n2.  Find *all* 3x5 cross shapes in the grid and store their color, coordinates, and column range. (This step needs optimization if it's the bottleneck).\n3.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input.\n4.  Iterate through the found cross shapes. For each cross:\n    *   Check if its column range overlaps with the column range of any *Red* trigger line found in step 1.\n    *   If an overlap with a Red line exists, change the color of all pixels belonging to this cross in the *output* grid to Gray(5).\n5.  Iterate through the found trigger lines (Red and Green). For each line:\n    *   Change the pixels corresponding to the line's location on the bottom row of the *output* grid to the background color.\n6.  Return the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
