            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code execution resulted in a timeout, suggesting the initial approach, particularly the method for identifying \"plus\" shapes (`_is_plus_shape_at`), was likely inefficient or potentially incorrect for the scale of the grids (30x30). The timeout implies the logic might be scanning too much or performing redundant checks.\n\nA detailed re-examination of the three training examples reveals a consistent pattern:\n1.  The shapes involved are not 5x5 pluses, but rather 3x5 \"crosses\" (3 pixels high, 5 pixels wide).\n2.  The trigger mechanism involves specific 1x5 horizontal lines of either Red (2) or Green (3) located *only* on the bottom row of the grid.\n3.  A cross shape's color is modified *only if* it is located directly above a *Red* trigger line, sharing the exact same column span (columns `c` to `c+4`). The cross occupies rows H-4 to H-2 when the line is on row H-1.\n4.  If a cross is above a *Green* trigger line (matching columns), its color is unchanged.\n5.  All Red and Green trigger lines on the bottom row are removed (replaced by the background color) in the output, irrespective of whether a cross was found above them.\n\nThe strategy needs refinement to specifically target these 1x5 bottom-row lines and then check only the precise location above them for the specific 3x5 cross shape. This avoids generalized, potentially slow shape detection across the entire grid.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n| Example   | Dimensions | Background Color | Red Lines (Bottom Row) | Green Lines (Bottom Row) | Line Columns (Start, End)                      | Approx.
