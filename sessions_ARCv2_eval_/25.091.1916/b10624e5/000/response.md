Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are square (27x27 in the examples). They consistently feature a yellow (4) background.
2.  **Dividing Lines:** A central vertical blue (1) line and a central horizontal blue (1) line divide the grid into four quadrants. These lines are present in both input and output and appear unchanged.
3.  **Quadrants:** The key activity happens within the four quadrants defined by the blue lines.
4.  **Source Pattern:** The top-left quadrant of the input contains a distinct pattern or object composed of various colors (excluding the background yellow and the dividing line blue).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves taking the pattern from the input's top-left quadrant and replicating it, with reflections, into the other three quadrants of the output grid.
6.  **Reflection Axes:** The blue lines serve as the axes for these reflections.
    *   The top-right quadrant in the output is a horizontal reflection of the top-left pattern across the vertical blue line.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant in the output is a vertical reflection of the top-left pattern across the horizontal blue line.
    *   The bottom-right quadrant in the output is a reflection of the top-left pattern across both lines (a 180-degree rotation or diagonal reflection).
7.  **Overwriting:** Any original patterns present in the input grid's top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants are disregarded and overwritten in the output grid by the reflected patterns.
8.  **Consistency:** The background color and the dividing blue lines are preserved exactly from input to output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color, which is yellow (4).
3.  Find the row index (`center_row`) of the horizontal blue (1) line and the column index (`center_col`) of the vertical blue (1) line. These define the center of the grid and the boundaries of the four quadrants.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled entirely with the background color (yellow).
5.  Copy the horizontal blue line from the input grid (row `center_row`) to the output grid.
6.  Copy the vertical blue line from the input grid (column `center_col`) to the output grid.
7.  Isolate the pattern present in the top-left quadrant of the *input* grid. This quadrant consists of cells `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < center_row` and `0 <= c < center_col`. Iterate through these cells.
8.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the input's top-left quadrant:
    *   Get the color `C` at `input[r, c]`.
    *   If `C` is *not* the background color (yellow) and *not* the line color (blue):
        *   **Copy to Top-Left:** Set the color of the output grid at `(r, c)` to `C`.
        *   **Reflect Horizontally to Top-Right:** Calculate the reflected column `c_reflected = center_col + (center_col - c)`. Set the color of the output grid at `(r, c_reflected)` to `C`.
        *   **Reflect Vertically to Bottom-Left:** Calculate the reflected row `r_reflected = center_row + (center_row - r)`. Set the color of the output grid at `(r_reflected, c)` to `C`.
        *   **Reflect Diagonally to Bottom-Right:** Set the color of the output grid at `(r_reflected, c_reflected)` to `C`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
