# Define the standard 5x3 pixel patterns for the letters
# (Relative coordinates (row, col) from top-left origin)
LetterPatterns:
  H: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [0,2], [1,2], [2,2], [3,2], [4,2], [2,1]]
  E: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [0,1], [0,2], [2,1], [2,2], [4,1], [4,2]]
  L: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [4,1], [4,2]]
  MirroredL: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,2], [3,2], [4,2], [4,1], [4,0]]

# Define mapping from identified small object types to letters
# (Based on analysis of the three examples)
SmallObjectToLetterMap:
  - ObjectType: "Red frame, Azure center" # Example 1, Object 1
    Letter: E
  - ObjectType: "Green frame, Red center" # Example 1, Object 2
    Letter: H
  - ObjectType: "Solid Azure square" # Example 1, Object 3
    Letter: L
    Mirrored: True # Special flag for this object type
  - ObjectType: "Red frame, Yellow center/pattern" # Example 2, Objects 1 & 2 (assume they map uniquely despite similarity)
    Letter: H # Tentative assignment for first matching rect
    Letter: E # Tentative assignment for second matching rect
  - ObjectType: "Green cross" # Example 3, Object 1
    Letter: L
  - ObjectType: "Azure complex shape" # Example 3, Object 2
    Letter: L

Elements:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - BackgroundColor: The most frequent color not part of large framed rectangles or small objects.
  - Type: LargeFramedRectangle
    Properties:
      - FrameColor: Color of the 1-pixel border.
      - FillColor: Color of the solid inner area.
      - Location: Bounding box coordinates.
  - Type: SmallObject
    Properties:
      - ObjectColor: The primary or outer color.
      - InnerDetails: Pattern or color(s) inside the object.
      - Location: Bounding box coordinates.
      - ObjectType: A classification based on shape/color pattern (e.g., "Red frame, Azure center", "Green cross").

Actions:
  - Action: Identify
    Target: BackgroundColor, LargeFramedRectangles, SmallObjects
  - Action: Classify
    Target: SmallObjects (assign ObjectType)
  - Action: Create
    Target: Output grid (filled with BackgroundColor)
  - Action: Copy
    Source: FrameColor pixels of LargeFramedRectangles
    Destination: Output grid
  - Action: Fill
    Target: Inner area of frames in Output grid
    Color: FillColor of the corresponding LargeFramedRectangle
  - Action: Match
    Source: FillColor of each LargeFramedRectangle
    Target: ObjectColor of SmallObjects
    Result: A pairing between each LargeFramedRectangle and one SmallObject.
  - Action: SelectPattern
    BasedOn: The ObjectType of the matched SmallObject (using SmallObjectToLetterMap)
    Result: Letter pattern (H, E, L) and Mirrored flag.
  - Action: DrawPattern
    Target: FillColor area within the frame on the Output grid
    Pattern: Selected letter pattern
    Color: FrameColor of the LargeFramedRectangle
    Offset: (row + 1, col + 1) from the top-left of the FillColor area.
  - Action: DrawMirroredPattern (Conditional)
    Condition: Mirrored flag is True for the selected pattern.
    Target: FillColor area within the frame on the Output grid
    Pattern: Mirrored version of the selected letter pattern
    Color: FrameColor of the LargeFramedRectangle
    Offset: (row + 1, col + 1 + pattern_width + 1) from the top-left of the FillColor area.

Relationships:
  - Each LargeFramedRectangle in the input corresponds to a modified region in the output.
  - Each SmallObject in the input is removed in the output.
  - Each LargeFramedRectangle is implicitly linked to one SmallObject via matching the rectangle's FillColor to the object's ObjectColor.
  - The type of the linked SmallObject determines the letter pattern drawn within the LargeFramedRectangle's fill area.
