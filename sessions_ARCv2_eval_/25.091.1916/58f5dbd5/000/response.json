            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels with different colors.\n2.  **Framed Objects:** The input grids contain distinct rectangular objects. These objects consist of an inner \"content\" area displaying a pattern and a single-pixel-thick \"frame\" surrounding the content. The frame is always a single, uniform color for a given object. The content area uses the frame color and one other distinct \"content color\".\n3.  **Object Properties:** Key properties of these framed objects are their frame color, content color, and the dimensions of the inner content area (height x width).\n4.  **Object Grouping:** In each input grid, there appears to be a collection of these framed objects that share the same frame color and the same content dimensions. These objects are arranged adjacent to each other (horizontally, vertically, or in a grid), separated only by their single-pixel frames.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The transformation focuses on the *largest* such group of identically framed and sized objects that form a contiguous arrangement (row, column, or grid).\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:\n    *   Identifying the largest group of contiguous, identically framed and sized objects.\n    *   Extracting the *content patterns* from these selected objects.\n    *   Constructing the output grid by arranging these content patterns in the same relative spatial configuration as they appeared in the input.\n    *   Rebuilding the frame structure: using the original frame color for a single-pixel border around the entire output assembly and also as single-pixel separators between the constituent content patterns.\n7.  **Output Dimensions:** The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the number and size of the selected content patterns, plus the necessary frame pixels. For example, if 'N' 5x5 content patterns are arranged vertically, the output height is (N * 5) + (N - 1) * 1 (internal frames) + 2 * 1 (outer frames), and the output width is 5 + 2 * 1 (outer frames). Similar logic applies to horizontal or grid arrangements.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Scan the input grid** to identify all \"framed rectangular objects\". A framed object is defined by a single-pixel thick border of a uniform color (the `frame_color`) surrounding a rectangular `content_area`. The `content_area` must contain only pixels of the `frame_color` and one other single color (the `content_color`), and must have dimensions of at least 1x1. Record the `frame_color`, `content_color`, `content_area` dimensions (height `H`, width `W`), the `content_pattern` (the grid snippet of the content area), and the top-left position of each identified object's content area.\n2.  **Group the identified objects** based on identical `frame_color` and identical `content_area` dimensions (`H`x`W`).\n3.  **For each group**, determine the connectivity of its objects. Objects are considered connected if their frames touch or are separated by exactly one pixel line (which would be part of the frame structure if they were adjacent). Find the largest connected set of objects within each group.\n4.  **Select the target group**: Choose the group whose largest connected set contains the maximum number of objects. If there's a tie, the selection criteria are currently undefined by the examples (assume picking the first one found or based on position/color index if needed, but examples suggest a unique largest group). Let the selected objects be `S`, their common `frame_color` be `F`, and their common content dimensions be `H`x`W`.\n5.  **Determine the arrangement** of objects in `S` (e.g., a 1xN row, Nx1 column, or MxN grid) based on their relative positions in the input grid.\n6.  **Construct the output grid**:\n    *   Calculate the output dimensions based on the number of objects in `S`, their arrangement (M rows, N columns), their content dimensions (`H`x`W`), and the single-pixel frames/separators.\n        *   Output Height = (M * H) + (M - 1) * 1 + 2 * 1\n        *   Output Width = (N * W) + (N - 1) * 1 + 2 * 1\n    *   Initialize the output grid with the `frame_color` `F`.\n    *   Iterate through the objects in `S` according to their relative positions. For each object at relative position (row `r`, column `c`) (0-indexed):\n        *   Calculate the top-left corner `(out_y, out_x)` within the output grid where its content pattern should be placed:\n            *   `out_y = 1 + r * (H + 1)`\n            *   `out_x = 1 + c * (W + 1)`\n        *   Copy the object's `content_pattern` (an `H`x`W` grid snippet) into the output grid starting at `(out_y, out_x)`.\n7.  **Return the constructed output grid.**"
