task_elements:
  - description: Input and Output Grids
    properties:
      format: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      colors: Mapped 0-9
  - description: Framed Objects (in Input)
    properties:
      structure: Rectangular content area surrounded by a single-pixel frame
      frame_color: Uniform color for the frame pixels
      content_area: Contains pixels of frame_color and one other content_color
      content_pattern: The arrangement of frame_color and content_color pixels within the content area
      content_dimensions: Height and Width of the content area (excluding the frame)
  - description: Object Groups (in Input)
    properties:
      criteria: Objects sharing the same frame_color and content_dimensions
      arrangement: Objects are spatially contiguous (horizontally, vertically, or in a grid), separated only by single frame lines.
  - description: Selection Rule
    properties:
      action: Identify the group with the maximum number of objects satisfying the grouping criteria.
      target: The largest contiguous group of identically framed and sized objects.
  - description: Transformation Process
    properties:
      step_1: Identify the target group of objects.
      step_2: Extract the content_pattern from each object in the group.
      step_3: Determine the frame_color of the group.
      step_4: Arrange the extracted content_patterns in the output grid, preserving their relative positions from the input.
      step_5: Reconstruct the frame structure using the frame_color:
        - Single-pixel border around the entire output assembly.
        - Single-pixel separators between adjacent content_patterns.
  - description: Output Grid
    properties:
      content: Composed of the arranged content_patterns from the selected input objects.
      structure: Includes the reconstructed frame using the original frame_color.
      dimensions: Determined by the size and arrangement of the selected content_patterns plus the frame pixels.

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    input_objects: Multiple framed objects (5x5 content) with azure '8' frames.
    selected_group: Three vertically aligned objects (content: blue '1', magenta '6', yellow '4') on the right.
    frame_color: azure '8'
    output: 19x7 grid containing the three content patterns arranged vertically with azure '8' frames/separators.
  - example: train_2
    input_objects: Multiple framed objects (5x5 content) with yellow '4' frames.
    selected_group: Three horizontally aligned objects (content: blue '1', red '2', green '3') on the top.
    frame_color: yellow '4'
    output: 7x19 grid containing the three content patterns arranged horizontally with yellow '4' frames/separators.
  - example: train_3
    input_objects: Multiple framed objects (5x5 content) with blue '1' frames.
    selected_group: Four objects arranged in a 2x2 grid (content: azure '8', yellow '4', green '3', maroon '9') in the top-left.
    frame_color: blue '1'
    output: 13x13 grid containing the four content patterns arranged in a 2x2 grid with blue '1' frames/separators.
