            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept of removing enclosed pixels for Examples 2 and 3 but failed in its aggregation and placement logic for the new indicator pixels. The key errors were:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Aggregation:** The code grouped all removed pixels of a single color across the *entire grid* before determining where to add indicator pixels. Example 2 demonstrated that different groups of enclosed pixels (even of the same color) need separate processing for adding indicators.\n2.  **Flawed Tie-Breaking:** The initial \"leftmost column with max frequency\" tie-breaker was insufficient or incorrect, as shown by Example 3 where column 5 was chosen despite columns 3, 5, and 6 all having the same maximum frequency of 2 removed pixels.\n3.  **Rule Mismatch for Example 1:** The \"enclosed by white space\" definition used does not apply to Example 1, where pixels *outside* the main shapes are modified. This example follows a different pattern.\n\nThe refined strategy is to:\n\n1.  Identify all non-white pixels unreachable from the boundary via white cells (`find_unreachable_non_white`).\n2.  Group these unreachable pixels into connected components based on color and adjacency *to each other*. Each component represents a distinct \"Enclosed Group\".\n3.  Process each Enclosed Group independently:\n    *   Remove the group's pixels from the grid.\n    *   Calculate column frequencies and unique rows *for that specific group*.\n    *   Determine the target column using max frequency, with a refined tie-breaker based on proximity to the group's column centroid (average column index), defaulting to leftmost if still tied.\n    *   Add indicator pixels (count = unique rows) of the group's color to the top of the target column.\n4.  Acknowledge that Example 1 is not covered by this revised logic.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the code execution analysis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Target Rule: Appears unrelated to simple enclosure. Involves removing specific magenta (6) and orange (7) pixels near yellow (4) and green (3) shapes, respectively, and adding new ones elsewhere. The `find_unreachable_non_white` method is not suitable here.\n    *   Removed: `[((2, 3), 6), ((3, 2), 6), ((8, 6), 7), ((9, 7), 7)]`\n    *   Added: `[((3, 7), 6), ((3, 8), 6), ((10, 1), 7), ((10, 2), 7)]`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Target Rule: Enclosure.\n    *   Removed Pixels (Maroon, 9): `[(5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 1), (7, 2)]`\n    *   Enclosed Groups (Maroon, 9):\n        *   Group A: `[(5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 2)]` (Connected)\n            *   Cols: `{1: 1, 2: 2}` -> Max Freq: 2 -> Candidate Cols: `[2]` -> Target Col: 2\n            *   Unique Rows: `{5, 6, 7}` -> N=3\n            *   Action: Add 3 maroon pixels to col 2.\n        *   Group B: `[(5, 7)]` (Isolated)\n            *   Cols: `{7: 1}` -> Max Freq: 1 -> Candidate Cols: `[7]` -> Target Col: 7\n            *   Unique Rows: `{5}` -> N=1\n            *   Action: Add 1 maroon pixel to col 7.\n    *   Result: Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Target Rule: Enclosure.\n    *   Removed Pixels (Orange, 7): `[(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 5)]`\n    *   Enclosed Groups (Orange, 7):\n        *   Group A: All removed pixels form one connected group.\n            *   Cols: `{3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 2}` -> Max Freq: 2 -> Candidate Cols: `[3, 5, 6]`\n            *   Centroid Col: `(3+4+5+6+6+3+5)/7 = 32/7 \u2248 4.57`\n            *   Distances: `|3 - 4.57| = 1.57`, `|5 - 4.57| = 0.43`, `|6 - 4.57| = 1.43`\n            *   Closest Col: 5 -> Target Col: 5\n            *   Unique Rows: `{7, 8, 9}` -> N=3\n            *   Action: Add 3 orange pixels to col 5.\n    *   Result: Matches expected output using the centroid tie-breaker.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Background is white (0).\n  - Pixels: Individual cells with color and location (row, col).\n  - Unreachable Pixels: Non-white pixels unable to reach the grid boundary via only white (0) pixels.\n  - Enclosed Group: A connected component (4-way adjacency) of Unreachable Pixels sharing the same color. Processed independently.\n  - Removed Pixels: Pixels belonging to an Enclosed Group, changed to white (0).\n  - Indicator Pixels: Pixels added at the top of the grid (rows 0 to N-1) in a specific column.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Adjacency: Cardinal (4-way) connection between pixels. Used for grouping.\n  - Reachability (via White): Defines Unreachable Pixels based on BFS from boundary through white cells.\n  - Grouping: Unreachable Pixels are partitioned by color and then by adjacency into Enclosed Groups.\n\nActions:\n  - Find Unreachable: Identify all Unreachable Pixels.\n  - Group Unreachable: Find connected components within Unreachable Pixels of the same color.\n  - Process Group (for each Enclosed Group):\n      1.  Store Locations: Record (row, col) for all pixels in the group.\n      2.  Remove: Set corresponding pixels in the output grid to white (0).\n      3.  Calculate Column Frequencies: Count group pixels per column.\n      4.  Find Max Frequency: Determine the highest column frequency for the group.\n      5.  Identify Max Frequency Columns: List columns achieving the max frequency.\n      6.  Apply Tie-breaker (`target_col` selection):\n          *   If only one max frequency column, select it.\n          *   If multiple: Calculate the average column index (centroid) of the group's pixel locations. Select the column from the tied list closest to the centroid. If still tied (equidistant), select the leftmost (minimum index) tied column.\n      7.  Count Unique Rows (`N`): Find the number of distinct row indices in the group's locations.\n      8.  Add Indicators: Set pixels `(0..N-1, target_col)` in the output grid to the group's color.\n\nExclusions:\n  - Example 1 follows a pattern distinct from this enclosure/indicator logic.\n\nProperties:\n  - Color: Pixel value (0-9).\n  - Location: (row, column).\n  - Frequency: Count per column within a group.\n  - Centroid Column: Average column index of a group's pixels (used for tie-breaking).\n```"

Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid that cannot reach any boundary cell by moving only through adjacent white (0) pixels.\n3.  Partition these identified pixels into \"Enclosed Groups\". An Enclosed Group consists of pixels that:\n    a.  All have the same color.\n    b.  Form a single connected component using 4-way adjacency (considering only connections between the identified pixels of that same color).\n4.  For each Enclosed Group identified:\n    a.  Let `C` be the color of the group and `L` be the list of (row, column) locations of its pixels.\n    b.  For each location (r, c) in `L`, set the pixel at `output_grid[r, c]` to white (0).\n    c.  Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each column index within the locations `L`.\n    d.  Determine the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) observed.\n    e.  Create a list, `candidate_cols`, containing all column indices that achieved `max_freq`.\n    f.  Select the `target_col` from `candidate_cols`:\n        i.  If `candidate_cols` has only one element, use that element.\n        ii. If `candidate_cols` has multiple elements: Calculate the average column index (`avg_col`) of all locations in `L`. Find the column(s) in `candidate_cols` that minimize the absolute difference `|column_index - avg_col|`. If one column is uniquely closest, select it. If two or more columns are equally close, select the one with the smallest column index (leftmost).\n    g.  Count the number of unique row indices present in the locations `L`. Let this count be `N`.\n    h.  For each row index `i` from 0 to `N-1` (inclusive), set the pixel at `output_grid[i, target_col]` to color `C`, provided `i` is less than the total number of rows in the grid.\n5.  After processing all Enclosed Groups, return the final output grid. (Note: This procedure describes the logic for examples 2 and 3; example 1 follows a different pattern)."
