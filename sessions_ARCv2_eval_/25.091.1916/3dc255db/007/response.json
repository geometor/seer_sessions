Identify Unreachable Pixels: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid that cannot reach any boundary cell by moving only through adjacent white (0) pixels. This is achieved using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all white boundary cells.\n2.  Group Unreachable Pixels: Partition the identified unreachable pixels into \"Enclosed Groups\". An Enclosed Group consists of pixels that:\n    a.  All have the same color.\n    b.  Form a single connected component using 4-way adjacency (considering only connections between the identified unreachable pixels of that same color).\n3.  Process Each Group: For every Enclosed Group found:\n    a.  Remove Group Pixels: Change the color of all pixels belonging to the group to white (0) in the output grid.\n    b.  Determine Target Columns: Identify the set of all unique column indices occupied by the pixels within the group.\n    c.  Determine Indicator Count (`N`): Count the number of unique row indices occupied by the pixels within the group.\n    d.  Add Indicator Pixels: For *each* unique target column identified in step 3b, change the color of the top `N` pixels (rows 0 to N-1) in that column to the group's color. Overwriting may occur if multiple groups target the same top cells.\n4.  Final Grid: The grid after processing all Enclosed Groups is the final output.\n(Note: This procedure is specifically designed to match the pattern observed in training examples 2 and 3. Example 1 exhibits a different transformation pattern not captured by this rule, involving pixels *outside* the main shapes.)\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_unreachable_non_white(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all non-white pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary via white cells.\n    Uses BFS starting from the boundary, propagating only through white cells (0).\n    Returns a set of ((r, c), color) tuples for unreachable non-white pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    reachable = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    q = deque()\n    unreachable_pixels = set() # Store as ((row, col), color)\n\n    # Initialize BFS queue with boundary white cells\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]:\n            if not reachable[r, c] and grid[r, c] == 0:\n                q.append((r, c))\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n             if not reachable[r, c] and grid[r, c] == 0:\n                q.append((r, c))\n                reachable[r, c] = True\n\n    # Perform BFS through white cells\n    while q:\n        r, c = q.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n               not reachable[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                reachable[nr, nc] = True\n                q.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # Identify non-white pixels that were not reached by the white-cell BFS\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not reachable[r, c]:\n                unreachable_pixels.add(((r, c), grid[r,c]))\n\n    return unreachable_pixels\n\ndef group_unreachable_pixels(unreachable_pixels_with_color, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Groups unreachable pixels into connected components based on color and adjacency.\n    Args:\n        unreachable_pixels_with_color: A set of ((r, c), color) tuples.\n        grid: The original input grid (needed for color checks).\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary {color: [group1_locations, group2_locations, ...]}\n        where each group_locations is a list of (r, c) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set() # Keep track of visited pixel locations (r, c)\n    groups = {}\n    # Create a set of just locations for efficient checking\n    unreachable_locations = {loc for loc, color in unreachable_pixels_with_color}\n\n    for pixel_loc, color in unreachable_pixels_with_color:\n        if pixel_loc not in visited:\n            current_group = []\n            q = deque([pixel_loc])\n            visited.add(pixel_loc)\n\n            # Start BFS to find connected component of the same color within unreachable pixels\n            while q:\n                r, c = q.popleft()\n                current_group.append((r,c))\n\n                # Explore neighbors\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    neighbor_loc = (nr, nc)\n\n                    # Check if neighbor is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                        # Check if neighbor is also unreachable, has the same color, and hasn't been visited yet\n                        if neighbor_loc in unreachable_locations and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and \\\n                           neighbor_loc not in visited:\n                            \n                            # Verify it's in the original set (redundant if unreachable_locations is correct, but safe)\n                            is_target_unreachable = False\n                            for loc, clr in unreachable_pixels_with_color:\n                                if loc == neighbor_loc and clr == color:\n                                    is_target_unreachable = True\n                                    break\n                            \n                            if is_target_unreachable:\n                                visited.add(neighbor_loc)\n                                q.append(neighbor_loc)\n\n            # Store the found group associated with its color\n            if color not in groups:\n                groups[color] = []\n            groups[color].append(current_group)\n\n    return groups\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the enclosure transformation rule derived from examples 2 and 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
