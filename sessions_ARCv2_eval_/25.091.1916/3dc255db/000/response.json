            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe examples involve grids containing distinct colored objects on a white background. The key transformation seems to involve interactions between objects where one object encloses pixels of another color.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Shows yellow and green shapes, with nearby magenta and orange pixels respectively. In the output, some magenta and orange pixels are removed, and new ones appear elsewhere. This example seems distinct from the others; the magenta/orange pixels are *outside* the main shapes, and the transformation rule isn't immediately obvious or consistent with Examples 2 and 3. The removal seems related to adjacency between same-colored pixels (magenta-magenta, orange-orange), but the placement of new pixels is unclear.\n*   **Example 2:** Shows a green shape enclosing maroon pixels and a magenta shape also enclosing maroon pixels. In the output, the enclosed maroon pixels are gone. New maroon pixels appear at the top of the columns where the enclosed pixels were originally located.\n*   **Example 3:** Shows a magenta shape enclosing several orange pixels. In the output, the enclosed orange pixels are removed. New orange pixels appear at the top of one specific column (the leftmost column that contained the most enclosed orange pixels). The number of new orange pixels matches the number of distinct rows that contained the removed orange pixels.\n\n**Conclusion:** Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate a consistent pattern: a colored shape encloses pixels of a different color. These enclosed pixels are removed, and new pixels of that same color are added to the top of the grid in the column that originally contained the most enclosed pixels (leftmost in case of a tie). The number of new pixels equals the number of rows involved in the enclosure. Example 1 does not seem to follow this enclosure rule and might represent a different pattern or edge case not fully captured by the other examples. I will focus the documentation and program on the clear enclosure pattern observed in Examples 2 and 3.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Background is white (0).\n  - Objects: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels.\n  - Enclosing Object: An object whose pixels form a boundary completely surrounding pixels of a different non-white color.\n  - Enclosed Pixels: Non-white pixels located within the boundary of an Enclosing Object of a different color.\n  - Enclosed Color: The color of the Enclosed Pixels.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Enclosure: An Enclosing Object spatially surrounds Enclosed Pixels. A pixel is enclosed if any path from it to the grid boundary must cross a pixel of the Enclosing Object.\n\nActions:\n  - Identify Enclosures: Find all pairs of (Enclosing Object, Enclosed Pixels of a specific Enclosed Color).\n  - Remove: Change the color of all identified Enclosed Pixels to white (0).\n  - Analyze Columns: For each Enclosed Color removed:\n      - Count how many pixels were removed in each column.\n      - Find the maximum count.\n      - Identify the column index(es) with the maximum count.\n      - Select the minimum (leftmost) column index among those with the maximum count.\n  - Analyze Rows: For each Enclosed Color removed:\n      - Count the number of unique row indices (`N`) from which pixels were removed.\n  - Add: In the selected column, change the color of the top `N` pixels (rows 0 to N-1) to the Enclosed Color.\n\nProperties:\n  - Color: The integer value (0-9) of a pixel.\n  - Location: The (row, column) index of a pixel.\n  - Shape: The configuration of pixels forming an object.\n  - Connectivity: Pixels are connected cardinally (up, down, left, right). (Note: Flood fill for enclosure might need to consider diagonals or just ensure no path to edge exists).\n\nRule Focus: The transformation primarily targets pixels enclosed by objects of a different color, as seen consistently in examples 2 and 3. Example 1's behavior seems different and is not covered by this primary rule.\n```"

Count the number of unique row indices among the recorded locations. Let this count be `N`.\n    g.  In the chosen leftmost column with the maximum frequency, set the color of the pixels in rows 0 to `N-1` to the enclosed color.\n4.  Repeat step 3 for all identified enclosures.\n5.
