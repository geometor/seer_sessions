Okay, let's analyze the task examples provided.

## Perception

The task involves identifying specific shapes or regions within the input grid and using information from other regions to modify them.

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct regions characterized by a dominant background color and often some internal "noise" or pattern pixels of a different color. In `train_1`, we see Blue, Yellow, Red, and Green regions against an Azure background. The Blue and Yellow regions contain Azure pixels internally. The Red and Green regions also contain Azure pixels internally. In `train_2`, we see Yellow, Green, Azure, and Blue regions containing Red pixels internally. Elsewhere, there are regions primarily composed of Red pixels containing patterns of Maroon, Gray, Blue, and Orange.
2.  **Key Colors:** Certain colors seem to act as placeholders or backgrounds. In `train_1`, Azure (8) acts as both the main grid background and the internal "noise" within the Blue and Yellow regions. It also forms the background for the Red and Green patterns. In `train_2`, Red (2) acts as the internal "noise" within the Yellow, Green, Azure, and Blue regions, and also serves as the background for the Maroon, Gray, Blue, and Orange patterns.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to select some of the initial regions (the "templates", e.g., Blue and Yellow in `train_1`; Yellow, Green, Azure, Blue in `train_2`) and modify their internal structure. The placeholder pixels within these templates (Azure in `train_1`, Red in `train_2`) are replaced by colors derived from the other "pattern" regions (Red and Green patterns in `train_1`; Maroon, Orange, Blue, Gray patterns in `train_2`).
4.  **Pairing:** There's a specific pairing mechanism determining which pattern color replaces the placeholder pixels in which template. In `train_1`, the top-left Blue template gets modified using the Red pattern color, and the top-right Yellow template gets modified using the Green pattern color. In `train_2`, the pairings are Yellow->Maroon, Green->Orange, Azure->Blue, Blue->Gray. The exact rule for this pairing needs to be determined, but it seems consistent across examples.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is constructed by assembling the modified template regions. The size and arrangement of the output grid depend on the number and original relative positions of the template regions selected from the input. `train_1` combines two 6x6 modified templates horizontally into a 6x12 output. `train_2` combines four 8x8 modified templates in a 2x2 grid to form a 16x16 output.

```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: Placeholder Color Identification
    description: Identify a color that appears consistently as internal pixels within multiple larger regions ('templates') and also as the background for other distinct patterns ('patterns').
    examples:
      - train_1: Azure (8) is inside Blue(1)/Yellow(4) templates and background for Red(2)/Green(3) patterns.
      - train_2: Red (2) is inside Yellow(4)/Green(3)/Azure(8)/Blue(1) templates and background for Maroon(9)/Gray(5)/Blue(1)/Orange(7) patterns.

  - name: Template Objects
    description: Contiguous regions defined by a primary outer color, containing internal pixels of the 'Placeholder Color'. These act as the base shapes for the output.
    properties:
      - location (bounding box)
      - outer_color
      - internal_placeholder_color
      - size (height, width)
    examples:
      - train_1: Blue(1)/Azure(8) region (6x6), Yellow(4)/Azure(8) region (6x6).
      - train_2: Yellow(4)/Red(2) region (8x8), Green(3)/Red(2) region (8x8), Azure(8)/Red(2) region (8x8), Blue(1)/Red(2) region (8x8).

  - name: Pattern Objects
    description: Regions predominantly consisting of the 'Placeholder Color' but containing a distinct pattern made of another color ('Pattern Color'). These provide the fill colors for modifying templates.
    properties:
      - location (bounding box)
      - pattern_color
      - background_placeholder_color
    examples:
      - train_1: Red(2) pattern within Azure(8) background, Green(3) pattern within Azure(8) background.
      - train_2: Maroon(9) pattern within Red(2) background, Gray(5) pattern within Red(2) background, Blue(1) pattern within Red(2) background, Orange(7) pattern within Red(2) background.

  - name: Template-Pattern Pairing
    description: A rule mapping each Template Object to a specific Pattern Object. The Pattern Color from the paired Pattern Object determines the replacement color for the Placeholder Color pixels within the Template Object.
    observed_pairings:
      - train_1: Blue/Azure template -> Red pattern; Yellow/Azure template -> Green pattern.
      - train_2: Yellow/Red template -> Maroon pattern; Green/Red template -> Orange pattern; Azure/Red template -> Blue pattern; Blue/Red template -> Gray pattern.
    hypothesis: The pairing might be based on relative spatial positions or order of detection, although the exact mechanism isn't fully determined yet.

  - name: Pixel Replacement Action
    description: Within each Template Object's grid, replace all pixels matching the 'Placeholder Color' with the 'Pattern Color' obtained from its paired Pattern Object.
    target: Pixels matching Placeholder Color inside Template Object grid.
    replacement: Pattern Color from the paired Pattern Object.

  - name: Output Grid Assembly
    description: Arrange the modified Template Object grids to form the final output grid. The arrangement preserves the relative spatial positioning of the original Template Objects.
    properties:
      - output_dimensions (derived from template sizes and count)
      - arrangement (e.g., horizontal concatenation, 2x2 grid)
    examples:
      - train_1: Two 6x6 modified templates arranged horizontally -> 6x12 output.
      - train_2: Four 8x8 modified templates arranged in a 2x2 grid based on original positions -> 16x16 output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze the input grid** to identify the 'Placeholder Color'. This color typically appears inside multiple distinct larger regions and also serves as the background for separate pattern regions.
2.  **Identify all 'Template Objects'**: Find contiguous regions defined by a primary outer color (C1) that contain internal pixels of the Placeholder Color (P). Record their location, size, outer color (C1), and the internal placeholder color (P).
3.  **Identify all 'Pattern Objects'**: Find regions that are predominantly composed of the Placeholder Color (P) but contain a distinct pattern made of a different color ('Pattern Color', C2). Record the Pattern Color (C2) associated with each such region.
4.  **Determine the Pairing Rule**: Establish a one-to-one mapping between each Template Object and a Pattern Object. Use the observed pairings in the examples (e.g., Blue template -> Red pattern in train_1; Yellow template -> Maroon pattern in train_2, etc.) to deduce the rule (potentially based on relative positions or order).
5.  **Determine Output Grid Structure**: Calculate the dimensions and layout of the output grid based on the number, sizes, and relative original positions of the identified Template Objects.
6.  **Perform Transformation for each Pair**:
    a.  For each Template Object (Ti) paired with a Pattern Object (Pi):
    b.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the Template Object Ti.
    c.  Identify the Placeholder Color (P) pixels within this subgrid.
    d.  Identify the Pattern Color (C2) associated with the paired Pattern Object Pi.
    e.  Create a modified subgrid by replacing all instances of color P with color C2.
7.  **Assemble the Output Grid**: Place the modified subgrids into the final output grid according to the structure determined in step 5, maintaining the relative positions of the original templates.
8.  **Return the assembled output grid.**
