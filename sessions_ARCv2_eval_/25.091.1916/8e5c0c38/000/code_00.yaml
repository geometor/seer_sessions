task_description: Modifies objects by removing pixels based on their local neighborhood connectivity.

definitions:
  - background_color: The color that occupies the most cells in the input grid.
  - object_pixel: A pixel whose color is not the background_color.
  - neighbor: Any of the 8 cells directly or diagonally adjacent to a given cell.
  - same_color_neighbor: A neighbor cell that has the same color as the central cell being considered.

examples:
  - id: train_1
    input:
      background_color: 8 # azure
      objects:
        - color: 1 # blue
        - color: 6 # magenta
        - color: 2 # red
      transformation:
        action: remove_pixels
        condition: Pixels with exactly 3 same_color_neighbors are changed to the background_color (8).
    output:
      preserves:
        - grid_dimensions
        - background_color
        - object_colors (partially)
      changes:
        - Specific pixels within objects are replaced by the background_color.
  - id: train_2
    input:
      background_color: 0 # white
      objects:
        - color: 2 # red
        - color: 8 # azure
        - color: 4 # yellow
      transformation:
        action: remove_pixels
        condition: Pixels with exactly 3 same_color_neighbors are changed to the background_color (0).
    output:
      preserves:
        - grid_dimensions
        - background_color
        - object_colors (partially)
      changes:
        - Specific pixels within objects are replaced by the background_color.

general_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the background color (most frequent color in the input grid).
  - step: 2
    action: Create a copy of the input grid for modification.
  - step: 3
    action: Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: For each cell that is NOT the background color:
      - sub_step: 4.1
        action: Count its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) that have the same color as the cell itself.
      - sub_step: 4.2
        condition: If the count of same_color_neighbors is exactly 3.
        action: Change the color of the corresponding cell in the copied grid to the background color.
  - step: 5
    action: Return the modified grid.
