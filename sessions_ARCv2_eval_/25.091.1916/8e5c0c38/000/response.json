The background pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern of Removal:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the removed pixels seem to be 'weakly connected' parts of the objects. Specifically, observing the neighbours (including diagonals) of the pixels that are removed, they consistently have exactly 3 neighbours of the *same* color as themselves. Pixels with fewer or more than 3 same-colored neighbours remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
