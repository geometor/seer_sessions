            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a green seed, blue/red barriers, an azure background, and a flood fill mechanism. However, the generated code failed because the flood fill implementation incorrectly propagated the green color, overwriting the azure background entirely instead of being constrained by it and the barriers.\n\nThe key errors in the previous logic/code were:\n1.  The flood fill condition likely did not correctly check if the target cell was specifically the background color (azure, 8) before filling.\n2.  The barrier logic might not have been fully robust; the fill must stop at *any* non-azure cell encountered *after* the initial blue-to-red conversion.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-analyze the examples to precisely define the conditions under which a cell is filled green.\n2.  Verify the barrier mechanism: blue pixels become red, and *all* red pixels (original and converted) block the fill. The fill *only* replaces azure pixels.\n3.  Gather metrics to confirm grid properties and object locations.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the fill and barrier rules.\n5.  The subsequent coding phase will implement this refined logic, ensuring the flood fill only targets azure pixels and stops correctly at boundaries and non-azure cells.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
