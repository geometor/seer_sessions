Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid and change their color to red (2) in the output grid. These red pixels, along with any pre-existing red (2) pixels in the input, will form barriers.\n3. Locate the single green (3) pixel in the original input grid; this is the starting seed for the flood fill.\n4. Perform a flood fill operation starting from the seed coordinates.\n5. The fill color is green (3), and it spreads only into adjacent azure (8) pixels.\n6. The fill propagates horizontally and vertically (4-connectivity).\n7. The fill is blocked by any red (2) pixels (either originally red or converted from blue) and by the grid boundaries.\n8. Return the modified output grid containing the original non-azure/non-blue pixels, the converted blue-to-red pixels, and the green filled area.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill transformation starting from a green seed, replacing azure pixels,\n    and bounded by red barriers (original red or converted blue).\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list of integers representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list of integers representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input_grid list of lists to numpy array for efficient manipulation\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
