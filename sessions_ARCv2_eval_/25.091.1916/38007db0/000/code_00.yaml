elements:
  - object: grid_structure
    description: Input consists of a grid formed by separator lines.
    properties:
      line_thickness: 1 pixel
      separator_color: Determined by the pixel at (0,0). (Blue in train_1, Green in train_2)
  - object: content_block
    description: Square areas enclosed by the separator grid lines containing distinct patterns.
    properties:
      size: Determined by the spacing between separator lines (e.g., 5x5 if lines are 6 pixels apart).
      arrangement: Arranged in a 2D grid layout (e.g., 3x3 in train_1, 3x4 in train_2).
      location: Defined by their top-left corner relative to the separator grid.
relationships:
  - type: separation
    object1: content_block
    object2: content_block
    details: Adjacent content blocks are separated by a single line of the separator color, both horizontally and vertically.
  - type: selection
    object: content_block
    criteria: Belongs to the rightmost column in the arrangement of content blocks within the input grid.
actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: separator_color
    method: Check pixel color at (0,0).
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: grid_spacing
    method: Find the distance between parallel separator lines.
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: content_block_locations
    method: Determine the coordinates of the top-left corner of each content block.
  - action: extract
    actor: system
    target: content_blocks
    condition: Located in the rightmost column of the block arrangement.
  - action: construct
    actor: system
    target: output_grid
    components:
      - extracted content blocks
      - separator lines (horizontal and immediate vertical)
    details: Vertically stack the extracted blocks, placing them within a new grid structure using the original separator color. The output width accommodates one block and its vertical separators. The output height matches the input height.
