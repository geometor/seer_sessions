These lines form a grid structure.\n2.  **Separator Color:** The color of the separating lines is consistent throughout the input grid and is the same as the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0). In `train_1`, it's blue (1); in `train_2`, it's green (3).\n3.  **Content Blocks:** The areas enclosed by the separator lines contain distinct patterns. These content blocks are square. In the examples, these blocks are 5x5 pixels.\n4.  **Block Arrangement:** The content blocks are arranged in a larger grid format within the input. `train_1` has a 3x3 arrangement of content blocks, while `train_2` has a 3x4 arrangement.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to isolate and extract only the rightmost column of these content blocks from the input grid.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid reconstructs the vertical structure of the rightmost column of blocks from the input. It maintains the original height, the vertical arrangement of the selected blocks, and the separator lines (both horizontal and the vertical lines immediately surrounding the blocks). The width of the output corresponds to the width of one content block plus its left and right separator lines.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the grid pattern formed by the `separator_color`. Find the row indices and column indices where the separator lines occur. These lines are 1 pixel thick.\n3.  Calculate the `spacing` between consecutive parallel separator lines (this will be constant, e.g., 6 in the examples). The content blocks between the lines will have dimensions (`spacing`-1) x (`spacing`-1).\n4.  Identify the column index of the separator line that defines the left edge of the *rightmost* column of content blocks. Let this be `rightmost_block_start_col`. This corresponds to `1 + max_col_index * spacing`, where `max_col_index` is the index of the last column of blocks.\n5.  Identify the row indices where content blocks start. These are `1 + row_index * spacing`.\n6.  Extract all the square content blocks of size (`spacing`-1) x (`spacing`-1) whose top-left corner is at `(1 + row_index * spacing, rightmost_block_start_col)` for all valid `row_index` values.\n7.  Create a new output grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of `spacing` + 1.\n8.  Fill the output grid entirely with the `separator_color`.\n9.  For each extracted content block (obtained in step 6), copy its pixels into the output grid. The top-left corner of the `i`-th extracted block (corresponding to `row_index = i`) should be placed at position `(1 + i * spacing, 1)` in the output grid."
