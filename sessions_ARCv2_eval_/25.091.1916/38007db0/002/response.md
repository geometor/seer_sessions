**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: identifying a grid structure based on the top-left pixel color, determining the block size, and extracting the rightmost column of blocks. The generated code successfully implements this logic. However, the comparison reveals minor discrepancies (2 pixels off in each example) between the code's output and the expected output.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Precisely locate the differences:** Use code execution to pinpoint the exact coordinates and values where the generated output differs from the expected output in both training examples.
2.  **Analyze the differing pixels in context:** Examine the input grid values corresponding to the differing output pixels. Look at the specific block in the input's rightmost column from which these pixels were (or should have been) extracted.
3.  **Identify the pattern/rule modification:** Determine if the difference points to a modification rule applied *after* extracting the block, or perhaps a slight error in identifying the block boundaries or the exact extraction source. The error seems consistent across examples (2 pixels), suggesting a systematic rule rather than a random error.
4.  **Update the facts and natural language program:** Refine the description of the transformation to incorporate the newly discovered rule or correction.
