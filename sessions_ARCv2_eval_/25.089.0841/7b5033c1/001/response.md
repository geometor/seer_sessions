"""
Identify the background color from the top-left pixel.
Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors.
For each object, record its color, the count of its pixels, and the coordinate of its top-most, left-most pixel.
Sort these objects based on their top-left coordinates (row first, then column).
Construct a 1D list by concatenating lists for each sorted object, where each sublist contains the object's color repeated 'pixel_count' times.
Reshape this 1D list into a column vector (Nx1 grid) for the output.
