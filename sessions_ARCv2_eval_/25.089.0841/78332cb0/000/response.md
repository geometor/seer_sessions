Okay, let's break down the perception, facts, and the natural language program for this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Separators:** The key element in the input grids is the presence of lines made of magenta pixels (color 6). These lines act as separators, dividing the grid into distinct regions or panels. These separators can be horizontal, vertical, or both (forming a cross).
2.  **Panels/Subgrids:** The separators delineate smaller, typically square (often 5x5), subgrids or panels within the larger input grid. These panels contain distinct patterns or shapes made of various colors (red, blue, green, yellow, azure, maroon).
3.  **Background/Padding:** The areas outside the panels and separators are often filled with a neutral background color, orange (color 7) in these examples.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The core task is to rearrange these panels. The input arrangement (e.g., horizontal row, vertical stack, 2x2 grid) is transformed into a different arrangement in the output.
5.  **Orientation Change:** The overall orientation of the panel arrangement changes. If panels are arranged horizontally in the input, they are arranged vertically in the output, and vice-versa. If arranged in a 2x2 grid, they become a vertical stack.
6.  **Separator Change:** The orientation of the magenta separators in the output matches the new arrangement. Vertical stacks get horizontal separators, and horizontal rows get vertical separators.
7.  **Order Change:** The order in which the panels appear in the output depends on their original arrangement:
    *   If originally in a horizontal row (Left, Middle, Right), the output vertical stack keeps the same order (Top=Left, Middle=Middle, Bottom=Right).
    *   If originally in a vertical stack (Top, Middle, Bottom), the output horizontal row reverses the order (Left=Bottom, Middle=Middle, Right=Top).
    *   If originally in a 2x2 grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right), the output vertical stack takes the order: Top=Top-Left, Second=Bottom-Right, Third=Top-Right, Bottom=Bottom-Left.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input Structure:** Scan the input grid to find all horizontal and vertical lines composed entirely of magenta pixels (color 6). Determine how these lines divide the grid into distinct panels (subgrids). Note the background/padding color (e.g., orange 7).
2.  **Extract Panels:** Identify and extract each panel subgrid, excluding the separators and any padding. Determine the original spatial arrangement of these panels (e.g., a horizontal row, a vertical stack, or a 2x2 grid). Note the original position of each panel (e.g., Top-Left, Middle, Bottom-Right).
3.  **Reorder Panels:** Create a new sequence of panels based on the original arrangement:
    *   If the original arrangement was a **horizontal row** (e.g., Left, Middle, Right), keep the sequence the **same**.
    *   If the original arrangement was a **vertical stack** (e.g., Top, Middle, Bottom), **reverse** the sequence (Bottom, Middle, Top).
    *   If the original arrangement was a **2x2 grid** (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right), reorder the sequence to: **Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left**.
4.  **Determine Output Layout:**
    *   If the input arrangement was horizontal or 2x2, the output arrangement will be a **vertical stack**.
    *   If the input arrangement was vertical, the output arrangement will be a **horizontal row**.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Assemble the output grid by placing the reordered panels according to the determined output layout. Insert single lines of magenta pixels (color 6) as separators between adjacent panels. The separators should be horizontal for a vertical stack and vertical for a horizontal row. Ensure the dimensions of the output grid accommodate the panels and separators.
