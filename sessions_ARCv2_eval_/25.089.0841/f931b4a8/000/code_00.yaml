Input Grid Properties:
  - structure: Often divisible into four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR).
  - quadrant_content: Can be [SolidColor, SinglePattern, MultiPattern, Background].
  - dimensions: Variable (e.g., 8x8, 16x16).

Output Grid Properties:
  - derivation: Primarily derived from content in BL and/or BR input quadrants.
  - size: Variable, determined by the specific transformation rule (can be smaller, larger, or differently proportioned than input quadrants).
  - content: Can be extracted patterns, tiled patterns, combined/modified patterns, generated patterns, or composed rows.

Objects:
  - name: Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
    properties: [content_type, dimensions, colors, patterns]
  - name: Patterns
    properties: [colors, structure, location (within quadrant), dimensions]
  - name: Solid Colors
    properties: [color_value, location (within quadrant)]

Relationships & Actions:
  - relationship: Output depends on the content_type of BL and BR.
  - relationship: TL quadrant properties (e.g., dimensions) can influence transformations involving BR (e.g., tiling factor).
  - relationship: BL solid color can be used to modify patterns from BR (e.g., background replacement, border color).
  - action: Extract pattern from a quadrant.
  - action: Tile pattern from one quadrant based on properties of another.
  - action: Identify multiple patterns within a quadrant.
  - action: Replace background color within a pattern.
  - action: Combine/Arrange patterns.
  - action: Add border to a pattern/grid.
  - action: Generate new pattern based on colors from different quadrants.
  - action: Select specific rows from quadrants.
  - action: Stack rows to form the output.

Transformation Rules (Conditional):
  - condition: BL=Pattern, BR=Empty -> action: Extract BL pattern.
  - condition: BL=Pattern, BR=Pattern -> action: Tile BR pattern using TL dimensions.
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=MultiPattern -> action: Combine BR patterns, replace background with BL color, add BL color border.
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=CheckerboardPattern -> action: Generate new checkerboard from BL/BR colors, specific output size (2*H_in, W_in/2).
  - condition: BL=Solid, BR=RowBasedPattern -> action: Combine specific rows from BL and BR.
