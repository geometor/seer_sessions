Initialize the automaton state with the input grid, mapping azure (8) to 1 and white (0) to 0.\n2. Determine the number of iterations N = max(height, width).\n3. Iterate N times:\n   a. Create a new grid for the next state, initialized to all zeros (representing white).\n   b. For each cell (r, c) in the current grid:\n      i. Get the states (0 or 1) of the four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) from the current grid.\n      ii. Treat neighbors outside the grid boundaries as state 0.\n      iii. Calculate the sum of the states of these four neighbors.\n      iv. If the sum is odd (sum % 2 == 1), set the cell (r, c) in the new grid to 1.\n      v. Otherwise, the cell (r, c) in the new grid remains 0.\n   c. Update the current grid state to be the new grid state.\n4. After N iterations, convert the final grid state back to the original color scheme: change 1s back to azure (8) and keep 0s as white (0).\n5.
