The output grids modify the areas around these blue objects. The transformation involves creating a frame around each blue object and filling the region between the frame and the object with specific colors based on proximity to the frame. The original blue objects remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Multiple such shapes can exist. These shapes are preserved in the output.\n      - object: frame\n        color: 2\n        description: A one-pixel thick border created in the output grid around each primary_shape. It's located on background pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the primary_shape and also adjacent to the external background.\n      - object: fill_area\n        description: The region of background pixels enclosed by the frame but not part of the primary_shape.\n        parts:\n          - color: 8 # azure\n            location: Fill_area pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one frame pixel.\n          - color: 6 # magenta\n            location: Fill_area pixels that are *not* adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any frame pixel.

Identify the enclosed yellow pixels (`EnclosedYellow`).

(Alternatively, find all yellow pixels adjacent to the blue object, perform a flood fill outwards, stopping at `ActualFrame`. The filled yellow pixels are `EnclosedYellow`).\n        d.  Color the `ActualFrame` pixels red (2) in the output grid.\n        e.  For each pixel `p` in `EnclosedYellow`:\n            i.

If it is adjacent to a red pixel, color `p` azure (8) in the output grid.\n            iii. If it is *not* adjacent to any red pixel, color `p` magenta (6) in the output grid.\n    4.
