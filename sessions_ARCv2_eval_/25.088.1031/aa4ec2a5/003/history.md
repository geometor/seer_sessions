For each distinct blue object:
1. Identifies yellow pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the blue object.
2. Partitions these adjacent yellow pixels into two groups:
    a. 'Frame': Those adjacent yellow pixels that are also adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one yellow pixel *not* adjacent to the current blue object. These frame pixels are colored red (2).
    b. 'Fill': Those adjacent yellow pixels that are *not* 'Frame' pixels.
3. Colors the 'Fill' pixels based on their adjacency to the 'Frame':
    a. If a 'Fill' pixel is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any 'Frame' pixel (now colored red), it's colored azure (8).
    b. Otherwise, it's colored magenta (6).
4. The original blue object pixels and the rest of the yellow background pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'skimage'
## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to implement a transformation based on observations from a single example. The core idea involves identifying blue objects on a yellow background, finding adjacent yellow pixels, and classifying/coloring these adjacent pixels based on further adjacency rules into 'frame' (red), 'outer fill' (azure), and 'inner fill' (magenta).

The immediate error `No module named 'skimage'` prevents execution and validation. This is an external dependency issue. However, reviewing the code logic against all examples, even conceptually, is necessary. The sequential processing of blue objects (`for blue_object_coords in blue_objects:`) might be a fundamental flaw if the transformation depends on the global configuration of all blue objects and yellow pixels simultaneously, rather than processing one blue object's influence at a time.

The strategy should be:
1.  Analyze all training examples to confirm or refute the 'frame', 'inner fill', 'outer fill' concepts derived from the first example.
2.  Pay close attention to how yellow pixels adjacent to *multiple* blue objects are treated.
3.  Refine the definitions of the conditions that lead to a yellow pixel becoming red, azure, or magenta, ensuring the rules apply consistently across all examples.
4.  Reformulate the natural language program to describe a simultaneous evaluation of all relevant pixels rather than a sequential, object-by-object process.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze each training example conceptually, assuming the intended logic of the previous code regarding adjacency and object finding. We'll focus on the state changes of yellow pixels (4).

**Color Definitions:**
*   Background: Yellow (4)
*   Object: Blue (1)
*   Frame: Red (2)
*   Outer Fill: Azure (8)
*   Inner Fill: Magenta (6)

**Analysis Approach:** For each example, we identify:
1.  Blue object pixels.
2.  Yellow pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to *any* blue pixel. Let's call this set `AdjacentYellow`.
3.  Yellow pixels *not* adjacent to *any* blue pixel. Let's call this set `NonAdjacentYellow`.
4.  Examine the output pixels corresponding to `AdjacentYellow` in the input.
    *   **Red Pixels (Frame):** Are these pixels in `AdjacentYellow` AND adjacent to at least one pixel in `NonAdjacentYellow`?
    *   **Azure Pixels (Outer Fill):** Are these pixels in `AdjacentYellow`, NOT classified as Red, AND adjacent to at least one Red pixel?
    *   **Magenta Pixels (Inner Fill):** Are these pixels in `AdjacentYellow`, NOT classified as Red, AND NOT adjacent to any Red pixel?

**(Note:** Actual coordinate analysis requires running code, which is blocked by the import error. This analysis relies on visual inspection and applying the hypothesized rules.)

**Example 1 (train[0]):**
*   Input: 13x13 grid, one central blue object, yellow background.
*   Output: Yellow pixels adjacent to the blue object are colored red, azure, or magenta.
*   Observations: Visual inspection aligns with the Frame/Outer Fill/Inner Fill hypothesis. Red pixels seem to border the `NonAdjacentYellow`. Azure pixels seem to border the Red pixels. Magenta pixels seem to fill the remaining space adjacent to Blue but not bordering Red.

**Example 2 (train[1]):**
*   Input: 11x11 grid, one 'L'-shaped blue object, yellow background.
*   Output: Adjacent yellow pixels are transformed.
*   Observations: The pattern seems consistent with Example 1. The concave part of the 'L' likely results in Inner Fill (magenta) pixels. The outer boundary likely shows Frame (red) and Outer Fill (azure).

**Example 3 (train[2]):**
*   Input: 13x13 grid, two separate blue rectangle objects, yellow background.
*   Output: Adjacent yellow pixels around *both* objects are transformed. The space *between* the objects is also transformed.
*   Observations: This example is crucial. The yellow pixels *between* the two blue objects are adjacent to blue. Are they Frame, Inner, or Outer Fill?
    *   If a yellow pixel is between the two blue objects and *not* adjacent to any `NonAdjacentYellow`, it shouldn't be Red (Frame).
    *   If it's adjacent to a Red pixel (which would likely be on the outer edges of the combined shape), it should become Azure (Outer Fill).
    *   If it's *only* adjacent to Blue pixels (and potentially other transformed pixels like Magenta/Azure), and *not* adjacent to Red pixels, it should become Magenta (Inner Fill).
    *   This suggests the classification (Red, Azure, Magenta) must consider the global state *after* identifying all `AdjacentYellow` and `NonAdjacentYellow` based on *all* blue objects collectively. The previous code's loop processes objects independently, which would likely fail here.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the colors: Blue (1), Yellow (4), Red (2), Magenta (6), Azure (8).
3.  Identify the coordinates of all Blue pixels in the input grid.
4.  Identify the coordinates of all Yellow pixels in the input grid.
5.  Determine the set of `AdjacentYellow` coordinates: these are Yellow pixels that have at least one Blue pixel as an orthogonal or diagonal neighbor.
6.  Determine the set of `NonAdjacentYellow` coordinates: these are Yellow pixels that are *not* in the `AdjacentYellow` set.
7.  Determine the set of `Frame` coordinates: these are pixels from `AdjacentYellow` that have at least one pixel from `NonAdjacentYellow` as an orthogonal or diagonal neighbor.
8.  Determine the set of `PotentialFill` coordinates: these are pixels from `AdjacentYellow` that are *not* in the `Frame` set.
9.  Determine the set of `OuterFill` coordinates: these are pixels from `PotentialFill` that have at least one pixel from the `Frame` set as an orthogonal or diagonal neighbor.
10. Determine the set of `InnerFill` coordinates: these are pixels from `PotentialFill` that are *not* in the `OuterFill` set (i.e., they are not adjacent to any `Frame` pixel).
11. Update the output grid:
    *   For each coordinate in `Frame`, set the pixel value to Red (2).
    *   For each coordinate in `OuterFill`, set the pixel value to Azure (8).
    *   For each coordinate in `InnerFill`, set the pixel value to Magenta (6).
12. Return the modified output grid. (Pixels not in `Frame`, `OuterFill`, or `InnerFill` retain their original colors from the input grid copy).
