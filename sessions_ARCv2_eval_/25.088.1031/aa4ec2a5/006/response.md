Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**1. General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to implement a multi-stage coloring process based on adjacency rules between blue and yellow pixels.

*   **Successes:** The code correctly identifies yellow pixels adjacent to blue pixels and changes them to red (forming a 'frame').
*   **Failures:** The primary issue lies in the subsequent classification and coloring of the *remaining* yellow pixels into Azure (8) and Magenta (6). The current logic seems to apply the filling rules to *all* yellow pixels not turned red, including those far away from the initial blue/red interaction zone (the background). This results in large areas, especially the background, being incorrectly colored Azure or Magenta.
*   **Key Insight:** The transformation appears localized. Only the yellow pixels that are somehow "related" or "connected" to the blue pixels should be considered for transformation beyond the initial red frame. The vast yellow background should remain untouched. The concept of connected components seems relevant here. We need to isolate the yellow region(s) interacting with the blue region(s) before applying the fill logic.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Identify the relevant "region" of yellow pixels. This region likely consists of all yellow pixels belonging to the same connected component(s) as the blue pixels (where connectivity includes touching blue pixels).
2.  Apply the transformation logic (Frame -> Red, Outer Fill -> Azure, Inner Fill -> Magenta) *only* within this identified yellow region.
3.  Leave all other yellow pixels (background) unchanged.

**2. Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the relationship between colors in the first example's *expected* output to understand the correct logic.


``` python
import numpy as np

# Define colors
BLUE = 1
RED = 2
GREEN = 3
YELLOW = 4
GRAY = 5
MAGENTA = 6
ORANGE = 7
AZURE = 8
MAROON = 9
WHITE = 0

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   `colors_origin_correct: False`: This is unexpected and crucial. It indicates that not all Red, Azure, or Magenta pixels in the expected output were originally Yellow. Let's re-examine. Ah, wait, the code checking this might be flawed if the input *also* contained Red/Azure/Magenta. But the inputs only show Blue (1) and Yellow (4). This implies *some Blue* pixels might be changing color, which contradicts the previous analysis. Let's look at Example 1 again.
    *   Input (2,1) is 1 (Blue). Output (2,1) is 1 (Blue). Okay.
    *   Input (7,1) is 1 (Blue). Output (7,1) is 1 (Blue). Okay.
    *   Input (11, 4) is 1 (Blue). Output (11, 4) is 1 (Blue). Okay.
    *   Where did `colors_origin_correct: False` come from? Let's rethink the BFS. The BFS explores *from* blue pixels *into* yellow ones.
    *   Looking closely at Expected Output 1:
        *   Pixel (1,0) is Red (2). Input (1,0) was Yellow (4). OK.
        *   Pixel (2,0) is Red (2). Input (2,0) was Blue (1). **Aha!** Blue pixels *can* change color if they are adjacent to yellow pixels that become red? No, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-read the problem description. The description was based on the *code*, which might be wrong. Let's trust the *examples*.
        *   Input (2,1) to (2,7) are Blue. Output (2,1) to (2,7) are Blue.
        *   Input (3,1) to (3,7) are Blue. Output (3,1) to (3,7) are Blue.
        *   Input (11,4) to (11,10) are Blue. Output (11,4) to (11,10) are Blue.
        *   Input (11,13) to (11,18) are Blue. Output (11,13) to (11,18) are Blue.
        *   Comparing input `input_grid_1` and `expected_output_1` shows that *no Blue pixel changes color*. All input blue pixels are still blue in the output. My `analyze_example` function has a bug in the `colors_origin_correct` check or its premise. It assumes Red/Azure/Magenta *only* come from Yellow. Let's ignore `colors_origin_correct` for now.

*   `red_adjacent_to_blue: True`: Confirms Red pixels (frame) were initially yellow and adjacent (inc. diagonal) to blue. This holds.
*   `azure_adjacent_to_red: False`: This is another critical failure of the previous hypothesis. Some Azure pixels in the expected output are *not* adjacent to Red pixels. Example: (3, 11) is Azure (8), its neighbors in the expected output are Yellow(4), Blue(1), Red(2), Azure(8). It *is* adjacent to Red(2) at (2, 11). Let's re-run the check carefully. Maybe the adjacency definition or coordinate sets are off.
*   `magenta_not_adjacent_to_red: True`: Confirms Magenta pixels are not adjacent to Red pixels. This holds.
*   `target_yellow_region_size: 436`: The BFS starting from blue found *all* yellow pixels. This means all yellow pixels are connected to blue pixels through some path of yellow/blue pixels in Example 1. This explains why the previous code affected the background - the "background" wasn't separate.
*   `calculated_transformed_yellow_count: 202`: This is the sum of Red, Azure, Magenta pixels in the output (142 + 44 + 16 = 202).
*   `all_transformed_from_target_yellow: False`: This means some Red/Azure/Magenta pixels in the output did *not* start as Yellow in the input according to the BFS result. This contradicts the visual check that Blue pixels don't change. There's likely an error in my BFS implementation or how `target_yellow` is defined/used.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

1.  Blue pixels remain Blue.
2.  Identify all Yellow pixels.
3.  Yellow pixels adjacent (ortho/diag) to Blue pixels become Red (Frame).
4.  Consider the *remaining* Yellow pixels.
5.  Remaining Yellow pixels adjacent (ortho/diag) to the newly formed Red pixels become Azure (Outer Fill).
6.  Remaining Yellow pixels *not* adjacent to the newly formed Red pixels become Magenta (Inner Fill).
7.  This still doesn't explain why `azure_adjacent_to_red` failed. Let's re-examine Example 1:
    *   Input (1,10) is Yellow (4). Blue neighbors: (2,10). Becomes Red (2) at (1,10). Correct.
    *   Input (2,10) is Blue (1). Remains Blue (1) at (2,10). Correct.
    *   Input (3,10) is Yellow (4). Blue neighbors: (2,10). Becomes Red (2) at (3,10). Error! Expected is Azure (8). Why?
        *   Neighbors of (3,10) in input: (2,9)Y, (2,10)B, (2,11)Y, (3,9)Y, (3,11)Y, (4,9)Y, (4,10)B, (4,11)Y. It's adjacent to Blue (2,10) and (4,10). So it should become Red.
        *   Where does Azure (8) come from then? Let's look at (2,10) in the expected output. It's Azure (8). Input (2,10) was Yellow(4). Neighbors: (1,9)Y, (1,10)Y, (1,11)Y, (2,9)Y, (2,11)Y, (3,9)Y, (3,10)Y, (3,11)Y. Its blue neighbor is (1,10). So (2,10) should become Red. But it's Azure.

This is confusing. Let's rethink the core process. Maybe it's about layers or distance?

*   Layer 0: Blue pixels (unchanged).
*   Layer 1 (Frame): Yellow pixels adjacent to Layer 0 (Blue). These become Red.
*   Layer 2 (Outer Fill): Yellow pixels (not in Layer 1) adjacent to Layer 1 (Red). These become Azure.
*   Layer 3 (Inner Fill): Yellow pixels (not in Layer 1 or 2) adjacent to Layer 2 (Azure). These become Magenta? No, the examples show Magenta surrounded by Azure.

Let's re-state the previous code's logic, which matches the description quite well:

1.  Copy input to output.
2.  Find all `blue_coords` and `all_yellow_coords`.
3.  Find `frame_coords`: yellow adjacent to blue.
4.  Set `output[frame_coords] = RED`.
5.  `remaining_yellow = all_yellow_coords - frame_coords`.
6.  Find `outer_fill`: `remaining_yellow` adjacent to `frame_coords`. Set `output[outer_fill] = AZURE`.
7.  `inner_fill = remaining_yellow - outer_fill`. Set `output[inner_fill] = MAGENTA`.

Why did this produce the wrong output? The code *seems* to implement this logic. The failure `azure_adjacent_to_red: False` in the *expected* output analysis suggests this logic itself might be slightly wrong or incomplete, or my analysis code is buggy.

Let's manually trace (3,10) from Example 1 again based on the *expected* output.
*   Input (3,10) is Yellow. Neighbors include Blue at (2,10) and (4,10).
*   Therefore, (3,10) *should* be part of `frame_coords` and become Red according to the logic.
*   But `expected_output[3,10]` is Azure (8).

What if adjacency for the Azure step uses a different rule? Or perhaps the order matters, and the Red pixels are finalized *before* checking for Azure? The code does this.

Could diagonal adjacency be treated differently at different stages? The description says "orthogonally or diagonally" for all steps.

Let's reconsider the `analyze_example` results. If `target_yellow_region_size` is 436 (all yellow pixels), and `calculated_transformed_yellow_count` is 202, this means `436 - 202 = 234` yellow pixels should remain yellow. But the analysis counted `output_yellow_coords_count: 278`. Where do the extra `278 - 234 = 44` yellow pixels come from? This discrepancy, along with the earlier `colors_origin_correct: False`, strongly suggests my analysis code might have errors. Let's simplify the analysis to just verify the rules on the *expected* output directly.

Rule 1: All Red(2) in output were Yellow(4) in input AND are adjacent (inc. diag) to a Blue(1) in input.
Rule 2: All Azure(8) in output were Yellow(4) in input AND are adjacent (inc. diag) to a Red(2) in output AND were NOT adjacent to a Blue(1) in input.
Rule 3: All Magenta(6) in output were Yellow(4) in input AND are adjacent (inc. diag) to an Azure(8) in output AND are NOT adjacent to a Red(2) in output AND were NOT adjacent to a Blue(1) in input. (Maybe just "not adjacent to Red" is sufficient?)
Rule 4: All Blue(1) in output were Blue(1) in input.
Rule 5: All Yellow(4) in output were Yellow(4) in input AND were NOT adjacent to Blue(1) in input AND were NOT adjacent to Red(2) in output AND were NOT adjacent to Azure(8) in output... (This seems overly complex, maybe just 'were not adjacent to blue and did not become red/azure/magenta').

Let's re-test Rule 1 on the confusing pixel (3,10) which is Azure(8) in the expected output.
Input (3,10) is Yellow. It *is* adjacent to Blue in input at (2,10) and (4,10). Rule 1 says it *should* become Red. But it becomes Azure.

**Conclusion:** The rule "Yellow adjacent to Blue becomes Red" must be wrong or incomplete.

What if we define the "Frame" differently? What if the Frame itself is multi-layered?

Alternative Idea: Flood Fill / Distance Based
1. Start with Blue pixels (distance 0).
2. Find Yellow pixels adjacent to distance 0 (Blue). These are distance 1. Color them Red.
3. Find Yellow pixels adjacent to distance 1 (Red) that were not distance 1 themselves. These are distance 2. Color them Azure.
4. Find Yellow pixels adjacent to distance 2 (Azure) that were not distance 1 or 2. These are distance 3. Color them Magenta.
5. All other Yellow pixels remain Yellow. Blue pixels remain Blue.

Let's test this on (3,10) [Input: Y]. Neighbors include Blue(1) at (2,10) and (4,10). So (3,10) is distance 1. Should be Red. Still conflicts with Expected Output [Azure].

Let's test on (2,10) [Input: Y]. Neighbor Blue(1) at (1,10). So (2,10) is distance 1. Should be Red. Expected Output is Azure(8). Conflict.

Let's test on (2,14) [Input: Y]. Neighbors include Blue(1) at (1,14), (1,15), (3,14). Distance 1. Should be Red. Expected Output is Azure(8). Conflict.

Let's test on (3,15) [Input: Y]. Neighbors include Blue(1) at (4,14). No adjacent Blue. Neighbors include Yellow that *will* become Red (e.g., (2,14) based on adjacency to (1,14)). If (2,14) is Red (dist 1), then (3,15) is adjacent to Red, making it distance 2 (Azure). Expected Output is Magenta(6). Conflict.

Okay, the simple distance/layer idea doesn't work directly either.

Let's look at the shapes. The blue pixels form shapes. The yellow pixels form a background and sometimes shapes nestled within or near the blue ones. The transformation creates a colored "aura" or "boundary region" around the blue shapes, using the nearby yellow pixels.

Revisit Example 1 Expected Output:
- The Red pixels form a 1-pixel thick border around the Blue shapes, using pixels that were originally Yellow.
- The Azure pixels form a 1-pixel thick border around the Red pixels, using pixels that were originally Yellow and not already turned Red.
- The Magenta pixels fill the remaining area *inside* the Azure border, using pixels that were originally Yellow and not turned Red or Azure.

This looks like:
1. Define `BlueSet` = coordinates of blue pixels.
2. Define `YellowSet` = coordinates of yellow pixels.
3. `FrameSet` = { (r, c) in `YellowSet` | exists neighbor (nr, nc) in `BlueSet` }
4. `RemainingYellowSet1` = `YellowSet` - `FrameSet`
5. `OuterFillSet` = { (r, c) in `RemainingYellowSet1` | exists neighbor (nr, nc) in `FrameSet` }
6. `RemainingYellowSet2` = `RemainingYellowSet1` - `OuterFillSet`
7. `InnerFillSet` = { (r, c) in `RemainingYellowSet2` | exists neighbor (nr, nc) in `OuterFillSet` OR ??? } How to define Magenta? Maybe it's just `RemainingYellowSet2`?

Let's re-test (3,10) [Input: Y] -> Expected: Azure(8)
- Neighbors include Blue(1) at (2,10) & (4,10).
- So (3,10) is in `FrameSet`. Should be Red(2). **Still conflicts.**

What is different about (3,10) [Y->Az] vs (1,10) [Y->R]?
- (1,10) neighbors: (1,9)Y, (1,11)Y, (2,9)Y, (2,10)B, (2,11)Y. Adjacent to Blue at (2,10). Becomes Red.
- (3,10) neighbors: (2,9)Y, (2,10)B, (2,11)Y, (3,9)Y, (3,11)Y, (4,9)Y, (4,10)B, (4,11)Y. Adjacent to Blue at (2,10) and (4,10). Becomes Azure.

Is there a rule about *how many* blue neighbors? Or maybe orthogonal vs diagonal?
- (1,10) has 1 Blue neighbor (diagonal). -> Red
- (3,10) has 2 Blue neighbors (1 diagonal, 1 orthogonal). -> Azure

Let's check another Azure pixel: (2,10) [Y->Az]
- Neighbors: (1,9)Y, (1,10)Y, (1,11)Y, (2,9)Y, (2,11)Y, (3,9)Y, (3,10)Y, (3,11)Y. Wait, input (2,10) is BLUE! My earlier check was wrong.
Let me reload the grids.

Ah, INPUT grid (2,10) is `1` (Blue). Output (2,10) is `8` (Azure).
INPUT grid (3,10) is `4` (Yellow). Output (3,10) is `8` (Azure).

**NEW RULE DISCOVERY:** Blue pixels *can* change color!

When does a Blue pixel change color?
- (2,10) [B->Az]. Neighbors: (1,10)Y, (2,9)Y, (2,11)Y, (3,10)Y. All Yellow neighbors.
- (11,10) [B->B]. Neighbors: (10,10)Y, (11,9)Y, (11,11)B, (12,10)B, (12,11)B. Has Blue neighbors.
- (11,11) [B->B]. Neighbors: (10,11)Y, (11,10)B, (11,12)B, (12,10)B, (12,11)B, (12,12)B. Has Blue neighbors.
- (2,1) [B->B]. Neighbors: (1,0)Y, (1,1)Y, (1,2)Y, (2,0)Y, (2,2)B, (3,0)Y, (3,1)B, (3,2)B. Has Blue neighbors.

Tentative Rule: A Blue pixel changes color *only if* all of its neighbors (ortho & diag) are Yellow? No, that doesn't seem right. (2,10) has Blue neighbors like (3,10) that becomes Azure.

Let's reset. Focus on the transformation steps implied by the colors.
Output Colors: Blue, Red, Azure, Magenta, Yellow.
Origin: Blue -> Blue (mostly), Blue -> ? (sometimes). Yellow -> Red, Yellow -> Azure, Yellow -> Magenta, Yellow -> Yellow.

Let's assume the transformation happens simultaneously or based on the *input* state.

1.  **Identify candidates for change:** All Blue and Yellow pixels.
2.  **Rule for Red:** A Yellow pixel becomes Red if it's adjacent to a Blue pixel.
3.  **Rule for Azure:** ???
4.  **Rule for Magenta:** ???
5.  **Rule for staying Blue:** A Blue pixel stays Blue if ???
6.  **Rule for staying Yellow:** A Yellow pixel stays Yellow if it's not adjacent to Blue and doesn't become Azure/Magenta.

Consider the "hole" in the second blue shape in Example 1 (row 11-16, col 10-12). Input has Yellow at (11,10), (11,11), (11,12) surrounded by Blue. Output has Azure at (11,10) and Magenta at (11,11), (11,12).
- (11,10) [Y->Az]. Input Neighbors: B,B,B, Y,Y, B,B,B. Adj to Blue. Rule 2 says -> Red. Conflict.
- (11,11) [Y->Mag]. Input Neighbors: B,B,B, Y,Y, B,B,B. Adj to Blue. Rule 2 says -> Red. Conflict.
- (11,12) [Y->Mag]. Input Neighbors: B,B,B, Y,Y, B,B,B. Adj to Blue. Rule 2 says -> Red. Conflict.

This suggests the simple "Yellow adj Blue -> Red" rule is fundamentally wrong.

**Let's reconsider the "layers" idea but based on the output:**

*   Blue pixels in output = Blue pixels in input that are adjacent to other Blue pixels in input?
*   Red pixels in output = Yellow pixels in input adjacent to "surviving" Blue pixels?
*   Azure pixels in output = Yellow pixels in input adjacent to Red pixels OR Blue pixels that were "isolated"?
*   Magenta pixels = Yellow pixels surrounded by Azure/Red?

Let's test the "isolated blue" idea. A blue pixel is isolated if it has no blue neighbors (ortho/diag).
- (2,10) [Input B]. Neighbors: Y, Y, Y, Y. -> Isolated? Yes. Output: Azure. Possible rule: Isolated Blue -> Azure.
- Check other isolated blues in Input 1: None.
- Check Input 2: (3,7)B has neighbors Y,Y,Y, Y,Y, Y,Y,Y -> Isolated. Output(3,7) is B. Rule fails.
- Check Input 3: (6,12)B has neighbors Y,Y,Y, Y,Y, Y,Y,Y -> Isolated. Output(6,12) is B. Rule fails.

Okay, isolated blue isn't the trigger.

What if the colors represent something like contour lines or fields?

Let's assume the core logic from the initial description and code *is* mostly correct, but applies differently. What if the "background" (Yellow=4) is treated specially?

Revised Logic Attempt 2:
1. Identify all contiguous objects of non-Yellow colors (only Blue=1 in this case).
2. For each Blue object:
    a. Find all Yellow pixels adjacent (ortho/diag) to this Blue object. Call this the `FrameSet` (potential Red).
    b. Find all Yellow pixels adjacent to the `FrameSet` pixels, which are not in `FrameSet` themselves. Call this `OuterFillSet` (potential Azure).
    c. Find all Yellow pixels adjacent to the `OuterFillSet` pixels, which are not in `FrameSet` or `OuterFillSet`. Call this `InnerFillSet` (potential Magenta).
3. Final Output Grid:
    a. Start with input grid.
    b. Color pixels in `FrameSet` Red(2).
    c. Color pixels in `OuterFillSet` Azure(8).
    d. Color pixels in `InnerFillSet` Magenta(6).
    e. Blue pixels remain Blue. Other Yellow pixels remain Yellow.

Let's re-test problematic pixels with THIS logic:

Example 1:
- Pixel (3,10) [Input Y]. Adjacent to Blue pixels (2,10), (4,10). Belongs to `FrameSet`. Logic says: Red(2). Expected: Azure(8). **Still fails.**
- Pixel (2,10) [Input B]. Remains Blue(1). Logic says: Blue(1). Expected: Azure(8). **Still fails.**

There must be a property of the pixels being overlooked.

Consider the case where Blue meets Yellow.
Input:
B B
Y Y
Expected Output based on examples:
B B
R R (If Y was adjacent only to B)
or
B B
Az Az (If Y was adjacent to B which was adjacent to Y...?)

Look at the boundaries in Example 1 Expected Output:
- B adjacent to R: (2,8)B-(2,9)R, (3,8)B-(3,9)R, (7,5)B-(7,6)R etc.
- R adjacent to Az: (1,9)R-(2,9)Az, (2,9)R-(2,10)Az, (3,9)R-(3,10)Az etc.
- Az adjacent to Mag: (2,14)Az-(3,15)Mag, (3,14)Az-(3,15)Mag etc.
- Az adjacent to Y: (1,12)Az-(1,13)Y, (2,12)Az-(1,12)Y etc. (This means the filling stops)
- R adjacent to Y: (1,12)R-(1,13)Y, (7,5)R-(7,6)Y etc. (This means the filling stops)

The filling process (R -> Az -> Mag) seems to happen *within* certain yellow regions, but not necessarily all yellow regions connected to blue.

What defines the boundary where filling stops?
Maybe it's related to the overall shape? Like a convex hull or bounding box?

Let's focus on the Blue->Azure change at (2,10). Input is Blue. Output is Azure. Its neighbours in the input are all Yellow. Why does it change? Compare to (3,7) in Ex 2. Input is Blue. Neighbours all Yellow. Output is Blue. What's the difference?
- Location? (2,10) is near a corner/concavity in the blue shape. (3,7) is on a flat edge.
- Connectivity? (2,10)'s yellow neighbours are part of a region that gets filled extensively. (3,7)'s yellow neighbours are part of a region that only gets a Red frame.

**Hypothesis - Connectivity & Local Neighbours:**
A pixel's final color depends on its initial color and the initial colors of its neighbours.

- If Pixel = Blue:
    - If any neighbour is Blue -> stays Blue.
    - If all neighbours are Yellow -> becomes Azure? (Failed on Ex2/3) -> Becomes Red? Becomes Yellow?
    - Let's check (2,10) neighbors in *output*: R, Az, Az, R, Az, R, Az, Az. It's surrounded by Red/Azure.
    - Let's check (3,7) in Ex2 *output*: R, R, R, R, B, R, R, R. It's surrounded by Red, but adjacent to Blue(3,6).

Revised Rule: If Pixel = Blue: Stays Blue IFF it's adjacent to another Blue pixel (input state). Otherwise, it participates in the Yellow->Red/Azure/Magenta transformation as if it were Yellow?
Let's test this:
- (2,10) [Input B]. No Blue neighbours in input. Treat as Yellow. Is it adjacent to an Input Blue pixel? Yes, (1,10) is Blue (neighbor check error before?). Let me recheck neighbours of (2,10) Input: (1,9)Y, (1,10)Y, (1,11)Y, (2,9)Y, (2,11)Y, (3,9)Y, (3,10)Y, (3,11)Y. Okay, input neighbours are all Yellow. So it has no Blue neighbours. Treat as Yellow. Is it adjacent to an input Blue pixel? No. Is it adjacent to a pixel that *will* become Red? Yes, (1,10) [Y->R], (3,10) [Y->Az? still unclear]. This path is confusing.

Let's simplify. The most consistent observation is the layering R->Az->Mag outwards from *something*. What is that something? It seems to be the boundary between the initial Blue and Yellow regions.

**Final Refined Hypothesis & Process:**

1.  Initialize `output_grid` as a copy of `input_grid`.
2.  Identify `BlueSet` (input blue coords) and `YellowSet` (input yellow coords).
3.  **Frame Generation (Red):**
    *   Identify `FrameSet = { (r, c) in YellowSet | has neighbor in BlueSet }`.
    *   Change `output_grid[r, c] = RED` for (r, c) in `FrameSet`.
4.  **Outer Fill Generation (Azure):**
    *   Identify `PotentialAzureSet = YellowSet - FrameSet`.
    *   Identify `OuterFillSet = { (r, c) in PotentialAzureSet | has neighbor in FrameSet }`.
    *   Change `output_grid[r, c] = AZURE` for (r, c) in `OuterFillSet`.
5.  **Inner Fill Generation (Magenta):**
    *   Identify `PotentialMagentaSet = PotentialAzureSet - OuterFillSet`.
    *   Identify `InnerFillSet = { (r, c) in PotentialMagentaSet | has neighbor in OuterFillSet }`. *(Correction based on visual: Magenta fills the rest of the connected yellow region)*. Let's redefine: `InnerFillSet = PotentialMagentaSet`.
    *   Change `output_grid[r, c] = MAGENTA` for (r, c) in `InnerFillSet`.
6.  **Isolated Blue Handling:**
    *   Identify `IsolatedBlueSet = { (r, c) in BlueSet | has no neighbor in BlueSet }`.
    *   For (r, c) in `IsolatedBlueSet`: check its neighbors in the *current* `output_grid` (after steps 3-5). If it has a Red neighbor, change `output_grid[r, c] = AZURE`. If it has an Azure neighbor, change `output_grid[r, c] = MAGENTA`. (This is speculative).

This sequence seems closer but still doesn't explain (3,10) Y->Az or (2,10) B->Az cleanly. The interaction seems more simultaneous.

Let's stick to the most salient features for the NL program and YAML: Framing and Filling outwards from Blue into Yellow. The Blue->Azure/Magenta change is an edge case needing refinement.

**3. YAML Facts Documentation**


```yaml
InitialObjects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Height: Varies (e.g., 28, 23, 20)
      - Width: Varies (e.g., 23, 25, 15)
      - Pixels:
          - Color: Blue (1) - Forms one or more contiguous shapes.
          - Color: Yellow (4) - Forms background and potentially shapes adjacent to or enclosed by Blue shapes.

Transformations:
  - Action: Framing
    Input: Yellow pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to Blue pixels.
    Output: These pixels change color to Red (2).
    OutputName: FramePixels

  - Action: Outer Filling
    Input: Yellow pixels, not part of FramePixels, that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to FramePixels.
    Output: These pixels change color to Azure (8).
    OutputName: OuterFillPixels

  - Action: Inner Filling
    Input: Yellow pixels, not part of FramePixels or OuterFillPixels, that are part of the same connected Yellow region initially affected by the framing/filling.
    Output: These pixels change color to Magenta (6).
    OutputName: InnerFillPixels

  - Action: Preservation
    Input: Blue pixels.
    Output: Generally remain Blue (1). (Exception: Some Blue pixels might change, rule TBD - potentially related to isolation or neighbor states after filling).

  - Action: Preservation
    Input: Yellow pixels not involved in Framing, Outer Filling, or Inner Filling (i.e., background Yellow not connected to the Blue interaction zone).
    Output: Remain Yellow (4).

FinalObjects:
  - Type: Grid
    Properties:
      - Same dimensions as Input Grid.
      - Pixels:
          - Color: Blue (1) - Original blue pixels (mostly).
          - Color: Red (2) - FramePixels.
          - Color: Azure (8) - OuterFillPixels (and maybe some original Blue pixels).
          - Color: Magenta (6) - InnerFillPixels (and maybe some original Blue pixels).
          - Color: Yellow (4) - Unchanged background Yellow pixels.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Orthogonal and diagonal adjacency is key for all color changes (Frame, OuterFill, InnerFill).
  - Connectivity: The transformation seems primarily focused on the connected component(s) of Yellow pixels that touch the initial Blue shapes.
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all coordinates of Blue pixels (`BlueSet`) and Yellow pixels (`YellowSet`) in the input grid.
3.  Identify the set of Yellow pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any Blue pixel. Call this the `FrameSet`.
4.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in the `FrameSet` to Red (2).
5.  Identify the set of remaining Yellow pixels that were not turned Red (`RemainingYellowSet1 = YellowSet - FrameSet`).
6.  Identify the subset of `RemainingYellowSet1` pixels that are adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any pixel in the `FrameSet`. Call this the `OuterFillSet`.
7.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in the `OuterFillSet` to Azure (8).
8.  Identify the set of remaining Yellow pixels that were not turned Red or Azure (`RemainingYellowSet2 = RemainingYellowSet1 - OuterFillSet`).
9.  In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in `RemainingYellowSet2` to Magenta (6).
10. **(Refinement Needed):** Address the transformation of certain Blue pixels. A possible rule (requiring verification) is: If an original Blue pixel has no Blue neighbors (in the input) AND it has a Red neighbor (in the output grid after step 4), change its color to Azure (8). If it has an Azure neighbor (after step 7) but no Red neighbor, change its color to Magenta (6). Otherwise, Blue pixels remain Blue. *(This step is uncertain and needs more investigation based on the failed examples)*. For now, assume Blue pixels largely remain unchanged unless a clearer rule emerges.

This program describes the R->Az->Mag layering emanating from the Blue regions into the Yellow regions. It assumes Blue pixels don't change, which aligns with the majority but not all cases observed in the expected outputs. The discrepancy suggests a more complex interaction or rule is missing, possibly related to the state of neighbors *after* a transformation step or simultaneous updates. However, this program reflects the most consistent pattern observed.
