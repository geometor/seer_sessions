task_description: Fill enclosed background areas based on the border color and the color of the largest interior object (if any), using a specific color mapping.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: objects
      - size: height x width (variable)

  - type: object
    properties:
      - pixels: contiguous block of non-white pixels of the same color.
      - role:
          - border_loop: A single object that completely encloses a region of white pixels without touching the grid edge itself.
          - interior_object: An object located strictly inside an enclosed white region, whose color is not white (0) and not the same as the border_loop color.
          - other_object: Any object not acting as a border_loop for a filled region or an interior_object relevant to filling.

  - type: region
    properties:
      - pixels: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels.
      - state:
          - enclosed: The region does not touch the grid edge and is bordered entirely by a single border_loop object.
          - unenclosed: The region touches the grid edge or is bordered by more than one distinct object/color.

actions:
  - action: identify_enclosed_white_regions
    input: grid
    output: list of enclosed_regions, each associated with its unique border_loop object/color.
    method:
      - Identify all connected components of white (0) pixels.
      - For each white component:
          - Check if any pixel touches the grid edge. If yes, ignore.
          - Perform a flood-fill or boundary check to find all adjacent non-white pixels.
          - Determine the set of unique contiguous non-white objects neighboring the white component.
          - If exactly one such object neighbors the entire boundary of the white component, the region is enclosed. Record the region and the border_loop object (and its color).

  - action: find_largest_interior_object
    input:
      - enclosed_region (coordinates)
      - border_color
      - grid
    output: color of the largest interior_object (or None if none exists).
    method:
      - Identify all contiguous objects strictly within the enclosed_region coordinates.
      - Filter these objects to keep only those whose color is not white (0) and not equal to border_color.
      - If multiple valid interior objects exist, find the one with the largest pixel count.
      - Return the color of the largest object, or None if no valid objects were found.

  - action: determine_fill_color
    input:
      - border_color
      - largest_interior_object_color (or None)
    output: fill_color
    logic: Apply a fixed mapping based on the (border_color, largest_interior_object_color) pair:
           (2, 1) -> 3
           (4, 1) -> 5
           (2, 4) -> 9
           (1, None) -> 6
           (3, None) -> 3
           (6, None) -> 7
           (4, None) -> 4
           (7, None) -> 6 # Note: This rule applies even if interior objects exist but don't trigger a specific override.

  - action: fill_region
    input:
      - grid
      - enclosed_region (coordinates)
      - fill_color
    output: modified_grid
    effect: Changes the color of all pixels within the enclosed_region (which were originally white) to the fill_color.

final_state: The output grid mirrors the input grid, except that all identified enclosed white regions are filled with the determined fill color. Border loops, interior objects, and unenclosed regions remain unchanged.
