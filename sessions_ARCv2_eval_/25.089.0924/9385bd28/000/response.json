            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background Color:** The color white (0) predominantly acts as the background or empty space.\n3.  **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of non-white colors form distinct objects or shapes within the grid.\n4.  **Loops/Boundaries:** In each example, there are one or more closed loops formed by pixels of a single color (e.g., red in train\\_1, yellow in train\\_2, red and blue in train\\_3, green, magenta, yellow, orange in train\\_4). These loops act as boundaries.\n5.  **Enclosed Areas:** These loops enclose areas within the grid. These areas primarily consist of the white background color but may also contain other non-white objects.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling the white (0) pixels *inside* these closed loops with a new color.\n7.  **Fill Color Determination:** The color used to fill the enclosed white space appears to depend on two factors:\n    *   The color of the loop itself (the border color).\n    *   The color of the largest distinct object *inside* the loop (if any exists). If only white pixels are inside, the fill color depends solely on the border color.\n8.  **Preservation:** The pixels forming the loop boundary and any objects originally inside the loop remain unchanged. Pixels outside any loop also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Iterate through each non-white color present in the input grid (potential loop colors).\n3.  For each potential loop color, identify all distinct contiguous objects (regions) composed of that color.\n4.  For each such object, determine if it forms a closed loop that encloses an area containing white (0) pixels. This can be verified by checking if a flood fill starting from the white pixels adjacent to the object's boundary eventually reaches the edge of the grid without crossing the object's color. If the flood fill is contained, the object forms a loop enclosing those white pixels.\n5.  For each confirmed loop:\n    a.  Identify all pixels located strictly inside the loop's boundary.\n    b.  Among the interior pixels, find all contiguous non-white, non-border-color objects.\n    c.  Determine the largest of these interior objects based on pixel count. Note its color (the \"interior object color\"). If no such objects exist (only white pixels and potentially pixels matching the border color are inside), consider the interior object color to be null.\n    d.  Determine the \"fill color\" based on the combination of the loop's color (the \"border color\") and the identified \"interior object color\" (or null) using the specific mapping rules derived from the examples:\n        *   If Border=Red(2) and Interior=Blue(1), Fill=Green(3).\n        *   If Border=Yellow(4) and Interior=Blue(1), Fill=Gray(5).\n        *   If Border=Red(2) and Interior=Yellow(4), Fill=Maroon(9).\n        *   If Border=Blue(1) and Interior=null, Fill=Magenta(6).\n        *   If Border=Green(3) and Interior=null, Fill=Green(3).\n        *   If Border=Magenta(6) and Interior=null, Fill=Orange(7).\n        *   If Border=Yellow(4) and Interior=null, Fill=Yellow(4).\n        *   If Border=Orange(7) and Interior=null, Fill=Magenta(6).\n    e.  Iterate through all the pixels identified as being strictly inside the loop (from step 5a). If a pixel's color is white (0), change its color in the output grid to the determined \"fill color\".\n6.  After processing all loops for all potential colors, return the modified output grid."
