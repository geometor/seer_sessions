**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis involving counting distinct objects of Red (2), White (0), and Blue (1) seems promising, despite the previous code evaluation results. The provided evaluation was performed on a secondary code version that used adjacency checks and pixel counts, not the primary version based on object counting. The pattern observed across the examples strongly supports the object counting hypothesis:

*   Examples 2 and 3: Have exactly one Red object, one White object, and one Blue object. The transformation swaps White and Blue (White->Blue, Blue->White), leaving Red unchanged.
*   Examples 1 and 4: Do *not* have exactly one of each object (Example 1 has multiple Blue structures, Example 4 has multiple Blue structures). The transformation changes Red to White and White to Blue (Red->White, White->Blue), leaving Blue unchanged.

The strategy is to revert to the object counting logic and refine the natural language program and YAML documentation accordingly. We will use `tool_code` to verify the object counts for each example to confirm this condition accurately distinguishes the cases.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution reveals that the `scipy.ndimage.label` function, with 8-way connectivity, identifies exactly one Red object, one White object, and one Blue object in *all four* examples. This contradicts the visual interpretation, particularly for examples 1 and 4, where the Blue pixels appear fragmented.

Let's reconsider example 1 visually:
*   Red: One 2x2 block. (Count = 1)
*   White: One 2x2 block. (Count = 1)
*   Blue: Appears as multiple separate groups (a 2x2, multiple lines/pixels). Why does `label` see them as one? It must be due to diagonal connections linking them together through the Green (3) background, which `label` treats implicitly. The function `label` works on the boolean mask `grid == color`, it doesn't inherently know about other colors acting as separators unless they break the connectivity defined by the `structure`.

If we look closely at example 1's Blue pixels, they are indeed all connected diagonally.

```
. . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . .
. 1 1 . . . . . . . . .    <-- Block A
. 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 . .    <-- Block B / Line C
. 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 . .
. 1 1 . 1 1 . 1 1 1 . .    <-- Line D / Line E
. 1 1 . 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 .
. 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 .    <-- Line F / Line G
. 1 1 1 1 1 . . 1 1 . .
. 1 1 1 . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . .
```

Block A is connected diagonally to Block B at (3,3). Block B connects to Line C. Line C connects diagonally down to Line D at (5,4). Line D connects to Line E. Line E connects diagonally down to Line F at (7,4). Line F connects to Line G. Therefore, `label` correctly identifies them as a single object with 8-way connectivity. The same applies to Example 4.

This means the "one object of each color" condition is *always* met according to `scipy.ndimage.label` with 8-way connectivity. This cannot be the distinguishing factor.

**New Hypothesis Exploration:**

Let's re-examine the difference between (1, 4) and (2, 3).
*   Rule for (1, 4): Red->White, White->Blue, Blue->Blue (False Rule)
*   Rule for (2, 3): Red->Red, White->Blue, Blue->White (True Rule)

What property holds true for 2 and 3, but not for 1 and 4?

Possibility 1: Pixel counts.

Possibility 1 Analysis: Pixel counts don't show a clear pattern. Red counts vary (4, 4, 9, 1). White counts vary (4, 4, 9, 1). Blue counts vary (52, 45, 120, 20). The rule doesn't seem directly tied to the *number* of pixels of each color.

Possibility 2: Adjacency *between* colors. Let's re-evaluate the adjacency condition used in the failed code: `white_touches_blue and (num_red_pixels > 1)`.
*   Example 1: White touches Blue? Yes. Red > 1? Yes (4). Condition = True. Expected Rule = False. -> Mismatch!
*   Example 2: White touches Blue? Yes. Red > 1? Yes (4). Condition = True. Expected Rule = True. -> Match!
*   Example 3: White touches Blue? Yes. Red > 1? Yes (9). Condition = True. Expected Rule = True. -> Match!
*   Example 4: White touches Blue? Yes. Red > 1? No (1). Condition = False. Expected Rule = False. -> Match!

The *only* mismatch is Example 1. What's unique about Example 1 regarding adjacency?
*   Does Red touch Blue in Example 1? Yes.
*   Does Red touch White in Example 1? No.
*   Does Red touch Blue in Example 2? No.
*   Does Red touch White in Example 2? No.
*   Does Red touch Blue in Example 3? No.
*   Does Red touch White in Example 3? No.
*   Does Red touch Blue in Example 4? No.
*   Does Red touch White in Example 4? Yes.

Hypothesis: The rule choice depends on whether Red pixels are adjacent to Blue pixels.
*   If Red touches Blue (8-way): Use False Rule (Red->White, White->Blue). (Example 1)
*   If Red does NOT touch Blue: Use True Rule (White->Blue, Blue->White). (Examples 2, 3)
*   What about Example 4? Red does not touch Blue. So this hypothesis predicts True Rule, but the expected rule is False Rule. This hypothesis fails on Example 4.

Let's reconsider Example 4. It uses the False Rule (Red->White, White->Blue). It is the only example where `num_red_pixels == 1`.
Hypothesis: If `num_red_pixels == 1`, use False Rule. Otherwise (if `num_red_pixels > 1`), use True Rule.
*   Example 1: Red=4. Predicts True Rule. Expected: False. -> Fails.
*   Example 2: Red=4. Predicts True Rule. Expected: True. -> Match.
*   Example 3: Red=9. Predicts True Rule. Expected: True. -> Match.
*   Example 4: Red=1. Predicts False Rule. Expected: False. -> Match.

This fails only on Example 1.

What if the condition is based on White touching Red?
*   Example 1: White touches Red? No.
*   Example 2: White touches Red? No.
*   Example 3: White touches Red? Yes.
*   Example 4: White touches Red? Yes.

Hypothesis: If White touches Red, use False Rule. Otherwise, use True Rule.
*   Example 1: White !touch Red. Predicts True. Expected: False. -> Fails.
*   Example 2: White !touch Red. Predicts True. Expected: True. -> Match.
*   Example 3: White touch Red. Predicts False. Expected: True. -> Fails.
*   Example 4: White touch Red. Predicts False. Expected: False. -> Match.

Let's go back to the `white_touches_blue and (num_red_pixels > 1)` condition. It worked for 2, 3, 4, but failed for 1.
*   For Example 1, the condition is True, but we need the False rule.
*   For Examples 2, 3, the condition is True, and we need the True rule.
*   For Example 4, the condition is False, and we need the False rule.

This looks like:
*   If `white_touches_blue and (num_red_pixels > 1)` AND <Some other condition specific to Ex 1 is FALSE>: Use True Rule (White->Blue, Blue->White). [Applies to Ex 2, 3]
*   Otherwise: Use False Rule (Red->White, White->Blue). [Applies to Ex 1, 4]

What condition distinguishes Ex 1 from Ex 2 and 3?
*   Ex 1: Red touches Blue? Yes.
*   Ex 2: Red touches Blue? No.
*   Ex 3: Red touches Blue? No.

Let's try this:
Condition `C = (white_touches_blue and (num_red_pixels > 1))`
Condition `D = red_touches_blue`

*   If `C` is True AND `D` is False: Use True Rule (White->Blue, Blue->White). [Applies to Ex 2, 3]
*   Otherwise (if `C` is False OR `D` is True): Use False Rule (Red->White, White->Blue). [Applies to Ex 1 (C=T, D=T), Ex 4 (C=F)]

This seems to cover all cases correctly. Let's verify the adjacencies needed.

**Analysis of Adjacency Hypothesis:**

The verification shows that Red touches Blue in Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4. The hypothesis `(C and not D)` predicts False, False, False, False. The expected rules are False, True, True, False. This hypothesis also fails.

Let's reconsider the object counting. Maybe the issue was the connectivity assumption? What if we use 4-way connectivity (no diagonals)?

``` python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label, generate_binary_structure

def find_objects_4way(grid_list, color):
    grid = np.array(grid_list, dtype=int)
    mask = (grid == color)
    structure = generate_binary_structure(2, 1) # 4-connectivity
    labeled_array, num_features = label(mask, structure=structure)
    return num_features
