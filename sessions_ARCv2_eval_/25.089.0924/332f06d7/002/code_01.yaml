Task: Conditional Color Transformation based on Adjacency and Size

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Colors:
      - Active: Red (2), White (0), Blue (1)
      - Background: Green (3) (and potentially others)
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of a single active color (Red, White, or Blue). Assumes 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). All training examples contain exactly one object of each active color.
  - Properties:
      - Adjacency: Whether pixels of the White object are adjacent (including diagonal) to pixels of the Blue object.
      - Red Pixel Count: The total number of Red (2) pixels in the grid.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Transformed 2D array of pixels.

Transformation:
  - Type: Pixel-wise color substitution based on a global condition derived from input properties.
  - Condition: Check if (any White pixel is adjacent to any Blue pixel) AND (the total count of Red pixels is greater than 1).
  - Rules:
      - If Condition is True: # White adjacent to Blue AND Red object is larger than 1 pixel
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> White (0)
          - Red (2) -> Red (2) # Stays Red
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
      - If Condition is False: # White not adjacent to Blue OR Red object is exactly 1 pixel
          - Red (2) -> White (0)
          - White (0) -> Blue (1)
          - Blue (1) -> Blue (1) # Stays Blue
          - Other_Colors -> Other_Colors (e.g., Green (3) -> Green (3))
  - Scope: Applies to all relevant pixels (Red, White, Blue) in the grid.
