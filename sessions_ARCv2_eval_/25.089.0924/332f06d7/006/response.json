            "text": "**Conclusion from Code Execution:**\n\nMy visual inspection was wrong. The `count_objects_4way` function *correctly* identifies that *all* blue pixels in *all* examples form a single contiguous object when using 4-way connectivity.\n\nThis means the condition `is_single_blue_object = (num_blue_objects == 1)` is *always* TRUE for these examples.\n\nTherefore, the code *always* executed the `if is_single_blue_object:` block, which applies Rule B:\n*   Rule B: Red -> Red, White -> Blue, Blue -> White\n\nLet's re-check the expected outputs against Rule B:\n*   Example 1 Expected: Red -> White (0), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> Blue (1) --- **This is Rule A!**\n*   Example 2 Expected: Red -> Red (2), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> White (0) --- **This is Rule B!**\n*   Example 3 Expected: Red -> Red (2), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> White (0) --- **This is Rule B!**\n*   Example 4 Expected: Red -> White (0), White -> Blue (1), Blue -> Blue (1) --- **This is Rule A!**\n\nSo, the actual discriminating factor is *not* the 4-way connectivity of blue pixels. We need a new condition that is TRUE for examples 2 & 3, and FALSE for examples 1 & 4.\n\n**New Hypothesis Exploration:**\n\nLet's gather metrics using the code execution tool.\n\n*   **Metric 1: Number of objects (8-way connectivity)**\n*   **Metric 2: Pixel counts (Red, White, Blue)**\n*   **Metric 3: Adjacency (8-way) between colors** (Red-White, Red-Blue, White-Blue)\n\n"

This doesn't distinguish the rules.\n*   `Count_Red`, `Count_White`, `Count_Blue`: The counts vary, but there's no obvious pattern (e.g., threshold) matching Rule A vs Rule B.\n*   `Adj_RW (8w)`: Always False.\n*   `Adj_RB (8w)`: Always True.\n*   `Adj_WB (8w)`: Always True.\n\nNone of these metrics alone seem to explain the difference. Let's reconsider the original hypothesis about object counts, but perhaps with a stricter definition or combination.\n\n**Revisiting the First Hypothesis (Number of Distinct Objects):**\nMy first hypothesis was: Condition = (num_red == 1) AND (num_white == 1) AND (num_blue == 1).\nThe `tool_code` output shows that using 8-way connectivity (`Obj_* (8w)` columns), this condition is TRUE for ALL examples. This can't be the distinguishing factor.\n\n**What if the object definition is stricter?**\nPerhaps \"object\" means something specific here. In ARC, background colors often separate objects. Green (3) is the background.\n\nLet's re-examine the grids visually, focusing on Green (3) as a separator.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Rule A):** Red(2) object is separated by Green(3). White(0) object is separated. Blue(1) pixels seem connected, but *also* appear in multiple places separated by Green(3). *However*, the `label` function (with 8-way) found only 1 object. This implies all Blue pixels *are* connected diagonally or side-by-side, even if it looks visually separated by Green.\n*   **Example 2 (Rule B):** Red, White, Blue objects all look like single contiguous blocks separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).\n*   **Example 3 (Rule B):** Similar to Example 2. Red, White, Blue objects look contiguous and separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).\n*   **Example 4 (Rule A):** Red(2) is a single pixel. White(0) is a single pixel. Blue(1) pixels appear in multiple places separated by Green. `label` confirms 1 object each (8-way).\n\n**The Key Difference:**\nThe condition might not be about the *number* of objects, but about their *nature* or *relationship*.\n\nLet's look at the *location* of the objects relative to each other.\n*   Rule A (Ex 1, 4): Red, White, Blue objects exist.\n*   Rule B (Ex 2, 3): Red, White, Blue objects exist.\n\nConsider adjacency *ignoring* the background Green(3). If we treat Green as empty space, are Red, White, and Blue components \"close\" or interacting in some way?\n\nLet's revisit the idea of adjacency: `Adj_RB` and `Adj_WB` were always TRUE. This means in all examples, at least one Red pixel is next to a Blue pixel, and at least one White pixel is next to a Blue pixel.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** The condition depends on whether *both* Red *and* White pixels are adjacent to *the same* Blue object. This seems difficult to check directly.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis:** Is there a unique property of the Blue object itself?\n*   Example 1 (Rule A): Blue object is complex, snakes around.\n*   Example 2 (Rule B): Blue object is relatively simple, mostly rectangular blocks.\n*   Example 3 (Rule B): Blue object is complex, but looks like one main group.\n*   Example 4 (Rule A): Blue object is fragmented into multiple visual clusters (even if technically connected via 8-way).\n\n**Let's test the original \"Number of Objects = 1 for each color\" idea again, but using 4-WAY connectivity.**\n\n"

This hypothesis is also incorrect.\n\n**Final Hypothesis before giving up on simple object counts/adjacency:**\nMaybe the rule depends *only* on the Red pixels?\n*   Example 1 (Rule A): Red object is 2x2 (4 pixels).\n*   Example 2 (Rule B): Red object is 2x2 (4 pixels).\n*   Example 3 (Rule B): Red object is 3x3 (9 pixels).\n*   Example 4 (Rule A): Red object is 1x1 (1 pixel).\n\nCondition could be: Is the Red object larger than 1x1 (i.e., `Count_Red > 1`)?\n*   Ex 1: `Count_Red = 4` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: A) - FAIL\n*   Ex 2: `Count_Red = 4` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: B) - OK\n*   Ex 3: `Count_Red = 9` -> > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected: B) - OK\n*   Ex 4: `Count_Red = 1` -> <= 1 -> Predict Rule A? (Expected: A) - OK\n\nThis almost works, but fails on Example 1.\n\nLet's reconsider the core difference between the groups {1, 4} and {2, 3}.\nGroup {1, 4} -> Rule A (Red->White, White->Blue, Blue->Blue)\nGroup {2, 3} -> Rule B (Red->Red, White->Blue, Blue->White)\n\nWhat if the condition relates to *both* Red and White?\nCondition: Are *both* the Red object *and* the White object larger than 1x1?\n*   Ex 1: Red=4, White=4 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected A) - FAIL\n*   Ex 2: Red=4, White=4 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected B) - OK\n*   Ex 3: Red=9, White=9 -> Both > 1 -> Predict Rule B? (Expected B) - OK\n*   Ex 4: Red=1, White=1 -> Both <= 1 -> Predict Rule A? (Expected A) - OK\n\nStill fails on Example 1.\n\nThere must be a property I'm missing. Let's look at the outputs again.\n\nRule A (Ex 1, 4 outputs): Red becomes White, White becomes Blue, Blue stays Blue.\nRule B (Ex 2, 3 outputs): Red stays Red, White becomes Blue, Blue becomes White.\n\nNotice that White *always* becomes Blue.\nThe difference lies in what happens to Red and Blue.\n*   Rule A: Red -> White, Blue -> Blue\n*   Rule B: Red -> Red, Blue -> White\n\nWhat determines this switch?\n\nMaybe it's about whether the Red and White objects are \"similar\" in some way?\n*   Ex 1: Red is 2x2, White is 2x2. They are the *same size*. (Rule A applied)\n*   Ex 2: Red is 2x2, White is 2x2. They are the *same size*. (Rule B applied)\n*   Ex 3: Red is 3x3, White is 3x3. They are the *same size*. (Rule B applied)\n*   Ex 4: Red is 1x1, White is 1x1. They are the *same size*. (Rule A applied)\n\nThis doesn't work either. All examples have Red and White objects of the same size.\n\n**Thinking outside the box:** What if Green matters?\nNo, Green seems purely background.\n\nWhat if the *position* matters? Is there some symmetry or alignment? Doesn't seem obvious.\n\n**Let's try the initial failed code's condition again:** `is_single_blue_object (4-way)`\nThe code execution showed this was TRUE for all examples. Why did the code produce different outputs then?\nAh, I see the mistake in my previous analysis. I was looking at the *expected* output to determine which rule *should* have been applied. But the code *always* applied Rule B because the condition `is_single_blue_object` was always true.\n\nLet's re-verify the transformed outputs from the failure report against Rule B (Red->Red, White->Blue, Blue->White):\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Red(2) -> Output Red(2) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 2->2*\n    *   Input White(0) -> Output Blue(1) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 0->1*\n    *   Input Blue(1) -> Output White(0) (Matches Rule B) - *Failure report showed 1->0*\n    *   **Wait, the failure report *does* show Rule B was applied!** Why did it say \"Match: False\"? Because the *expected* output for Example 1 uses Rule A.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Red(2) -> Output Red(2)\n    *   Input White(0) -> Output Blue(1)\n    *   Input Blue(1) -> Output White(0)\n    *   **The failure report shows Rule B was applied.** This matches the expected output for Example 2. Why did it fail? Let's compare pixels.\n    *   Expected: `... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3` (Row 3, middle) vs Actual: `... 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3` (Row 3, middle) -> Input Blue(1) became White(0) as per Rule B. Input White(0) became Blue(1) as per Rule B. The failure must be elsewhere.\n    *   Expected: `... 1 1 1 0 0 3 3 3 3` (Row 8, middle) vs Actual: `... 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3` (Row 8, middle) -> Input Blue(1) became White(0). Correct per Rule B.\n    *   Okay, the failure report's \"Transformed Output\" for Example 2 *does* match Rule B application. The failure must be due to comparing it against the *Expected* output which also uses Rule B, but there's a subtle difference.\n    *   Let's look very closely at Example 2 again.\n    *   Input, Row 3: `... 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 3 3`\n    *   Expected, Row 3: `... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3` (Input White 0,0 became Blue 1,1; Input Blue 1,1,1,1,1 became White 0,0,0,0,0 - NO! Blue stays Blue!) Wait, why did I think Rule B applied here?\n    *   **Rule B:** Red -> Red, White -> Blue, Blue -> White\n    *   **Rule A:** Red -> White, White -> Blue, Blue -> Blue\n    *   Example 2 Expected Output vs Input:\n        *   Red(2) -> Red(2)\n        *   White(0) [at (2,10),(2,11), (3,10),(3,11)] -> Blue(1) [at (2,10 to 16? NO! (2,10),(2,11)] -> Blue(1) -> Pixels (2,10),(2,11),(3,10),(3,11) go from 0 to 1.\n        *   Blue(1) [at (2,5 to 9)] -> Blue(1) [at (2,5 to 9)]. Blue STAYS Blue.\n        *   Blue(1) [at (7,8),(7,9), (8,8),(8,9)] -> White(0)? Yes, pixels (7,8),(7,9),(8,8),(8,9) go from 1 to 0 in the expected output.\n    *   This is confusing. Some Blues change to White, some stay Blue? This contradicts both Rule A and Rule B as defined.\n\n**Let's reconsider the transformation entirely.** Maybe it's not a simple global substitution.\n\nWhat if only *certain* pixels change based on local context?\n\nLook at Example 2 again:\nInput:\n"
