            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved in the transformation are Red (2), White (0), and Blue (1). Green (3) acts as a background or neutral color, remaining unchanged in all examples.\n2.  **Objects:** The transformation seems to focus on contiguous blocks (objects) of Red, White, and Blue pixels. These objects vary in size (1x1, 2x2, 3x3) across examples.\n3.  **Transformation Type:** The core operation is a pixel-wise color change applied to Red, White, and/or Blue pixels. The specific changes depend on a condition related to the input grid's composition.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** There appear to be two distinct transformation rules. The rule applied depends on the number of distinct objects of each color (Red, White, Blue) present in the input.\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, there is exactly one distinct object of Red, one of White, and one of Blue. In these cases, White pixels become Blue, and Blue pixels become White, while Red pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   In examples 1 and 4, the condition of having exactly one object of each color (Red, White, Blue) is *not* met (specifically, there isn't one distinct Blue object separate from other blue structures). In these cases, Red pixels become White, White pixels become Blue, and Blue pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
