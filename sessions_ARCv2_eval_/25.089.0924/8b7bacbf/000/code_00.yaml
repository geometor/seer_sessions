task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - element: background
    value: 0 (white)
  - element: objects
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The specific color (1-9) of the object's pixels.
      - shape: Some objects form closed loops or shapes that enclose areas.
  - element: enclosed_regions
    description: Contiguous areas of white pixels completely surrounded by non-white pixels.
  - element: isolated_pixel
    description: A single non-white pixel in the input grid that has no neighbors (including diagonals) of the same color. There is exactly one such pixel per input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of this isolated pixel. This color determines the fill color for the enclosed regions.
  - element: transformation
    description: Filling specific areas of the grid.
    action:
      type: fill
      target: enclosed_regions (white pixels)
      color_source: isolated_pixel's color
relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    subject: non-white pixels (objects)
    object: enclosed_regions (white pixels)
    description: Non-white pixels form boundaries that surround and define the enclosed white regions.
  - type: color_determination
    subject: isolated_pixel
    object: fill action
    description: The color of the single isolated pixel dictates the color used to fill the enclosed white regions.
