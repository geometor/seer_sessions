background_color: azure (8)

objects:
  - type: blue_shape
    count: 2
    attributes:
      - color: blue (1)
      - role:
          - one acts as an upper reference (unchanged)
          - one acts as a lower reference (determines transformation parameters)
  - type: source_pixel
    count: 2 (typically)
    attributes:
      - color: non-blue (1), non-azure (8) (e.g., red(2), yellow(4))
      - location: immediately adjacent (usually above) the top-most pixel(s) of the lower blue_shape
      - role: define the colors and starting order for the generated_line; are removed in the output
  - type: generated_line
    count: 1 (in output only)
    attributes:
      - orientation: vertical
      - location_column: determined by the position of source_pixels
      - location_row_start: 0
      - height: determined by the row index of the top-most pixel(s) of the lower blue_shape
      - color_pattern: alternating sequence of the two source_pixel colors
  - type: other_structure (optional)
    count: variable (e.g., vertical red/green line)
    attributes:
      - color: variable
      - shape: variable
      - role: context / distractor (unchanged in output)

relationships:
  - adjacency: source_pixels are located immediately adjacent (typically above) the lower blue_shape.
  - derivation:
      - generated_line's column is derived from the column of a specific source_pixel.
      - generated_line's height is derived from the row index of the top of the lower blue_shape.
      - generated_line's alternating color pattern is derived from the colors and relative positions of the source_pixels.

actions:
  - identify: locate the two blue_shapes.
  - identify: determine which blue_shape is the lower one.
  - find: locate the non-blue, non-background source_pixels adjacent to the top of the lower blue_shape.
  - determine: based on source_pixel positions, find the target column for the generated_line.
  - determine: based on source_pixel positions, find the starting color and the alternating pattern.
  - determine: based on the top row index of the lower blue_shape, find the height for the generated_line.
  - remove: delete the source_pixels from the grid.
  - generate: create the new vertical generated_line at the determined column, starting from row 0, with the calculated height and alternating color pattern.
  - copy: preserve all other elements (background, upper blue_shape, other structures) from the input to the output.
