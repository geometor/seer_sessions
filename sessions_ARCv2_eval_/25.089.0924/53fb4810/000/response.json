            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid based on specific patterns and relationships between objects within the grid. The input grids consistently feature an azure (8) background, two distinct blue (1) shapes (often different from each other), and one or more other small structures or single pixels near the blue shapes.\n\nThe core transformation focuses on the \"lower\" of the two blue shapes. Specific non-blue, non-background pixels located immediately adjacent to the top of this lower blue shape act as \"source colors\". These source pixels are removed in the output.\n\nA new vertical line is generated in the output grid. The characteristics of this line (location, height, color pattern) are determined by the properties of the source colors and the lower blue shape:\n1.  **Location (Column):** The column index of the new line corresponds to the column of a specific source pixel (typically the one with the lowest row index, and then lowest column index if rows are tied).\n2.  **Height:** The height of the new line is determined by the row index of the highest point of the lower blue shape. The line starts from row 0 and extends downwards for this height.\n3.  **Color Pattern:** The new line consists of an alternating sequence of the two source colors. The order of alternation (which color starts the sequence) depends on the relative positions (row and column) of the source pixels in the input.\n4.  **Other Elements:** The upper blue shape and any other distinct structures (like the vertical red/green lines seen in the examples) remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Determine which blue object is the \"lower\" one (e.g., the one whose lowest pixel has the highest row index, or whose highest pixel has the highest row index if needed for tie-breaking).\n4.  Find the pixel(s) belonging to the lower blue object that have the minimum row index (these are the top-most pixels). Record this minimum row index (`top_row_index`).\n5.  Identify all \"source pixels\": these are non-blue (1) and non-azure (8) pixels directly adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to any of the top-most pixels of the lower blue object, specifically checking positions above, above-left, and above-right of the top-most blue pixels. Store these source pixels with their colors and coordinates (row, column).\n6.  Remove the identified source pixels from the output grid (change their color to the background color, azure 8).\n7.  Determine the target column (`target_col`) for the new vertical line: Among the identified source pixels, find the one(s) with the minimum row index. If there's a tie in row index, select the one with the minimum column index. The column index of this selected pixel is `target_col`.\n8.  Determine the color sequence for the new line:\n    a.  Identify the two distinct colors of the source pixels.\n    b.  Determine the starting color (`color1`):\n        i.  If the source pixels are in different rows, `color1` is the color of the source pixel with the *maximum* row index.\n        ii. If the source pixels are in the same row, `color1` is the color of the source pixel with the *minimum* column index.\n    c.  The second color (`color2`) is the other source pixel color.\n9.  Determine the height (`height`) of the new vertical line: `height = top_row_index`.\n10. Generate the new vertical line in the output grid: Iterate from `row = 0` up to `row = height - 1`. For each `row`:\n    a.  If `row` is even, set the pixel at (`row`, `target_col`) to `color1`.\n    b.  If `row` is odd, set the pixel at (`row`, `target_col`) to `color2`.\n11.
