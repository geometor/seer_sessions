background_color: azure (8)

objects:
  - type: blue_object
    count: 2
    color: blue (1)
    role: reference_objects
      - one acts as upper reference (unchanged)
      - one acts as lower reference (determines line height)

  - type: source_pixel
    count: 2
    color: non-blue (1), non-azure (8)
    shape: single pixel (size = 1)
    role: define line properties (location, color, pattern)
    status: removed in output

  - type: distractor_object (optional)
    count: variable
    color: non-blue (1), non-azure (8)
    shape: variable (typically larger than 1 pixel, often lines or patterns)
    role: context, unchanged in output

  - type: generated_line
    count: 1 or 2 (in output only)
    orientation: vertical
    location_row_start: 0
    height: determined by top row index of lower blue_object
    properties_derived_from: source_pixels

relationships:
  - spatial_comparison: lower blue_object is determined by comparing max_row, then min_row of the two blue_objects.
  - identification: source_pixels are identified as the two single-pixel objects that are not blue or azure.
  - alignment: source_pixels are checked for vertical (same column) or horizontal (same row) alignment.
  - derivation (vertical alignment):
      - generated_line count: 1
      - generated_line column: shared column of source_pixels
      - generated_line color pattern: alternating, starting color (color1) from source_pixel with max_row.
  - derivation (horizontal alignment):
      - generated_line count: 2
      - generated_line columns: columns of the two source_pixels
      - generated_line color pattern: solid, color determined by the source_pixel in that column.

actions:
  - find_objects: Identify all connected components of non-background colors.
  - classify_objects: Categorize objects into blue_objects, potential source_pixels (size=1, non-blue), and distractor_objects (others).
  - identify_lower_blue: Determine the lower of the two blue_objects and its top row index (`height_line`).
  - select_source_pixels: Confirm exactly two single-pixel, non-blue objects exist; these are the source_pixels.
  - remove_source_pixels: Set the location of source_pixels to background_color in the output grid.
  - check_alignment: Determine if source_pixels share a row or column.
  - generate_lines: Create vertical line(s) based on alignment case:
      - Case Same Column: Single alternating line.
      - Case Same Row: Two solid lines.
  - copy_unchanged: Ensure all other pixels (background, upper blue_object, distractor_objects) are copied from input to output.
