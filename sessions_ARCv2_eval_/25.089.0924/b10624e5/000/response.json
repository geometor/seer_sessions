            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are relatively large (27x27) and predominantly filled with a yellow background (color 4).\n2.  **Dividing Lines:** A central vertical blue line (color 1) and a central horizontal blue line (color 1) divide the grid into four distinct quadrants. These lines appear consistently in the same position (column 13 and row 13) in both input and output grids.\n3.  **Objects:** Within the yellow background, there are various small, contiguous shapes (objects) made of different colors (red, green, azure, maroon, blue). These objects are located entirely within one of the four quadrants defined by the blue lines.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves reflecting objects across the dividing lines. Objects in one quadrant are reflected into a different quadrant.\n5.  **Reflection Pattern:**\n    *   Objects in the Top-Left (TL) quadrant are reflected horizontally across the vertical blue line into the Top-Right (TR) quadrant.\n    *   Objects in the Top-Right (TR) quadrant are reflected vertically across the horizontal blue line into the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant.\n    *   Objects in the Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant are reflected horizontally across the vertical blue line into the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant.\n    *   Objects in the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant are reflected vertically across the horizontal blue line into the Top-Right (TR) quadrant.\n6.  **Additive Process:** The reflections are *added* to the output grid. The original objects remain in their positions in the output grid, along with the newly added reflected objects. The blue dividing lines and yellow background remain unchanged.\n7.  **Quadrant Definition:**\n    *   TL: Rows 0 to 12, Columns 0 to 12\n    *   TR: Rows 0 to 12, Columns 14 to 26\n    *   BL: Rows 14 to 26, Columns 0 to 12\n    *   BR: Rows 14 to 26, Columns 14 to 26\n    *   The blue lines themselves (row 13 and column 13) are separators and do not contain objects to be reflected, nor are they destinations for reflection pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
