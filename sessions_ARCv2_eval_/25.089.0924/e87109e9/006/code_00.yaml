task_context:
  description: Stamp a 2x2 azure pattern onto a main grid, protecting certain areas.
  input_structure:
    - type: border
      color: gray (5)
      location: top row (row 0)
    - type: key_panel
      location: rows between top border (row 0) and separator row.
      content: multiple gray-bordered patterns containing one non-white/non-gray color adjacent to white pixels.
      purpose: defines a set of 'protected' colors.
    - type: separator
      color: gray (5)
      orientation: horizontal line
      location: last full row of gray pixels, separates key_panel from main_grid.
    - type: main_grid
      location: bottom section (below separator row).
      content: various colored shapes and background. Can include azure (8).
      purpose: the area to be transformed.
  output_structure:
    - type: grid
      size: matches the input's main_grid size.
      content: modified version of the input's main_grid.

objects:
  - id: explicit_key_colors
    source: non-white (0), non-gray (5) pixels adjacent (4-connectivity) to white (0) pixels in the key_panel.
    property: 'protected' - pixels with these colors prevent stamping in their 2x2 block.
  - id: main_grid_pixels
    source: all pixels in the main_grid section of the input.
  - id: stamp_color
    value: azure (8)
  - id: stamp_unit
    shape: 2x2 square

actions:
  - action: find_separator
    input: input_grid
    output: row_index of the last full gray row
  - action: extract_grid_sections
    input: input_grid, separator_row_index
    output: key_panel, main_grid
  - action: extract_keys
    input: key_panel
    output: set of protected explicit_key_colors
  - action: copy_grid
    input: main_grid
    output: initial output_grid
  - action: iterate_and_stamp
    target: output_grid
    based_on: input main_grid
    unit: 2x2 blocks (defined by top-left corner)
    condition: check if any pixel within the corresponding 2x2 block in the *input* main_grid has a color present in the set of explicit_key_colors.
    effect:
      - if condition is FALSE: overwrite the 2x2 block in the output_grid with the stamp_color (azure).
      - if condition is TRUE: leave the 2x2 block in the output_grid unchanged (preserving original colors from the input main_grid).

relationships:
  - type: protection
    subject: pixels in the main_grid matching explicit_key_colors
    effect: prevent overwriting by the azure stamp in any 2x2 block containing them.
  - type: spatial_grouping
    granularity: 2x2 blocks
    purpose: determines the unit of checking (in input) and potential stamping (in output).
