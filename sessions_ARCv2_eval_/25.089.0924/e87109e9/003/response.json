This \n   is the *last* row index consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels.\n2. Split the input grid based on the separator row:\n   - The \"key panel\" is the section between row 0 (exclusive, assuming row 0 is a border) \n     and the separator row (exclusive).\n   - The \"main grid\" includes all rows below the separator row.\n3. Extract a set of \"protected colors\" from the key panel. A color is protected if \n   it's not white (0), not gray (5), and is adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least \n   one white (0) pixel within the key panel.\n4. Initialize an output grid as an exact copy of the input's main grid.\n5. Iterate through the input's main grid using a 2x2 sliding window, defined by its \n   top-left corner (r, c).\n6. For each 2x2 window in the input's main grid:\n   - Check if *any* of the four pixels within this window contains a color present \n     in the set of protected colors.\n   - If *none* of the pixels are protected colors, change the corresponding 2x2 \n     block in the output grid to be entirely azure (8).\n   - If *at least one* pixel is a protected color, leave the corresponding 2x2 \n     block in the output grid unchanged.\n7.
