            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is consistently divided into two main sections separated by a horizontal line of gray (5) pixels.\n2.  **Top Section (\"Keys\"):** This section appears to define a set of rules or parameters. It contains small, isolated patterns bordered by gray (5). Each pattern consists of a single non-white pixel adjacent to three white (0) pixels. The non-white colors in these patterns vary across examples (e.g., blue, magenta, yellow, red in train\\_1).\n3.  **Bottom Section (\"Main Grid\"):** This is the primary canvas for the transformation. It has a background color (green in train\\_1, blue in train\\_2, orange in train\\_3) and contains various colored objects or shapes. Notably, a 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels is always present somewhere within this section in the input, though its location varies.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid corresponds in size to the *bottom section* (main grid) of the input. The top \"key\" section is absent.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing parts of the main grid to azure (8). The original shapes and background are partially preserved. The azure color seems to spread or be stamped in 2x2 blocks. Crucially, areas containing the specific colors identified in the top \"key\" section seem resistant to being overwritten by azure. The original 2x2 azure block in the input does not seem to dictate the *location* of the stamping, but rather the *color* used for stamping (azure) and perhaps the *size* (2x2).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Separate the input grid into two parts: the \"key panel\" (top section above the solid gray line) and the \"main grid\" (bottom section below the gray line).\n2.  Identify the set of \"protected colors\" by finding all unique non-white colors that are located next to a white pixel within the gray-bordered patterns in the key panel.\n3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) that is initially an exact copy of the input's main grid.\n4.  Iterate through every possible 2x2 block of pixels in the input's main grid. Define a block by its top-left corner's row (r) and column (c). The block includes pixels at (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), and (r+1, c+1).\n5.  For each 2x2 block in the input's main grid, check if *any* of its four pixels have a color that is present in the set of \"protected colors\" identified in step 2.\n6.  If *none* of the four pixels in the input 2x2 block match any of the protected colors, then change the corresponding 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid to be entirely azure (8).\n7.  If *at least one* pixel in the input 2x2 block *does* match a protected color, make no changes to the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid (it retains the colors copied in step 3).\n8.  After iterating through all possible 2x2 blocks, the resulting output grid is the final result."
