      description: Rectangular regions with a dominant Frame Color (F) and internal pixels of a consistent Noise Color (N).
      properties: [frame_color, noise_color, position, size]
    - type: source_info
      description: Regions providing the color used for replacement. Can be structured blocks or less defined areas. Contains information linking to target blocks via the Noise Color (N) and position.

actions:
  - action: identify_noise_color
    description: Find the color (N) common to the interior of multiple distinct blocks.
  - action: identify_target_blocks
    description: Find blocks defined by (Frame F, Noise N). Record F and position.
  - action: identify_source_pattern
    description: Determine if source info follows Pattern A (F_src, N) or Pattern B (N, RC). Record relevant colors (F_src or RC) and positions.
