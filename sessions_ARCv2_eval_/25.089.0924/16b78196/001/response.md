Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the main horizontal band: Find the most frequent non-white color ('base_color') in the input grid. Determine the topmost row ('min_row') where this 'base_color' first appears. This row marks the upper boundary of the main band area.
2. Project colors downwards: For every white pixel (hole) located at or below 'min_row', look vertically upwards in the same column. Find the first non-white pixel encountered in the rows above 'min_row'. 
3. Fill holes: Fill the white hole in the output grid with the color found in step 2. If no non-white pixel is found above, the hole remains white.
4. Clear upper area: Set all pixels in the output grid in rows above 'min_row' to white (0).
5. Preserve the rest: Pixels at or below 'min_row' that are not white holes retain their original color from the input grid.
