            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Background Color:** The dominant color in all input and output grids is azure (8). This appears to function as the background or empty space.\n2.  **Objects/Shapes:** In the input grids, there are distinct shapes made of various colors (green, maroon, blue, yellow, magenta, red, orange). Some shapes are enclosed by a green (3) border or frame. Other colored shapes exist independently.\n3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to involve \"projecting\" or \"extending\" colors outwards from their original positions. The output grid retains the original shapes, but the azure background pixels adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to non-azure pixels are filled with the color of that adjacent non-azure pixel. This projection continues outwards in straight lines (horizontal and vertical) until it hits another non-azure pixel or the edge of the grid.\n4.  **Frame Invariance:** The green (3) frames, where present, remain unchanged in the output. The projection seems to happen from the colors *inside* the frame as well as from colored pixels *outside* any frame.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The original colors of the shapes are preserved and used for the outward projection. No new colors are introduced, and existing colors don't change, except for the azure background being overwritten.\n6.  **Projection Rule:** The projection happens strictly horizontally and vertically. Diagonal projection does not occur. A projection line stops immediately upon encountering any pixel that is not azure (8).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
