Determine the background color (most frequent pixel color).\n2.  Find all contiguous objects (connected orthogonally or diagonally) of non-background colors.\n3.  If no non-background objects exist, return a grid filled with the background color.\n4.  Identify the object with the largest number of pixels. Its color is the 'shape_color', and its pixel locations are recorded.\n5.  Identify all single-pixel objects whose color is neither the background color nor the 'shape_color'. These are 'anchor points'. Their color is the 'anchor_color', and their locations are recorded.\n6.  Create an output grid filled with the background color.\n7.  Copy the largest object onto the output grid using its original 'shape_color' and locations.\n8.  For each anchor point's location (r, c), draw a 3x3 cross pattern overlaid on the output grid:\n    - Center pixel (r, c) gets the 'anchor_color'.\n    - Orthogonally adjacent pixels (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) get the 'shape_color', respecting grid boundaries. These overwrite any existing pixel (background or largest object).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, background_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.\n    Connectivity includes orthogonal and diagonal neighbors (8-way).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        background_color (int): The color to ignore (background).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              with keys 'color', 'locations' (list of (row, col) tuples),\n              and 'size'.
