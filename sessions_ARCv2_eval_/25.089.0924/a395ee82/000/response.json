The core elements appear to be:\n\n1.  **Background:** A dominant color filling most of the grid.\n2.  **Largest Object:** A contiguous shape (connected orthogonally or diagonally) made of a single color, which has the largest pixel count compared to other non-background shapes. The color of this object is important.\n3.  **Anchor Points:** Single pixels of a specific color, distinct from both the background and the largest object's color. The locations and color of these anchor points are crucial.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid is generated by placing a specific pattern (a 3x3 cross) centered at each anchor point location. The colors used in the cross pattern are derived from the anchor point color (for the center) and the largest object's color (for the arms). The original shapes from the input grid (including the largest object and the anchors) are not directly copied; only their properties influence the output pattern. The output grid starts as a blank canvas filled with the background color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all contiguous objects (groups of connected pixels of the same color, excluding the background color). For each object, record its color, size (pixel count), and pixel locations.\n3.  Find the object with the largest size (maximum pixel count). Store its color as `shape_color`.\n4.  Find all objects that consist of exactly one pixel. From these single-pixel objects, select those whose color is *not* the background color and *not* the `shape_color`. These are the anchor points. Store their color as `anchor_color` and their locations. (Note: It's assumed all valid anchor points in a given input grid will have the same color).\n5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it completely with the background color.\n6.  Iterate through each identified anchor point location `(row, column)`.\n7.  For each anchor point location:\n    a.  Place the `anchor_color` at the `(row, column)` coordinate in the output grid.\n    b.  Place the `shape_color` at the four orthogonally adjacent coordinates: `(row-1, column)`, `(row+1, column)`, `(row, column-1)`, and `(row, column+1)`, but only if these coordinates are valid (within the bounds of the grid). Overwrite any existing color (which would initially be the background color).\n8.  The final state of the output grid after processing all anchor points is the result."
