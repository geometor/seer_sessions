task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: remain constant between input and output
  - background_color: identified as the most frequent color in the input grid; preserved in the output grid except where patterns are drawn
objects:
  - type: contiguous_shapes
    definition: pixels of the same color connected orthogonally or diagonally
    properties:
      - color: the specific color of the pixels in the shape
      - size: the number of pixels comprising the shape
      - location: the coordinates of the pixels in the shape
      - bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape
  - role: largest_object
    identification: the contiguous shape with the maximum pixel count among all non-background shapes
    relevant_property: color (let's call it 'shape_color')
  - role: anchor_points
    identification: all single-pixel shapes whose color is different from the background color and different from the 'shape_color'
    relevant_properties:
      - color (let's call it 'anchor_color')
      - location (row, column coordinates)
actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: input grid
    output: background color value
  - action: find_objects
    input: input grid, background_color
    output: list of all contiguous non-background objects with their properties (color, size, locations)
  - action: identify_largest_object
    input: list of objects
    output: the object with the maximum size, extract its 'shape_color'
  - action: identify_anchor_points
    input: list of objects, background_color, shape_color
    output: list of single-pixel objects whose color is not background_color and not shape_color, extract their 'anchor_color' and locations
  - action: generate_output_grid
    input: input grid dimensions, background_color, anchor_points (locations and anchor_color), shape_color
    process:
      1. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
      2. For each anchor point location (r, c):
         - Define a 3x3 cross pattern centered at (r, c).
         - Set the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to 'anchor_color'.
         - Set the pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) in the output grid to 'shape_color', provided these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    output: the final output grid
relationships:
  - relationship: color_mapping
    between: largest_object_color, anchor_point_color
    description: The color of the largest object determines the color of the arms of the output crosses. The color of the anchor points determines the color of the center of the output crosses.
  - relationship: spatial_mapping
    between: anchor_point_location, output_pattern_location
    description: Each anchor point's location in the input grid determines the center location for a 3x3 cross pattern in the output grid.
