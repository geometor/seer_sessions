            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the background color, the largest non-background object (based on pixel count), and the single-pixel 'anchor' objects with a distinct color. However, the transformation logic was flawed. The code assumed the largest object was copied to the output grid, and then the cross patterns were overlaid.\n\nAnalysis of the failed examples reveals a different pattern:\n\n1.  The output grid starts as a blank canvas filled with the background color.\n2.  The original shapes from the input (including the largest object) are *not* directly copied to the output.\n3.  The location and color of the 'anchor' points determine the center of the cross patterns in the output.\n4.  The *color* (but not the shape or location) of the largest object determines the color of the arms of the cross patterns.\n5.  The final output consists only of the background color and the generated cross patterns.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the natural language program and the corresponding code to implement this corrected logic: identify background, largest object color, anchor points (color and locations), create a background-filled output grid, and draw the crosses using the appropriate colors at the anchor locations.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's verify the components based on the revised hypothesis for each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Background Color: Yellow (4)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Red (2) T-shape: Size 7 pixels. **Largest Object.** `shape_color` = Red (2).\n    *   Azure (8) pixels: Size 1 each at (6,4), (8,2), (10,4), (12,4). **Anchor Points.** `anchor_color` = Azure (8).\n*   Output Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Expected Output Construction:\n    *   Start with a 22x22 grid of Yellow (4).\n    *   For each anchor location (e.g., (6,4)):\n        *   Set pixel (6,4) to Azure (8).\n        *   Set pixels (5,4), (7,4), (6,3), (6,5) to Red (2).\n    *   Repeat for all anchor locations.\n*   Result Analysis: The previous code failed because it copied the Red (2) shape *and* drew crosses, leading to incorrect output. The revised hypothesis matches the expected output structure.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Background Color: Green (3)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Blue (1) H-shape: Size 11 pixels. **Largest Object.** `shape_color` = Blue (1).\n    *   Red (2) pixels: Size 1 each at (11,13), (11,15), (11,17), (15,15). **Anchor Points.** `anchor_color` = Red (2).\n*   Output Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Expected Output Construction:\n    *   Start with a 22x22 grid of Green (3).\n    *   For each anchor location (e.g., (11,13)):\n        *   Set pixel (11,13) to Red (2).\n        *   Set pixels (10,13), (12,13), (11,12), (11,14) to Blue (1).\n    *   Repeat for all anchor locations.\n*   Result Analysis: The previous code failed because it copied the Blue (1) shape *and* drew crosses. The revised hypothesis matches the expected output structure.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Background Color: Orange (7)\n*   Objects:\n    *   Yellow (4) cloud-shape: Size 7 pixels. **Largest Object.** `shape_color` = Yellow (4).\n    *   Magenta (6) pixels: Size 1 each at (8,13), (10,11), (10,13), (10,15), (12,11), (12,15). **Anchor Points.** `anchor_color` = Magenta (6).\n*   Output Grid Size: 22x22\n*   Expected Output Construction:\n    *   Start with a 22x22 grid of Orange (7).\n    *   For each anchor location (e.g., (8,13)):\n        *   Set pixel (8,13) to Magenta (6).\n        *   Set pixels (7,13), (9,13), (8,12), (8,14) to Yellow (4).\n    *   Repeat for all anchor locations.\n*   Result Analysis: The previous code failed because it copied the Yellow (4) shape *and* drew crosses. The revised hypothesis matches the expected output structure.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
