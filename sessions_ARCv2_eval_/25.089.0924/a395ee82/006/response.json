However, the previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed the output grid was built solely from the cross patterns on a background canvas. The comparison between the generated outputs and expected outputs clearly shows that the largest object from the input grid *persists* in the output grid, and the cross patterns are drawn *over* this base grid (background + largest object).\n\nThe strategy is to revise the process: first establish the base output grid (background + largest object), then overlay the cross patterns derived from the anchor points and the largest object's color.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
