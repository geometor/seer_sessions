"""
Transforms an input grid by:
1. Identifying the background color (most frequent).
2. Finding all contiguous non-background objects (8-way connectivity).
3. Determining the color ('shape_color') of the largest object (by pixel count).
4. Identifying single-pixel 'anchor' objects whose color is different from both the background and shape_color. The color of these anchors is 'anchor_color'.
5. Creating a new grid filled with the background color.
6. For each anchor point location, drawing a cross pattern: the center pixel gets the anchor_color, and the four orthogonal neighbors get the shape_color (respecting grid boundaries).
If no non-background objects or no anchor points are found, the output is a grid filled with the background color.

    Finds all contiguous objects of non-background colors in the grid.
