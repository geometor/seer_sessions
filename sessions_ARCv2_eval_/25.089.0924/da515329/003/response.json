Finding all white pixels reachable from the grid borders without crossing azure pixels (exterior white pixels) using a flood fill (BFS) algorithm starting from border white pixels. 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals) is used.\n2. Creating an output grid where:\n   - Original azure pixels (8) from the input become white (0) in the output.\n   - Exterior white pixels (0) from the input (those reachable from the border) remain white (0) in the output.\n   - Interior white pixels (0) from the input (those *not* reachable from the border) become azure (8) in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by filling enclosed white regions with azure.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list of integers representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list of integers representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to NumPy array for efficient operations\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize a boolean grid to track visited white cells reachable from the border\n    visited = np.zeros_like(input_grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Initialize a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Define 8-directional neighbors (relative coordinates)\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),          (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # 1.
