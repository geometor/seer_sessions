*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The initial assessment correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: dividing the grid into 9 regions and permuting their contents. However, the specific permutation map derived from observing only the first example was incorrect.
    *   The test results show that the code produced output grids of the correct size but with incorrect pixel placements and colors, confirming that the basic structure (region division) was likely right, but the mapping (permutation) was wrong.
    *   The strategy is to re-analyze the input-output pairs for *all three* training examples to deduce the single, fixed permutation map that applies consistently across all of them. This involves tracking the content of each of the 9 input regions to its corresponding location in the output grid for each example and finding the common mapping.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    We need to confirm the grid dimensions and calculate the region boundaries for each example. All examples use a 22x22 grid.

``` python
import numpy as np

def get_boundaries(H, W):
    r1 = H // 3
    r2 = 2 * H // 3
    c1 = W // 3
    c2 = 2 * W // 3
    row_boundaries = [0, r1, r2, H]
    col_boundaries = [0, c1, c2, W]
    return row_boundaries, col_boundaries

# Example 1 dimensions
H1, W1 = 22, 22
rb1, cb1 = get_boundaries(H1, W1)

# Example 2 dimensions
H2, W2 = 22, 22
rb2, cb2 = get_boundaries(H2, W2)

# Example 3 dimensions
H3, W3 = 22, 22
rb3, cb3 = get_boundaries(H3, W3)

print(f"Example 1: H={H1}, W={W1}, Row Boundaries={rb1}, Col Boundaries={cb1}")
print(f"Example 2: H={H2}, W={W2}, Row Boundaries={rb2}, Col Boundaries={cb2}")
print(f"Example 3: H={H3}, W={W3}, Row Boundaries={rb3}, Col Boundaries={cb3}")

# Verify region dimensions from boundaries
print("\nRegion dimensions (Height x Width):")
for r in range(3):
    for c in range(3):
        height = rb1[r+1] - rb1[r]
        width = cb1[c+1] - cb1[c]
        print(f"Region ({r},{c}): {height}x{width}")
```
```
Example 1: H=22, W=22, Row Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22], Col Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22]
Example 2: H=22, W=22, Row Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22], Col Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22]
Example 3: H=22, W=22, Row Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22], Col Boundaries=[0, 7, 14, 22]

Region dimensions (Height x Width):
Region (0,0): 7x7
Region (0,1): 7x7
Region (0,2): 7x8
Region (1,0): 7x7
Region (1,1): 7x7
Region (1,2): 7x8
Region (2,0): 8x7
Region (2,1): 8x7
Region (2,2): 8x8

```
The dimensions and boundaries are consistent for all examples. The regions are not perfectly square due to the grid size (22) not being perfectly divisible by 3, but the division logic is sound. The previous code correctly implemented this division. The error lies solely in the `permutation_map`.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid.
2.  Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions H x W.
3.  Calculate the row division points: `r1 = H // 3`, `r2 = 2 * H // 3`. Define row boundaries: `[0, r1, r2, H]`.
4.  Calculate the column division points: `c1 = W // 3`, `c2 = 2 * W // 3`. Define column boundaries: `[0, c1, c2, W]`.
5.  Define the 9 input regions using these boundaries. For input region `(r_in, c_in)` (where `r_in`, `c_in` are 0, 1, or 2), the pixels are from `row_boundaries[r_in]` to `row_boundaries[r_in+1]-1` and `col_boundaries[c_in]` to `col_boundaries[c_in+1]-1`.
6.  Define the 9 output regions using the same boundaries.
7.  Define the fixed permutation map (Input Region `(r_in, c_in)` -> Output Region `(r_out, c_out)`):
    *   (0, 0) -> (0, 0)
    *   (0, 1) -> (0, 2)
    *   (0, 2) -> (1, 0)
    *   (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
    *   (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
    *   (1, 2) -> (2, 1)
    *   (2, 0) -> (2, 2)
    *   (2, 1) -> (2, 0)
    *   (2, 2) -> (0, 1)
8.  For each input region `(r_in, c_in)` from (0,0) to (2,2):
    a.  Extract the subgrid of pixels corresponding to this input region.
    b.  Determine the target output region `(r_out, c_out)` using the permutation map.
    c.  Calculate the top-left corner coordinates of the target output region (`row_boundaries[r_out]`, `col_boundaries[c_out]`).
    d.  Copy the extracted input subgrid into the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner of the target output region.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
