It looks like the grid is conceptually divided into 9 regions (a 3x3 grid), and the entire content of these regions is permuted according to a fixed rule.\n    *   By dividing the 22x22 grid into nine roughly equal rectangular regions (approximated by dividing height and width by 3) and tracking the content of each region from input to output, a consistent permutation map emerges across all examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n\n"
