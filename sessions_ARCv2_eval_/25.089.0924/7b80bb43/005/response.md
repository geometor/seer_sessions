"""
Transforms an input grid based on two rules applied sequentially:

1.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the background color (most frequent in the input grid) and the foreground color (the other color present).
2.  **Cleanup Isolated Pixels:** Create a working copy of the input grid. Iterate through the *original* input grid. For each pixel with the foreground color, check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right). If *none* of the cardinal neighbors in the *original* grid have the foreground color, change the corresponding pixel in the *working copy* to the background color.
3.  **Fill Horizontal Gaps:** Iterate through each row of the grid resulting from the cleanup step. Find any sequence of one or more background pixels that are immediately preceded and followed by foreground pixels on the same row. Change all background pixels within such sequences to the foreground color.
4.  **Output:** Return the final modified grid.
