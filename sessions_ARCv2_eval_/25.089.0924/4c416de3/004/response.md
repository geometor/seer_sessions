**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial transformation rule, focusing on coloring background pixels cardinally adjacent to 'trigger pixels' (non-background, non-white pixels adjacent to white pixels), failed to produce the correct outputs. The discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs consistently involve 2x2 blocks of color appearing diagonally relative to the corners of the white (0) regions. The original rule produced single colored pixels or incomplete shapes instead of these 2x2 blocks.

The strategy is to revise the rule based on these observations:

1.  **Focus on White Regions:** Treat contiguous blocks of white pixels as distinct objects.
2.  **Bounding Boxes and Corners:** Determine the bounding box for each white region. The transformation seems linked to the diagonal corners *outside* this bounding box.
3.  **Associated Color Pixels:** Identify the non-white, non-background pixels associated with each white region. Association might mean being inside the bounding box or directly adjacent to the white region.
4.  **Proximity Rule:** The color used for the 2x2 block at a corner appears to be determined by the *closest* associated color pixel to that corner.
5.  **2x2 Block Placement:** The 2x2 block is painted in a specific location relative to the identified corner pixel.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's analyze the relationship between white regions, associated color pixels, and the resulting 2x2 blocks for Example 1.
