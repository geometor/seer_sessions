This color remains largely unchanged in the output, except for specific modifications.\n2.  **White Regions:** There are distinct areas or shapes composed of white (0) pixels scattered within the background. These white regions themselves appear unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Trigger Pixels:** Inside or immediately adjacent to these white regions, there are single pixels of various other colors (non-white, non-background). Examples include green, yellow, red in train_1; blue, yellow, magenta, green, red, orange in train_2; blue, green, yellow, maroon, azure in train_3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *background* pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to these \"trigger\" pixels. The background pixels take on the color of the adjacent trigger pixel.\n5.  **Condition for Transformation:** The trigger pixel must be adjacent (cardinally) to at least one white (0) pixel for the transformation to occur on its neighboring background pixels.\n6.  **Result:** This process often effectively expands the single trigger pixel into a 2x2 block, where the original trigger pixel and its newly colored background neighbors form the block. If a trigger pixel has multiple background neighbors, they all change color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
