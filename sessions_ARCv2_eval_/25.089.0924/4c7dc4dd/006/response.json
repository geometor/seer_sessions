            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed on both training examples, indicating fundamental issues in either identifying the correct objects (framed objects, container blocks) or applying the selection logic (containment check, color priority).\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code returned `[[0]]`, suggesting it failed to identify the necessary components (the framed object or the container block) or incorrectly determined their relationship, leading to an undefined state or error handled by the fallback. The most likely cause is the `is_framed_object_strict` function being too restrictive, failing to recognize the magenta cross within the yellow frame because its pixels might touch the inner boundary of the frame's bounding box, or the logic to check if all interior space is accounted for failed.\n*   **Example 2 Failure:** The code produced a 4x4 grid (correct size for the 'not contained' case) but used the wrong color (yellow=4 instead of red=2). This implies it correctly determined the 'not contained' scenario but selected the wrong framed object based on the minimum `inner_color` rule. It likely selected an object with inner color 4 instead of the object with inner color 2. This could stem from incorrect identification of candidates by `is_framed_object_strict` or an error in the sorting/selection logic for the `not_contained` case.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine `is_framed_object_strict`:** Loosen the constraint that the inner object cannot touch the frame's bounding box edges. The crucial part is that it's a distinct contiguous object within the white space defined by the frame, and its color differs from the frame. Ensure the check for surrounding white space and the single inner object is robust.\n2.  **Verify Container Identification:** Double-check that `find_largest_solid_block` correctly identifies the large red block in Example 1 and the large azure block in Example 2, applying tie-breaking rules correctly.\n3.  **Verify Target Selection Logic:** Step through the selection process for both examples:\n    *   Example 1: Confirm the single framed object is found, the red container is found, containment is true, and the 5x5 output is generated with the correct colors (inner=magenta=6, primary=red=2).\n    *   Example 2: Confirm *all* framed objects are found (especially the one with inner=red=2 and others with inner=yellow=4). Confirm the azure container is found. Confirm containment check fails for the red-inner object. Confirm the sorting for the 'not contained' case correctly picks the object with inner=red=2 based on the minimum color rule. Confirm the 4x4 output is generated with primary=red=2.\n4.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to log the intermediate findings (identified objects, container, selected target, containment status) for each example to pinpoint the exact step where the logic deviates.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
