Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are large (30x30) and contain a mix of background noise (often repeating sequences like 1,2,3,4) and distinct geometric objects.
2.  **Key Objects:** The relevant objects appear to be:
    *   **Solid Blocks:** Large, contiguous rectangular areas of a single color (like the red block in `train_1`). White (0) and Gray (5) likely don't count as primary block colors.
    *   **Framed Objects:** Objects consisting of a colored border (e.g., yellow=4 or azure=8), a white (0) interior, and sometimes a smaller, single-colored shape entirely within that white interior (e.g., magenta=6, yellow=4, red=2).
3.  **Relationships:** The crucial relationship seems to be containment â€“ whether a "Framed Object" is located entirely inside a "Solid Block".
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are small (5x5 or 4x4) and seem to be constructed based on colors derived from a selected "Framed Object" and its potential container "Solid Block". The pattern of the output grid depends on whether the selected Framed Object was contained within a Solid Block.

    description: A framed_object can be located entirely inside a solid_block.

actions:
  - name: identify_candidates
    input: input_grid
    output: list of framed_objects matching the definition
  - name: identify_container

    output: the single largest solid_block (if one exists)
  - name: select_target_object
    input: list of candidate framed_objects, container_object (or null)
    output: the single framed_object relevant for output generation
    logic: |
      1. Prioritize candidates contained within the container_object.
      2. If containment exists, select the top-leftmost contained candidate.
      3. If no containment exists, select the candidate with the lowest inner_color value (breaking ties with top-leftmost position).
  - name: extract_colors
    input: target_object, container_object (or null)
    output: inner_color, interior_color (0), primary_color
    logic: |
      inner_color = target_object.inner_color
      interior_color = 0
      primary_color = container_object.color if target_object is contained, else target_object.inner_color
  - name: generate_output_grid
    input: inner_color, interior_color, primary_color, is_contained

    logic: |
      If is_contained:
        Construct a 5x5 grid using a fixed pattern with inner_color, primary_color, and interior_color.
      Else:
        Construct a 4x4 grid using a fixed pattern with primary_color (which equals inner_color) and interior_color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Candidate Framed Objects:** Find all objects within the input grid that consist of a border of a single color, surrounding an area filled entirely with white (0), which in turn contains a single, contiguous shape of a third distinct color. Record the `inner_color` for each candidate.
2.  **Identify Largest Solid Container:** Find the largest solid rectangular block of a single color (excluding white=0 and gray=5) in the input grid. Note its color (`container_color`) and boundaries. If no such block exists or is unambiguous, consider the container as absent.
3.  **Select the Target Framed Object:**
    *   Check if any identified candidate framed objects lie completely within the boundaries of the largest solid container.
    *   If one or more candidates are contained, select the top-leftmost one as the "target object". Mark this case as `contained`.
    *   If *no* candidates are contained within the largest solid block, select the candidate object that has the numerically smallest `inner_color`. If there's a tie in `inner_color`, choose the top-leftmost one among them. Mark this case as `not_contained`.
4.  **Determine Output Colors:**
    *   Get the `inner_color` from the target object.
    *   The `interior_color` is always white (0).
    *   If the case is `contained`, the `primary_color` is the `container_color` identified in step 2.
    *   If the case is `not_contained`, the `primary_color` is the same as the `inner_color` of the target object.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   If the case is `contained`: Create a 5x5 grid following this pattern:
        
```
        Row 1: interior, interior, interior, interior, interior
        Row 2: inner,    primary,  primary,  primary,  primary
        Row 3: primary,  interior, interior, interior, interior
        Row 4: primary,  interior, interior, interior, interior
        Row 5: primary,  interior, interior, interior, interior
        ```

        (Using the colors determined in step 4).
    *   If the case is `not_contained`: Create a 4x4 grid following this pattern:
        
```
        Row 1: primary,  primary,  interior, primary
        Row 2: interior, interior, interior, primary
        Row 3: primary,  primary,  primary,  primary
        Row 4: primary,  interior, interior, primary
        ```

        (Using the colors determined in step 4, where `primary_color == inner_color`).
