            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe core transformation logic involves identifying specific types of objects or pixels in the input grid and applying distinct rules based on their color and shape.\n\n1.  **Pixel-to-Shape Transformation:** Single pixels of specific colors (red and green) expand into larger, hollow square shapes of different colors (yellow and blue, respectively). This transformation is conditional on the resulting shape fitting entirely within the grid boundaries.\n2.  **Object Manipulation:** Certain predefined objects undergo specific transformations: 2x2 magenta squares are shifted diagonally up-left, while 4x4 hollow blue squares are copied directly to the output in the same position.\n3.  **Filtering/Removal:** Any input pixel or object that does not match the criteria for transformation (Cases 1 & 2) is effectively removed, resulting in white (0) pixels in the corresponding output locations. This includes single pixels of colors other than red or green (e.g., gray), single red/green pixels whose expanded shape would go out of bounds, and larger objects of colors/shapes not explicitly handled (e.g., the 4x4 hollow yellow square in `train_3`).\n4.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is built by applying these transformations and copying/shifting rules onto an initially white grid. The transformations from different input elements can potentially overlap in the output grid. The order of application doesn't seem to matter based on the examples, as the transformed/copied objects don't overlap destructively.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
