task_type: pattern_propagation
grid_properties:
  separator_color: 2 # red
  block_size: [4, 4] # The size of the unit including the separator
  pattern_size: [3, 3] # The size of the pattern within the block
input_elements:
  - object: target_pattern
    definition: [[4, 4, 4], [4, 1, 4], [4, 4, 4]] # yellow/blue pattern
    role: the default pattern that can be changed
  - object: trigger_pattern
    definition: [[3, 1, 3], [3, 1, 3], [3, 3, 3]] # green/blue pattern
    role: the pattern that causes adjacent target patterns to change
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Two patterns are adjacent if their containing 4x4 blocks share a separator line segment (horizontally or vertically). Diagonal adjacency does not count.
    scope: between pattern blocks
transformation:
  action: replace_pattern
  condition: A target_pattern block is replaced if it is adjacent to a trigger_pattern block in the input grid.
  effect: The target_pattern block's 3x3 area is replaced with the trigger_pattern.
output_elements:
  - object: grid
    state: Contains the original separator lines and patterns, but with target_patterns converted to trigger_patterns where the adjacency condition was met in the input.
