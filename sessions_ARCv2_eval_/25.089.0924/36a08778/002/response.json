            "text": "The code confirms the deduction of regions based on vertical magenta lines. Example 5 is interesting - the magenta line is at column 0, meaning the entire grid effectively acts as one region (columns 1-19), excluding the column 0 boundary itself. This aligns with the widespread fill seen in its output.\n\nThe analysis confirms the hypothesis: the transformation operates independently within regions defined by vertical magenta lines (color 6).\n\n**Refinement Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Regions:** Determine the column ranges defined by vertical magenta (6) lines and grid edges.\n2.  **Process Each Region:** For each region:\n    *   Create a temporary mask/view of the grid corresponding to the current region.\n    *   Perform the connected components search (BFS) *only within this region*. The BFS should consider orange (7) and red (2) pixels as connectable and should *not* cross into other regions (i.e., stop at the region's column boundaries) or cross *any* magenta (6) pixels (even if they are within the region, though the examples don't show internal magenta pixels other than the vertical lines).\n    *   If a component within the region contains a red (2) pixel, change all orange (7) pixels belonging to that component *within that region* to magenta (6) in the main output grid.\n\nThis revised strategy correctly handles the separation imposed by the magenta lines.## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core elements (orange background, red sources, magenta boundaries/fill color) and the concept of connected components. However, it failed because it applied the fill logic globally across the entire grid wherever connectivity existed, ignoring the crucial role of the vertical magenta lines (color 6) as strict separators or region dividers. The transformed outputs consistently showed fills occurring across areas that should have been separated by these magenta lines according to the expected outputs.\n\nThe key insight missed was that the magenta lines partition the grid into distinct vertical regions. The connected component analysis and subsequent fill operation must be performed *independently within each region*. A connected component cannot span across these magenta boundaries.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Region Identification:** First, identify the vertical column ranges that define distinct regions. These regions are bounded by the vertical magenta lines (color 6) and the grid's left/right edges.\n2.  **Region-Specific Processing:** Iterate through each identified region.\n3.  **Component Search within Region:** For each region, perform a connected components search (e.g., BFS or DFS) considering only the pixels *within that region's column boundaries*. The search should connect adjacent (8-way) orange (7) and red (2) pixels. The search must not cross any magenta (6) pixels (including the boundary lines themselves) and must stay within the current region's column range.\n4.  **Conditional Fill within Region:** For each connected component found *within a region*:\n    *   Check if the component contains at least one red (2) 'source' pixel.\n    *   If it does, change all orange (7) pixels belonging to *that specific component* to the magenta (6) fill color in the output grid.\n5.  **Combine Results:** Since the modifications are done directly on a copy of the input grid, the final grid will contain the results from all regions.\n\nThis region-based approach ensures that the fill operation respects the boundaries imposed by the vertical magenta lines, aligning with the observed behavior in the training examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe `tool_code` analysis confirmed the column indices containing magenta (6) pixels, which act as dividers.\n\n| Example | Grid Size | Magenta Columns | Deduced Regions (Column Indices, Inclusive) | Failure Cause                                                                 |\n| :------ | :-------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 14x14     | [4, 12]         | [(0, 3), (5, 11), (13, 13)]                 | Fill crossed region boundaries defined by columns 4 and 12.                   |\n| 2       | 16x13     | [4, 11]         | [(0, 3), (5, 10), (12, 12)]                 | Fill crossed region boundaries defined by columns 4 and 11.                   |\n| 3       | 8x9       | [2]             | [(0, 1), (3, 8)]                            | Fill crossed region boundary defined by column 2.                             |\n| 4       | 14x5      | [3]             | [(0, 2), (4, 4)]                            | Fill crossed region boundary defined by column 3.                             |\n| 5       | 8x20      | [0]             | [(1, 19)]                                   | Fill occurred correctly within the single large region (cols 1-19). *Initial code likely failed due to edge case handling or minor BFS error, but the region concept is valid.* |\n| 6       | 15x16     | [6]             | [(0, 5), (7, 15)]                           | Fill crossed region boundary defined by column 6.                             |\n\nThe consistent pattern is that the previous code allowed connected components (and thus the fill) to \"leak\" across the vertical magenta boundaries, treating the entire grid (minus magenta pixels) as a single operational space. The correct approach requires segmenting the grid based on these boundaries first.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the column indices containing vertical `region_boundary` lines (magenta, 6).\n3.  Define the vertical regions based on these boundary columns and the grid's left/right edges. A region is defined by a starting column index and an ending column index (inclusive).\n4.  Create a `visited` grid (same dimensions as input, initialized to `False`) to track pixels already processed across all regions.\n5.  Iterate through each defined vertical region (by column range `start_col` to `end_col`).\n6.  Within the current region, iterate through each pixel (`r`, `c`) where `start_col <= c <= end_col`.\n7.  If the pixel (`r`, `c`) is orange (7) or red (2) and has not been `visited`:\n    a.  Start a connected component search (e.g., BFS) from (`r`, `c`).\n    b.  Initialize an empty list `component_pixels` to store coordinates of pixels in this component.\n    c.  Initialize a flag `found_source` to `False`.\n    d.  Initialize a queue for the BFS, adding (`r`, `c`). Mark (`r`, `c`) as `visited`.\n    e.  While the queue is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a pixel `(curr_r, curr_c)`.\n        ii. Add `(curr_r, curr_c)` to `component_pixels`.\n        iii. If `input_grid[curr_r, curr_c]` is red (2), set `found_source = True`.\n        iv. Explore the 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(curr_r, curr_c)`.\n        v.  For each neighbor, check if it is:\n            *   Within the grid bounds.\n            *   Within the current region's column bounds (`start_col <= nc <= end_col`).\n            *   Not a magenta (6) pixel in the `input_grid`.\n            *   Is either orange (7) or red (2) in the `input_grid`.\n            *   Not already `visited`.\n        vi. If all conditions are met, mark `(nr, nc)` as `visited` and enqueue it.\n    f.  After the BFS for this component is complete, check the `found_source` flag.\n    g.  If `found_source` is `True`, iterate through all pixels `(comp_r, comp_c)` in `component_pixels`:\n        i.  If `input_grid[comp_r, comp_c]` was originally orange (7), change `output_grid[comp_r, comp_c]` to magenta (6).\n8.  Return the final `output_grid`."
