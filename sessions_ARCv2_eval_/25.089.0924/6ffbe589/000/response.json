The output grid is always a cropped version of the input grid, containing only the largest contiguous object found in the input.

Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous areas (objects) formed by connected non-white pixels (pixels with values 1 through 9). Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n    2.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) for each identified object.\n    3.  Determine which object has the largest size. If there's a tie, any of the largest objects can be chosen (though the examples don't show ties).\n    4.  Find the bounding box of this largest object: determine its minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index.\n    5.  Create a new grid whose dimensions are determined by the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of the bounding box.\n    6.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the range [min_row, max_row] and [min_col, max_col] into the new output grid, preserving their relative positions."
