            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from input to output based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Each input and output is a rectangular grid of pixels, with a dominant background color.\n2.  **Background**: The background color fills most of the grid and is different in each training example (orange(7), blue(1), magenta(6)). The background color remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Objects**: Scattered on the background are distinct objects made of contiguous pixels of a single color (different from the background).\n4.  **Object Shapes**: Two primary shapes of objects are observed:\n    *   A 3x3 plus sign ('+') shape, consisting of 9 pixels.\n    *   A 5x5 diamond shape (a central 3x3 square with single pixels extending from the middle of each side), consisting of 13 pixels.\n5.  **Transformation**: The transformation modifies or removes some objects based on their properties (shape and color), while leaving others and the background unchanged. Specifically:\n    *   Objects with the 5x5 diamond shape are always removed (pixels replaced by the background color).\n    *   Objects with the 3x3 '+' shape undergo different transformations based on their color, and in one case, the background color:\n        *   Some colors (maroon(9), magenta(6), green(3)) change to gray(5).\n        *   Some colors (orange(7)) are removed (replaced by background).\n        *   One color (white(0)) is removed only if the background is magenta(6); otherwise, it's unchanged.\n        *   Other colors (blue(1), yellow(4), azure(8), red(2)) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
