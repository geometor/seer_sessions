transformations:
  - rule: "Remove large objects"
    condition: "Object shape is 'diamond' (13 pixels)."
    action: "Replace all pixels of the object with the background_color."
  - rule: "Recolor specific small objects"
    condition: "Object shape is 'plus_sign' (9 pixels) AND color is maroon(9) OR magenta(6) OR green(3)."
    action: "Change the color of all pixels of the object to gray(5)."
  - rule: "Remove specific small objects"
    condition: "Object shape is 'plus_sign' (9 pixels) AND color is orange(7)."
    action: "Replace all pixels of the object with the background_color."
  - rule: "Conditionally remove white small objects"
    condition: "Object shape is 'plus_sign' (9 pixels) AND color is white(0) AND background_color is magenta(6)."
    action: "Replace all pixels of the object with the background_color."
  - rule: "Keep remaining small objects"
    condition: "Object shape is 'plus_sign' (9 pixels) AND color is blue(1) OR yellow(4) OR azure(8) OR red(2) OR (white(0) AND background_color is NOT magenta(6))."
