The patterns are arranged in a grid-like fashion, separated by horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (blue in example 1, green in example 2).\n2.  **Pattern Size:** The fundamental repeating unit appears to be a 7x7 block, including the surrounding separator lines. This is evident from the separator lines occurring every 7 rows and 7 columns (e.g., column indices 0, 7, 14,... and row indices 0, 7, 14,...).\n3.  **Input vs. Output Dimensions:**\n    *   Example 1: Input 19x19 -> Output 19x7\n    *   Example 2: Input 19x25 -> Output 19x7\n    The number of rows remains unchanged, while the number of columns is reduced to 7 in both outputs.\n4.  **Content Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids pixel by pixel, the output grid in both examples corresponds exactly to the first 7 columns (indices 0 through 6) of the respective input grid. The content beyond the 7th column in the input is discarded. The internal details of the patterns within the 7x7 blocks (the yellow shapes in example 1, the blue shapes in example 2) do not influence the transformation rule itself, which seems purely based on grid slicing.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
