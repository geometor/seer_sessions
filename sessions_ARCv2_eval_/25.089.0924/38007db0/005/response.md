"""
The transformation rule determines the value of each pixel in the output grid 
based on corresponding pixels in the input grid arranged in horizontal segments. 
The input grid is conceptually divided into horizontal blocks of 7 columns each. 
For an output pixel at (row r, column c_out), where 0 <= c_out < 7, 
we consider all input pixels at (r, c_out + 7*k) for k >= 0, as long as the 
column index is within the bounds of the input grid.

The value of the output pixel (r, c_out) is determined by the "minority vote" 
among the corresponding input pixel values:
1. Collect the values of all input pixels (r, c_out + 7*k) that exist.
2. Count the occurrences of each distinct value.
3. Find the minimum frequency (count) among these values.
4. Identify all values that occur with this minimum frequency.
5. If there is only one value with the minimum frequency (a unique minority), 
   that value becomes the output pixel value.
6. If there is a tie (multiple values share the minimum frequency), the output 
   pixel value is taken from the first corresponding input pixel 
   (i.e., Input(r, c_out)).
   
The output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid and exactly 7 columns.
