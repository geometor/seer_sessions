Identify all unique 7x7 block patterns within the band.\n2. Count the frequency of occurrence for each unique pattern.\n3. Find the minimum frequency among all patterns in the band.\n4. Identify all patterns that occur with this minimum frequency (the \"least frequent\" patterns).\n5. Select the pattern corresponding to the *first* (leftmost) block in the band that matches one of these least frequent patterns.\n6. Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the selected 7x7 blocks from each band. \nThe output will have the same number of rows as the input but only 7 columns.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_block(grid_np, r_start, c_start, height=7, width=7):\n    \"\"\"Extracts a block of specified size from a NumPy grid.\"\"\"\n    return grid_np[r_start:r_start + height, c_start:c_start + width]\n\ndef block_to_tuple(block_np):\n    \"\"\"Converts a NumPy block to a hashable tuple of tuples.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(map(tuple, block_np.tolist()))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by selecting the least frequent 7x7 block pattern \n    from each 7-row band and stacking them vertically.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n    \n    # We expect rows and columns to be divisible by 7 or handle edge cases appropriately.\n    # Based on examples, the structure involves blocks of 7x7 including boundaries.\n    block_size = 7 \n    \n    selected_blocks = []\n\n    # Iterate through the grid in horizontal bands of 7 rows\n    for r_start in range(0, rows, block_size):\n        band_patterns = {} # Store {pattern_tuple: [list_of_col_starts]}\n        block_list_ordered = [] # Store (col_start, pattern_tuple) pairs in order\n\n        # Iterate through the band to find all 7x7 blocks\n        for c_start in range(0, cols, block_size):\n            # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n            if r_start + block_size <= rows and c_start + block_size <= cols:\n                block = get_block(input_np, r_start, c_start, block_size, block_size)\n                pattern_tuple = block_to_tuple(block)\n                \n                # Store pattern and its column start index\n                if pattern_tuple not in band_patterns:\n                    band_patterns[pattern_tuple] = []\n                band_patterns[pattern_tuple].append(c_start)\n                \n                # Keep track of blocks in order for tie-breaking\n                block_list_ordered.append((c_start, pattern_tuple, block)) # Store the actual block array too\n\n        # If no blocks were found in the band (e.g., band too narrow), skip\n        if not block_list_ordered:\n            continue \n            \n        # Count frequencies\n        pattern_counts = Counter({pattern: len(cols_list) for pattern, cols_list in band_patterns.items()})\n        \n        # Find the minimum frequency\n        if not pattern_counts: # Handle empty bands if necessary\n             continue\n        min_freq = min(pattern_counts.values())\n        \n        # Identify least frequent patterns\n        least_frequent_patterns = {pattern for pattern, count in pattern_counts.items() if count == min_freq}\n        \n        # Select the first block (leftmost) matching a least frequent pattern\n        selected_block_for_band = None\n        for c_start, pattern_tuple, block_array in block_list_ordered:\n            if pattern_tuple in least_frequent_patterns:\n                selected_block_for_band = block_array\n                break # Found the leftmost least frequent block\n\n        # Add the selected block to our list for final stacking\n        if selected_block_for_band is not None:\n            selected_blocks.append(selected_block_for_band)\n        # else: handle cases where no block was selected, though this shouldn't happen with valid inputs\n\n    # Stack the selected blocks vertically to form the output grid\n    if not selected_blocks:\n        # Handle cases where no blocks were selected at all (e.g., input smaller than 7x7)\n        # Returning an empty grid or a specific error might be options.\n        # Based on ARC constraints, inputs are >= 1x1. \n        # If input < 7x7, the loops wouldn't run.
