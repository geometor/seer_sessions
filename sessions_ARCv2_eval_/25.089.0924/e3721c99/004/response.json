            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous template-matching approach failed significantly on both examples. The core issue appears to be the matching logic. Instead of identifying complete gray objects and comparing their shapes to reference objects, the template matching scanned the grid anchor by anchor, which led to incorrect matches or failures to match. Many gray shapes that should have been recolored were instead erased (turned white).\n\nThe strategy needs to revert to the initial concept of identifying distinct objects (both reference and target) and comparing their canonical forms (relative pixel arrangements). Gray objects whose forms match a reference object's form should be recolored; otherwise, they should be erased.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine the shapes in Example 1 using the object-finding approach to confirm the shape-matching hypothesis.\n\n"
