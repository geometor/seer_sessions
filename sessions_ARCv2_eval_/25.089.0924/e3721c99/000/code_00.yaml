Input:
  Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  Background: white (0).
  Reference_Area: Typically the upper part of the grid.
  Separator: A horizontal line of blue (1) pixels often present.
  Target_Color: gray (5).

Objects:
  - Type: Reference_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: yellow (4), green (3), blue (1), red (2) etc. (non-gray, non-white)
      - Location: Typically in the Reference_Area.
      - Form: A specific pattern/arrangement of pixels.
      - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color form a connected component.
  - Type: Target_Shape
    Properties:
      - Color: gray (5)
      - Location: Anywhere in the grid except potentially overlapping the exact pixels of a reference shape.
      - Form: A specific pattern/arrangement of pixels.
      - Contiguous: Pixels of the same color form a connected component.
  - Type: Separator_Line
    Properties:
      - Color: blue (1)
      - Form: Horizontal line.
  - Type: Background
    Properties:
      - Color: white (0)

Relationships:
  - Form_Matching: A Target_Shape's form can match a Reference_Shape's form. Form comparison ignores color and absolute position, focusing on the relative arrangement of pixels within the shape.

Actions:
  1. Identify_References: Find all Reference_Shapes in the input grid, noting their form and color.
  2. Identify_Targets: Find all Target_Shapes (contiguous gray areas) in the input grid, noting their form and location.
  3. Compare_Forms: For each Target_Shape, compare its form against the forms of all Reference_Shapes.
  4. Recolor_Matched_Targets: If a Target_Shape's form matches a Reference_Shape's form, replace the gray pixels of the Target_Shape with the color of the matching Reference_Shape in the output grid.
  5. Erase_Unmatched_Targets: If a Target_Shape's form does not match any Reference_Shape's form, replace the gray pixels of the Target_Shape with the background color (white, 0) in the output grid.
  6. Preserve_Others: Copy all non-gray pixels from the input grid to the output grid.

Output:
  Grid: A modified version of the input grid where gray shapes are either recolored based on matching reference shapes or erased.
