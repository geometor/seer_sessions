            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task presented in the examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are the same size (30x30 in the examples). The input grid generally seems divided into three conceptual parts:\n    *   An upper region containing several small, distinct, colored shapes (yellow, green, blue, red) on a white background. These appear to serve as \"reference patterns\" or \"keys\".\n    *   A single horizontal line made of blue pixels acting as a separator.\n    *   A lower region (or sometimes other regions, like the top-right in example 2) containing multiple shapes made of gray pixels, also on a white background. Some non-gray shapes might also exist outside the reference area.\n2.  **Reference Shapes:** The colored shapes in the upper region (e.g., yellow '4', green '3', blue '1', red '2' in example 1) have distinct forms and colors.\n3.  **Target Shapes:** The gray shapes are the primary targets for transformation. Their forms vary; some seem to visually match the reference shapes, while others do not.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens to the gray shapes.\n    *   Gray shapes in the input that *match* the form of one of the reference shapes are \"recolored\" in the output grid using the color of the matching reference shape.\n    *   Gray shapes in the input that *do not match* the form of any reference shape are effectively \"erased\" \u2013 replaced by the white background color in the output grid.\n5.  **Invariance:** The reference shapes themselves, the blue separator line, and any other non-gray, non-white pixels in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output grid. The transformation specifically targets only the gray pixels that form contiguous shapes.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each reference shape, store its unique form (relative pixel pattern) and its color.\n3.  Identify all \"target shapes\": Locate all distinct, contiguous shapes made of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
