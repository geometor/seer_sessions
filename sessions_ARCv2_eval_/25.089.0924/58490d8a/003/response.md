"""
Identify the largest connected region of white (0) pixels in the input grid. 
Determine the bounding box of this region. 
Create an output grid with the dimensions of this bounding box, initialized to white (0). 
Iterate through the input grid within the calculated bounding box. 
For each pixel within this box in the input grid, if its color is not white (0), copy its color to the corresponding relative position in the output grid.
The final output grid contains the non-white content found within the bounding box of the largest white region, preserving relative positions, on a white background.
