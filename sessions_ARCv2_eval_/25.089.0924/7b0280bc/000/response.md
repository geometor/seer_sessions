Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels, with varying dimensions across examples.
2.  **Background Color:** Each example seems to have a dominant background color (Azure=8 in Ex1, Maroon=9 in Ex2, Orange=7 in Ex3). This background color remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Foreground Objects:** There are distinct shapes or patterns made of other colors placed on the background.
4.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of some foreground pixels. Crucially, the specific color changes depend entirely on the background color of the grid.
    *   In Example 1 (Azure background), White (0) becomes Gray (5), and Red (2) becomes Green (3). Blue (1) remains unchanged.
    *   In Example 2 (Maroon background), Yellow (4) becomes Gray (5), and Orange (7) becomes Green (3). Magenta (6) remains unchanged.
    *   In Example 3 (Orange background), Blue (1) becomes Green (3), and Magenta (6) becomes Gray (5). Red (2) remains unchanged.
5.  **Consistency:** Within each example, the same color transformation rule is applied consistently to all pixels of that color. The position of the pixels doesn't seem to affect the transformation rule itself, only the color value matters.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml

  - type: Contiguous areas of non-background color.
  - properties: Color.

    substitutions:

        output_color: 3 (Green)
      - input_color: 6 (Magenta)
        output_color: 5 (Gray)
      - input_color: 2 (Red) # Unchanged
        output_color: 2 (Red)
      - input_color: 7 (Orange) # Background
        output_color: 7 (Orange)
relationship: The color substitution applied to each pixel depends on both its own color and the identified background color of the entire grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to determine the background color. This is the color that appears most frequently.
2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel position (row, column) in the input grid.
4.  Retrieve the color of the pixel at the current position in the input grid.
5.  Based on the determined background color, apply the corresponding color substitution rule:
    *   If the background color is Azure (8):
        *   If the current pixel color is White (0), set the output pixel at the same position to Gray (5).
        *   If the current pixel color is Red (2), set the output pixel to Green (3).
        *   Otherwise (if the pixel is Blue (1) or the background Azure (8)), copy the input pixel color to the output pixel.
    *   If the background color is Maroon (9):
        *   If the current pixel color is Yellow (4), set the output pixel to Gray (5).
        *   If the current pixel color is Orange (7), set the output pixel to Green (3).
        *   Otherwise (if the pixel is Magenta (6) or the background Maroon (9)), copy the input pixel color to the output pixel.
    *   If the background color is Orange (7):
        *   If the current pixel color is Blue (1), set the output pixel to Green (3).
        *   If the current pixel color is Magenta (6), set the output pixel to Gray (5).
        *   Otherwise (if the pixel is Red (2) or the background Orange (7)), copy the input pixel color to the output pixel.
6.  After processing all pixels, return the completed output grid.
