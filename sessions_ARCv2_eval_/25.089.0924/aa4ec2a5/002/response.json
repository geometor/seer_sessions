            "text": "Okay, the initial code failed to replicate the transformations correctly, indicating the rules derived from the first example were incomplete or slightly inaccurate. The primary discrepancies involve the placement of red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6) pixels, and importantly, the unexpected change of some blue (1) pixels to azure (8) in the output.\n\n**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core concept of coloring the yellow (4) background based on adjacency to blue (1) pixels seems sound, but the conditions, priorities, and the newly discovered rule about blue pixels changing color need refinement.\n\nThe errors suggest:\n1.  The conditions for assigning red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6) might be subtly different or interact in ways not initially captured.\n2.  A crucial rule was missed: some blue (1) pixels are transformed into azure (8) pixels based on their local context, specifically their proximity to areas that become azure (8).\n\nStrategy:\n1.  Re-analyze the adjacency rules for yellow pixels, paying close attention to the exact conditions (number of neighbors, type of adjacency) leading to red, magenta, and azure in the expected outputs across all examples.\n2.  Formulate a specific rule for when blue pixels change to azure. The hypothesis is that this happens when a blue pixel is adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a yellow pixel that *becomes* azure based on the diagonal-only adjacency rule.\n3.  Adopt a two-stage transformation process:\n    *   Stage 1: Determine the colors (red, magenta, azure, or yellow) for all initially yellow pixels based on their adjacency to the *original* blue pixels.\n    *   Stage 2: Determine the final color for all initially blue pixels. If any neighbor (in the stage 1 calculated grid) is azure, the blue pixel becomes azure; otherwise, it remains blue.\n4.  Verify this two-stage process against all training examples.\n5.  Use `tool_code` to quantify color distributions in inputs and outputs to confirm patterns.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
