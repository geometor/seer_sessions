This is the reflection of `[3, 6]` and `[3, 7]` across the red pixel at `[4, 5]`. Code failed to reflect these.\n    *   `[5, 16]`, `[5, 17]`: Expected yellow (4), got background (1). Reflection of `[5, 12]`, `[5, 11]` across red at `[5, 14]`. Code failed.\n    *   `[6, 6]`: Expected green (3), got background (1). Reflection of `[2, 6]` across red at `[4, 5]`. Code failed.\n    *   `[6, 16]`, `[7, 16]`, `[8, 16]`: Expected yellow (4), got background (1). Reflection of `[6, 12]`, `[7, 13]`, `[8, 13]` across red at `[6, 14]`, `[7, 14]`, `[8, 14]`. Code *partially* worked but missed these. Ah, wait, my previous manual check was slightly off. Let me re-examine expected vs transformed directly for Ex1:\n        *   Expected `[5,6]=3, [5,7]=3`. Transformed `[5,6]=1, [5,7]=1`. Missing reflection of `(3,6)` and `(3,7)` across `(4,5)`.\n        *   Expected `[6,6]=3`. Transformed `[6,6]=1`. Missing reflection of `(2,6)` across `(4,5)`.\n        *   Expected `[5,16]=4, [5,17]=4`. Transformed `[5,16]=1, [5,17]=1`. Missing reflection of `(5,12)` and `(5,11)` across `(5,14)`.\n        *   Expected `[6,16]=4, [6,17]=4`. Transformed `[6,16]=4, [6,17]=1`. Missing reflection of `(6,12)` across `(6,14)`.\n        *   Expected `[9,4]=5`. Transformed `[9,4]=1`. Missing reflection of `(13,4)` across `(11,6)`.\n        *   Expected `[10,5]=5, [10,6]=5`. Transformed `[10,5]=1, [10,6]=1`. Missing reflection of `(12,5)` and `(12,6)` across `(11,6)`.\n        *   Expected `[16,11]=8, [16,12]=8, [16,15]=8, [16,16]=8`. Transformed `[16,11]=8, [16,12]=8, [16,15]=8, [16,16]=8`. Ah, the code DID get these reflections across the horizontal line! My initial check was wrong.\n        *   Expected `[17,13]=8`. Transformed `[17,13]=1`. Missing reflection of `(13,13)` across the horizontal red line at row 15.\n        *   Expected `[17,14]=8`. Transformed `[17,14]=1`. Missing reflection of `(13,14)` across the horizontal red line at row 15.\n        *   Code Output Diff Coords: `[[5, 6], [5, 7], [5, 16], [5, 17], [6, 6], [6, 16], [9, 4], [10, 5], [10, 6], [17, 13]]`. My manual check identified `[17,14]` as missing, but the tool didn't. Let's re-re-check. Input `(13,14)` is 8. Red line is row 15. Reflection is `(15 + (15 - 13), 14) = (17, 14)`. Expected Output `(17,14)` is 8. Transformed Output `(17,14)` is 1. Yes, `(17,14)` should be in the diff list. Why wasn't it? Maybe the tool output was truncated or I misread it? Let's assume 11 diffs for now.\n        *   **Conclusion Ex1:** The code fails to reflect pixels across single red pixels (acting as vertical mirrors) and misses *some* pixels when reflecting across horizontal red lines.\n\n*   **Example 2:** 6 pixels are wrong.\n    *   `[3, 1]`, `[3, 2]`: Expected yellow (4), got background (8). Reflection of `(3, 7)` and `(3, 6)` across the vertical red line segment at `(3, 4)`.\n    *   `[3, 15]`: Expected blue (1), got background (8). Reflection of `(3, 11)` across red pixel at `(3, 13)`.\n    *   `[4, 1]`: Expected yellow (4), got background (8). Reflection of `(4, 7)` across red pixel at `(4, 4)`.\n    *   `[5, 1]`, `[5, 2]`: Expected yellow (4), got background (8). Reflection of `(5, 7)` and `(5, 6)` across red pixel at `(5, 4)`.\n    *   **Conclusion Ex2:** The code fails to reflect pixels across vertical red lines/pixels correctly. It seems to only reflect the *immediately adjacent* pixel, not the whole object based on adjacency. The reflection across the horizontal line worked correctly this time.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:** The core issue is that the reflection logic is triggered *per pixel* based on its *immediate* red neighbor, rather than identifying the object, the adjacent red structure, and reflecting the *entire* object based on the *red structure's* properties (orientation and position).\n\n**Refined Strategy v2:**\n\n1.  Copy input to output.\n2.  Find background color.\n3.  Find all *contiguous* red objects. For each, determine its bounding box and classify its orientation (Horizontal line, Vertical line, Point).\n4.  Find all *contiguous* non-red, non-background objects. For each, get its set of pixel coordinates and color.\n5.  Iterate through each non-red/background object:\n    a.  Check if any pixel of this object is cardinally adjacent to any pixel of *any* red object.\n    b.  If adjacent, identify the *specific red object* it's adjacent to.\n    c.  Determine the reflection type based on the red object's classification:\n        *   Horizontal line: Vertical reflection across the line's row.\n        *   Vertical line or Point: Horizontal reflection across the line's/point's column.\n    d.  For *every pixel* `(r, c)` belonging to the non-red/background object:\n        i.  Calculate the reflected coordinate `(rr, rc)` based on the determined reflection type and the red object's axis (row or column). Use the *nearest* point on the red object to calculate the reflection if necessary, or perhaps the average row/column? No, the examples suggest reflection across the specific adjacent red line/pixel's axis. Let's stick with the original reflection calculation based on the *adjacent red pixel's coordinate* `(nr, nc)`: Vert: `(nr + (nr-r), c)`; Horiz: `(r, nc + (nc-c))`. *BUT* the classification (Horizontal/Vertical/Point) comes from the *whole* red object the neighbor `(nr, nc)` belongs to.\n        ii. Check bounds for `(rr, rc)`.\n        iii. If in bounds and `output[rr, rc]` is background color, set `output[rr, rc]` to the object's color.\n6.  Return output.\n\nThis seems more robust. It considers the whole red structure for orientation and reflects the whole adjacent object.## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept of reflection based on adjacent red (2) pixels. However, it failed because the reflection logic was too localized. It considered each non-red/non-background pixel individually and reflected it based only on its immediately adjacent red neighbor, without considering the overall shape/orientation of the red structure or the full extent of the object being reflected.\n\nThe errors observed in both examples confirm this:\n1.  Reflections were often incomplete, missing parts of the object that were not directly adjacent to the red pixel used for the reflection calculation.\n2.  The determination of reflection axis (horizontal vs. vertical) based solely on the *local* horizontal neighbors of the *adjacent* red pixel was flawed. Example 1 showed single red pixels causing horizontal reflection, and horizontal lines causing vertical reflection. Example 2 showed vertical lines causing horizontal reflection.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Identify Structures:** Implement logic to identify *entire* contiguous objects, both the red \"mirror\" objects and the objects to be reflected (non-red, non-background). Standard algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to find connected components of the same color.\n2.  **Classify Red Structures:** For each identified red object, determine its primary orientation:\n    *   **Horizontal Line:** If its height is 1 and width > 1.\n    *   **Vertical Line:** If its width is 1 and height > 1.\n    *   **Point:** If its height is 1 and width is 1.\n3.  **Determine Adjacency:** For each non-red/non-background object, check if *any* of its constituent pixels are cardinally adjacent to *any* pixel of a red object.\n4.  **Apply Reflection Rule:** If an object is adjacent to a red structure:\n    *   Determine the reflection type based on the red structure's classification: Vertical reflection for Horizontal Lines, Horizontal reflection for Vertical Lines and Points.\n    *   Determine the reflection axis: Use the row of the horizontal red line for vertical reflection, or the column of the vertical red line/point for horizontal reflection. If a red structure spans multiple rows/columns (e.g., a thick line), the specific adjacent red pixel's coordinate might still be the correct reference point for the axis calculation (`nr` or `nc`).\n    *   Reflect *all* pixels of the adjacent object across this axis.\n    *   Update the output grid only where the target pixel is the background color.\n\nThis object-based approach should handle the cases where parts of an object are further from the mirror and ensure the correct reflection orientation is applied based on the entire mirror structure.\n\n## Metrics\n\nUsing the detailed error analysis from the `thought` block:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 18x18\n*   Background Color: White (1)\n*   Red Structures:\n    *   Point at (4, 5)\n    *   Vertical Line/Points at (5, 14), (6, 14), (7, 14), (8, 14)\n    *   Point at (11, 6)\n    *   Horizontal Line at row 15, cols 11-15\n*   Reflected Objects & Expected Reflections:\n    *   Green L (pixels: (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)) adjacent to red (4,5) -> Reflected horizontally across col 5. Expected additions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,7) should be Green(3).\n    *   Yellow Square (pixels: (5,11),(5,12),(6,11),(6,12)) adjacent to red line (5:8, 14) -> Reflected horizontally across col 14. Expected additions: (5,17),(5,16),(6,17),(6,16) should be Yellow(4).\n    *   Gray S (pixels: (11,7),(12,6),(12,7),(13,6)) adjacent to red (11,6) -> Reflected horizontally across col 6. Expected additions: (11,5),(12,5),(12,4),(13,5) should be Gray(5). *Correction*: Input gray object is at (11,7), (12,7), (12,8), (13,8). Adjacent to red (11,6). Expected reflection: (11,5), (12,5), (12,4), (13,4) should be Gray(5). Let's re-recheck input/output... Input gray object is at (11,7) pixel 5, (12,6) pixel 5, (12,7) pixel 5, (13,8) pixel 5. Red pixel at (11,6). Reflection across col 6: (11,5), (12,5), (12,5 - wait, duplicate), (13,4). Let's use the provided output: (9,4)=5, (10,5)=5, (10,6)=5. This implies the object at (11,7),(12,7),(12,8),(13,8) is reflected across (11,6) to (11,5),(12,5),(12,4),(13,4). No, this still doesn't match the expected output at rows 9,10. Let me trace again: Input pixels adjacent to red(11,6) are (11,7)=5, (12,6)=5, (12,7)=5. Reflecting across col 6: (11,7)->(11,5), (12,6)->(12,6) NO REFLECTION, (12,7)->(12,5). This is still wrong. What *is* the gray object in the input? (11,7)=5, (12,6)=5, (12,7)=5, (13,8)=5. Okay. What gray pixels appear in the output? (9,4)=5, (10,5)=5, (10,6)=5, (11,7)=5, (12,6)=5, (12,7)=5, (13,8)=5. It looks like the object at (11,7), (12,6), (12,7) was reflected across the red pixel at (11,6) to create pixels at (11,5), (12,6 - no change?), (12,5)? This whole gray section is confusing and doesn't fit the simple reflection model well. Let's focus on the clearer examples first. Maybe the gray part is more complex or I'm misinterpreting the shape/adjacency.\n    *   Azure L (pixels: (13,14),(14,11),(14,12),(14,13),(14,14)) adjacent to red line (row 15) -> Reflected vertically across row 15. Expected additions: (17,14),(16,11),(16,12),(16,13),(16,14) should be Azure(8).\n*   Errors in Previous Code (11 diffs based on visual re-check): Failed horizontal reflections across points/vertical lines (Green L, Yellow square). Failed vertical reflection for some pixels across horizontal line (part of Azure L). The Gray S reflection is anomalous or my interpretation is wrong.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 18x18\n*   Background Color: Azure (8)\n*   Red Structures:\n    *   Vertical Line at col 4, rows 3-6\n    *   Vertical Line/Point at col 13, rows 3-4\n    *   Horizontal Line at row 11, cols 8-11\n*   Reflected Objects & Expected Reflections:\n    *   Yellow C (pixels: (3,5-7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5-7), (6,5)) adjacent to red line (col 4) -> Reflected horizontally across col 4. Expected additions: (3,3-1), (4,3), (4,1), (5,3-1), (6,3) should be Yellow(4).\n    *   Blue L (pixels: (3,11),(3,12),(4,12)) adjacent to red line (col 13) -> Reflected horizontally across col 13. Expected additions: (3,15),(3,14),(4,14) should be Blue(1).\n    *   Green T (pixels: (8,10), (9,9-11), (10,10)) adjacent to red line (row 11) -> Reflected vertically across row 11. Expected additions: (14,10),(13,9-11),(12,10) should be Green(3).\n*   Errors in Previous Code (6 diffs): Failed horizontal reflections across vertical line for parts of the Yellow C object. Failed horizontal reflection for part of Blue L object across point/vertical line. Vertical reflection (Green T) worked correctly.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
