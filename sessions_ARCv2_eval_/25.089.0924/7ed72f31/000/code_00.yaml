Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 18x18 (for both examples)
  - Background Color:
      - Example 1: White (1) - most frequent color, not red.
      - Example 2: Azure (8) - most frequent color, not red.

Objects:
  - Type: Red Elements
    - Color: Red (2)
    - Shapes Observed:
        - Single Pixel (Point)
        - Horizontal Line (contiguous red pixels in a row)
        - Vertical Line (contiguous red pixels in a column)
    - Role: Act as reflection axes/points ("mirrors"). Persist in output.
  - Type: Mirrored Objects
    - Color: Any color except Red (2) and the determined Background Color.
    - Property: Must be adjacent (sharing an edge) to a Red Element.
    - Role: These objects are copied and reflected. Persist in output.
  - Type: Background
    - Color: White (1) or Azure (8) in examples.
    - Role: Fills empty space. Can be overwritten by reflected object copies.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Mirrored Objects are located directly next to (sharing an edge with) Red Elements.
  - Symmetry Trigger: The presence of a Red Element adjacent to a Mirrored Object triggers a reflection.

Actions:
  - Identification: Locate Red Elements and potential Mirrored Objects. Determine Background Color.
  - Reflection:
    - Type: Geometric Mirroring.
    - Axis Determination:
        - Horizontal Red Line: Reflect vertically across the line's row.
        - Vertical Red Line or Single Red Pixel: Reflect horizontally across the line's/pixel's column.
    - Process: For each pixel of a Mirrored Object adjacent to a Red Element, calculate its reflected position based on the Red Element's type and location.
  - Copying: The reflection process creates a copy of the Mirrored Object's pixels.
  - Addition: The reflected pixels are added to the output grid, typically overwriting only Background Color pixels at the target location. Original input pixels are preserved.
