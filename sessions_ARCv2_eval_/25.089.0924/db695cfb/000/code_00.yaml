task_context:
  description: Adds blue pixels (1) along diagonal paths based on the positions of existing blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels.
  background_color: Varies (gray=5, azure=8, yellow=4), remains unchanged.
  input_objects:
    - object_type: pixel
      color: blue (1)
      role: source / start_point
    - object_type: pixel
      color: magenta (6)
      role: target / attractor (if present)
  output_objects:
    - object_type: pixel
      color: blue (1)
      role: original_source
    - object_type: pixel
      color: magenta (6)
      role: original_target
    - object_type: pixel
      color: blue (1)
      role: path_segment / trail
  transformation_rules:
    - condition: Magenta pixels exist.
      action: For each blue pixel, draw a diagonal path of blue pixels towards the *nearest* magenta pixel (Manhattan distance). The path stops one step before reaching the target magenta pixel's row or column.
    - condition: No magenta pixels exist, and exactly two blue pixels exist.
      action: Draw a diagonal path of blue pixels connecting the two existing blue pixels. The path fills the cells *between* the two source blue pixels.
    - condition: No magenta pixels exist, and the number of blue pixels is not equal to two.
      action: No change to the grid (implied).
  properties:
    - Path direction is always diagonal (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
    - Original pixels (blue and magenta) are preserved in the output.
    - Path generation depends on relative positions and distances.
