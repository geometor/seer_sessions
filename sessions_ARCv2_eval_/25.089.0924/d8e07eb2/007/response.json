Identify all 'ShapePixels' which are pixels whose color is neither gray (8) nor magenta (6).\n    2. Find all gray (8) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to any ShapePixel.\n    3. Only consider adjacent gray pixels that are located *above* the second magenta line (row index < height - 3).\n    4. Change these identified adjacent gray pixels to green (3) in the output grid.\n    5. Keep track if any of the pixels changed to green in step 4 are located within the top 5 rows (rows 0-4).\n    6. If any changes occurred in the top 5 rows, change all pixels in the bottom two rows (rows height-2 and height-1) to green (3).\n    7. Otherwise (if no changes occurred in the top 5 rows), change all pixels in the bottom two rows to red (2).\n    8.
