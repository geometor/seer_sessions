            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code timed out, indicating an inefficiency likely related to iterating through every gray pixel and checking its neighbors. The core logic observed from the first example\u2014changing gray pixels adjacent to specific colored shapes and setting the bottom rows based on changes in the top section\u2014appears largely correct based on visual inspection of the other examples.\n\nThe strategy is to reverse the primary loop: instead of checking neighbors for every *gray* pixel, we will iterate through every *non-gray, non-magenta* pixel and identify its adjacent *gray* neighbors. This significantly reduces the number of neighbor checks, as the number of \"active\" colored pixels is much smaller than the number of background gray pixels. We will maintain the logic for determining the color of the bottom two rows based on whether any changes occurred in the top section (rows 0-4).\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather metrics for this specific issue, as the problem was a timeout (inefficiency) rather than incorrect output for the provided examples. The core observation is that the number of non-gray, non-magenta pixels is significantly smaller than the number of gray pixels in all examples, making the proposed optimization viable.\n\n*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** Consistently 30x22 across all examples.\n*   **Key Colors:** Gray (8) background, Magenta (6) separators (rows 5, 27), various colors for shapes.\n*   **Target Colors:** Green (3) for adjacent grays, Green (3) or Red (2) for bottom rows.\n*   **Conditionality:** Bottom rows (28, 29) are Green (3) if any gray pixel in rows 0-4 was changed to Green (3); otherwise, they become Red (2).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
