Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

The task involves transforming input grids based on complex conditional rules. The transformation applied seems to depend entirely on the specific colors present in the input grid and potentially their arrangement or frequency. I observe several distinct transformation patterns across the examples:

1.  **Structure-based transformation (Example 4):** A vertical line of a specific color (Red) acts as a boundary and trigger. The line itself changes color, and the area to one side of the line is filled with a specific color, erasing previous content in that area.
2.  **Conditional transformations based on Azure (Examples 1, 2, 3):** The presence of Azure (8) seems to activate different sets of rules, potentially determined by which *other* color is most frequent.
    *   When Azure is present and Blue (1) is the most frequent other color (Example 1), the largest Blue object is transformed (Blue -> Red), and everything else is erased.
    *   When Azure is present and Magenta (6) is the most frequent other color (Example 2), color pairs swap (Magenta <-> Orange, Red <-> Yellow), Azure is removed, and a peculiar row-duplication effect occurs for the Magenta/Orange swaps (pixels in the row below corresponding white space also change color).
    *   When Azure is present and Yellow (4) is the most frequent other color (Example 3), specific transformations occur (Yellow -> Red, Blue -> Orange), and Azure and some original colors (Red, Orange) are removed.
3.  **Color Removal:** Azure (8) is frequently removed or overwritten, except when participating in the area fill in Example 4. Other colors are also removed depending on the active rule set (e.g., non-largest objects in Example 1, original Red/Orange in Example 3).

The core challenge lies in identifying the correct condition (Red line? Azure present? Which color is most frequent alongside Azure?) and then applying the corresponding, unique transformation rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid or an empty grid of the same dimensions, depending on the rule applied.
2.  **Check for a Vertical Red Line:** Examine the input grid to see if there is a contiguous vertical line composed solely of Red (2) pixels spanning the grid's height.
    *   If such a line exists in column `c`:
        a.  Change all pixels in the input grid at column `c` that were Red (2) to Blue (1) in the output grid.
        b.  Change all pixels in the output grid `(r, col)` where `col < c` to Red (2).
        c.  Change all pixels in the output grid `(r, col)` where `col >= c` and the original input pixel was *not* part of the Red line at `(r, c)` to white (0).
        d.  The transformation is complete. Proceed no further.
3.  **Check for Azure:** If no vertical Red line was found, check if Azure (8) exists anywhere in the input grid.
    *   If Azure (8) exists:
        a.  Count the frequency of all non-white (0) and non-azure (8) colors in the input grid.
        b.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (Most Frequent Color - MFC). Handle ties if necessary (though none observed in examples).
        c.  **If MFC is Blue (1):**
            i.  Find all contiguous objects composed of Blue (1) pixels.
            ii. Identify the largest Blue object (by pixel count).
            iii. Create a new output grid filled entirely with white (0).
            iv. For each pixel belonging to the largest Blue object identified in step ii, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Red (2).
            v. The transformation is complete.
        d.  **If MFC is Magenta (6):**
            i.  Create an intermediate grid by applying the following transformations to the input: Magenta(6)->Orange(7), Orange(7)->Magenta(6), Red(2)->Yellow(4), Yellow(4)->Red(2). All Azure(8) become white(0). Other colors become white(0).
            ii. Initialize the final output grid as a copy of this intermediate grid.
            iii. Iterate through the *original input* grid's pixels `(r, c)` from top-left (row by row, column by column).
            iv. If input `(r, c)` is Magenta(6) AND `r+1` is within the grid bounds AND input `(r+1, c)` is white(0), set the *final output* grid pixel `(r+1, c)` to Orange(7).
            v. If input `(r, c)` is Orange(7) AND `r+1` is within the grid bounds AND input `(r+1, c)` is white(0), set the *final output* grid pixel `(r+1, c)` to Magenta(6).
            vi. The transformation is complete.
        e.  **If MFC is Yellow (4):**
            i.  Initialize the output grid filled entirely with white (0).
            ii. Iterate through the input grid's pixels `(r, c)`.
            iii. If input `(r, c)` is Yellow(4), set output `(r, c)` to Red(2).
            iv. If input `(r, c)` is Blue(1), set output `(r, c)` to Orange(7).
            v. (Azure, original Red, original Orange implicitly remain white).
            vi. The transformation is complete.
4.  **Default Case:** If no vertical Red line was found AND Azure (8) was not present in the input grid, apply a default transformation (currently undefined based on examples - perhaps return the input unchanged).
