These serve as \"template\" shapes.\n    *   The lower section contains numerous gray shapes (color 5) scattered on a white background.\n    *   The horizontal blue line and the template shapes from the upper section are preserved identically in the output grid.\n    *   The transformation happens in the lower section: the gray shapes are recolored based on the templates from the upper section.\n    *   There are two primary rules for recoloring a gray shape:\n        1.  **Exact Match:** If a gray shape below the line has the exact same shape and size as one of the template shapes above the line (ignoring color and position), it is recolored with the specific color of that matching template shape.\n        2.  **No Exact Match:** If a gray shape does not exactly match any template shape, its recoloring depends on its geometric properties (specifically convexity) and the order of the templates above the line.\n            *   The templates above the line are considered in order, likely based on their horizontal position (left-to-right). Let's call them Template 1, Template 2, etc.\n            *   If the non-matching gray shape is convex, it takes the color of the *second* template (Template 2).\n            *   If the non-matching gray shape is *not* convex, it takes the color of the *first* template (Template 1).\n    *   All other pixels (white background, the blue line itself) remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
