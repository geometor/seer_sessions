"""
Transforms an input grid by filling enclosed regions of the background color (azure 8) with red (2). 
The process identifies background pixels connected to the grid's border using a flood fill (BFS) 
and then changes any background pixels not reached by this fill to the designated fill color. 
Other pixels (boundary colors, exterior background) remain unchanged.
