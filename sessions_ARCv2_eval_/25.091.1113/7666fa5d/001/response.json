It performs a flood fill starting from all background-colored pixels on the grid's border. This marks all background pixels connected to the outside.\n3. It iterates through the grid. Any background pixel that was *not* reached by the flood fill (i.e., is enclosed by non-background pixels) is changed to red (2).\n4.
