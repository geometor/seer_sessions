It identifies the background color (azure 8).\n2. It iterates through each pixel of the grid.\n3. If a background pixel hasn't been visited yet, it initiates a flood fill (BFS) starting from that pixel.\n4. During the flood fill, it collects all connected background pixels belonging to the same region and checks if any pixel in this region touches the grid's border.\n5. If the flood fill completes and the region did *not* touch the border, all pixels identified in that region are colored red (2) in the output grid.\n6. All pixels visited during any flood fill are marked to avoid redundant checks.\n7. Non-background pixels and background pixels belonging to regions connected to the border remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills enclosed regions of the background color with red (2).\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a numpy array\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Define background and fill colors\n    background_color = 8\n    fill_color = 2\n    \n    # Create a boolean grid to mark visited pixels during any flood fill\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel in the grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Start a flood fill only if the pixel is background and hasn't been visited\n            if grid[r, c] == background_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                \n                # Store pixels of the current region being explored\n                current_region_pixels = []\n                # Flag to track if this region touches the border\n                reached_border = False\n                # Queue for BFS\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                \n                # Mark the starting pixel as visited and add to the region list\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                current_region_pixels.append((r, c))\n\n                # Perform BFS for the current connected background region\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n\n                    # Check if the current pixel is on the border\n                    if curr_r == 0 or curr_r == rows - 1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == cols - 1:\n                        reached_border = True # No need to break, continue exploring to mark all connected as visited\n\n                    # Explore 4-way neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n\n                        # Check if neighbor is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            # Check if neighbor is background color and not yet visited\n                            if grid[nr, nc] == background_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                current_region_pixels.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # After exploring the entire connected region:\n                # If the region did not reach the border, fill it with the fill_color\n                if not reached_border:\n                    for pr, pc in current_region_pixels:\n                        output_grid[pr, pc] = fill_color\n                        \n    return output_grid\n```"
