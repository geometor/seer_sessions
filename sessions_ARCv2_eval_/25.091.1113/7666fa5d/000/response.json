Example 1 uses yellow (4) for foreground elements, and Example 2 uses green (3). The output introduces red (2) as a new color while preserving the original colors.\n3.  **Background Preservation:** The azure (8) pixels that are part of the exterior background remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Foreground Preservation:** The non-background pixels present in the input (yellow 4 in example 1, green 3 in example 2) are preserved in their original locations in the output. These pixels seem to form closed loops or boundaries.\n5.  **Filling:** The key transformation is the addition of red (2) pixels. These red pixels appear to fill the areas *enclosed* by the loops formed by the non-background pixels (yellow or green).\n6.  **Interior Definition:** The \"inside\" of the loop seems to be defined relative to the grid; areas connected to the grid boundary via the background color are considered \"outside\". Any background-colored regions completely surrounded by the non-background color loop are \"inside\".\n7.  **Consistency:** The fill color is always red (2), regardless of the color forming the boundary (yellow or green).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
