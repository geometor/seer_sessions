            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The background color is consistently azure (8).\n2.  **Key Colors/Objects:**\n    *   **Azure (8):** Background color. Fills most of the grid initially and replaces elements in the output.\n    *   **Blue (1):** Forms distinct shapes or objects within the grid. These shapes vary in form and number across examples.\n    *   **Green (3):** Appears as small pixels, often adjacent to or within the blue shapes. They seem to indicate specific points related to the blue shapes.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** A single yellow pixel appears in each input, always above a vertical line of red pixels.\n    *   **Red (2):** Appears as a short vertical line of pixels directly below the single yellow pixel in the input. In the output, red is the primary color used to fill shapes.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The location of the yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the input seems crucial. They define a specific column.\n    *   Blue shapes (1) in the input grid that are intersected by this specific column are \"activated\".\n    *   In the output grid, the activated blue shapes (including all contiguous parts of those shapes, even those outside the activation column) are filled with red (2).\n    *   However, any input green pixels (3) that were part of or immediately adjacent to the activated blue shapes seem to create \"holes\" in the output red shapes \u2013 these locations remain the background color (azure 8).\n    *   All original input elements (blue shapes that weren't activated, green pixels not associated with activated shapes, the yellow pixel, the original red pixels) are replaced by the background color (azure 8) in the output grid, unless they are part of the newly created red shapes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all green (3) pixels from the input grid that are adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel coordinate belonging to this blue object.
