            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples. The primary reasons appear to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function only considered orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) when identifying contiguous blue shapes. ARC tasks frequently use diagonal adjacency as well. This leads to blue shapes being fragmented or missed entirely.\n2.  **Incomplete Activation/Filling:** Because the blue objects were not correctly identified, the activation check (intersection with the activation column) and subsequent filling were incomplete or incorrect. Example 1 likely failed because the relevant blue object wasn't found *at all* due to the connectivity issue. The other examples show partial filling, consistent with finding only parts of the intended shapes.\n3.  **Potential Hole Misassociation:** If blue objects are fragmented, green pixels might not be correctly associated as holes for the intended complete shape.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `find_objects` function to use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) to correctly identify the full extent of blue objects.\n2.  Re-evaluate the hole identification logic (`get_adjacent_coords` and its use) to ensure it correctly identifies green pixels adjacent (including diagonally) to the *complete* activated blue objects.\n3.  Re-test the refined logic against all training examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 again with diagonal connectivity in mind.\n\n**Example 1 Input Analysis:**\n"

However, *none* of the pixels in that object are in column 8 (the activation column). Therefore, according to the current rule (\"blue objects intersected by the activation column\"), *no* object should be activated, and the output should be all azure (8).\n\nWhy does the expected output for Example 1 show red pixels in column 8? Let's re-examine the relationship between the yellow/red activation column and the blue shapes.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The blue shape is far from the activation column. Output has red pixels *only* in the activation column, extending vertically.\n*   **Example 2:** Blue shapes exist. Two are intersected by the activation column (col 10). The output fills these two shapes with red, respecting green holes. Another blue shape (top right) is *not* intersected and is ignored.\n*   **Example 3:** Blue shapes exist. Two are intersected by the activation column (col 16). The output fills these two shapes with red, respecting green holes. Another blue shape (bottom left) is *not* intersected and is ignored.\n*   **Example 4:** Blue shapes exist. One is intersected by the activation column (col 5). The output fills this shape with red, respecting green holes. Another blue shape (bottom right) is *not* intersected and is ignored.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors based on whether *any* blue shape intersects the activation column:\n\n1.  **Intersection Case (Examples 2, 3, 4):** If one or more blue (1) shapes intersect the activation column (defined by yellow 4 / red 2), then *only those intersected shapes* are filled with red (2) in the output, respecting green (3) pixels as holes (adjacent or within the blue shape become azure 8). All other input elements become azure (8).\n2.  **No Intersection Case (Example 1):** If *no* blue (1) shape intersects the activation column, the output grid is formed by drawing a vertical red (2) line in the activation column, spanning the full height of the grid. All other cells are azure (8).\n\nThis revised hypothesis explains all training examples. The key is the conditional behavior based on intersection.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
