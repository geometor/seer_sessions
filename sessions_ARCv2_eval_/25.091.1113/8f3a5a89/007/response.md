Transformation Rule:

1. Find the single magenta pixel (color 6) which serves as the starting point.
2. Identify all pixels reachable from the start point via a flood fill. The fill can move horizontally and vertically through gray (8) and the initial magenta (6) pixels, but is blocked by blue (1) pixels and grid boundaries. Store the coordinates of all reachable pixels.
3. Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
4. Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
5. If a pixel is gray (color 8) AND it is within the set of reachable pixels identified in step 2:
    a. Check if this gray pixel is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any "boundary". A boundary is defined as:
        i. The edge of the grid.
        ii. A blue pixel (color 1).
        iii. A pixel whose coordinates are NOT in the set of reachable pixels.
        iv. The original magenta start pixel (color 6).
    b. If the gray pixel is adjacent to any boundary according to condition 5a, change its color to orange (7) in the output grid.
6. All other pixels (blue, magenta, unreachable gray pixels, and reachable gray pixels not adjacent to a boundary) retain their original color in the output grid.
7. Return the modified output grid.
