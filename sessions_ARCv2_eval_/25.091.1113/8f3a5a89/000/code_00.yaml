actions:
  - name: find_start_point
    description: Locate the single pixel with the 'start_point' color (magenta, 6).
  - name: flood_fill
    description: >
      Starting from the 'start_point' pixel, identify all connected 'background'
      pixels (gray, 8) that can be reached without crossing any 'boundary' pixels
      (blue, 1). Connectivity is considered horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).
  - name: replace_pixels
    description: Change the color of all identified reachable 'background' pixels to the 'fill_color' (orange, 7).

relationships:
  - type: spatial_containment
    description: The 'background' pixels reachable from the 'start_point' are contained within areas defined by the 'boundary' pixels.
  - type: immutability
    description: The 'boundary' pixels and the 'start_point' pixel are immutable; their color and position do not change.
