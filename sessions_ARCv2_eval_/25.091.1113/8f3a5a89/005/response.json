Find the single magenta pixel (color 6) which serves as the starting point for a flood fill.\n3. Perform a flood fill operation starting from the magenta pixel:\n    - Initialize a queue with the starting pixel's coordinates.\n    - Initialize a set to keep track of visited coordinates.\n    - While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue a coordinate (r, c).\n        - Check if the coordinate is valid (within bounds, not visited, not a boundary blue pixel '1'). If not valid, skip.\n        - Mark the coordinate as visited.\n        - If the pixel at (r, c) in the original input grid is gray (color 8), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to orange (color 7).\n        - Add all valid neighbors (up, down, left, right) of (r, c) to the queue.\n4.
