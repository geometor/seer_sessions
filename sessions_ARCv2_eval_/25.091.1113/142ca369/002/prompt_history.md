**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids contain various small, distinct objects composed of colored pixels (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange) scattered on a white background. Some objects are single pixels, while others form simple shapes like lines or 'L' shapes.

The output grids show the original objects from the input grid, plus additional colored pixels forming diagonal lines. These lines originate from each of the non-white pixels present in the input grid. Each line extends downwards and to the right, maintaining the color of the originating pixel. The lines continue until they reach either the bottom edge or the right edge of the grid. The final output grid appears to be a superposition of the original input grid and these newly generated diagonal paths.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
    background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. Can be single pixels or multi-pixel shapes.
    properties:
      - color: blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7)
      - position: row and column coordinates
      - shape: variable (single pixel, lines, L-shapes observed)
actions:
  - name: identify_source_pixels
    description: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (white, 0).
  - name: generate_path
    description: For each identified source pixel, create a diagonal path.
    parameters:
      - source_pixel: The non-white pixel initiating the path.
      - direction: Downwards and to the right (increase row index by 1, increase column index by 1).
      - color: The path pixels have the same color as the source_pixel.
      - termination: The path stops when the next step would go beyond the grid's bottom or right boundary.
  - name: combine_grids
    description: Superimpose the generated paths onto the original input grid. The original non-white pixels remain, and the path pixels are added. If a path pixel overlaps an existing non-white pixel, the original pixel's color is retained (or potentially overwritten by the path color, though examples suggest superposition without conflict). The examples show the path color simply filling in white background cells along its trajectory.
relationships:
  - Each non-white pixel in the input grid is a source_pixel for a generated path.
  - The path generated by a source_pixel shares the same color as that source_pixel.
  - The path follows a strict diagonal trajectory (down-right) relative to the source_pixel's location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
3.  If a cell contains a non-white color (value > 0):
    a.  Store the color and the starting coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of this source pixel.
    b.  Initialize the current path position to `(r + 1, c + 1)`.
    c.  While the current path position is within the grid boundaries (current row < grid height and current column < grid width):
        i.  Set the pixel at the current path position in the output grid to the stored color of the source pixel.
        ii. Update the current path position by moving one step down and one step right (increment row and column by 1).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by identifying all non-white pixels and drawing a 
    diagonal path (down and right) starting from each of these source pixels. 
    The path uses the same color as the source pixel and continues until it 
    hits the bottom or right edge of the grid. The final output grid is a 
    superposition of the original grid and all the generated paths.
