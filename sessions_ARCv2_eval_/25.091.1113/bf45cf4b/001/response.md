"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent color).
2. Find the two distinct non-background patterns (objects) in the input grid using connected components analysis.
3. Determine the bounding box subgrid for each pattern.
4. Count the number of unique non-background colors within each pattern's bounding box subgrid.
5. The pattern with a higher count of unique non-background colors becomes the 'Tile Pattern'.
   The other pattern becomes the 'Shape Pattern'. If counts are equal, the selection criteria might need refinement,
   but based on examples, the one with more colors is the tile. Assume unequal counts or a default tie-break (e.g., first found).
6. Create a binary mask from the Shape Pattern's subgrid (1 for non-background pixels, 0 for background).
7. Create an output grid whose dimensions are derived by multiplying the dimensions of the
   Shape Pattern's mask (rows * tile_height, cols * tile_width).
8. Tile the output grid: Place copies of the Tile Pattern subgrid into the output grid at positions
   corresponding to the '1's in the Shape Pattern mask, scaled by the Tile Pattern dimensions.
   Place blocks of the background color (matching the Tile Pattern's dimensions) where the mask is '0'.
