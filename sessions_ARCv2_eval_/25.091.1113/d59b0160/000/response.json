            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 16x16 grid.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in both input and output grids is orange (7). This appears to be the background color.\n3.  **Other Colors:** Various other colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon) appear as pixels or small clusters within the orange background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing certain non-orange pixels to the orange background color. Not all non-orange pixels are changed; some remain the same in the output.\n5.  **Key Difference:** The pixels that are changed to orange seem to be those that are \"internal\" or \"isolated\" from the grid's border by the orange background color. Pixels of any non-orange color that are on the border, or connected to the border through a path of other non-orange pixels (including diagonally adjacent), seem to remain unchanged. Pixels or connected groups of non-orange pixels that are completely surrounded by orange pixels are changed to orange.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize a set or list, `border_connected_pixels`, to store the coordinates of non-background pixels connected to the border.\n4.  Initialize a queue or stack for a search algorithm (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) with the coordinates of all non-background pixels located on the grid's border (row 0, last row, column 0, or last column). Add these initial border pixels to `border_connected_pixels`.\n5.  While the search queue/stack is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue/pop a pixel coordinate `(r, c)`.\n    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).\n    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:\n        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the input grid is *not* the background color (not orange).\n        iii. Check if `(nr, nc)` has *not* already been added to `border_connected_pixels`.\n        iv. If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are met, add `(nr, nc)` to `border_connected_pixels` and enqueue/push it onto the search queue/stack.\n6.  Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n7.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is *not* the background color (not orange) AND its coordinate `(r, c)` is *not* present in the `border_connected_pixels` set:\n    a.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the background color (orange, 7).\n8.  All other pixels (background pixels and border-connected non-background pixels) retain their original color in the output grid (already handled by copying the input initially and only modifying the non-connected ones).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
