task_type: pattern_filling_by_region
grid_properties:
  size: constant (input and output have same dimensions)
  background_color: identifiable (most frequent color, excluding separators)
  separator_color: red (2)
  separators_persist: true (red pixels remain unchanged)

components:
  - object: separator
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      type: vertical or horizontal lines
      function: divides grid into regions
  - object: region
    properties:
      shape: rectangular
      defined_by: separators
      location: unique area bounded by separators or grid edges
  - object: key_pixel
    properties:
      location: within a region
      color: not background_color and not separator_color
      role: determines output colors for the region
  - object: fill_area
    properties:
      location: within an output region
      color: determined by the 'first' key_pixel (sorted row/col) or a default
      occupies: most of the region area
  - object: pattern_overlay
    properties:
      location: within an output region
      shape: fixed geometric stencil (potentially different for left/right regions)
      color: determined by 'subsequent' key_pixels or a default
      coloring_rule: if multiple pattern colors, assign based on nearest key_pixel (Manhattan distance, row/col tie-break)

relationships:
  - input region maps to output region
  - key_pixels within input region determine fill_color and pattern_color(s) for output region
  - first key_pixel (or default) determines fill_color
  - subsequent key_pixels (or default) determine pattern_color(s)
  - region position (left/right of vertical separator) potentially influences default colors and pattern shape

defaults:
  - fill_color: used when region has no key_pixels (may depend on left/right position)
  - pattern_color: used when region has 0 or 1 key_pixel (may depend on left/right position)

constants:
  - separator_color: red (2)
  - pattern_geometry: fixed shape for left regions, fixed shape for right regions
