task_description: Identify the single color forming vertical divider lines, distinct from the overall background color. Split the grid into sections using these dividers. Count pixels in each section that match neither the divider nor the background color. Output the leftmost section with the highest count of such foreground pixels.

elements:
  - role: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - role: output_grid
    description: A 2D array, representing a vertical subgrid (section) from the input.
  - role: uniform_column
    description: A vertical column in the input grid where all pixels share the same color.
  - role: overall_most_frequent_color
    description: The single color value that appears most frequently across all pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - global_prevalence: Highest count grid-wide.
  - role: divider_color
    description: The color forming the uniform columns that act as separators. This color is distinct from the overall_most_frequent_color.
    properties:
      - forms_uniform_columns: True
      - is_separator: True
      - is_overall_most_frequent: False
  - role: divider_column
    description: A uniform_column whose color is the divider_color.
    properties:
        - function: Partitions the grid into vertical sections.
  - role: background_color
    description: The color identified as the overall_most_frequent_color.
    properties:
      - is_overall_most_frequent: True
  - role: section
    description: A vertical subgrid of the input grid, located between divider columns or between a grid edge and a divider column.
  - role: foreground_pixel
    description: A pixel within a section whose color is neither the background_color nor the divider_color.
    properties:
      - color: Distinguishes it from background and dividers.

actions:
  - name: find_overall_most_frequent_color
    description: Count all pixel colors in the input grid and identify the color with the highest count.
  - name: find_uniform_columns_and_colors
    description: Identify all columns composed of a single color and list the colors found in such columns.
  - name: determine_divider_color
    description: Select the color from the uniform column colors that is not the overall_most_frequent_color.
  - name: determine_background_color
    description: Set the background_color to be the overall_most_frequent_color.
  - name: identify_divider_columns
    description: Find the indices of all columns composed solely of the determined divider_color.
  - name: segment_grid_by_dividers
    description: Use the identified divider_columns to split the input grid into vertical sections.
  - name: count_foreground_pixels_in_sections
    description: For each section, count pixels whose color is neither the background_color nor the divider_color.
  - name: select_target_section
    description: Identify the section(s) with the maximum count of foreground pixels. If there is a tie, select the section corresponding to the smallest starting column index (leftmost).
  - name: generate_output
    description: Create the output grid by copying the selected target section.

relationships:
  - type: equals
    source: background_color
    target: overall_most_frequent_color
    description: The background color is defined as the most frequent color in the entire grid.
  - type: composition
    source: divider_column
    target: divider_color
    description: Divider columns are composed entirely of the divider color.
  - type: distinct_from
    source: divider_color
    target: background_color
    description: The divider color cannot be the same as the background color.
  - type: defines
    source: divider_columns
    target: sections
    description: Divider columns define the boundaries between sections.
  - type: excludes
    source: foreground_pixel_color
    target: [background_color, divider_color]
    description: A foreground pixel's color cannot be the background or divider color.
  - type: determines
    source: count_of_foreground_pixels_in_sections
    target: selected_target_section
    description: The maximum count determines which section is selected (leftmost in case of tie).
  - type: equals
    source: output_grid
    target: selected_target_section
    description: The output grid is identical to the selected target section.
