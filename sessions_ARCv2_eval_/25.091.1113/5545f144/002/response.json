The outputs generated by the code (`[[3], [3]...]`, `[[2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 3, 0]...]`, `[[4], [4]...]`) do not match the expected outputs and seem inconsistent even with each other (sometimes a single column of the divider color, sometimes a mix including the divider column). This strongly suggests either a fundamental bug in the implementation (perhaps in array slicing, section handling, or return value formatting) or an issue with the execution/reporting environment, rather than a flaw in the high-level transformation logic derived from the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to re-affirm the core logic based on a careful re-examination of the input/output pairs, refine the natural language program and YAML facts for clarity, and assume the previous execution results were due to an implementation error that needs correcting in the coder phase, not a misunderstanding of the task's rules. We will proceed with the original, traced logic which correctly predicts the output for all training examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-calculate the key metrics for each example based on the intended logic:\n\n"
