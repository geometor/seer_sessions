            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of pixels with various colors. A prominent feature is the presence of one or more vertical columns composed entirely of a single, repeating color. These columns act as dividers.\n2.  **Dividers:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the dividers are columns of green (3).\n    *   In `train_2`, the dividers are columns of red (2).\n    *   In `train_3`, the divider is a column of yellow (4).\n3.  **Sections:** These divider columns partition the input grid into distinct vertical sections or subgrids.\n4.  **Background Color:** Within each example, there appears to be a dominant background color, distinct from the divider color.\n    *   `train_1`: Background is blue (1).\n    *   `train_2`: Background is white (0).\n    *   `train_3`: Background is gray (5).\n5.  **Foreground Objects:** Each section contains foreground objects composed of pixels whose color is neither the background color nor the divider color.\n    *   `train_1`: Foreground is yellow (4).\n    *   `train_2`: Foreground is green (3).\n    *   `train_3`: Foreground is magenta (6).\n6.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is consistently a copy of exactly *one* of the vertical sections from the input grid.\n7.  **Selection Logic:** The key transformation is selecting *which* section becomes the output. Comparing the sections reveals a pattern: the section chosen for the output is the one containing the *highest number* of foreground pixels (pixels that are not the background color and not the divider color).\n    *   `train_1`: Sections have 7, 4, and 3 yellow pixels. The first section (with 7) is chosen.\n    *   `train_2`: Sections have 6, 5, 4, and 7 green pixels. The last section (with 7) is chosen.\n    *   `train_3`: Sections have 11 and 8 magenta pixels. The first section (with 11) is chosen.\n8.  **Tie-breaking:** In case of a tie in the count of foreground pixels between sections, the examples (`train_1`, `train_3`) suggest selecting the leftmost section among those tied for the maximum count. `train_2` does not involve a tie.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Columns:** Examine each column of the input grid. Identify columns where all pixels have the same color. These are potential divider columns. Determine the single color used across all such uniform columns; this is the `divider_color`. Confirm that at least one such column exists.\n2.  **Identify Background:** Consider all pixels *not* located in the identified divider columns. Count the occurrences of each color among these non-divider pixels. The color with the highest frequency is the `background_color`.\n3.  **Define Sections:** Mentally (or actually) split the input grid vertically using the divider columns as boundaries. This creates multiple sections. The sections include the areas from the left edge to the first divider, between consecutive dividers, and from the last divider to the right edge.\n4.  **Count Foreground in Sections:** For each section created in step 3, iterate through its pixels. Count how many pixels have a color that is *neither* the `divider_color` nor the `background_color`. Record this count for each section.\n5.  **Select Section:** Find the maximum count recorded in step 4. Identify the section(s) that achieved this maximum count. If only one section has the maximum count, select it. If multiple sections tie for the maximum count, select the one that appears furthest to the left in the original input grid.\n6.  **Produce Output:** The output grid is an exact copy of the single section selected in step 5."
