Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: 12x12 (variable, but consistent within a pair)
  Cell Values: Integers 0-9 (Colors)
  Background Color: 0 (white)

Objects:
  - Name: ControlPixel
    Location: Top-left corner (coordinates [0, 0])
    Property: Color (value C)
    Role: Determines the transformation (shift vector) for other objects. Remains stationary in the output.
  - Name: GridContent
    Description: All non-background pixels excluding the ControlPixel.
    Composition: Can be multiple disconnected shapes or patterns.
    Behavior: Undergoes a translational shift.

Transformation:
  Type: Conditional Shift
  Condition: Based on the Color (C) of the ControlPixel.
  Shift Vectors (delta_row, delta_col):
    - If C == 9 (Maroon): (0, 0)
    - If C == 4 (Yellow): (3, 2)
    - If C == 6 (Magenta): (3, 1)
    - If C == 7 (Orange): (3, 1)
  Process:
    - Apply the determined shift vector to the coordinates of every pixel belonging to the GridContent.
    - Pixels shifted outside the grid boundaries are removed.
    - The ControlPixel remains at [0, 0] in the output.
    - The output grid is initialized with the Background Color, then populated with the stationary ControlPixel and the shifted GridContent.
