            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of varying sizes but seem to be around 11x11. They primarily consist of an orange (7) background.\n2.  **Key Object:** The central feature in each input is a 3x3 block composed of green (3) pixels arranged around a central red (2) pixel, forming the pattern `[[3,3,3],[3,2,3],[3,3,3]]`.\n3.  **Modifying Elements:**\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels are present elsewhere in the grid, scattered or in small clusters. Their presence seems essential for any transformation to occur.\n    *   Gray (6) pixels often form a partial or near-complete border around the central 3x3 green/red block. In one example (`train_3`), these gray pixels are absent.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation exclusively affects the pixels within the 3x3 green/red block. Some or all of the green (3) pixels are changed to maroon (9). The central red (2) pixel sometimes changes to maroon (9) (`train_2`) but usually remains unchanged (`train_1`, `train_3`). Pixels outside this 3x3 block are never modified.\n5.  **Rule Dependency:** The specific pattern of change within the 3x3 block appears to depend on the configuration of the gray (6) pixels immediately surrounding the block. The presence of *any* maroon (9) pixels outside the block acts as a trigger for the change.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
