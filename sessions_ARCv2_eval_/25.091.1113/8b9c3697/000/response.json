Appears as single pixels or small contiguous blocks (like 2x2 squares).\n    *   White (0): Appears only in the output grid, used as a fill color.\n    *   Other Colors (Blue 1, Yellow 4, Green 3, Azure 8): Form larger shapes or structures that interact with the red pixels. These act as \"containers\" or boundaries.\n    *   Background Color: The color filling most of the grid space (Yellow 4 or Green 3).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Red Objects:** Single pixels or contiguous blocks of red (2). These are the actors.\n    *   **Container Objects:** Contiguous shapes of a single color (e.g., blue, yellow, azure) that are not red and not the background. These define boundaries for the action.\n    *   **Background:** The pervasive color filling the space around objects.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying specific red objects based on their proximity to \"cavities\" or \"inlets\" in container objects.\n    *   **Cavity Filling:** When a red object is found near such a cavity, the background-colored region forming the cavity is flood-filled with white (0). The fill stops at the boundary of the container object.\n    *   **Red Object Modification:** The red object that triggered the fill is itself modified:\n        *   It turns white (0) if it ends up sharing an edge with the newly filled white region.\n        *   It turns into the background color if it triggered a fill but does not share an edge with the white fill (e.g., only connected diagonally or separated by a container pixel).\n    *   **Red Object Removal:** Red objects that do *not* trigger a cavity fill are simply removed, replaced by the background color.\n5.  **Spatial Relationships:** Adjacency (both edge and corner) is crucial for determining if a red object can trigger a fill (must be adjacent to a background pixel within a cavity). Edge adjacency is then used to determine the final color of the triggering red object. The concept of a \"cavity\" or \"partially enclosed region\" defined by a container object is central.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
