**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids consist of a dominant background color (yellow in Ex1 & 3, green in Ex2) and various shapes or pixels of other colors.
2.  **Key Colors:**
    *   Red (2): Seems to be the primary trigger or agent of change. Appears as single pixels or small contiguous blocks (like 2x2 squares).
    *   White (0): Appears only in the output grid, used as a fill color.
    *   Other Colors (Blue 1, Yellow 4, Green 3, Azure 8): Form larger shapes or structures that interact with the red pixels. These act as "containers" or boundaries.
    *   Background Color: The color filling most of the grid space (Yellow 4 or Green 3).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   **Red Objects:** Single pixels or contiguous blocks of red (2). These are the actors.
    *   **Container Objects:** Contiguous shapes of a single color (e.g., blue, yellow, azure) that are not red and not the background. These define boundaries for the action.
    *   **Background:** The pervasive color filling the space around objects.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying specific red objects based on their proximity to "cavities" or "inlets" in container objects.
    *   **Cavity Filling:** When a red object is found near such a cavity, the background-colored region forming the cavity is flood-filled with white (0). The fill stops at the boundary of the container object.
    *   **Red Object Modification:** The red object that triggered the fill is itself modified:
        *   It turns white (0) if it ends up sharing an edge with the newly filled white region.
        *   It turns into the background color if it triggered a fill but does not share an edge with the white fill (e.g., only connected diagonally or separated by a container pixel).
    *   **Red Object Removal:** Red objects that do *not* trigger a cavity fill are simply removed, replaced by the background color.
5.  **Spatial Relationships:** Adjacency (both edge and corner) is crucial for determining if a red object can trigger a fill (must be adjacent to a background pixel within a cavity). Edge adjacency is then used to determine the final color of the triggering red object. The concept of a "cavity" or "partially enclosed region" defined by a container object is central.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the background color (the most common color).
3.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects (shapes) made of colors other than the background color. Categorize these into "red objects" (color 2) and "container objects" (all others).
4.  Keep track of which red objects have been processed. Initialize this tracker as empty.
5.  For each unprocessed red object:
    a.  Check its neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    b.  If a neighbor is a background pixel `N`, check if `N` lies within a "cavity" or "inlet" formed by a single container object. A cavity is a region of background pixels partially enclosed by the container object, reachable from `N` by moving through background pixels without crossing the container object's boundary pixels.
    c.  If such a cavity is found adjacent to the red object:
        i.  Flood fill the entire cavity region (starting from `N`) on the output grid with white (color 0). The fill should stop when it hits pixels belonging to the container object that forms the cavity.
        ii. Check if any pixel of the original red object shares an edge (not just a corner) with any
