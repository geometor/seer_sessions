Identify all groups of connected non-white pixels (value != 0) in the input grid using 8-way connectivity.
Select the group (object) with the largest number of pixels.
Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col) of this largest object.
Create a new grid sized to this bounding box, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
Copy only the pixels belonging to the largest object from the input grid to the new grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box frame.
