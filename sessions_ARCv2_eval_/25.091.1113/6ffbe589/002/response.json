            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully identified the largest connected component of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity) and calculated its bounding box. The dimensions derived from this bounding box correctly matched the dimensions of the expected output grid across all training examples. However, the code failed because it performed a simple rectangular crop of the input grid based on these bounds. The comparison between the `transformed output` and the `expected output` reveals that the output grid should *only* contain the pixels belonging to the largest object itself, placed within the bounding box frame, while all other positions within that frame should be the background color (white, 0). The original crop included background pixels and potentially pixels from smaller objects that happened to fall within the largest object's bounding box.\n\nThe strategy needs refinement: instead of cropping, create a new grid of the correct dimensions (derived from the bounding box) initialized with the background color, and then \"paint\" only the pixels from the largest object onto this new canvas, adjusting their coordinates relative to the bounding box's top-left corner.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the previous `code_execution` output and analysis:\n\n*   **Connectivity:** 8-way connectivity is used for identifying objects.\n*   **Background Color:** White (0) is the background color.\n*   **Object Selection Criterion:** The object with the maximum number of non-white pixels is selected.\n*   **Bounding Box Role:** Defines the exact dimensions (height and width) of the output grid.\n*   **Output Content:** Consists *only* of the pixels from the selected largest object, translated to fit within the bounding box dimensions, padded with the background color.\n\n| Example | Input Dims | Expected Output Dims | Largest Object Size (Pixels) | Largest Object BBox (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) | BBox Derived Dims (H, W) | BBox Dims Match Output Dims? | Simple Crop Matches Output? |\n| :------ | :--------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| 1       | (20, 20)   | (13, 13)             | 100                          | (0, 12, 6, 18)                                  | (13, 13)                   | Yes                          | No                          |\n| 2       | (20, 20)   | (10, 10)             | 46                           | (2, 11, 6, 15)                                  | (10, 10)                   | Yes                          | No                          |\n| 3       | (20, 20)   | (10, 10)             | 48                           | (9, 18, 1, 10)                                  | (10, 10)                   | Yes                          | No                          |\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Use 8-way connectivity (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors are considered connected). Keep track of the coordinates `(row, col)` for every pixel within each group.\n2.  **Find the Largest Group:** Calculate the size (number of pixels) for each group found in step 1. Identify the group that has the largest size. This is the \"target object\".\n3.  **Determine Bounds:** Find the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) among all pixels belonging to the target object. These define its bounding box.\n4.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid. The height of this grid will be `(max_r - min_r + 1)` and the width will be `(max_c - min_c + 1)`. Fill this entire new grid with the background color (white, 0).\n5.  **Transfer Object:** Iterate through each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` that belongs to the target object (identified in step 2).\n    a.  Retrieve the original color of this pixel from the input grid at `input_grid[r, c]`.\n    b.  Calculate the corresponding position in the output grid: `new_row = r - min_r`, `new_col = c - min_c`.\n    c.  Place the retrieved color into the output grid at `output_grid[new_row, new_col]`.\n6.  **Final Output:** The newly created and populated grid is the result."
