Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2. For each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom, checking each pixel (r, c) and the one directly below it (r+1, c).\n3. Identify a \"trigger\" pixel at (r, c) if its color (C1) is not white (0).\n4. Identify a potential \"target\" segment starting at (r+1, c) if its color (C2) is not white (0) and C1 is different from C2.\n5. If such a trigger and potential target start are found:\n    a. Determine the full extent of the contiguous vertical segment of color C2 starting at (r+1, c) and extending downwards. Let this segment end at row k.\n    b. In the output grid, change the color of all pixels in this segment, from row r+1 to row k in column c, to the trigger color C1.\n6. Pixels not part of a segment modified this way retain their original color. White pixels (0) act as boundaries and are never triggers or targets.\n7. The process continues iterating through the rows and columns. Modifications are made to a copy of the grid, ensuring that the original pixel colors are used for subsequent checks within the same column scan.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_vertical_segment_end(grid, start_row, col, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the end row index of a contiguous vertical segment of a specific color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        start_row (int): The starting row index of the segment.\n        col (int): The column index of the segment.\n        target_color (int): The color of the segment pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The row index of the last pixel in the segment.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = grid.shape[0]\n    end_row = start_row\n    # Iterate downwards from the row below the starting row\n    for r in range(start_row + 1, height):\n        if grid[r, col] == target_color:\n            # If the color matches, extend the segment end\n            end_row = r\n        else:\n            # If the color doesn't match, the segment ends at the previous row\n            break\n    return end_row\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by recoloring vertical segments based on the pixel above.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each column\n    for c in range(width):\n        # Iterate through rows, stopping one before the last row\n        # as we need to check the pixel below (r+1)\n        for r in range(height - 1):\n            # Get the color of the current pixel (potential trigger)\n            trigger_color = input_grid[r, c]\n            # Get the color of the pixel below (potential target segment start)\n            target_start_color = input_grid[r + 1, c]\n\n            # Check the conditions for transformation:\n            # 1.
