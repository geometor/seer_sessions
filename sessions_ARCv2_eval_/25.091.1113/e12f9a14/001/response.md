"""
Identifies non-gray, non-green "seed" pixels within the input grid.
Performs a flood fill operation starting from these seed pixels.
The fill color for a region is determined by the color of the seed pixel(s) initiating the fill for that region.
The fill propagates into adjacent (including diagonal) gray pixels.
Green pixels act as barriers, stopping the fill.
The original seed pixels and green barrier pixels remain unchanged.
Gray pixels not reachable by any fill also remain unchanged.
If multiple fills could reach the same gray pixel, the first one to reach it claims it (implicit in BFS).
