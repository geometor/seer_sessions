Identify \"seed\" pixels: non-gray (8) and non-green (3) pixels in the input.\n2. Identify green (3) pixels, which act as boundary interfaces.\n3. For each seed pixel, find adjacent green pixels (8-way connectivity).\n4. For each pair of seed pixel (sr, sc) with color C and adjacent green pixel (gr, gc):\n   a. Determine the projection direction (dr, dc) = (gr - sr, gc - sc).\n   b. Define the ray starting position (start_r, start_c) = (gr + dr, gc + dc).\n   c. Cast a ray from (start_r, start_c) in the direction (dr, dc).\n5. Ray Casting Logic:\n   a. Starting from (r, c) = (start_r, start_c), proceed in steps of (dr, dc).\n   b. At each step (r, c):\n      i. If (r, c) is outside the grid, stop the ray.\n      ii. If the pixel input_grid[r, c] is green (3), stop the ray.\n      iii. If the pixel input_grid[r, c] is gray (8), change output_grid[r, c] to the seed color C.\n      iv. If the pixel input_grid[r, c] is non-gray and non-green, stop the ray.\n      v. Continue to the next step: (r + dr, c + dc).\n6. The final output grid contains the original non-gray pixels and the gray pixels colored by the rays. If multiple rays color the same gray pixel, the outcome depends on the order of processing, but the examples suggest a consistent result, implying either non-overlapping projections or a deterministic overwrite rule (e.g., based on proximity or seed color value - although the latter seems unlikely). This implementation assumes overwriting is acceptable, processed ray by ray.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Projects colors from seed pixels outwards from adjacent green boundary pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): The input 2D grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: The transformed 2D grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    GRAY = 8\n    GREEN = 3\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Define 8 directions for adjacency checks and ray casting\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        ( 0, -1),          ( 0, 1),\n        ( 1, -1), ( 1, 0), ( 1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Store unique rays to cast: set of (start_r, start_c, dr, dc, color)\n    rays_to_cast = set()\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify seed pixels and find adjacent green boundaries\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            seed_color = input_grid[r, c]\n            # Check if it's a seed pixel\n            if seed_color != GRAY and seed_color != GREEN:\n                # Step 3: Check neighbors for green pixels\n                for dr_adj, dc_adj in directions:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr_adj, c + dc_adj\n                    # Check bounds and if neighbor is green\n                    if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and input_grid[nr, nc] == GREEN:\n                        # Found an adjacent green boundary pixel (nr, nc)\n                        # Step 4a: Determine projection direction\n                        proj_dr, proj_dc = dr_adj, dc_adj # Direction is from seed to green\n                        # Step 4b: Define ray starting position (first pixel beyond green)\n                        start_r, start_c = nr + proj_dr, nc + proj_dc\n                        # Add ray details to the set (ensures uniqueness)\n                        rays_to_cast.add((start_r, start_c, proj_dr, proj_dc, seed_color))\n\n    # Step 5 & 6: Cast all unique rays\n    for start_r, start_c, dr, dc, color in rays_to_cast:\n        curr_r, curr_c = start_r, start_c\n        # Keep casting while within bounds\n        while 0 <= curr_r < height and 0 <= curr_c < width:\n            # Check the color of the pixel in the *original* grid\n            pixel_in_input = input_grid[curr_r, curr_c]\n\n            if pixel_in_input == GREEN:\n                # Stop ray if it hits a green barrier\n                break\n            elif pixel_in_input == GRAY:\n                # Color the gray pixel in the output grid\n                output_grid[curr_r, curr_c] = color\n            else: # Hit another non-gray, non-green color\n                 # Stop the ray (as specified by examples like Ex1 where rays stop)\n                 # Alternative: could continue if output[curr_r, curr_c] is gray\n                 # but let's stick to stopping based on input content first.\n                 break # Stop ray if it hits any non-GRAY, non-GREEN pixel in the input\n\n            # Move to the next pixel along the ray\n            curr_r += dr\n            curr_c += dc\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
