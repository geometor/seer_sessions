task_description: "Fill connected gray background areas based on adjacent non-gray, non-green 'seed' colors, respecting green boundaries."
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9."
  - type: background
    color: gray (8)
    description: "The default pixel color, subject to filling."
  - type: barrier
    color: green (3)
    description: "Pixels that block the fill process."
    properties:
      - static: Remain unchanged in the output.
      - impassable: Fill cannot enter or cross these pixels.
  - type: seed
    description: "Pixels with colors other than gray (8) or green (3)."
    properties:
      - static: Remain unchanged in the output.
      - source: Initiate flood fill into adjacent gray areas.
      - color: Determines the color of the filled area.
  - type: fill_area
    description: "Regions of gray pixels in the input that are connected to a seed pixel via a path of gray pixels without crossing a green pixel."
    properties:
      - initial_color: gray (8)
      - final_color: The color of the seed pixel that initiated the fill for that region.
      - connectivity: 8-way (adjacent and diagonal).
actions:
  - type: identify_elements
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates and colors of background, barrier, and seed pixels.
  - type: multi_source_flood_fill
    input: input_grid, seed_pixel_list
    parameters:
      - fill_target: gray (8)
      - barrier_color: green (3)
      - connectivity: 8
    output: filled_grid
    description: >
      Perform a simultaneous Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all seed pixels.
      The search expands into adjacent (8-way) gray pixels.
      When a gray pixel is reached, it is colored with the color of the seed pixel from which the fill path originated.
      The fill stops at green pixels, grid edges, or any non-gray pixel.
      If multiple fills could reach the same gray pixel, the first one to reach it (determined by BFS) claims the pixel.
      Barrier (green) and seed pixels are never modified.
output_generation:
  - step: Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
  - step: Identify all seed pixels (non-gray, non-green).
  - step: Perform the multi_source_flood_fill operation, updating the output_grid. The fill starts from all seeds simultaneously. Gray pixels are recolored based on the originating seed color of the fill path that first reaches them. Green pixels act as barriers. Original seed and green pixels remain unchanged.
  - step: Return the final output_grid.
