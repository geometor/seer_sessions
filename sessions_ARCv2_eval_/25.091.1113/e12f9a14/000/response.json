Inside these green boundaries, there are small regions of other colors (e.g., maroon(9), blue(1), yellow(4), magenta(6), red(2), orange(7)). The transformation fills the gray background areas connected to these inner colors, using the respective inner color for filling. The filling process extends outwards from the inner color regions, stops at the green boundaries, and does not affect the original green shapes or their inner colored regions. The fill seems to use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
