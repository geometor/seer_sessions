```python
"""
Perform a multi-source flood fill on a grid. 
Identifies non-gray (8), non-green (3) "seed" pixels. 
Starting simultaneously from all seed pixels, fills adjacent (8-way connectivity) 
gray (8) pixels with the color of the originating seed. 
Green (3) pixels act as barriers, stopping the fill. 
Original seed and green pixels remain unchanged in the output.
Gray pixels not reachable by any fill also remain unchanged.
