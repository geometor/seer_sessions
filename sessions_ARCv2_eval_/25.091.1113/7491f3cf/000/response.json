There are typically four distinct rectangular inner regions. One of these regions (the rightmost one in the examples) is initially filled with a single color. The output grid modifies only this rightmost region. The modification involves overlaying patterns from the second and third regions (from the left) onto the rightmost region. Specifically, non-background pixels from the second region are copied first, and then non-background pixels from the third region are copied into the remaining background locations of the target region.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
