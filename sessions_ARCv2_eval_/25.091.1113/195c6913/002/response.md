## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as a pattern fill originating from seed pixels into a fillable area, bounded by background and terminator pixels. However, the python code failed because it used hardcoded parameters derived *only* from `train_1`, specifically the colors, pattern sequence (`[2, 2, 8]`), and seed handling (`retain`).

The failures on `train_2` and `train_3`, and even `train_1`, highlight several issues:

1.  **Parameter Hardcoding:** The most significant error. The `fillable_color`, `seed_colors`, `pattern_sequence`, `terminator_colors`, `erased_colors`, and `background_color` must be dynamically determined for *each specific input grid*.
2.  **Pattern Propagation Logic:** The way the pattern index was advanced in the BFS (`next_pattern_index + 1`) seems incorrect or insufficient. The color assigned to a newly filled pixel likely depends on the color of the pixel *from which* it is being filled (its parent in the BFS tree), cycling through the `pattern_sequence`. The initial implementation didn't correctly map the parent's color to the child's color within the sequence.
3.  **Seed Handling:** The initial code assumed seeds retain their color (`seed_handling = "retain"`). `train_3` clearly shows seeds being *replaced* by the pattern's starting color. This needs to be a parameter derived from the examples.
4.  **Initial Fill:** The code correctly identified initial fill locations (fillable cells adjacent to seeds) and colored them with the first pattern color. This part seems generally correct, but depends on correct parameter identification.
5.  **Terminator/Background Handling:** The code implicitly handled these by only propagating into `fillable_color` pixels found in the *input* grid, which is correct.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Dynamic Parameter Identification:** Develop logic to identify the roles of each color (background, fillable, seed, terminator, erased) and the pattern sequence based on properties observed across the examples (e.g., frequency, adjacency relationships, changes between input/output).
2.  **Refine Fill Logic:** Modify the BFS to determine a new pixel's color based on its parent's color within the identified `pattern_sequence`.
3.  **Implement Seed Handling Logic:** Add a step to handle seed pixels according to the determined rule ('retain' or 'replace') *before* the main fill propagation begins.
4.  **Implement Erasure Logic:** Add a pre-processing step to replace 'erased' colors with the 'background' color.
