Initialize a \n    'visited' set to track non-fillable or already filled pixels.\n3.  **Pre-processing & Visited Set Population:**\n    - Iterate through the input grid.\n    - Identify original seed locations.\n    - Add coordinates of all non-fillable pixels (background, seeds, terminators, \n      erased) from the input to the 'visited' set.\n    - Apply pre-processing changes to the output grid: replace erased colors with \n      background, and if seed handling is 'replace', update seed pixels with the \n      first pattern color.\n4.  **Initial Fill Points & Queue Seeding:**\n    - Identify pixels that were originally fillable *and* are 8-directionally \n      adjacent to any original seed location.\n    - For each such starting point not already in 'visited':\n        - Color it with the first pattern color in the output grid.\n        - Add its coordinates to 'visited'.\n        - Add the coordinate and the pattern index used (0) to the BFS queue.\n5.  **BFS Propagation:**\n    - While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue a pixel P and the pattern index 'current_idx' used to color it.\n        - Calculate the 'next_idx' and corresponding 'next_color' from the pattern sequence.\n        - For each 8-directional neighbor N of P:\n            - If N's coordinate is *not* in the 'visited' set:\n                - Color N with 'next_color' in the output grid.\n                - Add N's coordinate to 'visited'.\n                - Enqueue N with 'next_idx'.\n6.  **Return:** Return the final modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets coordinates of 8-directional neighbors within grid bounds.\n\n    Args:\n        r (int): Row index of the center cell.\n        c (int): Column index of the center cell.\n        height (int): Grid height.\n        width (int): Grid width.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[tuple[int, int]]: List of valid neighbor coordinates (row, col).\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            #
