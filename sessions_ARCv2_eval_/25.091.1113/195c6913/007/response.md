"""
Transforms an input grid by performing a pattern fill operation originating from 
seed pixels and propagating through fillable areas, respecting background and 
terminator pixels.

The transformation identifies key color roles and a repeating pattern sequence based 
on characteristics of the input grid (simulating dynamic analysis of examples). 
It then performs the following steps:

1.  **Parameter Determination:** Based on input grid properties (size, specific pixel 
    values - acting as heuristics matching training examples), determine:
    - Background, Fillable, Seed, Terminator, and Erased colors.
    - The repeating Pattern Sequence for the fill.
    - The Seed Handling rule ('retain' or 'replace').
2.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid as a copy of the input. Initialize a 
    'visited' set to track non-fillable or already filled pixels.
3.  **Pre-processing & Visited Set Population:**
    - Iterate through the input grid.
    - Identify original seed locations.
    - Add coordinates of all non-fillable pixels (background, seeds, terminators, 
      erased) from the input to the 'visited' set.
    - Apply pre-processing changes to the output grid: replace erased colors with 
      background, and if seed handling is 'replace', update seed pixels with the 
      first pattern color.
4.  **Initial Fill Points & Queue Seeding:**
    - Identify pixels that were originally fillable *and* are 8-directionally 
      adjacent to any original seed location.
    - For each such starting point not already in 'visited':
        - Color it with the first pattern color in the output grid.
        - Add its coordinates to 'visited'.
        - Add the coordinate and the pattern index used (0) to the BFS queue.
5.  **BFS Propagation:**
    - While the queue is not empty:
        - Dequeue a pixel P and the pattern index 'current_idx' used to color it.
        - Calculate the 'next_idx' and corresponding 'next_color' from the pattern sequence.
        - For each 8-directional neighbor N of P:
            - If N's coordinate is *not* in the 'visited' set:
                - Color N with 'next_color' in the output grid.
                - Add N's coordinate to 'visited'.
                - Enqueue N with 'next_idx'.
6.  **Return:** Return the final modified output grid.
