            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code implementation failed because it relied on hardcoded parameters derived solely from the first training example (`train_1`). These parameters (specific colors for background, fillable areas, seeds, terminators, the pattern sequence itself, and seed handling rules) do not generalize across the other examples (`train_2`, `train_3`). The core Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern-filling logic appears conceptually sound, but its application depends heavily on correctly identifying these roles and the pattern sequence dynamically for each task instance.\n\nThe large number of differing pixels in the results confirms that the incorrect parameters led to fundamentally wrong fill patterns, colors, and boundaries.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Parameter Identification:** Develop a robust method to identify the key parameters (background, fillable, seed, terminator, erased colors, pattern sequence, seed handling) by analyzing the relationships *within a single training example* (input/output pair). Assume these parameters remain consistent for the entire task (including other training examples and the test case).\n2.  **Refine Logic:** Ensure the pre-processing steps (handling erased colors, modifying seeds if required) and the BFS fill correctly use the dynamically identified parameters.\n3.  **Focus on Relationships:** Instead of relying on fixed color values, focus on identifying colors based on their *role* and *spatial relationships* (e.g., color most frequent on border = background; color replaced by multiple other colors = fillable; colors adjacent to fillable that persist = terminators; colors adjacent to fillable that initiate the pattern = seeds).\n4.  **Pattern Extraction:** Analyze the *output* grid in the filled area, specifically near the original seed locations, to extract the repeating pattern sequence.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather some metrics to better understand the discrepancies.\n\n"
