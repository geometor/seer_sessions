Determining parameters based on input grid characteristics (currently hardcoded \n    based on training examples):\n    - Background color: Unchanged, acts as boundary.\n    - Fillable color: Area to be overwritten by the pattern.\n    - Seed color(s): Initiate the fill into adjacent fillable areas.\n    - Terminator color(s): Halt the pattern fill, retain their color, act as boundary.\n    - Erased color(s): (Optional) Replaced by background color before filling.\n    - Pattern Sequence: Repeating sequence of colors used for filling.\n    - Seed Handling: Rule for seed pixels ('retain' original color or 'replace' \n      with the first pattern color).\n2.  Initializing an output grid.\n3.  Pre-processing the grid and initializing a 'visited' set:\n    - Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n    - Populate the 'visited' set with the coordinates of all pixels that are *not* \n      the fillable color in the input grid (background, seeds, terminators, erased).\n    - Update the output grid: Replace erased colors with the background color. \n      If seed handling is 'replace', update seed pixels in the output grid with the \n      first pattern color.\n4.  Identifying initial fill locations: Find pixels that were originally fillable \n    and are 8-directionally adjacent to any original seed pixel location.\n5.  Performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern fill:\n    - Seed the BFS queue with the initial fill locations, coloring them with the \n      first pattern color and marking them as visited. Store the pattern index (0) used.\n    - While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue a pixel P and the pattern index 'current_idx' used to color it.\n        - Calculate the next pattern index 'next_idx' and corresponding 'next_color'.\n        - For each 8-directional neighbor N of P:\n            - If N is within grid bounds and has *not* been visited:\n                - Color N with 'next_color' in the output grid.\n                - Mark N as visited.\n                - Enqueue N with 'next_idx'.\n6.  Returning the modified grid. The fill naturally stops at grid edges, pre-marked \n    visited pixels (background, terminators, seeds), and already filled pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets coordinates of 8-directional neighbors within grid bounds.\n\n    Args:\n        r (int): Row index of the center cell.\n        c (int): Column index of the center cell.\n        height (int): Grid height.\n        width (int): Grid width.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[tuple[int, int]]: List of valid neighbor coordinates (row, col).\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            #
