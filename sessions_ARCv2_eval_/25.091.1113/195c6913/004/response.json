            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or error in the implementation of the pattern fill logic.\n\n**Observations from Failures:**\n\n1.  **Boundary Violation:** The most significant issue across all examples is that the pattern fill overwrites pixels that should remain unchanged. Background colors, terminator colors, and even seed colors (when they should be retained) are being replaced by the pattern.\n2.  **Incorrect Pattern Propagation:** The sequence and placement of the pattern colors within the fillable area are incorrect. This suggests the BFS logic (neighbor selection, color assignment based on sequence, visited tracking) is flawed.\n3.  **Pre-processing Issues:**\n    *   Erased colors (Ex 2: Blue-1) were not replaced by the background color (Red-2).\n    *   Seed handling (Ex 3: Replace Red-2/Green-3 with pattern start Red-2) was not implemented correctly; the original seeds were still present in the incorrect output.\n4.  **Terminator Handling:** Terminator colors (Ex 1: Yellow-4, Ex 2: Maroon-9, Ex 3: Azure-8) were treated as fillable instead of acting as boundaries.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Parameter Identification:** Implement robust logic to identify the `background_color`, `fillable_color`, `seed_colors`, `terminator_colors`, `erased_colors`, `pattern_sequence`, and `seed_handling` rule for any given input/output pair. (For now, we will continue using the hardcoded parameters derived from analysis but refine the core logic based on them).\n2.  **Strict Pre-processing:** Create a clean `initial_state` grid *before* the BFS:\n    *   Copy the input.\n    *   Replace `erased_colors` with `background_color`.\n    *   Modify `seed_colors` based on `seed_handling` (`retain` or `replace`).\n3.  **Refine BFS:**\n    *   **Initialization:** Identify initial fill points: pixels that had `fillable_color` in the *original input* and are adjacent to *original* seed locations.\n    *   **State:** The BFS queue should store `(row, col, pattern_step_index)`.\n    *   **Color Assignment:** When visiting `(r, c)` corresponding to `pattern_step_index`, assign `pattern_sequence[pattern_step_index % pattern_len]`.\n    *   **Propagation:** When adding a neighbor `(nr, nc)`, enqueue it with `(nr, nc, pattern_step_index + 1)`.\n    *   **Target Check:** Only propagate *into* neighbors `(nr, nc)` if `input_np[nr, nc]` was *originally* the `fillable_color`.\n    *   **Visited Set:** Use a `visited` set (or modify the `output_grid` itself) to track pixels that have received their *final* color (either through pre-processing or filling). Only enqueue/color a neighbor if it hasn't been visited. Crucially, *do not* overwrite pixels that were pre-processed (like retained seeds or terminators) or belong to the background. The check should be: `if input_np[nr, nc] == fillable_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:`\n4.  **Boundary Enforcement:** Ensure the `get_neighbors` function correctly handles grid edges and that the BFS logic strictly checks the *original* color of a potential neighbor before filling it and ensures it's not already visited/processed.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the grids more closely.\n"
