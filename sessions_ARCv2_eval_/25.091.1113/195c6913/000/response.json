            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Color Roles:** In each example, different colors seem to play distinct roles:\n    *   **Background:** A color that occupies a large area, often framing the grid or filling space where no specific action occurs. This color generally remains unchanged. (e.g., Green-3 in Ex1, Red-2 in Ex2, Blue-1 in Ex3).\n    *   **Fillable Area:** A region of a specific color in the input grid that gets overwritten by a pattern in the output grid. (e.g., White-0 in Ex1, Azure-8 in Ex2, Yellow-4 in Ex3).\n    *   **Seed/Source:** One or more colors whose pixel locations in the input act as starting points or sources for the pattern fill. (e.g., Red-2/Azure-8 in Ex1, Yellow-4 in Ex2, Red-2/Green-3 in Ex3).\n    *   **Terminator:** A color that halts the pattern propagation. Pixels with this color in the input retain their color in the output and act as boundaries for the fill. (e.g., Yellow-4 in Ex1, Maroon-9 in Ex2, Azure-8 in Ex3).\n    *   **Erased:** Some colors present in the input might be simply replaced by the background color in the output if they aren't seeds, terminators, or fillable areas. (e.g., Blue-1 in Ex2).\n    *   **Pattern Colors:** The specific sequence of colors used to fill the \"Fillable Area\". This sequence is consistent within each example. (e.g., (Red-2, Red-2, Azure-8) in Ex1, (Yellow-4, Blue-1) in Ex2, (Red-2, Red-2, Green-3) in Ex3).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a \"pattern fill\" operation. A specific sequence of colors propagates (like mold or crystal growth) from the seed/source pixels into the adjacent fillable areas.\n4.  **Propagation Mechanics:**\n    *   The fill spreads using 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals).\n    *   The pattern sequence repeats cyclically.\n    *   The fill stops when it hits the grid boundary, a background pixel, a terminator pixel, or a pixel that has already been filled.\n    *   The original seed pixels might retain their color, be replaced by the first color of the pattern, or remain unchanged depending on the specific example's rules. Terminator pixels always seem to retain their color. Erased pixels are replaced by the background color *before* the fill starts.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Also, determine the repeating Pattern Sequence.\n2.  **Initialize** an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  **Pre-process** the output grid:\n    *   Replace any pixels matching Erased colors with the Background color.\n    *   Modify the Seed pixels in the output grid based on the specific rule for the task (e.g., keep original color, replace with pattern start color).\n4.  **Identify starting points** for the fill: find all pixels in the input grid that have the Fillable color and are 8-directionally adjacent to any pixel that had a Seed color in the original input grid.\n5.  **Perform a pattern fill** (using a method like Breadth-First Search):\n    *   Create a queue for the BFS and a set to track visited Fillable pixels.\n    *   For each identified starting point pixel: if it hasn't been visited, set its color in the output grid to the first color in the Pattern Sequence, mark it as visited, and add it to the queue.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Get the next pixel `P` from the queue.\n        *   Determine the `Next_Pattern_Color` based on the current color of `P` in the output grid and the fixed Pattern Sequence.\n        *   Examine all 8 neighbors `N` of `P`.\n        *   If a neighbor `N` is within the grid boundaries, had the Fillable color in the original input, and has not been visited:\n            *   Set the color of `N` in the output grid to `Next_Pattern_Color`.\n            *   Mark `N` as visited.\n            *   Add `N` to the queue.\n6.  **Return** the modified output grid.
