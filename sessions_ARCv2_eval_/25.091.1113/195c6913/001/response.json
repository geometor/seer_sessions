Analyze the input grid to identify key color roles:\n    - Background color: Persists, often frames the grid.\n    - Fillable color: Area to be overwritten with a pattern.\n    - Seed color(s): Initiate the pattern fill into adjacent fillable areas.\n    - Terminator color(s): Halt the pattern fill, retain their color.\n    - Erased color(s): (Optional) Replaced by background color before filling.\n    - Pattern Sequence: Repeating sequence of colors for filling.\n    (Note: In this implementation, these parameters are currently hardcoded based \n     on the analysis of training example 1. A general solution would need to \n     derive these parameters dynamically).\n2.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Pre-process the output grid:\n    - Replace any Erased colors with the Background color. (Not applicable for Ex1)\n    - Modify Seed pixels based on rules (e.g., retain color, replace with pattern start). (Retained for Ex1)\n4.  Identify starting points for the fill: Find all pixels in the input grid that have the \n    Fillable color and are 8-directionally adjacent to any Seed color pixel in the input grid.\n5.  Perform a pattern fill using Breadth-First Search (BFS):\n    - Initialize a queue with the starting points. Each element stores the pixel coordinates \n      and the index of the pattern color to be applied to its neighbors.\n    - Maintain a set of visited pixels to avoid re-processing and infinite loops.\n    - Color the initial starting points with the first color of the pattern sequence.\n    - While the queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue a pixel P and its associated 'next pattern index'.\n        - Determine the color for P's neighbors based on this index and the pattern sequence.\n        - Determine the pattern index for the *next* level of neighbors.\n        - For each 8-directional neighbor N of P:\n            - If N is within bounds, had the Fillable color in the input grid, and has not \n              been visited:\n                - Set N's color in the output grid to the determined neighbor color.\n                - Mark N as visited.\n                - Enqueue N with the calculated pattern index for the next level.\n6.  Return the modified output grid. The fill stops naturally at grid edges, Background pixels, \n    Terminator pixels, and already filled pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets coordinates of 8-directional neighbors within grid bounds.\n\n    Args:\n        r (int): Row index of the center cell.\n        c (int): Column index of the center cell.\n        height (int): Grid height.\n        width (int): Grid width.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[tuple[int, int]]: List of valid neighbor coordinates (row, col).\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Skip the center cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the pattern fill transformation to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid as a 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed grid as a 2D list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # --- Parameter Definition (Hardcoded based on analysis of train_1) ---\n    # In a general solver, these would be determined by analyzing examples.\n    fillable_color = 0       # White\n    seed_colors = {2, 8}     # Red, Azure\n    # background_color = 3     # Green (Implicitly acts as boundary)\n    # terminator_colors = {4}  # Yellow (Implicitly acts as boundary)\n    # erased_colors = set()    # None for train_1\n    pattern_sequence = [2, 2, 8] # Red, Red, Azure\n    # seed_handling = \"retain\" # For train_1, seeds keep their color and initiate fill\n\n    # --- Initialize BFS queue and visited set ---\n    # Queue stores tuples: (row, col, pattern_index_for_next_neighbor)\n    queue = deque()\n    # Visited stores (row, col) tuples of pixels whose color has been set by the fill\n    visited = set() \n    pattern_len = len(pattern_sequence)\n\n    # --- Pre-processing Step ---\n    # Placeholder: Handle Erased Colors (Replace with background)\n    # for r in range(height):\n    #     for c in range(width):\n    #         if input_np[r,c] in erased_colors:\n    #             output_grid[r,c] = background_color\n    \n    # Placeholder: Handle Seed Color Modification (e.g., replace seeds for train_3)\n    # if seed_handling == \"replace\":\n    #    start_pattern_color = pattern_sequence[0]\n    #    for r in range(height):\n    #       for c in range(width):\n    #           if input_np[r,c] in seed_colors:\n    #               output_grid[r,c] = start_pattern_color\n\n    # --- Identify Initial Fill Locations & Seed Queue ---\n    # Find fillable cells adjacent to seed cells in the original input.\n    # These are the first cells to receive the pattern color.\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell is fillable in the *input*\n            if input_np[r, c] == fillable_color:\n                is_initial_fill = False\n                # Check its neighbors in the *input* grid\n                for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n                    # If a neighbor has a seed color in the *input*\n                    if input_np[nr, nc] in seed_colors:\n                        is_initial_fill = True\n                        break # Found a seed neighbor, no need to check others\n                \n                # If it's an initial fill point and not already visited\n                if is_initial_fill and (r, c) not in visited:\n                    # Color this initial point with the first pattern color\n                    start_pattern_color = pattern_sequence[0]\n                    output_grid[r, c] = start_pattern_color\n                    visited.add((r, c))\n                    # Add to queue.
