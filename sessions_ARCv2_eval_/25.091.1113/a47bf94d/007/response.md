Transformation Rule:
1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Find all solid 3x3 squares in the *original input* grid where the color is Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), or Magenta(6). Record their top-left coordinates (r, c) and color C.
3. If no such squares are found, return the unchanged output grid copy.
4. Determine the location rule: Check if *all* identified solid squares share the same top row index r=1. If yes, the rule is 'row_move'. Otherwise, the rule is 'column_swap'.
5. For each solid 3x3 square found in the original input:
    a. Modify the *output grid* at the original location (r, c) to create a hollow 3x3 frame: change the center pixel (r+1, c+1) to White(0) and ensure the 8 surrounding perimeter pixels are set to the original color C.
    b. Determine a 'partner' color C_partner based on a swap rule: Red(2)<->Green(3), Blue(1)<->Yellow(4), Magenta(6)<->Magenta(6).
    c. Determine the top-left coordinates (new_r, new_c) for a new pattern based on the location rule:
        i. If the rule is 'row_move': new_r = 14, new_c = c.
        ii. If the rule is 'column_swap': if c == 2, set new_r = r, new_c = 15; if c == 15, set new_r = r, new_c = 2. (Assume these cover all column swap cases).
    d. Modify the *output grid* at the new location (new_r, new_c) to create a 3x3 'cross' pattern using C_partner: set pixels (new_r, new_c), (new_r, new_c+2), (new_r+1, new_c+1), (new_r+2, new_c), (new_r+2, new_c+2) to C_partner, and set the other 4 pixels within the 3x3 area to White(0). This may overwrite existing grid content.
6. Return the modified output grid.
