**General Assessment:**

The initial code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example but failed on two subsequent examples (`train_2`, `train_3`). The failures indicate a flaw in the underlying object detection (`find_objects` function) or an incomplete understanding of the transformation rule, particularly concerning Example 2. The `find_objects` function incorrectly identified objects and their dimensions, leading to incorrect application of the transformation logic. Example 2's expected output remains puzzling even after correcting the Red object's dimensions, as the target Blue object changed doesn't match the dimensions of either the Red or White input objects based on the initial rule hypothesis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Object Detection:** Replace the faulty `find_objects` function with a correct implementation for identifying contiguous blocks and their bounding box dimensions.
2.  **Verify Rule with Corrected Detection:** Re-run the logic using the corrected object detection to see if Examples 2 and 3 now produce the expected output based on the initial rule (White->Blue; Red->Matching Blue->White, else Red->White).
3.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** If discrepancies remain (especially for Example 2), re-evaluate the relationship between Red, White, and Blue objects, considering alternative properties like pixel count or positional relationships, or interactions involving the grid state *after* the White->Blue change.

**Metrics Gathering (with corrected `find_objects` logic):**

We need to re-evaluate the object properties using a corrected function.
