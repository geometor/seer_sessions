White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The key elements appear to be 3x3 squares characterized by a uniform border color and a different center color.\n3.  **Object Variations:**\n    *   Some 3x3 objects contain only the border color and the center color.\n    *   At least one example (train\\_1, middle-left) shows a 3x3 object with a uniform border, a center color, and *another* different color within the 3x3 area.\n    *   Other colored shapes exist in the grid but don't seem to be the primary focus of the transformation unless they are part of these 3x3 structures.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying these specific 3x3 objects and either:\n    *   Removing the entire 3x3 object (replacing it with the background color, white).\n    *   Modifying *only* the center pixel of the 3x3 object to a new color, leaving the border intact.\n5.  **Rule Dependency:** The decision to remove or modify, and the resulting new color in case of modification, seems to depend specifically on the combination of the border color and the original center color, as well as whether any \"extra\" colors are present within the 3x3 object.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Iterate through every possible 3x3 subgrid within the input grid by considering each pixel (excluding the last two rows and columns) as a potential top-left corner.\n3.  For each 3x3 subgrid:\n    a.  Check if the 8 border pixels all share the same single color (let's call it `BorderColor`) and if the center pixel has a different color (let's call it `CenterColor`).\n    b.  If this condition is met, identify this 3x3 subgrid as a potential `Object`.\n    c.  Examine all 9 pixels within this `Object`. Check if any pixel's color is different from both `BorderColor` and `CenterColor`.\n    d.  If such an \"extra\" color exists (making it a `Non-standard Object`), modify the *output grid* by setting all 9 pixels corresponding to this 3x3 subgrid to white (0).\n    e.  If no \"extra\" color exists (making it a `Standard Object`):\n        i.  Determine the specific action based on the pair (`BorderColor`, `CenterColor`) according to the predefined rules:\n            *   If the pair (`BorderColor`, `CenterColor`) matches one of the \"Removal Pairs\" [(1,3), (2,6), (3,2), (4,8), (4,3), (3,6), (2,9)], modify the *output grid* by setting all 9 pixels corresponding to this 3x3 subgrid to white (0).\n            *   If the pair (`BorderColor`, `CenterColor`) matches one of the \"Modification Pairs\" [(3,4), (6,1), (8,3), (1,4), (1,2), (7,4)], modify the *output grid* by changing *only* the center pixel corresponding to this `Object`'s center pixel to its associated `New Color` [2, 3, 2, 8, 9, 3, respectively].\n        ii. If a `Standard Object`'s (`BorderColor`, `CenterColor`) pair does not match any predefined rule, leave it unchanged in the output grid.\n4.  After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, return the final modified output grid. (Note: Handle potential overlaps carefully. If a pixel is part of multiple objects marked for removal or modification, the removal action on the 3x3 area should likely take precedence or the order of processing needs clarification. However, based on the examples, objects seem distinct and non-overlapping)."
