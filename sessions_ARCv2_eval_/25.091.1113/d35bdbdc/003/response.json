Non-Standard Object Rule: If a 3x3 object contains any pixel whose color is neither the BorderColor nor the CenterColor, the entire 9-pixel area of the object is removed (replaced with white, 0). (Note: This specific condition wasn't observed in training examples but is kept as a potential rule).\n2. Standard Object Rules: If a 3x3 object contains only pixels with the BorderColor or the CenterColor ('Standard Object'), the action depends on the specific pair (BorderColor, CenterColor):\n    a. Removal: If the pair matches a predefined set of 'Removal Pairs', the entire 9-pixel area is removed (replaced with white, 0).\n    b. Modification: If the pair matches a predefined set of 'Modification Pairs', only the center pixel of the object is changed to a specific 'NewCenterColor'.\n    c. No Change: If a Standard Object's pair matches neither Removal nor Modification rules, it remains unchanged.\n\nApplication Strategy:\nA two-pass approach is used:\n- First Pass: Identify all 3x3 objects that trigger a removal (either Non-Standard Objects or Standard Objects matching Removal Pairs). Mark these 9-pixel areas in a temporary boolean mask.\n- Apply Removals: Update the output grid by setting all pixels marked in the mask to white (0).\n- Second Pass: Identify all Standard Objects matching Modification Pairs. If the center pixel of such an object was *not* marked for removal in the first pass, update the center pixel in the output grid to the corresponding NewCenterColor.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Constants for Rules ---\n\n# Standard objects with these (border_color, center_color) pairs are completely removed.\nREMOVAL_PAIRS: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = {\n    (4, 2),  # Yellow border, Red center   (Rule added based on analysis)\n    (1, 3),  # Blue border, Green center\n    (2, 6),  # Red border, Magenta center\n    (3, 2),  # Green border, Red center\n    (4, 8),  # Yellow border, Azure center\n    (4, 3),  # Yellow border, Green center\n    (3, 6),  # Green border, Magenta center\n    (2, 9),  # Red border, Maroon center\n}\n\n# Standard objects with these (border_color, center_color) pairs have their center pixel modified.\n# Value is the new_center_color.\nMODIFICATION_RULES: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int] = {\n    (3, 4): 2,  # Green border, Yellow center -> Red center\n    (6, 1): 3,  # Magenta border, Blue center -> Green center\n    (8, 3): 2,  # Azure border, Green center -> Red center\n    (1, 4): 8,  # Blue border, Yellow center -> Azure center\n    (1, 2): 9,  # Blue border, Red center -> Maroon center\n    (7, 4): 3,  # Orange border, Yellow center -> Green center\n}\n\n# --- Helper Function ---\n\ndef check_3x3_object(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[int], Optional[int], bool]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the 3x3 subgrid starting at (r, c) forms a valid object based on border/center colors.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input numpy array.\n        r: Top row index.\n        c: Left column index.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple: (is_object, border_color, center_color, has_extra_color)\n        - is_object (bool): True if it matches the 3x3 border/center structure.\n        - border_color (Optional[int]): The color of the border pixels if is_object is True.\n        - center_color (Optional[int]): The color of the center pixel if is_object is True.\n        - has_extra_color (bool): True if any pixel in the 3x3 area is neither\n                                  border_color nor center_color (only relevant if is_object is True).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    # Ensure the 3x3 grid fits within bounds\n    if r + 2 >= rows or c + 2 >= cols:\n        return False, None, None, False\n\n    subgrid = grid[r:r+3, c:c+3]\n    center_color = subgrid[1, 1]\n\n    # Collect border pixels (top row, bottom row, middle-sides)\n    border_pixels = [\n        subgrid[0, 0], subgrid[0, 1], subgrid[0, 2],\n        subgrid[1, 0],                 subgrid[1, 2],\n        subgrid[2, 0], subgrid[2, 1], subgrid[2, 2]\n    ]\n\n    # Check if all border pixels are the same color\n    border_color = border_pixels[0]\n    if not all(p == border_color for p in border_pixels):\n        return False, None, None, False\n\n    # Check if center color is different from border color\n    if center_color == border_color:\n        return False, None, None, False\n\n    # Now we know it's structurally a valid object.
