task_context:
  background_color: 1 (blue)
  transformation_type: conditional based on input colors

conditions:
  - name: green_and_yellow_present
    trigger: Grid contains both color 3 (green) AND color 4 (yellow) pixels (excluding background).
    actions:
      - Identify spatial clusters of non-background pixels.
      - For each cluster:
          - Count pixels of each color (e.g., red_count, green_count, yellow_count).
          - Calculate modified counts: new_green_count = old_yellow_count, new_yellow_count = old_green_count, other counts unchanged.
          - Reconstruct cluster in output grid using modified counts.
          - Output shapes may be simplified (e.g., lines, blocks).
          - Relative spatial location of clusters is preserved (e.g., left cluster stays left).
  - name: green_and_yellow_not_both_present
    trigger: Grid does NOT contain both color 3 (green) AND color 4 (yellow) pixels simultaneously.
    actions:
      - Identify individual non-background objects (connected components of a single color).
      - Preserve the shape and color of each object.
      - Relocate objects to a new position in the output grid.
      - Relocation appears to move objects closer together, potentially towards the bottom-center/right area, maintaining approximate relative positions.

example_specifics:
  train_1_and_2:
    condition: green_and_yellow_present
    input_clusters:
      - left: 8 red pixels
      - right: 4 green, 7 yellow pixels
    output_clusters (based on swapped counts):
      - left: 8 red, 4 yellow pixels
      - right: 7 green pixels
  train_3:
    condition: green_and_yellow_not_both_present
    input_objects:
      - object_1: gray(5), specific shape, count=6
      - object_2: orange(7), specific shape, count=4
      - object_3: magenta(6), specific shape, count=4
    output_objects:
      - object_1: gray(5), same shape, count=6, relocated
      - object_2: orange(7), same shape, count=4, relocated
      - object_3: magenta(6), same shape, count=4, relocated
    relocation_effect: Objects moved generally down/right and closer together.
