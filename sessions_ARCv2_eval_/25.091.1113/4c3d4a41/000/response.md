## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (8x20). The grids appear visually divided into two sections: a left section (columns 0-8) and a right section (columns 9-19).
2.  **Left Section:** In the input grids, the left section contains scattered gray (5) pixels on a white (0) background. In the output grids, this entire left section is uniformly white (0).
3.  **Right Section:** The right section is characterized by a prominent gray (5) border outlining a rectangular area. Inside this border, various colored pixels (green=3, red=2, yellow=4, orange=7, magenta=6, azure=8) are interspersed with white (0) and sometimes gray (5) pixels.
4.  **Transformation - Left Side:** The transformation consistently clears the left section (columns 0-8) to white (0), regardless of the initial pattern of gray pixels.
5.  **Transformation - Right Side:** The transformation selectively modifies pixels *within* the gray border in the right section. The gray border itself remains unchanged. Specific color changes observed:
    *   Green (3) pixels in the input are replaced by gray (5) in the output (train\_1).
    *   Orange (7) pixels in the input are replaced by gray (5) in the output (train\_1, train\_2).
    *   Other colors present within the border (red=2, yellow=4, magenta=6, azure=8, gray=5, white=0) appear to remain unchanged in their positions.
6.  **Invariant Elements:** The overall grid dimensions, the gray border in the right section, and the positions of non-transformed pixels in the right section remain constant.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid:
  Dimensions: Fixed (8x20 for provided examples)
  Vertical_Split:
    Column_Index: 9 # Divides grid into left (0-8) and right (9-19) sections
Sections:
  - Name: Left_Section
    Columns: 0-8
    Input_Content: White background with variable gray pixel patterns
    Output_Content: Uniformly white (0)
    Action: Clear_to_White
  - Name: Right_Section
    Columns: 9-19
    Features:
      - Type: Border
        Color: Gray (5)
        Shape: Rectangle
        Location: Outlines the section
        Transformation: Invariant
      - Type: Inner_Pixels
        Location: Within the gray border
        Input_Colors: Variable set including White(0), Green(3), Red(2), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Azure(8)
        Transformation: Selective_Color_Replacement
          Rule:
            - Input_Color: Green (3)
              Output_Color: Gray (5)
            - Input_Color: Orange (7)
              Output_Color: Gray (5)
            - Input_Color: All_Others # (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
              Output_Color: Keep_Original
Relationships:
  - The transformation rule depends on the column index of the pixel.
  - The transformation in the right section only applies to specific input colors (Green and Orange).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the pixel's column index is less than 9 (i.e., it's in the left section):
    *   Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
4.  If the pixel's column index is 9 or greater (i.e., it's in the right section):
    *   Get the color of the input pixel.
    *   If the input pixel's color is green (3) or orange (7):
        *   Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
    *   Otherwise (if the color is not green or orange):
        *   Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the same color as the input pixel.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
