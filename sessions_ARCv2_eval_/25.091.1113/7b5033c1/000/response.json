The output is a 1D vertical grid (a column vector) of pixels.\n2.  **Background Color**: Each input grid seems to have a dominant color acting as a background (azure 8 in train_1, blue 1 in train_2).\n3.  **Foreground Objects**: The input contains distinct \"objects\" or contiguous blocks of pixels with colors different from the background.\n4.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to extract the colors of the foreground objects from the input and list them in the output column.\n5.  **Color Grouping**: All pixels of the same foreground color seem to be grouped together in the output.\n6.  **Ordering**: The order in which these color groups appear in the output seems determined by the position of their first appearance in the input grid when scanned row by row, top to bottom, left to right. The color encountered first (top-most, then left-most pixel of that color) appears first in the output, followed by all other pixels of that same color. Then the next color encountered in the scan order follows with all its pixels, and so on.\n7.  **Pixel Count**: The number of times a color appears in the output column corresponds exactly to the number of pixels of that color in the input grid (excluding the background color).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Keep track of the non-background colors encountered and the order in which they are *first* seen. Store this order (e.g., in a list).\n3.  **Count Pixels per Color**: For each unique non-background color found in the input grid, count the total number of pixels that have that color.\n4.  **Construct Output**: Create an empty list for the output. Iterate through the ordered list of non-background colors determined in step 2. For each color in this ordered list, append that color's value to the output list a number of times equal to its count (determined in step 3).\n5.  **Format Output**: Reshape the final list of pixel values into a single-column grid (Nx1)."
