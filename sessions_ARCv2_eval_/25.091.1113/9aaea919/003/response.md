"""
Transforms an input grid based on specific rules applied to 5-pixel objects.
1. Identifies the background color (most frequent color).
2. Creates an output grid filled with the background color.
3. Finds all connected objects of non-background colors.
4. Filters for objects consisting of exactly 5 pixels.
5. Determines the shape of each 5-pixel object ('plus' or 'horizontal_line').
6. Applies rules:
   - Removes 5-pixel horizontal lines if they are Red (2) or Green (3) by leaving them as the background color.
   - Changes the color of 5-pixel plus shapes to Gray (5) if they are Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3).
   - Keeps all other identified 5-pixel plus or horizontal line shapes unchanged (copies their original color to the output).
