The background remains unchanged. The timeout error strongly suggests that the object detection method (`_find_objects` using BFS) was too computationally expensive for the 30x30 grid size, likely due to repeated checking of pixels or inefficient traversal. The strategy should be revised to identify and process the target shapes more directly, avoiding a full connected components search for every object. An iterative approach, checking for specific patterns (plus center, line start) at each pixel, should be more efficient.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
