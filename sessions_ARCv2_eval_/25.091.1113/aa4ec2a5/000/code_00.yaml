elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with color values 0-9.
  - object: background
    color: yellow (4)
    description: The predominant color in the input grid, filling space not occupied by shapes.
  - object: shape
    color: blue (1)
    property: contiguous
    description: Regions of connected blue pixels in the input grid.
  - object: hole
    color: yellow (4)
    property: enclosed
    description: Regions of background color completely surrounded by a single blue shape in the input.
    relationship: located inside a shape.
  - object: border
    color: red (2)
    property: thickness_1px
    description: A one-pixel thick frame generated around each original blue shape in the output.
    relationship: surrounds the area of the original shape.
  - object: filled_interior
    description: The area within the border corresponding to the original blue shape.
    conditional_color:
      - condition: original shape had holes
        color: azure (8)
      - condition: original shape had no holes
        color: blue (1)
  - object: filled_hole_area
    color: magenta (6)
    description: The area within the border corresponding to the original holes (enclosed yellow pixels).
    condition: Only exists if the original shape had holes.
    relationship: located inside the filled_interior (azure).

actions:
  - identify: Find all distinct contiguous blue (1) shapes in the input grid.
  - analyze: For each blue shape, determine if it encloses any yellow (4) background pixels (holes).
  - create_border: For each identified shape, draw a red (2) border around its perimeter in the output grid.
  - fill_interior:
      if shape has holes:
        fill original blue pixel locations with azure (8).
        fill original hole locations with magenta (6).
      else:
        fill original blue pixel locations with blue (1).
  - copy_background: Preserve yellow (4) pixels from the input that are not part of any shape or its generated border.
