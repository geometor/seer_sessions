"""
The transformation identifies a background color (most frequent color) and several non-background colors forming shapes or boundaries. 
It then determines a specific 'fill color' from the non-background colors. 
This fill color expands (flood fills) into adjacent background-colored areas. 
The expansion is constrained by the grid boundaries and any other non-background colors, which act as barriers.
The final output grid shows the result of this constrained flood fill, with the original boundary colors and the expanded fill color replacing the background color in the filled regions.

The fill color appears to be the unique non-background color that has adjacent background pixels it can expand into, considering other non-background colors as impassable boundaries.
