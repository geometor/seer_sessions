facts:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - type: input/output
      - pixels: colored integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: height, width
      - aspect_ratio: derived from height and width (tall, wide, square)
  - element: delimiter
    attributes:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - shape: single-pixel-thick lines (horizontal or vertical)
      - function: separates subgrids
  - element: subgrid
    attributes:
      - content: rectangular blocks of non-magenta pixels
      - source: extracted from input grid based on delimiters
      - properties: internal pattern/shape, background color (often orange 7), dimensions (e.g., 5x5)
      - relationship: arranged in a layout (e.g., 2x2, 1xN, Nx1) in the input
  - element: process
    attributes:
      - step 1: identify delimiters and extract subgrids
      - step 2: determine reading order of subgrids (T-B, L-R)
      - step 3: determine input grid aspect ratio
      - step 4: apply transformation rule based on aspect ratio
        - if tall: stack vertically, preserve order, use horizontal delimiters
        - if wide: arrange horizontally, reverse order, use vertical delimiters
        - if square (2x2 case): stack vertically, apply specific order (TL, BR, TR, BL), use horizontal delimiters
      - step 5: construct output grid by assembling subgrids and inserting appropriate delimiters
