            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code correctly solved the square input case (Example 1) but failed on the tall and wide input cases (Examples 2 and 3). The core issue seems to be the misinterpretation of how the input grid's aspect ratio dictates the output arrangement. The results suggest that the transformation logic is not directly tied to the *overall* input aspect ratio (Height vs Width) but rather to the *orientation of the delimiter lines* within the input or the *layout* of the subgrids they define.\n\n*   **Example 2 (Input H=17, W=5):** Input is tall, delimiters are *horizontal*, defining a vertical stack (1x3 conceptually). The output requires *horizontal* arrangement, *reversed* order, and *vertical* delimiters. The original code applied the \"Tall\" rule (vertical stack, original order, horizontal delimiter), which was incorrect.\n*   **Example 3 (Input H=5, W=17):** Input is wide, delimiters are *vertical*, defining a horizontal row (3x1 conceptually). The output requires *vertical* stacking, *original* order, and *horizontal* delimiters. The original code applied the \"Wide\" rule (horizontal arrangement, reversed order, vertical delimiter), which was incorrect.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Detect the presence and orientation of delimiter lines (rows vs. columns of magenta).\n2.  Determine the implied layout of subgrids based on these delimiters (e.g., stacked vertically if only horizontal delimiters, arranged horizontally if only vertical delimiters, grid layout if both).\n3.  Apply transformation rules based on the *input delimiter orientation*:\n    *   If *only horizontal delimiters* exist (input subgrids stacked vertically): Arrange subgrids *horizontally* in the output, *reverse* their original top-to-bottom order, and use *vertical* delimiters.\n    *   If *only vertical delimiters* exist (input subgrids arranged horizontally): Stack subgrids *vertically* in the output, *preserve* their original left-to-right order, and use *horizontal* delimiters.\n    *   If *both horizontal and vertical delimiters* exist (input subgrids in a grid, e.g., 2x2): Apply the special reordering rule (TL, BR, TR, BL), stack *vertically*, and use *horizontal* delimiters.\n\nThis revised logic aligns the observed input characteristics with the required output transformations for all three examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n"
