Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors & Objects:** The grids contain pixels of various colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange). These pixels often form shapes or contiguous regions. Notably, red (2) and gray (5) pixels seem to form boundaries or outlines in some examples.
3.  **Key Transformation:** The primary difference between input and output grids is the filling of certain white (0) regions with a specific color (either yellow/4 or orange/7).
4.  **Fill Color Source:** In each example, the input grid contains exactly one pixel of either yellow (4) or orange (7). This single pixel's color dictates the color used for filling in the output grid.
    *   Example 1: Input has orange (7) at `(17, 22)`. Output fills regions with orange (7).
    *   Example 2: Input has yellow (4) at `(11, 0)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).
    *   Example 3: Input has yellow (4) at `(15, 9)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).
    *   Example 4: Input has yellow (4) at `(7, 7)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).
5.  **Regions to Fill:** The regions being filled are initially composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid. These regions appear to be "enclosed" or "bounded" by pixels of a *single* other color.
    *   In examples 2, 3, and 4, the enclosing color is red (2).
    *   In example 1, regions enclosed by red (2) *and* a region enclosed by gray (5) are filled.
6.  **Enclosure Definition:** A region of white pixels seems "enclosed" if all immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) non-white pixels belong to the *same* color. The region must be fully surrounded by this single color; touching the grid edge or multiple boundary colors means it's not filled.
7.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that are not part of these specific enclosed white regions remain unchanged from input to output.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Fill enclosed white regions with a specific color found elsewhere in the grid.
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
    - relevant_colors: [white(0), red(2), gray(5), yellow(4), orange(7)] # Colors directly involved in the core transformation.
    - background_color: white(0)

objects:
  - type: BoundaryShapes
    description: Contiguous shapes made of a single non-white color (e.g., red(2) or gray(5)).
    properties:
      - color: Uniform, non-white (observed: red(2), gray(5))
      - function: Potentially enclose regions of white(0) pixels.
  - type: EnclosedRegions
    description: Contiguous regions of white(0) pixels in the input.
    properties:
      - color: white(0)
      - relationship: Must be fully surrounded (adjacent non-diagonal cells) only by pixels of a single BoundaryShape color. Cannot touch the grid edge.
  - type: FillColorPixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid determining the fill color.
    properties:
      - color: yellow(4) or orange(7) (observed)
      - count: Exactly one instance per input grid.
      - location: Variable.

actions:
  - name: FindFillColor
    description: Identify the unique pixel in the input grid with color yellow(4) or orange(7).
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: fill_color (value 4 or 7)
  - name: IdentifyEnclosedRegions
    description: Find all connected components of white(0) pixels.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_white_regions
  - name: CheckEnclosure
    description: For each white region, verify if all its adjacent non-white neighbors have the same single color and the region does not touch the grid edge.
    inputs: white_region, input_grid
    outputs: is_enclosed (boolean), boundary_color
  - name: FillRegion
    description: Change the color of all pixels within a confirmed enclosed white region to the fill_color.
    inputs: enclosed_white_region, fill_color, output_grid
    outputs: modified_output_grid

transformation_rule:
  - Step 1: Scan the input grid to find the unique "fill color" pixel (either yellow/4 or orange/7). Store this fill color.
  - Step 2: Create a copy of the input grid as the initial output grid.
  - Step 3: Iterate through the input grid to find connected regions of white(0) pixels.
  - Step 4: For each white(0) region found, check its boundary: examine all pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the pixels in the white region.
  - Step 5: If all these boundary pixels exist (i.e., the region doesn't touch the grid edge) AND they all share the *same* single non-white color, then the region is considered "enclosed".
  - Step 6: If a white region is identified as enclosed, change the color of all pixels within that region in the output grid to the stored "fill color".
  - Step 7: Repeat steps 3-6 until all white regions have been checked.
  - Step 8: The final modified grid is the result.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Fill Color:** Scan the input grid to locate the single pixel that is either yellow (4) or orange (7). Remember this color as the `fill_color`.
3.  **Identify Potential Regions:** Find all connected components (groups) of white (0) pixels in the input grid that have not yet been processed.
4.  **Check Each Region:** For each identified white component:
    a.  Determine all pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any pixel within the white component. These are the boundary neighbors.
    b.  Check two conditions for the boundary neighbors:
        i.  Do *all* boundary neighbors have the exact same color?
        ii. Is this shared boundary color *not* white (0)?
    c.  If *both* conditions are true, then this white component is an "enclosed region".
5.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** If a white component is identified as an enclosed region, change the color of every pixel belonging to that component in the *output* grid to the `fill_color` found in Step 2. Mark this region as processed.
6.  **Repeat:** Continue identifying and checking unprocessed white components (Step 3 & 4) until none remain.
7.  **Final Output:** The modified output grid is the result.
