Scan the input grid to find the unique 'fill color' pixel (either yellow/4 or orange/7). Store this fill color.\n3. Find all connected components (regions) of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n4. For each white component:\n    a. Determine all pixels immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the component that are *not* part of the component itself. These are the boundary neighbors.\n    b. Check if the component touches the grid edge. If it does, it's not enclosed.\n    c. Check if all boundary neighbors exist and have the *exact same* non-white color.\n    d. If the component does not touch the edge AND all boundary neighbors share the same single non-white color, then this component is an \"enclosed region\".\n5. Change the color of all pixels belonging to any identified \"enclosed region\" in the *output* grid to the stored 'fill color'.\n6.
