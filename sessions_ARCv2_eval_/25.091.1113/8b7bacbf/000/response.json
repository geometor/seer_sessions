            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Colors & Objects:** The grids contain pixels of various colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, orange). These pixels often form shapes or contiguous regions. Notably, red (2) and gray (5) pixels seem to form boundaries or outlines in some examples.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The primary difference between input and output grids is the filling of certain white (0) regions with a specific color (either yellow/4 or orange/7).\n4.  **Fill Color Source:** In each example, the input grid contains exactly one pixel of either yellow (4) or orange (7). This single pixel's color dictates the color used for filling in the output grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input has orange (7) at `(17, 22)`. Output fills regions with orange (7).\n    *   Example 2: Input has yellow (4) at `(11, 0)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).\n    *   Example 3: Input has yellow (4) at `(15, 9)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).\n    *   Example 4: Input has yellow (4) at `(7, 7)`. Output fills regions with yellow (4).\n5.  **Regions to Fill:** The regions being filled are initially composed entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid. These regions appear to be \"enclosed\" or \"bounded\" by pixels of a *single* other color.\n    *   In examples 2, 3, and 4, the enclosing color is red (2).\n    *   In example 1, regions enclosed by red (2) *and* a region enclosed by gray (5) are filled.\n6.  **Enclosure Definition:** A region of white pixels seems \"enclosed\" if all immediately adjacent (up, down, left, right) non-white pixels belong to the *same* color. The region must be fully surrounded by this single color; touching the grid edge or multiple boundary colors means it's not filled.\n7.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that are not part of these specific enclosed white regions remain unchanged from input to output.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
