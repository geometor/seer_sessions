            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as a flood fill constrained by barriers. However, the previous code implementation incorrectly filled the output grid. The comparison between expected and actual outputs reveals that the code filled almost the entire grid with azure (8), while the expected output preserves the original barrier locations as white (0) and leaves internal, unreachable areas white (0).\n\nThe key mistake was likely in how the output grid was constructed during the fill process. The fill should identify *all* cells reachable from the non-barrier border cells. The final output grid should then be constructed based on this reachability information: reachable cells become azure (8), and all other cells (original barriers *and* unreachable background cells) become white (0).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-implement the flood fill (BFS) algorithm.\n2.  The BFS should start from all border cells that are *not* barriers (input value 0).\n3.  The BFS should only traverse cells that are *not* barriers (input value 0).\n4.  Maintain a set of all `reachable_locations` identified by the BFS.\n5.  After the BFS completes, construct the `output_grid`: Iterate through every cell `(r, c)`. If `(r, c)` is in the `reachable_locations` set, set `output_grid[r, c]` to azure (8). Otherwise, set `output_grid[r, c]` to white (0).\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
