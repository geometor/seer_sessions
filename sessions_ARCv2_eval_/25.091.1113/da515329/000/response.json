            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains mostly background pixels (white, 0) and a distinct shape or pattern made of azure (8) pixels. The dimensions vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Has the same dimensions as the corresponding input grid. It also contains only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The azure pattern in the output is significantly different and generally larger than the input pattern.\n3.  **Transformation:** The azure pixels in the input seem to act as barriers or \"walls\". The output grid appears to be generated by a process that fills areas of the grid with azure, starting from the borders, but is blocked by these input barriers.\n4.  **Colors:** White (0) represents empty or background space. Azure (8) in the input represents barriers. Azure (8) in the output represents areas reachable from the border without crossing a barrier. White (0) in the output represents both the original barrier locations and any background areas that were *not* reachable from the border.\n5.  **Connectivity:** The filling process seems to use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). Diagonal movement does not appear relevant for the fill propagation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all cells in the `input_grid` that contain the azure (8) color. Store their coordinates as a set called `barrier_locations`.\n3.  Create a queue data structure (e.g., FIFO) to manage cells to visit during the fill process.\n4.  Create a set data structure, `visited_locations`, to keep track of cells that have been added to the queue to prevent redundant processing.\n5.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` located on the border of the `input_grid` (where `r` is 0 or the maximum row index, or `c` is 0 or the maximum column index).\n6.  For each border cell `(r, c)`:\n    *   Check if this cell's location `(r, c)` is *not* in `barrier_locations`.\n    *   If it is not a barrier, add the location `(r, c)` to the `queue` and to the `visited_locations` set. Also, set the color of the cell `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).\n7.  While the `queue` is not empty:\n    *   Remove a location `(r, c)` from the front of the `queue`.\n    *   Examine the four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) of `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's location be `(nr, nc)`.\n    *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:\n        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.\n        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` has not already been added to `visited_locations`.\n        *   Verify that `(nr, nc)` is *not* in the `barrier_locations` set.\n        *   If all these conditions are true:\n            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `queue`.\n            *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the `visited_locations` set.\n            *   Set the color of the cell `(nr, nc)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).\n8.  After the `queue` is empty, the `output_grid` contains the final pattern. Return the `output_grid`."
