            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core mechanism as a flood fill originating from the borders and constrained by azure (8) barriers. However, it misinterpreted the final output representation. The failed examples show that the goal is not to color the *reachable* areas azure, but rather to color the *unreachable* areas azure. The areas reachable by the flood fill from the white (0) border cells should become white (0) in the output, and all other cells (original barriers and initially white cells enclosed by barriers) should become azure (8).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Perform the flood fill (BFS) starting from all white (0) border cells, traversing only through other white (0) cells. Keep track of all visited (reachable) cells.\n2.  Create the output grid. Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the grid.\n3.  If cell `(r, c)` was *visited* during the flood fill, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to white (0).\n4.  If cell `(r, c)` was *not* visited (meaning it was either an original barrier or an unreachable white cell), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to azure (8).\n\n**Metrics Analysis:**\n\nThe following metrics were derived by simulating the flood fill from white border cells (as described in the strategy) and comparing the set of *unvisited* cells to the azure cells in the expected output for each training example.\n"
