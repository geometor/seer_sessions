            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis was incorrect. The previous code assumed a flood fill starting from the *white* border cells, using the input azure cells as barriers. The results clearly show this leads to overfilling the grid with azure.\n\nThe key insight from reviewing the failed examples is that the output pattern seems to represent the areas *unreachable* from the initial azure cells, while staying within the grid boundaries. The white areas in the output correspond precisely to the original azure input cells *plus* all the white input cells that can be reached from those initial azure cells via 4-way adjacency without crossing the grid border.\n\nThe strategy is to reverse the logic:\n1.  Identify the starting points: these are the azure (8) cells in the input grid.\n2.  Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from these azure cells.\n3.  The fill should only propagate into adjacent *white* (0) cells within the grid boundaries.\n4.  Keep track of all cells visited during this fill (both the initial azure cells and the reachable white cells).\n5.  Construct the output grid: Mark all *unvisited* cells as azure (8) and all *visited* cells as white (0).\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between input azure cells, reachable white cells, and the output grid for `train_1`.\n"

Filling from the input azure cells into adjacent white cells visits *all* cells in the grid, resulting in an entirely white output grid according to the proposed logic (visited = white, unvisited = azure). This also does not match the expected outputs.\n\nLet's rethink the interaction between the fill and the borders/barriers.\n\nMaybe the fill *does* start from the border, but the *input azure cells* define areas that are *protected* from the fill?\n\nConsider `train_1`:\nInput has an azure cross. Output has azure everywhere *except* the original cross locations and the central white square enclosed by the cross.\n\nNew Hypothesis 3:\n1.  Start a flood fill from *all* white (0) cells on the border of the *input* grid.\n2.  The fill can propagate to adjacent (4-way) white (0) cells only.\n3.  The fill *cannot* enter cells that were originally azure (8) in the input. These azure cells act as barriers.\n4.  Mark all cells visited by this fill process.\n5.  Create the output grid:\n    *   Cells that were visited by the fill become azure (8) in the output.\n    *   Cells that were *not* visited (either because they were original barriers or because they were white cells enclosed by barriers) become white (0) in the output.\n\nThis seems identical to the *first* hypothesis, which produced the incorrect code. Why did that code fail? Let's re-examine the first code's output for `train_1`:\n\nExpected Output:\n"

While these seem equivalent *if* the only non-zero input color is 8, relying on the pre-computed set might have masked an error or led to slightly different behavior than intended.
