The transformation uses the locations of the marker pixels as anchors to replicate the pattern object onto the output grid. The original pattern and marker pixels are effectively replaced by the stamped copies. The background color persists in the output where no pattern is stamped.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
