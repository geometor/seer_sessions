**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** All input grids appear to be composed of four equal-sized quadrants.
2.  **Quadrant Roles:** The transformation primarily involves the bottom-left (BL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants. The top quadrants (TL, TR) seem irrelevant for the main pattern generation in most cases, although they might influence output size or framing in specific instances (like potentially Ex 3's output size).
3.  **Content Types:** Quadrants contain either solid blocks of a single color or patterns involving multiple colors (including the background color, white/0). Patterns include stripes, checkerboards, frames, and more complex arrangements.
4.  **Transformation Core:** The core logic involves selecting content/color from one or both bottom quadrants (BL, BR) and combining or modifying them based on whether they are solid colors or patterns.
5.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is constructed based on the interaction between BL and BR. This can involve:
    *   Directly copying a quadrant (Ex 4).
    *   Replacing the background of one quadrant's pattern with the solid color of the other (Ex 1, Ex 3).
    *   Using one quadrant as a mask or stencil over a tiled version of the
