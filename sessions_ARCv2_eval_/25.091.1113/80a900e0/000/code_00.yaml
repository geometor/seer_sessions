elements:
  - type: background
    properties:
      colors: [white, blue]
      pattern: checkerboard
      role: canvas, potentially overwritten
  - type: foreground_pixel
    properties:
      colors: [red, green, yellow, azure] # Colors other than background
      role: can be static or source of projection, can act as obstacle
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      content: background pattern and foreground pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - type: blocking
    description: >
      Foreground pixels present in the input grid block the diagonal projection
      of other colors if they lie on the projection path.
actions:
  - name: copy_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: initial_output_grid
  - name: identify_sources
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates and colors for non-background pixels
  - name: project_color
    input: source_pixel (coordinate, color), input_grid, output_grid
    condition: color is red, yellow, or azure
    effect: >
      Modifies output_grid by coloring background pixels along a diagonal path
      starting from the source_pixel's location + 1 step, according to color-specific direction.
      Projection stops at grid boundary or when the next cell in the path corresponds
      to a non-background pixel in the input_grid.
    parameters:
      direction:
        red: up-left (dr=-1, dc=-1)
        yellow: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
        azure: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
rules:
  - >
    Static pixels (green) remain unchanged in the output grid and act as obstacles.
  - >
    Projecting pixels (red, yellow, azure) remain unchanged in the output grid
    but also generate projection rays.
  - >
    Projection only overwrites pixels that were originally background colors (white or blue).
