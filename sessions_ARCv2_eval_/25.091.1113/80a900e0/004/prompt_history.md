Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Background:** Both input and output grids feature a consistent checkerboard pattern using white (0) and blue (1) pixels. This pattern forms the background canvas.
2.  **Foreground Objects/Pixels:** Scattered within the checkerboard are pixels of other colors: azure (8) and green (3) in the first example, and red (2), green (3), and yellow (4) in the second. These appear as individual pixels or small clusters.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves certain foreground colors "projecting" or "radiating" diagonally from their original positions. The background checkerboard pattern is overwritten by this projection, but only where the projection path encounters background pixels.
4.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**
    *   **Green (3):** Pixels of this color appear static; they remain in their original positions in the output and do not project. They also act as barriers, stopping the projection of other colors.
    *   **Azure (8) and Yellow (4):** These colors project diagonally downwards and to the left (row increases, column decreases).
    *   **Red (2):** This color projects diagonally upwards and to the left (row decreases, column decreases).
5.  **Projection Rules:**
    *   Projection originates from the location of each source pixel (azure, yellow, red) in the *input* grid.
    *   The projection ray continues in its specific diagonal direction, step by step.
    *   At each step, the target cell is checked in the *input* grid:
        *   If the target cell is outside the grid boundaries, the projection stops.
        *   If the target cell contains *any* non-background color (anything other than white-0 or blue-1) in the *input* grid, the projection stops *before* reaching that cell.
        *   If the target cell contains a background color (white-0 or blue-1) in the *input* grid, that cell in the *output* grid is colored with the projecting color.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input. Then, the background cells along the valid projection paths are colored according to the rules above. Original non-background pixels (including the sources and static green pixels) retain their positions and colors.

**Facts**

    effect: >
      Modifies output_grid by coloring background pixels along a diagonal path
      starting from the source_pixel's location + 1 step, according to color-specific direction.
      Projection stops at grid boundary or when the next cell in the path corresponds
      to a non-background pixel in the input_grid.
    parameters:
      direction:
        red: up-left (dr=-1, dc=-1)
        yellow: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
        azure: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)
rules:
  - >
    Static pixels (green) remain unchanged in the output grid and act as obstacles.
  - >
    Projecting pixels (red, yellow, azure) remain unchanged in the output grid
    but also generate projection rays.
  - >
    Projection only overwrites pixels that were originally background colors (white or blue).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-background pixels (colors other than white-0 and blue-1) in the input grid. Store their locations (row, column) and colors. These are potential sources and obstacles.
3.  Iterate through each identified non-background pixel (let's call it the `source_pixel`) from the input grid.
4.  Determine the projection behavior based on the `source_pixel`'s color:
    *   If the color is green (3), do nothing further for this pixel (it's static).
    *   If the color is red (2), set the projection direction to up-left (change in row = -1, change in column = -1).
    *   If the color is yellow (4) or azure (8), set the projection direction to down-left (change in row = +1, change in column = -1).
5.  If the `source_pixel`'s color requires projection (red, yellow, or azure):
    a.  Initialize the current position `(curr_row, curr_col)` to the `source_pixel`'s location.
    b.  Start a loop for projection steps:
        i.  Calculate the next position `(next_row, next_col)` by adding the determined directional changes to `(curr_row, curr_col)`.
        ii. Check boundary conditions: If `next_row` or `next_col` is outside the grid dimensions, stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iii. Check for obstacles: Look up the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid*. If this color is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1), stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.
        iv. If the checks pass (within bounds and the target cell in the input is background), update the *output grid* at `(next_row, next_col)` with the `source_pixel`'s color.
        v.  Update the current position: `curr_row = next_row`, `curr_col = next_col`.
        vi. Continue the loop (go back to step 5.b.i).
6.  After iterating through all initial non-background pixels, the modified output grid is the final result.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid based on diagonal projection rules for specific colors.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all non-background pixels (colors other than white-0 and blue-1) 
   in the input grid. These are potential sources or obstacles.
3. Iterate through each identified non-background source pixel from the input grid.
4. Determine the projection direction based on the source pixel's color:
    - Red (2): Projects diagonally up-left (row decreases, column decreases).
    - Yellow (4) and Azure (8): Project diagonally down-left (row increases, column decreases).
    - Green (3): Does not project; it's static but acts as an obstacle.
5. For projecting colors (Red, Yellow, Azure):
    a. Start from the cell diagonally adjacent to the source pixel in the determined direction.
    b. Continue projecting step-by-step in the same diagonal direction.
    c. At each step, check the corresponding cell in the *original input grid*:
        i. If the cell is outside the grid boundaries, stop projection.
        ii. If the cell contains a non-background color (any color except 0 or 1), 
           stop projection *before* coloring this cell.
        iii. If the cell contains a background color (0 or 1), color the 
            corresponding cell in the *output grid* with the source pixel's color.
    d. Update the current position and repeat step 5.c.
6. Pixels that are sources of projection or static (green) retain their original 
   color and position in the output grid.
7. Return the final modified output grid.
