            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because its interpretation of the projection rule was slightly incorrect. It stopped projection whenever the next cell in the *input* grid contained *any* non-background color. The analysis of the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs revealed that projection should only be stopped by grid boundaries or by encountering a *specific* static obstacle color (green-3) in the input grid. Projections *can* pass through the original location of other *projecting* colors (red-2, yellow-4, azure-8), but only color the output cell if that cell was originally a background color (white-0 or blue-1).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the projection logic:\n1.  Identify all non-background source pixels in the input.\n2.  For each source pixel, determine its projection direction (or lack thereof for green).\n3.  Trace the projection path step-by-step diagonally.\n4.  At each step, check for stopping conditions:\n    *   Is the next position outside the grid? -> Stop projection.\n    *   Does the input grid at the next position contain green (3)? -> Stop projection.\n5.  If projection does not stop, check if the input grid at the next position contains a background color (0 or 1). If yes, update the corresponding cell in the *output* grid with the projecting color.\n6.  Continue tracing the projection path from the new position, regardless of whether the cell was colored or not in the previous step (unless a stop condition was met).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the previous execution results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 14\n    *   Cause: Projection stopped prematurely when the path encountered the original location of *any* non-background pixel in the input, instead of only stopping for green (3) pixels or grid boundaries. Cells that should have been colored by projection (because they were background in the input and not blocked by green) remained as background.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 50\n    *   Cause: Same as Example 1. Both red (up-left) and yellow (down-left) projections were shorter than expected because they were incorrectly blocked by other red/yellow/azure pixels in the input grid along their paths.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Define the static obstacle color: green (3).\n4.  Define the projecting colors and their directions:\n    *   Red (2): Up-left (row change -1, column change -1)\n    *   Yellow (4): Down-left (row change +1, column change -1)\n    *   Azure (8): Down-left (row change +1, column change -1)\n5.  Identify all pixels in the *input grid* that are not background colors. Store their locations (row, column) and colors.\n6.  Iterate through each identified non-background pixel (the `source_pixel`) from step 5.\n7.  If the `source_pixel`'s color is green (3), do nothing further for this pixel and proceed to the next one.\n8.  If the `source_pixel`'s color is one of the projecting colors (red, yellow, or azure):\n    a.  Determine the row change (`dr`) and column change (`dc`) based on the color's projection direction.\n    b.  Initialize the current position `(curr_row, curr_col)` to the `source_pixel`'s location `(r, c)`.\n    c.  Start a loop to trace the projection path:\n        i.  Calculate the next potential position `(next_row, next_col)` by adding `(dr, dc)` to `(curr_row, curr_col)`.\n        ii. Check boundary conditions: If `next_row` or `next_col` is outside the grid dimensions, stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.\n        iii. Check for static obstacle: Look up the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid*. If this color is green (3), stop the projection loop for this `source_pixel`.\n        iv. Check if the target cell was originally background: If the color of the cell at `(next_row, next_col)` in the *original input grid* is one of the background colors (0 or 1), then update the *output grid* at `(next_row, next_col)` to be the `source_pixel`'s color.\n        v.  Update the current position for the next iteration: `curr_row = next_row`, `curr_col = next_col`.\n        vi. Continue the loop (go back to step 8.c.i).\n9.  After iterating through all initial non-background pixels, the potentially modified output grid is the final result."
