Define background colors (0: white, 1: blue) and the static obstacle color (3: green).\n3. Define projecting colors and their directions:\n    - Red (2): Up-left (dr=-1, dc=-1)\n    - Yellow (4) and Azure (8): Down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1)\n4. Identify all non-background pixels in the input grid as potential sources.\n5. Iterate through each source pixel:\n    a. Skip green pixels (they are static obstacles only).\n    b. Determine the projection direction (dr, dc) for red, yellow, or azure.\n    c. Trace a path starting from the source pixel's location.\n    d. In each step along the path:\n        i. Calculate the next position (next_r, next_c).\n        ii. Check for stop conditions:\n            - If (next_r, next_c) is out of grid bounds, stop projecting for this source.\n            - If the input grid color at (next_r, next_c) is green (3), stop projecting.\n        iii. Check for coloring condition:\n            - If the input grid color at (next_r, next_c) is a background color (0 or 1), set the output grid color at (next_r, next_c) to the source pixel's color.\n        iv. Update the current position to (next_r, next_c) and continue tracing.\n6.
