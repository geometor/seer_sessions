task_context:
  description: "Fill horizontal gaps of exactly three background pixels between two pixels of the same non-background color."
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: Identified as the most frequent color in the input grid.
    - foreground_colors: Any color that is not the background color.
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_background: Boolean, true if the pixel color matches the grid's background color.
  - type: Horizontal_Pattern
    definition: A sequence of five horizontally adjacent pixels within a single row.
    pattern_of_interest: "C B B B C"
      - C: A specific foreground (non-background) color.
      - B: The background color.
      - constraint: The color C must be the same at both ends of the pattern.
actions:
  - name: Identify Background Color
    input: Input grid
    output: The most frequent color value (background color)
  - name: Scan Rows Horizontally
    input: Input grid
    process: Iterate through each row from left to right.
  - name: Detect Pattern
    input: Current row scan position
    process: Check if the sequence of five pixels starting at the current position matches the "C B B B C" pattern, using the identified background color for B and any non-background color for C.
  - name: Fill Gap
    input: Detected pattern "C B B B C" at position (row, col)
    output: Modified grid
    process: Change the color of the pixels at (row, col+1), (row, col+2), and (row, col+3) to color C.
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally if they are in the same row and their column indices differ by 1.
  - type: Pattern Matching
    description: The transformation is triggered by the specific horizontal sequence "C B B B C".
final_state:
  grid: The output grid is a copy of the input grid, modified by applying the "Fill Gap" action wherever the "C B B B C" pattern was detected.
