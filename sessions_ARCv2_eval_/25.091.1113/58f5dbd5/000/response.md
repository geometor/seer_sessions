Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (azure '8' in Ex1, yellow '4' in Ex2, blue '1' in Ex3) that forms a border and fills empty space.
2.  **Objects:** Embedded within the background are multiple distinct objects, each composed of a contiguous block of a single non-background color.
3.  **Object Types:** The objects appear to fall into two categories:
    *   **Solid Rectangles:** Objects whose bounding box contains *only* pixels of the object's color. (e.g., the blue '1', magenta '6', and bottom-right yellow '4' in Ex1; blue '1', red '2', green '3' in Ex2; azure '8', top-left yellow '4', left green '3', bottom-left maroon '9' in Ex3).
    *   **Non-Solid Objects:** Objects whose bounding box contains pixels of the background color (i.e., they have "holes" or are not perfectly rectangular fills). (e.g., the top-left yellow '4', green '3', maroon '9', gray '5' in Ex1; magenta '6', azure '8', maroon '9' in Ex2; red '2', orange '7', middle maroon '9', gray '5', bottom azure '8', bottom magenta '6', bottom-right yellow '4', bottom-right green '3' in Ex3).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation filters the objects, keeping *only* the "Solid Rectangles".
5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid contains the selected solid rectangles, preserving their relative positions. The grid is cropped to the minimum bounding box required to contain all selected objects, plus a one-pixel border of the original background color.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Filter objects in a grid, keeping only solid rectangles, and crop the output grid around the kept objects with a border.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
  - background_color: The color that forms the border and fills the space between objects. It is typically the most frequent color or the color at the grid corners.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object.
  - solid_rectangle: An object where every pixel within its bounding box has the object's color (no background pixels within the bounding box).

input_elements:
  - grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - background: The background color pixel value.
  - objects: Multiple distinct objects of various colors and shapes embedded in the background.

output_elements:
  - grid: A potentially smaller 2D array of pixels.
  - background: The same background color as the input.
  - objects: A subset of the input objects, specifically only the solid rectangles.

transformation_steps:
  - 1. Identify the background color.
  - 2. Find all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
  - 3. For each object:
      - a. Determine its color.
      - b. Calculate its bounding box.
      - c. Check if it's a solid rectangle (all pixels within the bounding box match the object's color).
  - 4. Filter the objects, selecting only the solid rectangles.
  - 5. Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all selected solid rectangles.
  - 6. Extract the subgrid from the input corresponding to this minimal bounding box.
  - 7. Create the output grid, sized to fit the extracted subgrid plus a 1-pixel border on all sides.
  - 8. Fill the output grid border with the background color.
  - 9. Place the extracted subgrid into the center of the output grid.

relationships:
  - Objects are distinct from the background.
  - Objects are classified based on whether they form a solid rectangle within their bounding box.
  - The output grid's content is a cropped section of the input grid.
  - The output grid's size depends on the spatial extent of the selected solid rectangles.
  - The relative positions of the selected objects are preserved from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color of the input grid (usually the color at the corners or the most frequent color).
2.  Locate all separate, contiguous groups of non-background colored pixels (these are the objects).
3.  For each object found:
    a.  Determine its color and find its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing it).
    b.  Check if the object completely fills its bounding box with its own color. If any pixel within the bounding box has the background color, the object is *not* solid. Otherwise, it *is* a solid rectangle.
4.  Create a list of only the objects identified as solid rectangles.
5.  Find the overall minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column occupied by any pixel belonging to *any* of the solid rectangles identified in step 4. This defines the minimal bounding box containing all relevant objects.
6.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid defined by this overall bounding box (from the minimum row/column to the maximum row/column found in step 5).
7.  Construct the output grid. Its height will be the height of the extracted subgrid plus 2, and its width will be the width of the extracted subgrid plus 2.
8.  Fill the outermost border (top/bottom rows, left/right columns) of the output grid with the background color identified in step 1.
9.  Copy the extracted subgrid (from step 6) into the center of the output grid (starting at row 1, column 1).
