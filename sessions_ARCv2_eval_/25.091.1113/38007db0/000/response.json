            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input examples feature a larger grid divided into smaller, equally sized square subgrids by lines of a single color (blue `1` in `train_1`, green `3` in `train_2`). These dividing lines are one pixel thick.\n2.  **Subgrids:** These subgrids act as containers for patterns. In both examples, the subgrids including their borders are 7x7 pixels.\n3.  **Patterns:** Inside each 7x7 subgrid, there's an internal 5x5 area where a distinct pattern resides. These patterns are composed of two colors: the subgrid's background color (magenta `6` in `train_1`, yellow `4` in `train_2`) and a pattern color (yellow `4` in `train_1`, blue `1` in `train_2`).\n4.  **Arrangement:**\n    *   `train_1` input: A 3x3 arrangement of 7x7 subgrids.\n    *   `train_2` input: A 3x4 arrangement of 7x7 subgrids.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the height of the input grid and the vertical grid structure (the horizontal dividing lines). However, the output width is reduced to accommodate only *one* column of subgrids (7 pixels wide).\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves selecting *one* specific subgrid from each *row* of subgrids in the input and arranging these selected subgrids vertically in the output.\n7.  **Selection Criterion:** The subgrid selected from each input row appears to be the one containing a pattern that is *unique* within that row. If all patterns in a row are identical, the first pattern from that row is selected.\n    *   In `train_1`, row 1 has two 'C' shapes and one 'O-like' shape; the 'O-like' one is selected. Row 2 has two 'C' shapes and one 'backward C'; the 'backward C' is selected. Row 3 has a 'C', a 'backward C', and an 'O-missing-middle'; the 'O-missing-middle' is selected.\n    *   In `train_2`, row 1 has four identical 'H' shapes; the first one is selected. Row 2 has one 'C' shape and three 'H' shapes; the 'C' shape is selected. Row 3 has three 'H' shapes and one 'different' shape; the 'different' shape is selected.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify the color and locations of the grid lines that divide the input into a matrix of smaller, equally-sized subgrids. Determine the dimensions of these subgrids (e.g., 7x7).\n2.  **Extract Subgrids:** Extract each subgrid from the input grid based on the identified structure. Store these subgrids, maintaining their original row and column position.\n3.  **Process Rows:** Iterate through each row of subgrids identified in the previous step.\n4.  **Compare Patterns within Row:** For the current row of subgrids, compare the patterns contained within them. Two patterns are considered identical if the subgrids are pixel-for-pixel identical.\n5.  **Identify Unique/First Pattern:** Count the occurrences of each distinct pattern within the current row.\n    *   If one pattern occurs exactly once, identify the subgrid containing this unique pattern as the \"selected subgrid\" for this row.\n    *   If all patterns in the row are identical (i.e., only one distinct pattern exists, and it occurs multiple times), identify the first subgrid (leftmost) in that row as the \"selected subgrid\".\n6.  **Store Selected Subgrids:** Keep track of the selected subgrid for each row.\n7.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input grid but with a width equal to the width of a single subgrid.\n8.  **Populate Output Grid:** Place the selected subgrids vertically into the output grid, preserving their original row position and maintaining the original grid line structure (horizontal lines and the left/right borders). The final output will be a single column of the selected subgrids."
