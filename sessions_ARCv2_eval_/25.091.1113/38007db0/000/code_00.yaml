task_description: Identify and extract unique patterns from rows of subgrids within a larger grid.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - composed_of: subgrids arranged in rows and columns
    - separated_by: single-pixel-thick grid lines of a uniform color (frame_color)
    - contains: N rows and M columns of subgrids

subgrid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: fixed size (e.g., 7x7 in examples)
    - contains:
        - outer_border: 1 pixel thick, same color as grid lines (frame_color)
        - inner_area: contains a pattern
          - pattern_background_color: uniform color within the subgrid (bg_color)
          - pattern_foreground_color: color forming the specific shape (fg_color)
          - pattern_dimensions: fixed size (e.g., 5x5 in examples)

patterns:
  properties:
    - defined_by: the arrangement of pattern_foreground_color pixels within the inner area of a subgrid
    - comparison: patterns within the same row of subgrids in the input are compared for uniqueness

transformation:
  action: select_subgrid_per_row
  criterion:
    - IF: one subgrid's pattern is unique within its input row
      THEN: select that unique subgrid
    - ELSE IF: all subgrid patterns in the input row are identical
      THEN: select the first subgrid in that row
  output_construction:
    - vertically stack the selected subgrids, maintaining the original vertical spacing and frame color
    - output_dimensions: same height as input, width equal to one subgrid's width

colors:
  - frame_color: color of the grid lines and subgrid outer borders (e.g., blue `1`, green `3`)
  - bg_color: background color within the pattern area (e.g., magenta `6`, yellow `4`)
  - fg_color: color making the pattern shape (e.g., yellow `4`, blue `1`)
