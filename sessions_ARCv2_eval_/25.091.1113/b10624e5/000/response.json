            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both examples use a 27x27 grid. The background is predominantly yellow (4). There is a central vertical blue (1) line at column 13 and a central horizontal blue (1) line at row 13. These lines divide the grid into four quadrants.\n2.  **Objects**: Various shapes and patterns (\"objects\") composed of different colors (red, green, azure, maroon, blue) exist within the yellow background, primarily located off the blue axes. Some objects span multiple cells and can be composed of multiple colors.\n3.  **Transformation**: Comparing the input and output grids, the core transformation appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirroring) across the central vertical blue line (column 13). Objects originally on the left side appear on the right side in the output, and vice-versa. The reflection preserves the row position but inverts the column position relative to the central axis.\n4.  **Invariance**: The central vertical and horizontal blue lines remain unchanged in their positions and color. The overall grid dimensions also remain the same.\n5.  **Mechanism**: The color of each pixel in the output grid seems determined by the color of the pixel at the symmetrically opposite horizontal position in the input grid, relative to the central vertical axis. Specifically, the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output takes its value from the pixel at `(row, 26 - col)` in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
