Okay, I will analyze the provided training examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both examples use a 27x27 grid. The background is predominantly yellow (4). There is a central vertical blue (1) line at column 13 and a central horizontal blue (1) line at row 13. These lines divide the grid into four quadrants.
2.  **Objects**: Various shapes and patterns ("objects") composed of different colors (red, green, azure, maroon, blue) exist within the yellow background, primarily located off the blue axes. Some objects span multiple cells and can be composed of multiple colors.
3.  **Transformation**: Comparing the input and output grids, the core transformation appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirroring) across the central vertical blue line (column 13). Objects originally on the left side appear on the right side in the output, and vice-versa. The reflection preserves the row position but inverts the column position relative to the central axis.
4.  **Invariance**: The central vertical and horizontal blue lines remain unchanged in their positions and color. The overall grid dimensions also remain the same.
5.  **Mechanism**: The color of each pixel in the output grid seems determined by the color of the pixel at the symmetrically opposite horizontal position in the input grid, relative to the central vertical axis. Specifically, the pixel at `(row, col)` in the output takes its value from the pixel at `(row, 26 - col)` in the input.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - width: 27
  - height: 27
  - background_color: 4 # yellow
  - axes:
      - orientation: vertical
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based column index
      - orientation: horizontal
        color: 1 # blue
        index: 13 # zero-based row index

objects:
  - description: Contiguous areas of pixels with colors other than the background (yellow, 4) or axes (blue, 1).
  - location: Distributed across the grid, off the main axes.
  - properties: Vary in shape, size, and color composition between examples.

transformation:
  - type: reflection
  - axis_of_reflection: vertical
  - axis_location: column 13 (zero-based index)
  - rule: The pixel value at output coordinate (row, col) is determined by the pixel value at input coordinate (row, 26 - col).
  - invariant_elements:
      - Grid dimensions
      - Central vertical blue axis (col 13)
      - Central horizontal blue axis (row 13)
      # Note: The background color (yellow, 4) is not strictly invariant,
      # as it can be overwritten by a reflected object pixel.
      # However, areas that are background in both the original and reflected position remain background.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (27x27).
2.  For each cell in the input grid, identified by its `row` and `column` index (zero-based):
    a.  Determine the source color from the input grid at `(row, column)`.
    b.  Calculate the target `column_reflected` index using the formula: `column_reflected = 26 - column`.
    c.  Place the source color into the output grid at the position `(row, column_reflected)`.
3.  Return the completed output grid.
