"""
Transforms the input grid by copying its left half (including the central vertical column) 
to the output grid's left half, and then reflecting the input grid's left half 
(excluding the central column) onto the output grid's right half. The original content 
of the input grid's right half is discarded. Assumes the grid has an odd number of columns 
so there is a unique central column.
