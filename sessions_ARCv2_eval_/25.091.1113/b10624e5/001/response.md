"""
Reflects the input grid horizontally across its central vertical axis.
The value of a pixel at coordinate (row, col) in the output grid is 
taken from the value of the pixel at coordinate (row, width - 1 - col) 
in the input grid. The central vertical and horizontal axes (if present
and identifiable by a consistent color like blue in the examples) 
remain in place, as the reflection maps them onto themselves.
