**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis of a simple horizontal reflection across the entire grid was incorrect. The results indicate that the transformation involves preserving the left side of the input grid and using a reflection of the *left* side to create the *right* side of the output grid. The original content on the right side of the input grid is disregarded.

The strategy is to refine the understanding of the transformation by:
1.  Confirming the grid structure and identifying the central vertical axis.
2.  Analyzing the relationship between the input's left half and the output's left and right halves separately.
3.  Updating the description (facts and natural language program) to reflect a copy-and-reflect mechanism based on the left half of the input.
