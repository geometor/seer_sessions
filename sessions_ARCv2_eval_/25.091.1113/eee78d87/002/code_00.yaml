task_context:
  description: Creates a patterned 16x16 output grid based on the input grid's colors. The background pattern depends on the specific minority color present. A fixed shape is overlaid if the input contains more than one color.
  input_grid_size: Variable (6x6 in examples)
  output_grid_size: Fixed (16x16)

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - colors: Contains a dominant color and potentially one minority color.
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently (Orange=7 in examples). Let this be D.
      - minority_color: The color that is not the dominant color. Let this be M. Can be None if the grid is monochromatic. (Green=3, Blue=1, Magenta=6 in examples).
      - is_monochromatic: Boolean flag, true if only one color is present.

  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - size: 16x16
      - background_pattern:
          description: A grid pattern determined by the dominant input color (D) and white (0), based on the minority input color (M).
          rule: Determined by M.
            - If M = 3 (Green) or M is None: Cell(r,c) = 0 if r%3==0 or c%3==0 else D. (Pattern 1)
            - If M = 1 (Blue): Cell(r,c) = D if r%3==0 or c%3==0 else 0. (Pattern 2)
            - If M = 6 (Magenta): Use Pattern 1 rule if column_block_index (c//3) is even, use Pattern 2 rule if column_block_index is odd. (Pattern 3)
      - overlay_shape:
          description: A fixed shape made of maroon (9) pixels, overlaid only if the input grid is not monochromatic.
          shape_name: Blocky 'H'
          color: Maroon (9)
          coordinates: Fixed set of (row, col) pairs: [(5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (10, 9)]
          condition: Applied only if minority_color is not None.

actions:
  - action: analyze_input_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color_value (D), minority_color_value (M), is_monochromatic_flag
    description: Find the most frequent color (D) and the other color (M). If only one color exists, M is None and is_monochromatic is true.

  - action: create_background_grid
    input: dominant_color_value (D), minority_color_value (M)
    output: initial_output_grid (16x16)
    description: Generate a 16x16 grid based on the background pattern rules associated with M (or the default Pattern 1 if M is None).

  - action: overlay_H_shape_conditionally
    input: initial_output_grid, is_monochromatic_flag
    output: final_output_grid
    description: If is_monochromatic_flag is false, change the pixels at the predefined 'H' coordinates in the initial_output_grid to maroon (9). Otherwise, return the initial_output_grid unchanged.

relationships:
  - relationship: background_pattern_determination
    from: input_grid (dominant color D, minority color M)
    to: output_grid (background_pattern cells)
    rule: Specific pattern function selected based on value of M.
  - relationship: overlay_trigger
    from: input_grid (is_monochromatic flag)
    to: output_grid (inclusion of the maroon 'H' overlay)
