task_context:
  description: Creates a patterned 16x16 output grid based on the input grid's colors. A fixed shape is overlaid if the input contains more than one color.
  input_grid_size: Fixed (6x6 in examples, but rule seems general)
  output_grid_size: Fixed (16x16)

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - colors: Contains a dominant background color and potentially other colors forming small shapes.
      - dominant_color: The color that appears most frequently. (Orange=7 in examples)
      - minority_colors_present: Boolean flag indicating if any color other than the dominant one exists.

  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - size: 16x16
      - background_pattern:
          description: A grid pattern determined by the dominant input color (D) and white (0).
          rule: Cell (r, c) is 0 if r % 3 == 0 or c % 3 == 0, otherwise it is D.
      - overlay_shape:
          description: A fixed shape made of maroon (9) pixels.
          shape_name: Blocky 'H'
          color: Maroon (9)
          coordinates: Fixed set of (row, col) pairs relative to the top-left (0,0) of the output grid.
            # [(5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (10, 9)]

actions:
  - action: determine_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color_value (D)
    description: Find the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.

  - action: create_background_grid
    input: dominant_color_value (D)
    output: initial_output_grid (16x16)
    description: Generate a 16x16 grid where cell (r, c) is 0 if r % 3 == 0 or c % 3 == 0, else D.

  - action: check_for_minority_colors
    input: input_grid, dominant_color_value (D)
    output: boolean_flag
    description: Check if any pixel in the input grid has a color different from D.

  - action: overlay_H_shape
    input: initial_output_grid, boolean_flag
    output: final_output_grid
    description: If the boolean_flag is true, change the pixels at the predefined 'H' coordinates in the initial_output_grid to maroon (9). Otherwise, return the initial_output_grid unchanged.

  - relationship: overlay_trigger
    from: input_grid (presence of any non-dominant color)
    to: output_grid (inclusion of the maroon 'H' overlay)
