            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are 6x6, while the output grids are always 16x16.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Inputs use orange (7) as a background and feature small shapes made of green (3), blue (1), or magenta (6).\n    *   Outputs use white (0), orange (7), and maroon (9).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has a very regular structure.\n    *   There's a background grid pattern composed of white (0) lines and cells filled with the dominant color from the input (orange=7 in all examples). Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are all white. Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are all white. The remaining cells form 2x2 blocks filled with the dominant input color.\n    *   Superimposed on this background grid, there is a fixed shape made of maroon (9) pixels. This shape looks like a blocky 'H'.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The background grid's colored cells (the non-white ones) take their color from the most frequent color (dominant color) in the input grid. In all training examples, this is orange (7).\n    *   The presence of *any* non-dominant color pixels in the input grid seems to trigger the appearance of the fixed maroon 'H' shape in the output. The specific non-dominant color (green, blue, magenta) or its shape in the input does not affect the output pattern or the 'H' shape.\n    *   If the input grid consisted solely of the dominant color, it's inferred that the output would only contain the background grid pattern (white and the dominant color), without the maroon 'H'.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Create a new 16x16 grid, initially empty or filled with a placeholder.\n3.  Generate the background pattern for the output grid: Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) from (0,0) to (15,15). If `r` modulo 3 is 0, OR `c` modulo 3 is 0, set the cell value to 0 (white). Otherwise, set the cell value to the dominant color `D`.\n4.  Check if the input grid contains any pixel whose color is *not* equal to the dominant color `D`.\n5.  If such pixels exist (i.e., the input grid has more than one color), modify the generated output grid by overlaying a fixed maroon (9) 'H' shape. Set the value of the cells at the specific coordinates corresponding to the 'H' shape to 9. The coordinates for the 'H' shape are: `(5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 6), (10, 9)`.\n6.  If no such pixels exist (i.e., the input grid is monochromatic), make no further changes to the grid generated in step 3.\n7.  The final modified (or unmodified in the monochromatic case) grid is the result."
