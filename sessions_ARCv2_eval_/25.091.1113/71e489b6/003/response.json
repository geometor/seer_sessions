Identify black pixels (0) in the input grid that are *not* part of any 2x2 square composed entirely of black pixels. These are considered 'trigger pixels'.\n2. A black pixel at (r, c) is part of a 2x2 black square if itself and its neighbors at (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1) are all black (within bounds), OR similar checks for the other three 2x2 squares anchored at (r, c).\n3. For each identified trigger pixel, change the color of its neighboring blue (1) pixels (within the 3x3 area centered on the trigger pixel) to orange (7) in the output grid.\n4. The trigger black pixel itself remains black.\n5. All other pixels (non-trigger black pixels, blue pixels not adjacent to a trigger pixel, etc.) retain their original color from the input grid. Overlapping changes from multiple trigger pixels are cumulative (a blue pixel adjacent to two trigger pixels becomes orange).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _is_part_of_2x2_black(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the black pixel at (r, c) is part of any 2x2 black square.\n    Assumes grid[r, c] is already confirmed to be black (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Check the four possible 2x2 squares where (r, c) could be the top-left,\n    # top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner.\n\n    # Check if (r, c) is top-left of a 2x2 square\n    if r + 1 < rows and c + 1 < cols and \\\n       grid[r+1, c] == 0 and grid[r, c+1] == 0 and grid[r+1, c+1] == 0:\n        return True\n        \n    # Check if (r, c) is top-right of a 2x2 square\n    if r + 1 < rows and c - 1 >= 0 and \\\n       grid[r+1, c] == 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 0 and grid[r+1, c-1] == 0:\n        return True\n        \n    # Check if (r, c) is bottom-left of a 2x2 square\n    if r - 1 >= 0 and c + 1 < cols and \\\n       grid[r-1, c] == 0 and grid[r, c+1] == 0 and grid[r-1, c+1] == 0:\n        return True\n        \n    # Check if (r, c) is bottom-right of a 2x2 square\n    if r - 1 >= 0 and c - 1 >= 0 and \\\n       grid[r-1, c] == 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 0 and grid[r-1, c-1] == 0:\n        return True\n        \n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = input_np.copy()\n    \n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n    trigger_pixels = []\n\n    # Step 1: Identify all trigger pixels\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the pixel is black\n            if input_np[r, c] == 0:\n                # Check if it's NOT part of a 2x2 black square\n                if not _is_part_of_2x2_black(input_np, r, c):\n                    trigger_pixels.append((r, c))\n\n    # Step 2: Apply transformations based on trigger pixels\n    for r, c in trigger_pixels:\n        # Iterate through the 8 neighbors of the trigger pixel\n        for dr in range(-1, 2):\n            for dc in range(-1, 2):\n                # Skip the center pixel itself\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Check if the neighbor in the *input* grid is blue (1)\n                    if input_np[nr, nc] == 1:\n                        # Change the color in the *output* grid to orange (7)\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 7\n                        \n    # Return the modified grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
