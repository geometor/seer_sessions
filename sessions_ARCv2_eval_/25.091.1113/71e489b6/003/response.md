"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
1. Identify black pixels (0) in the input grid that are *not* part of any 2x2 square composed entirely of black pixels. These are considered 'trigger pixels'.
2. A black pixel at (r, c) is part of a 2x2 black square if itself and its neighbors at (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1) are all black (within bounds), OR similar checks for the other three 2x2 squares anchored at (r, c).
3. For each identified trigger pixel, change the color of its neighboring blue (1) pixels (within the 3x3 area centered on the trigger pixel) to orange (7) in the output grid.
4. The trigger black pixel itself remains black.
5. All other pixels (non-trigger black pixels, blue pixels not adjacent to a trigger pixel, etc.) retain their original color from the input grid. Overlapping changes from multiple trigger pixels are cumulative (a blue pixel adjacent to two trigger pixels becomes orange).
