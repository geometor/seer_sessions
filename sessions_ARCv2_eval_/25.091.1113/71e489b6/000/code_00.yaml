task_elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer from 0-9 (black=0, blue=1, orange=7 used here).
      - location: (row, column) coordinates.
      - neighbors: 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals).
objects:
  - object: background
    pixels: Mostly composed of blue (1) pixels, forming large contiguous areas.
  - object: isolated_defects
    pixels: Single black (0) pixels located within the blue background areas.
    condition: Must be completely surrounded (8 neighbors) by blue (1) pixels.
  - object: non_isolated_defects
    pixels: Black (0) pixels that are adjacent to other black pixels, black pixels at the grid edge, or black pixels not completely surrounded by blue pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify_isolated_defects
    description: Iterate through the input grid to find black (0) pixels where all 8 neighbors are blue (1).
  - action: apply_color_change
    description: For each identified isolated defect pixel at (r, c), change the color of its neighboring pixels within the 3x3 area centered at (r, c) from blue (1) to orange (7) in the output grid.
    target_pixels: Pixels at (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1).
    condition_for_change: The target pixel must exist within the grid boundaries and must be blue (1) in the input grid.
    unaffected_pixel: The central isolated defect pixel at (r, c) retains its black (0) color.
relationships:
  - relationship: neighborhood
    description: The transformation depends on the colors of the 8 pixels immediately surrounding a central black pixel.
  - relationship: input_output_mapping
    description: The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. Modifications (blue to orange) are applied based on the identified isolated defects. Pixels not part of the 3x3 modification zone around an isolated defect retain their original color.
