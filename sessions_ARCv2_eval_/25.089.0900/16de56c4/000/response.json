            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of colored pixels. The size varies between examples.\n2.  **Input Features:** Inputs contain sparsely distributed non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9) on a white background (color 0). Some inputs feature single pixels, while others have horizontal pairs or short segments of identical colors. The distribution and colors of pixels, especially in the last row, seem significant.\n3.  **Output Features:** Outputs are generally transformations of the input grids. Two distinct transformation patterns emerge:\n    *   **Horizontal Line Filling (Example 1):** Existing horizontal segments or pairs of points in a row are extended or filled to form longer horizontal lines. The color and extent of the filled line depend on the original pixels in that row and potentially the overall grid content.\n    *   **Vertical Line Drawing (Examples 2 & 3):** Vertical lines spanning the entire height of the grid are drawn. The position and color of these vertical lines are determined solely by the non-white pixels present in the *last row* of the input grid.\n4.  **Key Distinction:** The structure of the *last row* appears to determine which transformation type is applied. Specifically, the presence (Example 1) or absence (Examples 2 & 3) of adjacent, identical, non-white pixels in the last row seems to be the trigger.\n5.  **Anomaly:** In Example 1, row 1's transformation (adding a single blue pixel at column 6) doesn't perfectly fit the derived horizontal filling rule that applies to other rows in that example.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
