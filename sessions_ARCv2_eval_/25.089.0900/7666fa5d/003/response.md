"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying enclosed background regions and filling them.
The transformation works as follows:
1. Identify the background color (azure, 8) and boundary colors (any other color present in the input).
2. Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all background pixels located on the grid's border.
3. This flood fill only propagates through adjacent background pixels. Boundary pixels act as barriers.
4. Keep track of all background pixels reached by this flood fill (the 'exterior' background pixels).
5. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6. Iterate through the grid. Any pixel that was originally the background color but was *not* reached by the flood fill (i.e., it's an 'interior' background pixel enclosed by boundaries) is changed to the fill color (red, 2).
7. All other pixels (boundary pixels and exterior background pixels) retain their original color.
