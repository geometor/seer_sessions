            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a simple transposition was incorrect. While the output grid dimensions are sometimes consistent with transposition (swapping rows and columns), the pixel values within the grid do not follow a simple transposition rule. All examples failed to match the expected output, although the size was correct in all cases. This suggests the core logic needs significant revision. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully compare each input and expected output, paying close attention to the color and position of each pixel. Look for patterns beyond simple transposition, maybe a combination or modified version of it.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify if we can think of blocks of colour as \"objects\", and if these \"objects\" are subject to certain manipulations.\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the re-examination, formulate a new hypothesis and describe it in a natural language program. It might not be a single, well-known operation.\n4. **Metrics for verification**: use tool execution to look at the number of pixels that were off, and see if there's a pattern to it.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nLet's start by switching rows and columns of the input and see how that compares to the expected output and the current code's result.\n\n"
