  The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by
  substituting pixel values based on a one-to-one mapping.  The grids
  are of uniform size and shape within each example.
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integer values representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: constant within each example
      - width: constant within each example
      - cell_values: integers between 0 and 9 inclusive
actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Each pixel value in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding value in the output grid.

      The mapping is consistent across all examples. Input values map to specific, unique output values, and vice-versa.
mapping:
    3: 4
    1: 5
    2: 6
    8: 9
    5: 1
    6: 2
    9: 8
    4: 3
