Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   **Objects:** Non-zero pixels seem to be the primary objects.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves a change in the grid's structure, suggesting some form of object interaction, duplication, or movement. The zeros seem like a background.\n*   **Symmetry:** A vertical symmetry or reflection seems relevant based on a casual observation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
