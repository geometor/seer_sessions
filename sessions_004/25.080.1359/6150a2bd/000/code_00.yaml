objects:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width (same for input and output).
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.

actions:
  - reordering:  Elements in the grid are rearranged.
  - transposition: rows become columns and columns become rows (90 degree clockwise rotation).

relationships:
  - input_grid: The initial state of the grid.
  - output_grid: The transformed state of the grid.
  - element_mapping:  Each element in the input grid maps to a specific position in the output grid.
 -  row_inversion: row order is reversed - top input row is the bottom output row
