facts:
  - observation: "Each input and output is a 3x3 grid."
  - observation: "Pixels maintain their values/colors during transformation."
  - observation: "The transformation involves a change in pixel positions."
  - hypothesis: "The transformation might be a 90-degree clockwise rotation."
  - hypothesis: "The Transformation is a reflection, either horizontal or vertical."
  - evidence_for_rotation: "train_1 shows a rotation of the maroon '9' and white '0' areas"
  - evidence_for_rotation: "train_3 also demonstrates clear 90 degree rotation"
  - evidence_against_180_rotation: "train_2 shows that the center is invariant, not a 180 rotation."
  - action: "Pixels are rearranged in the output grid."
  - relationship: "input grid maps to output grid via position changes."
