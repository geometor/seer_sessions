facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: Grid dimensions are preserved during transformation.
  - observation: Digits represent colors.
  - observation: Contiguous pixels of the same color form implicit objects.
  - action: The input grid's values and their relative positions are mirrored and inverted.
  - relationship: Input[i, j] maps to Output[height - 1 - i, width - 1 - j] where height and width are the dimensions of the grid, and i, j are the row and column indices, respectively.
