## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, and 3x2 to 3x3 in the second.) The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or color changes based on neighboring pixels. Instead, the entire grid seems to be re-arranged. The order seems very specific. It appears input is rotated and flipped, and pixel values are remapped.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        height:  # Varies, determined from input
        width:  # Varies, determined from input

transformations:
  - rotation: input is rotated, possibly counter clock wise 90 degrees, 180, or 270
  - flip: input is possibly flipped verticaly or horizontally, possibly before and/or after the rotation
  - remap: a many to one relationship from input pixels to output pixels, potentially following a pattern

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid:  The transformation rule defines this mapping.
  - color_mapping:  Each integer corresponds to a specific color.
  - spatial_rearrangement:  Pixel positions change in a structured way (rotation/reflection).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate/Flip:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise *and then* is reflected vertically. Another way to consider is that the input grid is transposed across it's top-left to bottom-right diagonal.
2.  **Remap Pixels:** The values of the input grid map the the values of the output grid.
3. The combined operations in steps 1 and 2 create the transformation.

Here is the remapping for example 1:


```
3 -> 8
8 -> 3
7 -> 7
5 -> 5
0 -> 0
```


Here is the remapping for example 2:


```
5 -> 2
2 -> 5
1 -> 1
0 -> 0
```


The remapping is many-to-one.
