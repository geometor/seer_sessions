observations:
  - object: non-white pixel
    properties:
      color: value of the pixel (1-9)
      location: (row, column)
    actions:
      - draw_diagonal:
        description: Extends a diagonal line in four directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) from the pixel's location.
        properties:
          color: Same as the original pixel's color.
          length: distance of the diagonal line
  - grid:
    properties:
      dimensions: (rows, columns)
    actions: []

transformation_rule:
  description: >
    For each non-white pixel in the input grid, draw a diagonal cross centered
    on that pixel in the output grid using the same color. The cross is
    formed by extending lines diagonally.
