      - pixels: The set of (row, col) coordinates belonging to the region.

actions:
  - name: FillZero
    description: Replaces zero-valued pixels with the color of the surrounding object.

      - target: A pixel with a value of 0.
      - context: The 8 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    logic:
      - Determine the colors of all non-zero neighbors.
      - If only one color is in neighbors: replace the zero with this value.
