objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        height: variable (constrained by examples)
        width: variable (constrained by examples)
        rows: list of rows

actions:
  - reorder_rows:
      description: Reorders the rows of the input grid based on a specific rule.
      details: It appears the order of rows is reversed, and each row is also reversed

relationships:
  - input_output_grid_dimensions: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - element_preservation: "The set of elements in the input grid is the same as the set of elements in the output grid (colors are preserved)."
