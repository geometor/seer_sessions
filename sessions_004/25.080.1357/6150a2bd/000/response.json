The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a mirroring or rotation. The colors/digits themselves are preserved, but their positions change. The height of the output grid appears to be equivalent to the height of the input grid, and similarly for the width.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
