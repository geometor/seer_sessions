task_description: |
  The task involves rearranging the pixels of a grid. The transformation maintains the dimensions of the grid.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: digits (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns (same as input_grid)
      - values: digits (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: row
    type: 1D array

actions:
    - name: transpose
      description: order of elements in rows is reversed

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - input_grid and output_grid contains same set of unique digits, in other words color counts are same.

transformations:
  - name: row_rearrangement
    description: The rows of the input grid are reordered and/or transposed to form the output grid.
    details: |
        Spefically,
        1. the last input row becomes first output row.
        2. the first input row become last output row, and
        3. the middle row is transposed i.e. values are placed in reverse order.
