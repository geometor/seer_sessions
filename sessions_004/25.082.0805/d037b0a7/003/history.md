Okay, here's a breakdown of the information and a plan to address the errors in the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the rightmost non-zero pixel in each row, it incorrectly filled *all* cells below and to the left of that pixel with the identified color. The actual transformation rule is more nuanced: it propagates the rightmost non-zero pixel's value *downwards* in subsequent rows, but *only within the column of that pixel and to the left up to the first non zero pixel*. The left bound should be the first non-zero pixel.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the observed behavior in *all* examples, not just the first. Specifically, clarify the filling boundaries.
2.  **Gather Metrics about the results:** Use a code to analyze the input, output and prediction to identify more precisely what is not matching.
3.  **Update the code.** modify the code to match the refined natural language program and test it.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

We need more specific data about the errors. Here's a python tool to give us this info:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    errors = np.where(expected_output != transformed_output)
    error_coords = list(zip(errors[0], errors[1]))
    
    print(f"Error Coordinates: {error_coords}")

    for row, col in error_coords:
        print(f"  At ({row}, {col}): Expected={expected_output[row, col]}, Got={transformed_output[row, col]}")

examples = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]],
        "transformed": [[0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]],
        "transformed": [[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]],
        "transformed": [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0]]
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    analyze_results(example["input"], example["expected"], example["transformed"])
    print("-" * 20)

```

  At (1, 0): Expected=0, Got=6
  At (1, 1): Expected=4, Got=6
  At (2, 0): Expected=3, Got=6
  At (2, 1): Expected=4, Got=6
--------------------
Example 2:
Error Coordinates: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1))]
  At (1, 0): Expected=7, Got=2
  At (2, 0): Expected=7, Got=8
  At (2, 1): Expected=2, Got=8

Example 3:
Error Coordinates: [(np.int64(2), np.int64(0))]
  At (2, 0): Expected=4, Got=2

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each row in the input grid contains zero or more '0' (white) pixels and potentially one or more non-zero colored pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The primary objects are pixels within a 2D grid.  Each pixel has a color (represented by an integer).
  - action: |
      The rightmost non-zero pixel in each row is identified.
  - propagation: |
      The color of the identified pixel is propagated downwards in subsequent rows.
  - constraint: |
      Propagation is limited to the column of the identified pixel and the columns to its *left until a non zero pixel*.
  - boundary_condition: |
     The propagation only affects rows *below* the row where the rightmost non-zero pixel was found.
  - input_output_relation: |
      The output grid is a modified version of the input grid where pixel colors have been propagated based on the stated rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid, starting from the top (row 0).
2.  For each row, **find** the rightmost non-zero pixel.
3.  If a rightmost non-zero pixel is found in a row:
    *   **Iterate** through the rows *below* the current row.
    *   For each lower row, **fill** the cell in the same column as the identified rightmost non-zero pixel with that pixel's color.
    * **Propagate** the color to the left within the lower row, stopping if another non-zero pixel is encountered or the beginning of the row is reach.
4.  If a row does not have a non-zero pixel do not fill.
5.  If a row has a non-zero pixel at the start do not change.
