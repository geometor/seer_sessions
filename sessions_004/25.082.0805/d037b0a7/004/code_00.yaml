objects:
  - name: rightmost_pixel
    description: The rightmost non-zero pixel in each row.
    properties:
      value: int  # The color value of the pixel.
      row: int    # The row index.
      col: int    # The column index.

actions:
  - name: propagate
    subject: rightmost_pixel
    description: Propagate the value of the rightmost pixel.
    steps:
      - action: move_down
        description: Move to the next row, same column.
        condition: Current row is less than the last row.
      - action: fill_down
        description: Set the pixel value to the rightmost_pixel's value.
      - action: move_left
        description: Move to the previous column in the current row.
        condition: Current column is greater than 0 AND the original input pixel at this location was 0.
      - action: fill_left
        description: Set the pixel value to the rightmost_pixel's value.
      - action: repeat
        description: Repeat move_left and fill_left until the condition is false.
      - action: repeat_all
        description: repeat move_down, fill_down, and the leftward fill sequence until the move_down condition is false.
    stopping_condition: "Propagation stops when moving down reaches the last row or when moving left encounters a non-zero pixel *in the original input grid*."
