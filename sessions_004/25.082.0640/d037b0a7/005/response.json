These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Propagation with Precedence:**\n    *   Each seed pixel attempts to propagate its value in two directions: *downwards* in its column and *rightwards* in its row.\n    *   **Downward propagation takes precedence.**\n    *   **Downward Propagation:** A seed pixel's value propagates downwards to all cells in the same column until either:\n        *   It reaches the bottom of the grid.\n        *   It encounters a cell that *already has a value* resulting from any other downward propagation.\n    *   **Rightward Propagation:** A seed pixel's value propagates rightwards to all cells in the same row until either:\n        * It reaches the right edge of the grid\n        * It is blocked because the cell below that has already been filled by a downward propagation\n\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. The propagation rules modify the output grid, filling cells below and to the right of each seed pixel, respecting the precedence and stopping conditions. The original seed pixel values are preserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_nonzero_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of all non-zero pixels in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid != 0)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    # get non-zero pixels\n    nonzero_pixels = get_nonzero_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # if no non-zero pixels, return original grid\n    if not nonzero_pixels:\n      return output_grid\n\n    # Propagate downwards first (higher precedence)\n    for r, c in nonzero_pixels:\n        val = input_grid[r,c]\n        # Propagate down\n        for i in range(r + 1, height):\n            if output_grid[i, c] != 0 and (i,c) not in nonzero_pixels: # Check if another downward prop already filled this cell\n              break  #stop the downward prop if it hit a filled cell\n            output_grid[i, c] = val\n\n    # Propagate rightwards (lower precedence)\n    for r, c in nonzero_pixels:\n        val = input_grid[r, c]\n\n        # Propagate right\n        for j in range(c + 1, width):\n          if output_grid[r,j] == 0:\n            output_grid[r, j] = val\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
