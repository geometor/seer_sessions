Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.
*   Each grid contains single-digit integers representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair, but may vary between different pairs.
*   The arrangement of numbers (colors) changes from the input to the output grid. It appears to be a rearrangement rather than a mathematical operation on the numbers themselves.
*	The transformation appears to be a rotation, specifically by 180 degrees.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of integers.
  - type: integers
    description: Integers represent colors.
  - type: dimensions
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearrangement of elements.
  - type: rotation
    description: output is what you would get by rotating the input 180 degrees.
  - type: observation
    descriptiion: The size of the grids are the same.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input grid is rotated by 180 degrees.
2.  The rotated grid becomes the output grid.

Essentially, the output grid is an upside-down and mirrored version of the input grid. Each element retains it's original value(color), only it's coordinates(position in array) changes.
