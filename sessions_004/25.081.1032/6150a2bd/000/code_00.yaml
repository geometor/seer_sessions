facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Each cell in the grid contains a single-digit integer (0-9).
  - observation: The transformation rearranges the cell values within the grid.
  - observation: The transformation does not introduce new numbers or change existing numbers' values.
  - relationship: output grid appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the input, similar to a combined rotation and reflection.
  - object: grid_cells - properties: value(int 0-9), row_index, col_index
  - action: rearrange-cells: The transformation rearranges the grid cells as an action.
