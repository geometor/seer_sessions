actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid

    output: subgrid (3x3)
    description: Takes the top-left 3x3 portion of the input grid.

  - name: transform_pixels
    input:
        - input_grid #need the entire input grid to get the location of color 9
        - subgrid #3x3 area derived from input grid
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Within the 3x3 subgrid, replaces pixels with the value 9 (maroon) in the
      input grid with the value 2 (red) in the output_grid. All other cells
      in the 3x3 subgrid are 0.
