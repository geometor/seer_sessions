The output is a single integer for each input grid. The grids themselves contain single-digit integers, which likely correspond to colors (as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`). A key observation is the consistent pattern in all input grids: they all appear to be symmetrical, either vertically, horizontally, or both. This suggests that the transformation might involve counting something related to symmetry or the number of non-zero elements that are not on the center cross.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
