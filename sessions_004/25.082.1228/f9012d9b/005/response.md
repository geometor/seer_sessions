1.  **Identify Input Grid Dimensions and Colors:** Determine the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid and the unique colors present.

2.  **Analyze for Subgrids:** Examine the input grid for repeating subgrids of various sizes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, and 2x2).

3.  **Identify Repeating Pattern:** Find if output exists as subgrid in Input grid

4.  **Determine Output Grid:**
    - If the output grid exists as a subgrid in the input, return.

5. **Return the output**
