      Gray pixels change based on adjacency to white pixels:
      1. If vertically adjacent to white, become red (2).
      2. Otherwise, if horizontally adjacent to white, become yellow (4).
      3. Otherwise, if diagonally adjacent to white, become green (3).
      4. Otherwise, remain green(3).
