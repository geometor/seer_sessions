The digits/colors used in the output (2, 3, and 4) are consistent.\n*   **Transformation:**  The transformation seems to involve a direct mapping of specific input colors to specific output colors. The position of the colors within the grid seems irrelevant. The size of grid is same for input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
