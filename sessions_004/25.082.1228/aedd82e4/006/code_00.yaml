        description: Select a single pixel within each red block to be changed.
        rule: >
          If a block has only one pixel, that pixel is the target.  If the block
          spans multiple rows and columns, the target pixel becomes the lowest, right-most
          pixel of the block. If there are multiple disjoint blocks, each
          block is processed independently.

        description: Change the color of the target pixel from red to blue.
