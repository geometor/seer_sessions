The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The transformation seems to involve replacing a subset of colors with the color gray (5), while other colors remain unchanged. The selection of which colors to change isn't immediately obvious and seems to depend on the spatial arrangement of the colors. Specifically it affects 7 and not other numbers.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
