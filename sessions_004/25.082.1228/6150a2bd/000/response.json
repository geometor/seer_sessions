The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example, and 3x2 on the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitution; instead, the positions of the numbers (pixels) are changing. It appears to be some kind of rotation or reflection, combined with a reordering or sorting.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
