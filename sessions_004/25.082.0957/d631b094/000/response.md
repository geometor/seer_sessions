Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into a smaller grid. The output grid's dimensions and content seem directly related to the non-zero elements present in the input grid. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grid appear to be irrelevant or act as a background. The core operation seems to be extracting and potentially replicating the non-zero values. The number of times each non zero number is repeated seem to be how many times it exists on the diagonals.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: variable
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - non_zero_elements:
      type: list
      elements: single-digit integers (1-9) from input_grid

properties:
  - input_grid_values: values present in the input grid
  - output_grid_values: values present in the output grid
  - count: number of occurrences of non-zero elements along diagonals

actions:
  - extraction: identify and extract non-zero elements from the input grid.
  - replication: repeat non-zero elements.
  - construction: form the output grid using the replicated elements.

relationships:
  - input_to_output_size: output grid size is determined by the number of non-zero and how often it is in diagonals elements in the input grid.
  - input_to_output_content: output grid content consists of the replicated non-zero elements from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements:** Scan the input grid and identify all non-zero elements.
2. **Count Diagonal Occurrences:** For each non-zero element, count how many times it occurs in any diagonal.
3. **Construct Output:** Create a new output grid. For each identified non-zero value, add that value to the array as many times as the occurrences.
