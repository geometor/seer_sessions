The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are 0 (white), 4 (yellow), and 2 (red).  The transformation seems to involve removing isolated color pixels that are surrounded by white pixels.  A key characteristic appears to be the preservation of contiguous blocks of the same non-white color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
