The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0 and 1 in the first two examples, 0 and 3 in the third). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the values while leaving others untouched. The core challenge is to identify the rule governing which values change and which remain the same. There seems to be a spatial/positional aspect, where parts of an object become uncolored and others are not.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
