facts:
  - object: digit_run
    description: A consecutive sequence of identical digits.
    properties:
      - value: The digit composing the run (0-9).
      - length: The number of digits in the run.
      - start_index: The index of the first digit in the run.
      - end_index: The index of the last digit in the run.
      - bounded_by_zeros: True if the run is immediately preceded and followed by zeros, or by the beginning/end of the sequence if the first/last element is non-zero.

  - action: remove_run
    description: Removes a digit run from the sequence.
    conditions:
      - The run's value is not zero.
      - The run is bounded_by_zeros.
      - The length of the run is 1

  - action: keep_run
    description: keep a digit run in the sequence
    conditions:
      - The run is bounded by zeros and has length > 1
      - the runs value is zero
