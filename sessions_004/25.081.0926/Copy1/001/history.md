Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and determine the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9).
*   **Output:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels, with the same dimensions (height and width) doubled compared to the input grid.
*   **Colors:** The input grids contain a primary color (3 in the first example, 2 in the second, and 4 in the third) and black (0). These colors are preserved in the output.
*   **Pattern:** The input pattern appears to be repeated four times in a 2x2 arrangement within the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer] # Set of colors present in the grid
      - dimensions: [height, width]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer] # Set of colors present in the grid
      - dimensions: [height, width]

actions:
  - name: duplicate_and_expand
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Duplicates the input grid both horizontally and vertically.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is formed by a 2x2 tiling of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Obtain Input:** Get the input grid, its dimensions, and the colors it contains.
2.  **Double Dimensions:** Create a new output grid with twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
3. **Copy and Tile:** Copy the entire input grid and paste it into:
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.
4.  **Return Output:** The output grid is the result.

In essence, the transformation rule is to take the input grid and create a new grid that's twice as large in both dimensions, by tiling the original input grid four times in a 2x2 pattern.
