            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed with the concept of replicating objects, primarily focusing on horizontal and vertical replication. It also included special handling for single-cell objects of colors 3 (green) and 6 (magenta). However, the test results on the second example show that the replication logic and single-cell handling are not entirely correct and need adjustments. The first example failed because it added extra copies to all the objects. The second example failed as it did not replicate all objects as needed, specifically, single cell objects of color 3, and it also seems that some replications missed by one position.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Replication:** Correct the existing logic to accurately replicate objects to adjacent empty spaces in the input data, both horizontally and vertically.\n2.  **Adjust Single-Cell Object Handling**: Revisit the `expand_single_cell_objects` to ensure correct expansion, considering the specific rules and variations in the examples.\n3.  **Unified approach.** Consider objects of single cells as no different to other objects - ie. all objects are treated the same\n4.  **Eliminate Hardcoding:** Where possible, remove the special cases for color and shape.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using code execution where needed)**\n\nLet's perform some more analysis of the errors and determine the properties of the task.\n\nFirst, an overall summary, then metrics for each task\n\n"
