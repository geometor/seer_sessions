Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code failed to accurately capture the transformation rule. The core issue is that the code duplicates and shifts the last two columns of *every* object, regardless of their position or context. It seems the rule is more selective, only applying the duplication to specific object *parts*, or maybe not all objects. Additionally, it looks like objects might expand or influence adjacent blank spaces, depending on the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each example, paying close attention to *which* parts of the objects are duplicated and shifted, not just that duplication occurs. Focus on how the shape changes.
2.  **Identify Object Parts/Conditions:** Determine if there are specific conditions (object shape, position, adjacency to other objects or the border, color) that trigger the duplication.
3.  **Refine Object Definition:** It will be useful to update the definition of object and consider if that will help.
4.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the more nuanced rule.
5.  **Update and Test Code:** Modify the code to reflect the revised program, and test it against all examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use the `get_objects` function to analyze the objects present in the examples and see how they are changed in the expected output. I don't need to do this for the code's transformed output because the function is applied consistently; the problem is with how the `transform` function uses object information, not the object definition itself *per se*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero (non-white) pixels.
2.  **Conditional Duplication:**
    *   In Example 1: If an object spans multiple rows and its shape is not simply vertical, then it may be targeted for action. The object with color 2 is targeted. Duplicate the entire targeted object, and position the copy so its left-most edge aligns with the left most edge of any other object in the input grid. The duplicated object will overlap any existing object.
    *  In Example 2: Single pixel objects are duplicated *horizontally* to fill available empty (0-colored) spaces that are adjacent to an existing object. The duplicated pixels of an object are of the same color and always adjacent.

3. **Preservation:**  The original objects are mostly preserved (though they can be overlapped). Only in Example 2 are new objects created through expansion into blank spaces.

This natural language program is significantly more complex than the original, as it requires distinguishing different types of duplication based on object characteristics. It also includes the critical observation about *where* the duplicated parts are placed, which was entirely missed in the first attempt.
