Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were too specific, focusing only on immediate right-neighbor relationships and specific color combinations (green-orange, blue-blue). The second example reveals a different pattern, and the first example transformation wasn't completely right. The core idea of looking at neighbors is correct, but the conditions and actions need to be generalized. We need to account for cases where an object "fills in" adjacent black pixels based on an apparent continuation or line.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze both examples, paying attention to *all* color changes, not just the ones the previous code targeted. Focus on how black pixels seem to be replaced. Look for patterns where adjacent pixels are influencing pixel transformations.
2.  **Gather Metrics:** Quantify the errors. Determine precisely which pixels are incorrect and try to find a pattern in these errors.
3.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML with more general observations, moving away from specific color-to-color rules. Think about "object continuation" or line following.
4.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to describe a more general rule that works for both examples (and potentially others). Focus on relative positions and not solely colors.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze Errors**

I'll start with the first example and check differences:

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Lines:** Examine the grid and identify "lines" of pixels. A line is a set of adjacent pixels of the same color, either horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Black Pixel Replacement:** If a black pixel is immediately to the right of a colored line, and a different colored line exist to the right of this black pixel, then the color of the black pixel is conditionally updated.
3.  **Conditional update:** The color to update with matches the color of the line to the left of the black pixel.
