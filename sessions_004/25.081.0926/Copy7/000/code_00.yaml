facts:
  - observation: Input and output are rectangular grids of integers (colors).
  - observation: The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
  - object_type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-color pixels
      - position: row and column indices
    actions:
      - change_color: Some pixels within color blocks change color.
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: Color changes occur adjacent to specific colors.
  - observation: "train_1 shows orange pixels adjacent to where the green color is added"
  - observation: "train_2 shows blue pixels adjacent to where the blue color is added"
