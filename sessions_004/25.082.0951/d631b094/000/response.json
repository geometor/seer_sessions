The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grids seem to have a common structure: a single non-zero color embedded within a field of zeros. The output grids appear to be related to the non-zero color in the input grid, and its position. The output grid is smaller than the input grid. The output size seems to be correlated to the number of the single non-zero color pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The length of new grid is equal to number of non-zero color in input. Fill the output grid entirely with the identified non-zero color.\n\nEssentially the rule consolidates or extracts the non-zero color and creates a dense, filled grid of only that color. The new grid size seems to equal to how many pixels had that color in original grid.\n"
