    description: The single color value in the input grid that is not 0 (black).
  - property: count
    description: The number of times the non_black_color appears in the input grid.
  - transformation: output_dimensions
    description: >
      The output grid's dimensions are determined by the 'count' of the
      non-black color.
      - If count is 1, output is 1x1.
      - If count is 2, output is 1x2.
      - If count is 3, output is 1x3.
      - If count is 4, output is 2x2.
  - transformation: output_filling
    description: The output grid is entirely filled with the non_black_color.
