The input grids always have a black (0) background.  A single non-black color appears in the input grid, forming different shapes or in different positions. The output grid consists only of the non-black color from the input, and its size seems related to the number of instances of that color in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If count is 1, make the output a 1 x 1 array; if count is 2, make the output a 1 x 2 array, if count is 3, make the output a 1 x 3 array, and if the count is 4, make the output a 2 x 2 array.\n4. **Create the Output Grid**: Make a new grid based on Step 3's dimensions.\n5.  **Fill the output:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the identified non-black color.\n"
