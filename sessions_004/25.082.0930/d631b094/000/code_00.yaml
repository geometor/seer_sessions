facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions vary.
  - observation: Input grids contain a background color of black (0).
  - observation: Input grids contain one other color (non-black).
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-black color from the input.
  - observation: The number of pixels of the non-black color in the output seems determined by how many of that color appeared in the input.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      background_color: 0
      other_colors: [1, 2, 7, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      colors: "same as the non-black color in input_grid"
  - relationship: The size of output is the number of cells in the input of the other color.
