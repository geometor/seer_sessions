## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and attempt to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.
*   Each grid consists of single-digit integers (0-9), which can be interpreted as colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each pair, but they vary between example pairs (3x3 in `train_1`, and 3x3 in `train_2`).
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to produce the output grid. It looks like a rotation and mirroring of some kind, combined.
*	  The input and output are both 3x3 grids.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3  # Consistent dimensions within each example pair
      elements: integers (0-9)
    relationships:
      - input_grid: transformed_to -> output_grid
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearranges elements of the input grid
    details:
      - seems to be a 90 degree clockwise rotation
      - seems to be a vertical mirror
      - combines rotation and mirroring
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Mirror:** Mirror the rotated grid vertically (i.e., flip it along the horizontal axis).
3.  The resulting grid is the output grid.
Combining them:
Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then flip vertically to get output grid.
