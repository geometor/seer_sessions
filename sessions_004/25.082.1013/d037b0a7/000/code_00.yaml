facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input grid appear to influence the output grid.
  - observation: Zero values in the input grid are sometimes replaced by non-zero values in the output grid.
  - observation: The bottom right value in train_1 input and output is `6`.
  - observation: The transformation seems like a directional propagation or fill operation.
  - relationship: train_1: The top-right value (6) propagates to the left along the row and then propagates down, carrying the row values with it.
  - relationship: train_2: The middle-right value (8) propagates to the left and down.
  - relationship: train_3: The top-left value (4) propagates downwards.
  - hypothesis: non-zero value in the last column or bottom row may cause propagation.
