While they correctly processed the first example, they failed on the subsequent two. The core issue is that the logic for selecting the output color is flawed. It's not simply about picking one of the first two colors in the first row; there's a more nuanced rule at play. The strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between the input and output grids, focusing on identifying a consistent rule for color selection that applies to *all* examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Gather Metrics (Beyond Visual Inspection):** Use python to perform a more detailed comparison, comparing colors.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** The current assumption about the first two cells of the first row is incorrect.\n3.  **Identify a Universal Rule:**\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Create a new version, focusing on clarity and completeness.\n5.  **Document in YAML:** Create fact objects.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\nIt's not necessary to execute code to answer this question. The necessary data has already been collected and formatted. It is readily available and I can answer based on that information.\n\n**Re-evaluate Assumptions and Identify a Universal Rule:**\n\nLooking at all three examples together, I see that for example 2:\n\nInput:\n"
