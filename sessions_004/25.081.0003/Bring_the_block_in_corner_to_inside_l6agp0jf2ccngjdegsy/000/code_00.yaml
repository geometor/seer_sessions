  - observation: |
     The height of the non-white object is always 3.
  - observation: |
      The transformation focuses on single pixels located at the edges of the shape, specifically the last row of the surrounding white space.
  - observation: |
      The last row of the input can have 1 or 2 non-white pixels, always at the edge.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, a magenta (6) pixel replaces a white pixel above an existing red (2).
  - observation: |
       In train_1, a red (2) pixel replaces a white pixel.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, the two orange (7) are removed, and the azure object moves up.
  - observation: |
    In train_3, a yellow (4) and a red (2) pixel stay in the same place.
