            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed adjustments to the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on a single example and, as expected, doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that it assumes *any* pixel in the last row needs to be moved. It doesn't correctly identify the \"object\" that should be transformed, nor does it precisely handle where these pixels should be moved *to*.  The provided code moves the outside edge to the inside object.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of simply looking at the last row, we need to identify the contiguous \"object\" in the corner. This object is determined by connected non-background (non-zero) pixels.\n2.  **Precise Relocation Logic:**  The current logic of inserting a row and moving pixels is too simplistic. We need to specifically identify the *target* location based on the interaction, or lack of, between the single-pixel object and the large object..\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using observations):**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input object is not well-defined.  The bottom-left pixel (value 2) is treated as part of a large object, but there is a single block of color 6 above.\n    *   Expected: Move the '2' pixel up and in by 1 row and 1 column, inside the larger shape.\n    *   Actual: last row removed, pixel moved to above the last row, keeping the same column.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar logic error. Two separate objects, bottom object contains 7.\n    *   Expected: Move '7' pixels up and in, adjacent to other object.\n    *   Actual: last row removed, pixels moved to above the last row.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Similar logic error. Two separate objects, bottom object contains 4 and 2.\n    *   Expected: Move both '4' and '2' up and adjacent.\n    *   Actual: last row removed, pixels moved to above the last row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If the outside object consists of multiple pixels, maintain their relative positions to each other during the move.\n"
