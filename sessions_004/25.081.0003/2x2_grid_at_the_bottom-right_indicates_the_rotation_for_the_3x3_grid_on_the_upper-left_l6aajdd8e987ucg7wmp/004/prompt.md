"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of color 3 (green),
    color 1 (blue) and color 4 (yellow) pixels.
2.  **Object-3 Transformation:** Move the object-3 (green) to the top-left corner of the grid, making
    it a horizontal line if longer than 1. Maintain the relative positions of the green pixels.
3.  **Object-1 and Object-4 Removal:** Remove the blue 2x1 object (object-1)
    and the adjacent single pixel yellow object (object-4).
4.  **Output:** The resulting grid contains the repositioned object-3
    and 0 for the previous positions of all other objects.
