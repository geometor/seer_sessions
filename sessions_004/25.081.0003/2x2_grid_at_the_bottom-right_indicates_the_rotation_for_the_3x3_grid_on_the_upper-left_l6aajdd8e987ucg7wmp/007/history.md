2.  **Object-3 Transformation:** Move the object-3 (green) to the top-left corner of the grid, making
    it a horizontal line if longer than 1. Maintain the relative positions of the green pixels.

Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have fundamental flaws. While the code correctly identifies and isolates objects of color 3 (green), 1 (blue), and 4 (yellow), it does not accurately reflect the transformation seen in *all* the examples. The core issue is the placement and shape of the green object after the transformation. The code places all green pixels in the top row, which works for example one, but fails for the others. The code does remove the blue and yellow, which is partially correct.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Object-3 Transformation:** The primary error lies in how the green object (object-3) is transformed. We need to examine *all* examples to discern the precise rule governing its new shape and position, not assuming its always on the top row.

2.  **Contextualize Object Relationships:** The provided results show only pixel differences and general boolean flags. The code needs to understand spatial relationships more thoroughly.

3.  **Refine Object Identification:** the find\_object approach does identify the objects, however, it does not distinguish between parts of the same object.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

I need to analyze the original and transformed grids to determine the object movement.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of pixels with color 3 (green), color 1 (blue), and color 4 (yellow). Each of these groups is considered an object.
2. **Remove Blue and Yellow Objects:** Delete all blue and yellow objects.
3.  **Transform Green Objects**: The green objects are not always moved to the top left, nor are they flattened into a horizontal line. There appears to be a pattern to the re-arrangement.
    *   In Example 1, the green objects retain their original positions in the output.
    *   In Example 2, the large green object is converted to a 3x1 vertical line, plus one additional point.
    *   In Example 3: the 2x1 horizontal object is split.
4.  **Output:** The final grid will consist of the transformed green objects, while all other cells become 0 (white). The transformation of green seems to involve splitting into component parts and potentially re-arranging those.
