facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid in all examples.
  - observation: |
      The number of occurrences of each color in the input grid exactly matches the number of cells of that color stacked vertically in the output grid.
  - observation: |
    Each column in output represents the count of a color in input, forming a colored column.
  - object_property: color_count
    description: |
      The number of times a specific color appears in the input grid.
  - transformation_rule: histogram_construction
    description: |
      The output is constructed by creating vertical columns for each color present in the input. The height of each column corresponds to the number of occurrences of that color in the input. The rest of the grid is filled with 0.
  - example_1:
      input_color_counts: {0: 16, 2: 3, 3: 4, 6: 1, 8: 1}
      output_color_counts: {0: 16, 2: 3, 3: 4, 6: 1, 8: 1}
      output_structure: |
          Columns are formed based on color counts: 4 x '3', 3 x '2', 1 x '6', 1 x '8', and the rest filled with '0'.
  - example_2:
      input_color_counts: {0: 12, 2: 4, 3: 2, 6: 4, 8: 3}
      output_color_counts: {0: 12, 2: 4, 3: 2, 6: 4, 8: 3}
      output_structure: |
          Columns are formed based on color counts: 2 x '3', 4 x '2', 4 x '6', 3 x '8', and the rest filled with '0'.
  - example_3:
      input_color_counts: {0: 17, 2: 4, 3: 3, 8: 1}
      output_color_counts: {0: 17, 2: 4, 3: 3, 8: 1}
      output_structure: |
          Columns are formed based on color counts: 3 x '3', 4 x '2', 1 x '8', and the rest filled with '0'.
