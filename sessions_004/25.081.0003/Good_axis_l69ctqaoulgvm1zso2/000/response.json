The colors involved seem to be primarily red (2), white (0), orange (7), and azure (8). The core operation appears to be some form of replacement or movement of azure and white pixels based on their positions relative to other colors. Specifically, a horizontal line of azure seems to control change in white columns above it.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Replace the white pixels in the identified columns with azure pixels, up to the row immediately above the red row identified initially.\n5. Preserve bottom row\n\nIn summary the azure pixels take the place of white pixels in any all white column, but only up to (and including) the columns where the all-red row has red pixels, and only to the row above the all red row.\n"
