facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: 5
      - width: 5
      - values: integers (0-9)

  - object: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels within the grid.
    properties:
        - index: integer (position from top, 0-indexed)
        - values: array of integers

  - action: stack
    description: Overlaying rows from the input, starting from the top, onto the last row.
    parameters:
        - source_row_index: index of the row to be stacked.
        - target_row_index: Where to position the stacked information.
        - fill_zeros:  bool (implied - observed to be true - only take values from source_row_index to fill in 0 coordinate positions.)

  - relationship: input_output_grid_size_equality
    description: The input and output grids have identical dimensions.

  - relationship: last_row_preservation
    description: >
      Non-zero values in the last row of the input grid are preserved in the
      same x-coordinate in the output grid.
