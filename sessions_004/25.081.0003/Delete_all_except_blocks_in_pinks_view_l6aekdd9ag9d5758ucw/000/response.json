The primary element seems to be the manipulation of pixels of color `5` (gray) and `6` (magenta) based on their position and neighbors and specifically changing some of these pixels to color `0` (white). There's potentially a concept of \"connected components\" or regions of these colored pixels being important. The surrounding `0` (white) pixels seem to act as a static background or border.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
