facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 5x5
  - output_grid_dimensions: 5x5
  - input_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 5: gray
  - output_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 2: red
    - 4: yellow
    - 6: magenta
  - input_pattern: varies, gray pixels ('5') arranged differently in each input
  - output_pattern: constant, columns alternate with a value unique to the color
  - transformation_type: column-based color replacement
  - column_mapping: |
    a function of column position, f(c) where if the value is 5:
        column 0 -> 4 or 2 or 6
        column 1 -> 0
        column 2 -> 2 or 6 or 1
        column 3 -> 0
        column 4 -> 1 or 4 or 6
  - observations: |
        The mapping appears to relate color changes to column number of the original gray, where each
        column of the 5s has a corresponding color in the output. Zeros are always maintained.
