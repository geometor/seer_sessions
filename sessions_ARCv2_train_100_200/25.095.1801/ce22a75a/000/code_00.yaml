Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 9x9)
  Cells: Contain integer values.

Input Grid:
  Objects:
    - Type: Background Cell
      Value: 0
    - Type: Marker Cell
      Value: 5
      Role: Indicates the center of an operation for the output.

Output Grid:
  Objects:
    - Type: Inactive Cell
      Value: 0
    - Type: Active Cell
      Value: 1
      Formation: Appear in 3x3 blocks.

Transformation:
  Action: Generate Output Grid from Input Grid
  Rule:
    1. Identify all Marker Cells (value 5) in the Input Grid.
    2. For each Marker Cell at position (row, col):
       a. Define a 3x3 neighborhood centered at (row, col).
       b. Set all cells within this 3x3 neighborhood in the Output Grid to Active (value 1).
    3. All other cells in the Output Grid remain Inactive (value 0).
  Overlap Handling: If 3x3 neighborhoods overlap, the corresponding cells in the Output Grid remain Active (value 1).
  Mapping: Input Marker Cell -> Center of 3x3 Active Cell block in Output.
