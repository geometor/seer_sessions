            "text": "Okay, here's the analysis of the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grids:** Both input and output are represented as 2D grids of numbers. They have the same dimensions (9x9 in the examples).\n2.  **Input Values:** The input grids primarily consist of 0s, with a few scattered cells containing the value 5. These '5' cells appear to be significant markers.\n3.  **Output Values:** The output grids consist only of 0s and 1s. The 1s form distinct, solid square blocks (3x3 in size).\n4.  **Relationship:** There's a clear spatial relationship between the locations of the '5's in the input and the blocks of '1's in the output. Each '5' in the input corresponds to the center of a 3x3 block of '1's in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The process seems to involve identifying the '5' markers in the input and then \"drawing\" or \"stamping\" a 3x3 block of '1's onto the output grid, centered at the location of each '5'. Where these blocks overlap, the output remains '1'. The original '5's themselves do not appear directly in the output, nor do the original '0's unless they are overwritten by a '1' block.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
