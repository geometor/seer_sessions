            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids containing integers 0 and 2. The grid dimensions vary slightly in examples but maintain a structure (4 rows, 6 columns in all provided examples).\n2.  **Core Operation:** The fundamental change observed is the conversion of some '0' cells to '2' cells. '2' cells never change to '0'.\n3.  **Row-Based Patterns:** The changes appear to be conditional based on specific patterns within individual rows. Two key patterns emerge involving rows containing exactly two '2's:\n    *   Pattern 1 (P1): '2's at the absolute start and end of the row, with '0's in between (e.g., `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`).\n    *   Pattern 2 (P2): '2's at the second and second-to-last positions, with '0's elsewhere (e.g., `[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]`).\n4.  **Global Conditionality:** Whether a row fitting P1 or P2 is actually modified depends on the composition of the *entire grid*. The presence of rows with '2's that *don't* fit P1 or P2 (Other Patterns, OP) seems to inhibit *any* modification (Examples: train\\_2, train\\_4).\n5.  **Rule Hierarchy:** When modifications *are* allowed (i.e., no OP rows exist):\n    *   If *only* P1 rows (and potentially all-'0' rows) are present, the P1 rows are filled (train\\_1).\n    *   If *both* P1 and P2 rows are present, *only* the P2 rows are filled (train\\_3, train\\_5).\n    *   (Implicitly) If *only* P2 rows (and potentially all-'0' rows) are present, the P2 rows would be filled.\n6.  **Filling Mechanism:** When a row pattern (P1 or P2) is selected for modification, all the '0' cells strictly *between* the two '2's defining the pattern are changed to '2'.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
