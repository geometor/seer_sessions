Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (matrices) of numbers, specifically 8x8 in the examples.
2.  **Grid Values:** The grids contain integers. The predominant value in the input is 7, acting as a background or default value. Other values present are 2 and 5.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is derived from the input grid. Some values change, while others remain the same.
4.  **Value Preservation:** The numbers 2 and 5 in the input grid appear unchanged in the same positions in the output grid.
5.  **Value Changes:** Some instances of the number 7 in the input grid are changed to either 3 or 4 in the output grid.
6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The changes from 7 to 3 or 4 seem to depend on the proximity of the 7 to the numbers 2 and 5 in the *input* grid. Specifically, it appears that the 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals) are considered.
7.  **Change Rules:**
    *   A 7 changes to 3 if at least one of its 8 neighbors (in the input grid) is a 2.
    *   A 7 changes to 4 if none of its neighbors is a 2, but at least one neighbor is a 5.
    *   A 7 remains 7 if none of its neighbors are 2 or 5.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (identified by its row and column) of the input grid.
3.  For the current cell, check its value in the input grid.
4.  If the input cell value is 7:
    a.  Examine the values of all 8 neighboring cells (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) in the *input* grid, handling boundary conditions appropriately (neighbors outside the grid are ignored or treated as having no relevant value).
    b.  Check if any neighbor has the value 2. If yes, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 3.
    c.  If no neighbor has the value 2, then check if any neighbor has the value 5. If yes, set the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to 4.
    d.  If no neighbor has the value 2 and no neighbor has the value 5, the corresponding cell in the output grid retains the value 7 (it's already copied).
5.  If the input cell value is not 7 (i.e., it is 2 or 5), the corresponding cell in the output grid retains its original value (it's already copied).
6.  After iterating through all cells, the output grid contains the final transformed result.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a grid of numbers based on the values of neighboring cells.

Specifically:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. If the input cell value is 7:
   a. Examine the values of its 8 neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) in the input grid.
   b. If any neighbor has the value 2, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 3.
   c. Else if any neighbor has the value 5, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 4.
   d. Otherwise, the output cell value remains 7.
4. If the input cell value is not 7 (e.g., 2 or 5), the corresponding cell in the output grid retains its original value.
5. Return the transformed output grid.
