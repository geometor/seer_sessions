task_description: "Transform a grid of numbers based on neighbor values."
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - size: 8x8 (in examples)
      - values: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7] (observed across input/output)
  - element: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighbors: 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals)
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    description: "The initial grid."
  - object: output_grid
    description: "The transformed grid."
  - object: background_value
    value: 7
    description: "Default value, potentially changes based on neighbors."
  - object: trigger_value_1
    value: 2
    description: "Causes neighboring 7s to become 3. Preserved in output. Takes precedence over trigger_value_2."
  - object: trigger_value_2
    value: 5
    description: "Causes neighboring 7s to become 4 (if no neighboring 2). Preserved in output."
  - object: derived_value_1
    value: 3
    description: "Result of transforming a 7 adjacent to a 2."
  - object: derived_value_2
    value: 4
    description: "Result of transforming a 7 adjacent to a 5 (and not adjacent to a 2)."
actions:
  - action: preserve_value
    description: "Cells with values 2 or 5 in the input retain their value in the output."
  - action: transform_value
    description: "Cells with value 7 in the input may change based on neighbors."
    conditions:
      - condition: "If any of the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) in the input grid has value 2."
        result: "Output cell value becomes 3."
      - condition: "Else if any of the 8 neighbors in the input grid has value 5."
        result: "Output cell value becomes 4."
      - condition: "Otherwise (no neighbors are 2 or 5)."
        result: "Output cell value remains 7."
relationships:
  - relationship: neighborhood
    description: "The transformation of a cell depends on the values of its 8 immediate neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)."
  - relationship: precedence
    description: "The influence of neighbor value 2 takes precedence over the influence of neighbor value 5 when transforming a 7."
