The predominant value in the input is 7, acting as a background or default value. Other values present are 2 and 5.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is derived from the input grid. Some values change, while others remain the same.\n4.  **Value Preservation:** The numbers 2 and 5 in the input grid appear unchanged in the same positions in the output grid.\n5.  **Value Changes:** Some instances of the number 7 in the input grid are changed to either 3 or 4 in the output grid.\n6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The changes from 7 to 3 or 4 seem to depend on the proximity of the 7 to the numbers 2 and 5 in the *input* grid. Specifically, it appears that the 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals) are considered.\n7.  **Change Rules:**\n    *   A 7 changes to 3 if at least one of its 8 neighbors (in the input grid) is a 2.\n    *   A 7 changes to 4 if none of its neighbors is a 2, but at least one neighbor is a 5.\n    *   A 7 remains 7 if none of its neighbors are 2 or 5.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
