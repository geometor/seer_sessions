## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the transformation rule as reversing the order of rows in the input grid. This observation holds true for all three provided training examples. The content within each row remains unchanged, and the grid dimensions are preserved, only the vertical sequence of rows is inverted.

The error reported (`Train Set Error: transform function not found`) is technical and related to the testing environment expecting a specific function name (likely `transform`) rather than the `transform_grid` function provided in the previous code. The underlying logic of row reversal implemented in `transform_grid` appears correct based on the examples.

The strategy is to maintain the core transformation logic (row reversal) and update the implementation details (specifically, the function name) to align with the assumed requirements of the execution framework. The Natural Language Program and Facts should continue to accurately describe the row reversal process.

## Metrics

-   **train_1:**
    -   Input dimensions: 5 rows, 5 columns
    -   Output dimensions: 5 rows, 5 columns
    -   Transformation: Row order reversed (Row 1 -> Row 5, Row 2 -> Row 4, etc.)
-   **train_2:**
    -   Input dimensions: 5 rows, 5 columns
    -   Output dimensions: 5 rows, 5 columns
    -   Transformation: Row order reversed (Row 1 -> Row 5, Row 2 -> Row 4, etc.)
-   **train_3:**
    -   Input dimensions: 7 rows, 7 columns
    -   Output dimensions: 7 rows, 7 columns
    -   Transformation: Row order reversed (Row 1 -> Row 7, Row 2 -> Row 6, etc.)

**Consistency Check:** All examples consistently demonstrate the same transformation: the input grid's rows are presented in reverse order in the output grid. The number of rows and columns can vary between examples, but the rule applies uniformly.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input text into a grid structure, representing it as a list of rows, where each row is a list of integers.
2.  Create a new list containing the rows from the input grid but in reverse order. The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output, the second row becomes the second-to-last, and so forth.
3.  Format the resulting list of rows back into the required output text format (space-separated integers per line, lines separated by newlines).
