    type: grid
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers
      - structure: sequence of rows, each row is a sequence of integers
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - content: same elements as input_grid
      - row_order: reversed compared to input_grid

    description: Invert the order of the sequence of rows from the input grid to produce the output grid. The content and order of elements within each row remain unchanged.
    input: sequence of rows (from input_grid)
    output: reversed sequence of rows (for output_grid)
