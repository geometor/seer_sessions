The output is also a grid of single-digit integers with the same dimensions and content as the input grid. The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the rows within the grid. Specifically, the order of the rows in the input grid is reversed to produce the output grid. The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output, and so on, until the last row of the input becomes the first row of the output. The content and order of numbers within each row remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
