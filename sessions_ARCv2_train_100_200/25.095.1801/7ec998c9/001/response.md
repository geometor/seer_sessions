"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W).
2. Finds the 'background' value (most frequent integer) and the unique 'anchor' cell 
   (r_anchor, c_anchor) with a different value (v_anchor).
3. Determines a pair of opposite corners:
    - If the anchor cell is at the exact geometric center of the grid 
      (r_anchor == (H-1)/2 and c_anchor == (W-1)/2), uses Top-Right ((0, W-1)) 
      and Bottom-Left ((H-1, 0)).
    - Otherwise, uses Top-Left ((0, 0)) and Bottom-Right ((H-1, W-1)).
4. Constructs a path connecting the selected corners, using the anchor cell's column (c_anchor)
   as the vertical segment:
    - Horizontal segment from Corner1's row/col to (Corner1_row, c_anchor).
    - Vertical segment from (Corner1_row, c_anchor) to (Corner2_row, c_anchor).
    - Horizontal segment from (Corner2_row, c_anchor) to Corner2's row/col.
5. Creates an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
6. Iterates through all cells on the constructed path. If a path cell is *not* the anchor cell,
   its value in the output grid is changed to 1.
7. Returns the modified output grid.
