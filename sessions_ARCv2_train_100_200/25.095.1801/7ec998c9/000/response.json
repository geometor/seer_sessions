            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) of single-digit integers. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Grid Content:** Each input grid primarily consists of a single repeating integer (the \"background\" color/number). There is exactly one cell in each input grid that has a different integer value (the \"anchor\" color/number).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation preserves the location and value of the anchor cell. It also preserves the value of many background cells. However, a specific subset of background cells is changed to the value '1' in the output.\n4.  **Pattern of Change:** The cells changed to '1' appear to form a path or shape within the grid. This path seems related to the position of the anchor cell. Specifically, the path looks like it connects two opposite corners of the grid, using the row or column of the anchor cell as a conduit.\n5.  **Path Details:** Observing the examples suggests the path consists of three segments: a horizontal segment along the starting corner's row towards the anchor's column, a vertical segment along the anchor's column connecting the rows of the two corners, and a horizontal segment along the ending corner's row from the anchor's column to the corner.\n6.  **Anchor Cell Exception:** Crucially, if the anchor cell lies on the constructed path, its value is *not* changed to '1'; it retains its original anchor value. All other cells on the path are changed to '1'.\n7.  **Corner Selection:** The specific pair of opposite corners used seems to vary:\n    *   Example 1 (8x8, anchor at (3,2)) uses Top-Left to Bottom-Right.\n    *   Example 2 (5x5, anchor at (2,2)) uses Top-Right to Bottom-Left.\n    *   Example 3 (7x7, anchor at (3,4)) uses Top-Left to Bottom-Right.\n    The rule for selecting the corner pair isn't immediately obvious but might relate to the anchor's position relative to the grid center (e.g., example 2's anchor is exactly central). In all provided examples, the path utilizes the *column* of the anchor cell for its vertical segment.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
