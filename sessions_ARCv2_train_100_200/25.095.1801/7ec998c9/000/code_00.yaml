Grid:
  Type: 2D array of integers
  Properties:
    - Height: H
    - Width: W
Objects:
  - Cell:
      Properties:
        - Row: r (0 to H-1)
        - Column: c (0 to W-1)
        - Value: v (integer)
  - Background:
      Type: Cell value
      Definition: The most frequent value in the input grid.
  - Anchor Cell:
      Type: Cell
      Definition: The unique cell whose value differs from the Background value.
      Properties:
        - Anchor Row: r_anchor
        - Anchor Column: c_anchor
        - Anchor Value: v_anchor
Relationships:
  - Anchor cell position determines the path.
  - Path connects two opposite corners via the anchor cell's column.
Actions:
  - Identify: Find H, W, Background value, Anchor Cell (r_anchor, c_anchor, v_anchor).
  - Determine Corners: Select a pair of opposite corners (e.g., Top-Left & Bottom-Right OR Top-Right & Bottom-Left) based on a rule (potentially related to anchor position/grid center).
  - Construct Path: Define a path consisting of three segments connecting the chosen corners, using the anchor column (c_anchor) for the vertical segment.
    - Segment 1: Horizontal from Corner1 to (row_Corner1, c_anchor)
    - Segment 2: Vertical from (row_Corner1, c_anchor) to (row_Corner2, c_anchor)
    - Segment 3: Horizontal from (row_Corner2, c_anchor) to Corner2
  - Transform Grid:
    - Initialize Output Grid as a copy of Input Grid.
    - For each cell (r, c) on the constructed path:
      - If (r, c) is NOT the Anchor Cell:
        - Set Output Grid cell (r, c) value to 1.
