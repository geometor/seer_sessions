*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    *   The grids contain the digit `0` and other non-zero digits (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 8).
    *   The output grid retains the original non-zero digits in their positions.
    *   Some `0`s in the input grid are replaced by `2`s in the output grid.
    *   The transformation appears to happen row by row.
    *   The non-zero digits within a row act as delimiters or boundaries.
    *   The `0`s that are changed to `2`s are those located horizontally *between* two non-zero digits within the same row.

    task_elements:
      - object: grid
        description: A 2D array of integers.
        properties:
          - rows: Sequence of horizontal lines in the grid.
          - columns: Sequence of vertical lines in the grid.
          - cells: Individual elements within the grid, each having a value and position (row, column).
      - object: cell
        properties:
          - value: An integer (0 or non-zero).
          - row_index: The row position of the cell.
          - column_index: The column position of the cell.
      - object: boundary_marker
        description: A cell with a non-zero value in the input grid. These markers define segments within a row.
      - object: fill_value
        description: The integer '2' used to replace specific '0's in the output grid.
      - object: segment
        description: A horizontal sequence of cells within a single row, starting and ending with boundary markers.
        properties:
          - start_boundary: The leftmost boundary marker of the segment in a row.
          - end_boundary: The rightmost boundary marker of the segment in a row.
          - interior_cells: Cells located strictly between the start and end boundaries within the same row.

    action:

        description: Iterate through each row, identify segments defined by adjacent boundary markers, and change the value of interior cells with value 0 to the fill_value (2).
        inputs:
          - input_grid
        outputs:
          - output_grid
        steps:
          - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify the column indices of all boundary markers (non-zero cells).
          - Sort these indices.
          - For each pair of adjacent boundary marker indices (col1, col2) in the sorted list:
          - For each column index 'c' such that col1 < c < col2:
          - If the cell at (row, c) has a value of 0:
          - Change the value of the cell at (row, c) in the output grid to 2.
          - Otherwise, keep the original value from the input grid for all other cells.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3.  For the current row, find the column indices of all cells containing non-zero values (these are the boundary markers).
    4.  If there are fewer than two boundary markers in the row, proceed to the next row.
    5.  If there are two or more boundary markers, sort their column indices in ascending order.
    6.  Iterate through consecutive pairs of these sorted boundary column indices (let the indices of a pair be `col_start` and `col_end`).
    7.  For all column indices `c` such that `col_start < c < col_end`:
        a.  Check the value of the cell in the *input* grid at the current row and column `c`.
        b.  If the value is `0`, change the value of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid (at the current row and column `c`) to `2`.
    8.  After processing all rows, the modified grid is the final output.
