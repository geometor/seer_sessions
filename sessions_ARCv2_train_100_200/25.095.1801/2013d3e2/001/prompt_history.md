Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 10x10 grid containing single-digit integers (0-9). The grid contains a pattern of non-zero numbers surrounded by zeros.
2.  **Output:** The output is consistently a smaller 3x3 grid containing single-digit integers.
3.  **Relationship:** The output grid appears to be a sub-section (a crop) of the input grid. The specific 3x3 section seems related to the location of the non-zero elements in the input.
4.  **Pattern:** In both examples, the non-zero elements form a contiguous or near-contiguous block within the larger 10x10 input grid. The output grid seems to capture the top-left portion of this block of non-zero elements.
5.  **Core Task:** The task involves locating a specific region within the input grid based on the distribution of non-zero values and extracting a fixed-size (3x3) subgrid from that location.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all cells in the 10x10 input grid that contain a non-zero value.
2.  Determine the coordinates (row index, column index) for each of these non-zero cells.
3.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`) among all identified non-zero cell coordinates.
4.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) among all identified non-zero cell coordinates.
5.  Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at the cell located at (`min_row`, `min_col`). This subgrid includes cells from row `min_row` to `min_row + 2` and from column `min_col` to `min_col + 2`.
6.  The extracted 3x3 subgrid is the final output.
