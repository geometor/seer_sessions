Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions (rows, cols)
    - contains: Cells
Cell:
  Properties:
    - position (row, col)
    - value: integer
Relationships:
  - Neighborhood: A cell has 8 adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood).
Objects:
  - Source_Cell:
      is_a: Cell
      condition: value == 2
  - Target_Cell:
      is_a: Cell
      condition: value == 0
  - Passive_Cell:
      is_a: Cell
      condition: value != 0 and value != 2
  - Output_Cell:
      is_a: Cell
      value: 1
Action:
  - name: Fill_Neighbors
  - actor: Source_Cell (cells with value 2)
  - operation: For each Source_Cell in the input grid, examine its 8 neighbors.
  - condition: If a neighbor is a Target_Cell (value 0) in the input grid.
  - result: Change the corresponding cell's value to 1 in the output grid.
  - Preservation: All Source_Cells and Passive_Cells retain their original values and positions in the output grid. Target_Cells not adjacent to any Source_Cell also retain their value (0).
