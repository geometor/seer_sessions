The dimensions of the output grid are always identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Grid Content:** The input grids primarily contain zeros (representing empty space or background) and a few non-zero positive integers at specific locations.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some of the zero cells in the input grid to the value '1' in the output grid.\n4.  **Role of '2':** The number '2' appears to be the trigger for the transformation. The '1's in the output consistently appear in the immediate vicinity (specifically, the 8 neighboring cells or Moore neighborhood) of cells containing '2' in the input.\n5.  **Role of Other Non-Zero Numbers:** Other non-zero numbers (like 3, 6, 8 in the examples) seem to be passive; they are copied directly from the input to the output in their original positions but do not trigger the creation of '1's around them.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The process only changes cells that were originally '0'. The original positions of the '2's and other non-zero numbers are preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
