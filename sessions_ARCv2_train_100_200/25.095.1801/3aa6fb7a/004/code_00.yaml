objects:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers representing the state.
  - cell: An element within the grid defined by row, column, and value.
  - neighbors: The set of up to 8 cells directly or diagonally adjacent to a given cell.
  - target_neighbors: The subset of neighbors that have a specific value (e.g., 8).
properties:
  - cell.value: The integer value (0, 1, or 8).
  - cell.position: The (row, column) coordinates.
  - target_neighbors.count: The number of neighbors with the target value.
  - target_neighbors.coordinates: The list of (row, column) positions of the target neighbors.
  - target_neighbors.mutual_adjacency: A boolean property indicating if all neighbors in a set of three are adjacent to each other.
actions:
  - transform_grid: Creates an output grid based on applying rules to the input grid.
  - update_cell_value: Changes a cell's value in the output grid based on conditions met in the input grid.
relationships:
  - rule: The output value of a cell depends on its input value and the values and configuration of its neighbors in the input grid.
  - condition_value_0: A cell must have a value of 0 in the input grid to potentially change to 1.
  - condition_neighbor_count: A cell must have exactly three neighbors with value 8 in the input grid.
  - condition_neighbor_adjacency: The three neighbors with value 8 must all be mutually adjacent (each one must be a neighbor of the other two).
  - transformation_0_to_1: If a cell has value 0 and satisfies both condition_neighbor_count and condition_neighbor_adjacency, its value becomes 1 in the output grid.
  - invariance_8: Cells with value 8 in the input grid retain value 8 in the output grid.
  - invariance_0: Cells with value 0 in the input grid that do not meet the conditions for transformation_0_to_1 retain value 0 in the output grid.
