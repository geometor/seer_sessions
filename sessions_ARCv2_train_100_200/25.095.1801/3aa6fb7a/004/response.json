            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code based on the first example successfully implemented the transformation for the second example but failed for the first example. The specific error occurred at cell (4, 3) in the first example, where the code changed a 0 to a 1, but the expected output was 0.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the initial rule (\"a cell changes from 0 to 1 if it has exactly three neighbors with value 8\") was necessary but not sufficient. Both the cells that correctly changed to 1 and the cell (4, 3) that incorrectly changed had exactly three '8' neighbors in the input grid.\n\nThe key difference lies in the spatial configuration of these three '8' neighbors. For the cells that correctly changed to 1, the three '8' neighbors were positioned such that each neighbor was adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the other two. They formed a connected 'L' shape or block of three. For the cell (4, 3) that failed, its three '8' neighbors did not all touch each other; one was separated from the other two.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to refine the transformation rule to include this condition: the three '8' neighbors must be mutually adjacent.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the neighbor counts and configurations for cells that changed from 0 to 1, and for the error case (4, 3) in Example 1.\n\n**Example 1 (train_1):**\nInput Grid:\n"
