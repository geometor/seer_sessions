*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a 2D grid of numbers.
    *   The input grids contain only 0s and 8s.
    *   The output grids contain 0s, 1s, and 8s.
    *   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical for each example.
    *   The positions of the number 8 remain unchanged from input to output.
    *   Some cells containing 0 in the input are changed to 1 in the output.
    *   The change from 0 to 1 appears to depend on the neighboring cells. Specifically, it seems related to the count of neighbors with the value 8.

*   **Facts:**

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code based on the first example successfully implemented the transformation for the second example but failed for the first example. The specific error occurred at cell (4, 3) in the first example, where the code changed a 0 to a 1, but the expected output was 0.

Analysis revealed that the initial rule ("a cell changes from 0 to 1 if it has exactly three neighbors with value 8") was necessary but not sufficient. Both the cells that correctly changed to 1 and the cell (4, 3) that incorrectly changed had exactly three '8' neighbors in the input grid.

The key difference lies in the spatial configuration of these three '8' neighbors. For the cells that correctly changed to 1, the three '8' neighbors were positioned such that each neighbor was adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the other two. They formed a connected 'L' shape or block of three. For the cell (4, 3) that failed, its three '8' neighbors did not all touch each other; one was separated from the other two.

Therefore, the strategy is to refine the transformation rule to include this condition: the three '8' neighbors must be mutually adjacent.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using code execution to analyze the neighbor counts and configurations for cells that changed from 0 to 1, and for the error case (4, 3) in Example 1.

properties:
  - cell.value: The integer value (0, 1, or 8).
  - cell.position: The (row, column) coordinates.
  - target_neighbors.count: The number of neighbors with the target value.
  - target_neighbors.coordinates: The list of (row, column) positions of the target neighbors.
  - target_neighbors.mutual_adjacency: A boolean property indicating if all neighbors in a set of three are adjacent to each other.
actions:

  - condition_value_0: A cell must have a value of 0 in the input grid to potentially change to 1.
  - condition_neighbor_count: A cell must have exactly three neighbors with value 8 in the input grid.
  - condition_neighbor_adjacency: The three neighbors with value 8 must all be mutually adjacent (each one must be a neighbor of the other two).
  - transformation_0_to_1: If a cell has value 0 and satisfies both condition_neighbor_count and condition_neighbor_adjacency, its value becomes 1 in the output grid.
  - invariance_8: Cells with value 8 in the input grid retain value 8 in the output grid.
  - invariance_0: Cells with value 0 in the input grid that do not meet the conditions for transformation_0_to_1 retain value 0 in the output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) identical in dimensions to the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (identified by `row` and `col`) of the input grid.
3.  Get the value of the current cell (`input_value = input_grid[row][col]`).
4.  **Rule 1: Handle '8's:** If `input_value` is 8, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 8 (`output_grid[row][col] = 8`).
5.  **Rule 2: Handle '0's:** If `input_value` is 0:
    a.  Find all neighboring cells (up to 8) of the current cell (`row`, `col`) in the input grid.
    b.  Identify the neighbors that have a value of 8. Store their coordinates.
    c.  Count the number of these '8' neighbors (`count_8`).
    d.  **Check Condition 1:** Is `count_8` exactly equal to 3?
    e.  **Check Condition 2 (if Condition 1 is true):** Are the three '8' neighbors mutually adjacent? (Check if neighbor1 is adjacent to neighbor2 AND neighbor1 is adjacent to neighbor3 AND neighbor2 is adjacent to neighbor3).
    f.  **Apply Transformation:** If both Condition 1 (count is 3) and Condition 2 (mutual adjacency) are true, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 1 (`output_grid[row][col] = 1`).
    g.  **Default for '0's:** Otherwise (if `input_value` is 0 but either condition is false), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0 (`output_grid[row][col] = 0`).
6.  After iterating through all cells, return the completed output grid.
