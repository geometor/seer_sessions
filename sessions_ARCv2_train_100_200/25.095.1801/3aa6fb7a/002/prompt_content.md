Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
If the input cell's value is 8, keep it as 8 in the output grid.

If the count of 8-neighbors is exactly 3, set the corresponding output cell's value to 1.
Otherwise (if the input cell is 0 and the neighbor count is not 3), keep the output cell's value as 0.
