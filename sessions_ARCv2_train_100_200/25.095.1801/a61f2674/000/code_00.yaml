task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: constant between input and output (e.g., 9x9)
  - object: cell_value
    properties:
      - input_values: [0, 5]
      - output_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - background_value: 0
  - object: vertical_segment
    properties:
      - definition: A continuous sequence of non-background cells (value 5) in a single column.
      - attributes: [column_index, start_row, end_row, length]
      - input_marker: 5
      - output_markers: [1, 2]
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Vertical segments exist within the grid structure at specific column indices and row ranges.
  - type: correspondence
    description: Specific vertical segments in the input correspond to vertical segments in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all continuous vertical segments of value 5 in the input grid. Calculate their lengths.
  - action: select_longest_segment
    description: Identify the vertical segment with the maximum length.
  - action: select_shortest_segment
    description: Identify the vertical segment with the minimum length.
  - action: transform_grid
    description: Create an output grid initialized with the background value (0).
  - action: map_longest
    description: Place value 1 in the output grid at the locations corresponding to the longest input segment.
  - action: map_shortest
    description: Place value 2 in the output grid at the locations corresponding to the shortest input segment.
  - action: discard_others
    description: All other locations in the output grid (including those corresponding to non-selected input segments) remain the background value (0).
