            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of numbers. The dimensions remain constant between input and output for each example (9x9).\n2.  **Input Colors/Values:** The input grids primarily use the numbers 0 and 5. The value 0 appears to be the background, while 5 forms distinct shapes.\n3.  **Output Colors/Values:** The output grids use the numbers 0, 1, and 2. The value 0 is again the background. Values 1 and 2 form shapes corresponding to some of the input shapes.\n4.  **Input Shapes:** The number 5 consistently forms vertical lines or segments within the input grid. Multiple such segments can exist in a single input grid.\n5.  **Output Shapes:** The numbers 1 and 2 also form vertical lines or segments in the output grid. Crucially, the output contains only *two* such vertical segments (one of 1s, one of 2s), even if the input had more segments of 5s.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selecting specific vertical segments of 5s from the input and converting them into segments of 1s and 2s in the output, while discarding others. The positions (column and rows) of the selected segments are preserved.\n\n**Identifying the Selection Rule:**\n\n*   Let's examine the lengths of the vertical segments of 5s in each example.\n    *   **Train 1:**\n        *   Column 0: length 6 (rows 3-8)\n        *   Column 2: length 2 (rows 7-8)\n        *   Column 4: length 9 (rows 0-8)\n        *   Column 6: length 6 (rows 3-8)\n        *   Output: The segment in column 4 (length 9, *longest*) becomes 1s. The segment in column 2 (length 2, *shortest*) becomes 2s.\n    *   **Train 2:**\n        *   Column 0: length 6 (rows 3-8)\n        *   Column 2: length 8 (rows 1-8)\n        *   Column 4: length 4 (rows 5-8)\n        *   Column 6: length 7 (rows 2-8)\n        *   Column 8: length 3 (rows 6-8)\n        *   Output: The segment in column 2 (length 8, *longest*) becomes 1s. The segment in column 8 (length 3, *shortest*) becomes 2s.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies all continuous vertical segments of the number 5 in the input grid. It then selects the segment with the *maximum* length and transforms it into a segment of 1s in the output. It also selects the segment with the *minimum* length and transforms it into a segment of 2s in the output. All other segments of 5s from the input, along with the original 0s, become 0s in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n3.  Within each column, scan from top to bottom to identify continuous vertical runs (segments) of the value 5.\n4.  For each segment found, record its column index, starting row index, ending row index, and calculate its length (number of cells). Store this information.\n5.  After scanning all columns, examine the recorded segments. If no segments were found, the output is an empty grid or a grid filled with 0s matching the input dimensions.\n6.  If segments were found, identify the segment with the maximum length. If there are ties for the maximum length, assume the first one found (based on column index, then starting row) is chosen (though the examples don't demonstrate ties).\n7.  Identify the segment with the minimum length. If there are ties for the minimum length, assume the first one found is chosen.\n8.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the value 0.\n9.  Take the identified longest segment.
