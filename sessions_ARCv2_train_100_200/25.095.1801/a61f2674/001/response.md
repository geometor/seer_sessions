"""
Identifies all continuous vertical segments of the value 5 in the input grid. 
Selects the segment with the maximum length and transforms it into a segment of 1s in the output. 
Selects the segment with the minimum length and transforms it into a segment of 2s in the output. 
All other input cells (0s and non-selected 5s) become 0s in the output grid.
The dimensions of the output grid match the input grid.
