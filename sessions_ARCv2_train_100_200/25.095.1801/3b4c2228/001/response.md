"""
Transforms an input grid by detecting 2x2 blocks of the value 3. 
The presence of these blocks, found in top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan order, 
determines the placement of 1s along the main diagonal of a fixed 3x3 output grid.
The first found block sets output[0][0] to 1, the second sets output[1][1] to 1, 
and the third sets output[2][2] to 1. All other output cells remain 0.
