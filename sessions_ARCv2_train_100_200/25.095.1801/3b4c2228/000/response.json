The task involves identifying specific patterns within the input grid and summarizing their presence and potentially their order or location in the fixed-size output grid. The number '0' appears to function as a background color. The numbers '2' and '3' seem to represent different kinds of objects or patterns within the grid. The transformation specifically focuses on identifying contiguous 2x2 blocks composed entirely of the number '3'. The number '2' appears to be irrelevant to the final output. The position of the '1's in the 3x3 output grid correlates with the order in which these 2x2 blocks of '3's are found when scanning the input grid from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Create an empty list to store the row and column indices (coordinates) of the top-left corner of each identified target pattern.\n3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, considering it as a potential top-left corner for a 2x2 square. Stop the iteration early enough so that a 2x2 square fits entirely within the grid boundaries (i.e., iterate `r` from 0 to `height - 2` and `c` from 0 to `width - 2`).\n4.  For each potential top-left corner `(r, c)`, check if the cell at `(r, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, and `(r+1, c+1)` in the input grid all contain the value 3.\n5.  If all four cells contain the value 3, add the coordinate `(r, c)` to the list of found patterns.\n6.  After scanning the entire input grid, sort the list of found coordinates based primarily on the row index (ascending) and secondarily on the column index (ascending).\n7.  Examine the sorted list of coordinates:\n    a.  If the list contains at least one coordinate, set the value of the output grid at position `(0, 0)` to 1.\n    b.  If the list contains at least two coordinates, set the value of the output grid at position `(1, 1)` to 1.\n    c.  If the list contains at least three coordinates, set the value of the output grid at position `(2, 2)` to 1.\n8.  Return the final 3x3 output grid."
