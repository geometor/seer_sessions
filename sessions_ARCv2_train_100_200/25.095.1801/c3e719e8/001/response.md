"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid.
The transformation rule involves identifying the most frequent digit in the input grid.
A 3x3 pattern grid is created where cells corresponding to the most frequent digit in the input are marked (e.g., with 1) and others are unmarked (e.g., with 0).
The 9x9 output grid is constructed as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.
If a cell in the pattern grid is marked, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is a copy of the original input grid.
If a cell in the pattern grid is unmarked, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled with zeros.
