*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of single digits.
    *   The output is consistently a 9x9 grid of single digits.
    *   The output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.
    *   Each 3x3 block in the output is either a direct copy of the original 3x3 input grid or a 3x3 grid filled entirely with zeros.
    *   The placement pattern of the input grid copies within the 9x9 output appears to be determined by the content of the input grid itself.
    *   Specifically, the locations of the *most frequent digit* within the input grid dictate where copies of the input grid are placed in the output's 3x3 block structure. Where the most frequent digit does *not* appear in the input, a 3x3 zero block is placed in the corresponding output block location.

    Task: Grid Transformation based on Frequency Pattern

    Objects:
      - InputGrid:
          Type: Grid
          Properties:
            - Dimensions: 3x3
            - Content: Single digits (0-9)
      - OutputGrid:
          Type: Grid
          Properties:
            - Dimensions: 9x9
            - Content: Single digits (0-9)
      - SubGrid:
          Type: Grid
          Properties:
            - Dimensions: 3x3
          Subtypes:
            - InputGridCopy: A copy of the InputGrid.
            - ZeroGrid: A 3x3 grid filled with zeros.
      - PatternGrid:
          Type: Grid
          Properties:
            - Dimensions: 3x3
            - Content: Binary indicators (e.g., 1 or 0)
            - Derivation: Based on the locations of the most frequent digit in the InputGrid.

    Actions:
      - IdentifyMostFrequentDigit:
          Input: InputGrid
          Output: The digit that appears most often in the InputGrid.
          Note: Assumes no ties for simplicity based on examples.
      - CreatePatternGrid:
          Input: InputGrid, MostFrequentDigit
          Output: PatternGrid
          Logic: Mark cell (i, j) as 1 if InputGrid[i, j] equals MostFrequentDigit, else 0.
      - ConstructOutputGrid:
          Input: InputGrid, PatternGrid
          Output: OutputGrid
          Logic: Assemble a 9x9 grid as a 3x3 super-grid. For each cell (I, J) in the PatternGrid:
                   - If PatternGrid[I, J] is 1, place InputGridCopy at block position (I, J) in OutputGrid.
                   - If PatternGrid[I, J] is 0, place ZeroGrid at block position (I, J) in OutputGrid.

    Relationships:
      - OutputGrid is three times larger than InputGrid in each dimension.
      - The structure of OutputGrid is determined by PatternGrid.
      - PatternGrid is derived directly from InputGrid based on the frequency of its elements.
      - Each block in OutputGrid is either a copy of InputGrid or a ZeroGrid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the 3x3 input grid (`InputGrid`).
    2.  Analyze the `InputGrid` to determine the single digit that appears most frequently (`MostFrequentDigit`).
    3.  Create a new 3x3 grid, called `PatternGrid`.
    4.  Iterate through each cell `(i, j)` of the `InputGrid`:
        *   If the digit at `InputGrid[i, j]` is equal to `MostFrequentDigit`, set the corresponding cell `PatternGrid[i, j]` to 1.
        *   Otherwise, set `PatternGrid[i, j]` to 0.
    5.  Initialize an empty 9x9 output grid (`OutputGrid`).
    6.  Create a 3x3 grid filled with zeros (`ZeroGrid`).
    7.  Iterate through each cell `(I, J)` of the `PatternGrid` (where I and J range from 0 to 2):
        *   Calculate the top-left starting coordinates for the corresponding 3x3 block in the `OutputGrid`: `start_row = I * 3`, `start_col = J * 3`.
        *   If `PatternGrid[I, J]` is 1:
            *   Copy the contents of `InputGrid` into the 3x3 block of `OutputGrid` starting at `(start_row, start_col)`.
        *   If `PatternGrid[I, J]` is 0:
            *   Copy the contents of `ZeroGrid` into the 3x3 block of `OutputGrid` starting at `(start_row, start_col)`.
    8.  Return the populated `OutputGrid`.
