task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  size: 9x9 (based on examples)
  dimensionality: 2
cell_values:
  - value: 0
    role: background
  - value: 4
    role: foreground_object / trigger
  - value: 7
    role: modified_background / output_marker
objects:
  - type: grid_cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 4, or 7)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: region
    properties:
      - composed_of: value 4
      - connectivity: connected cells (sharing sides or corners)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Cells sharing a side or a corner (Moore neighborhood)
    applies_to: grid_cells
action:
  - type: conditional_value_change
    target: cells with value 0
    condition: target cell must be adjacent (Moore neighborhood) to at least one cell with value 4
    result: target cell value changes from 0 to 7
invariants:
  - Cells with value 4 do not change.
  - Cells with value 0 that do not meet the adjacency condition do not change.
