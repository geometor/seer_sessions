The grid size appears consistent (9x9 in the examples).\n2.  **Cell Values**: The grids contain three distinct integer values: 0, 4, and 7.\n3.  **Input Pattern**: The input grids consist primarily of 0s, representing a background. Within this background, there are one or more connected regions composed of the value 4.\n4.  **Output Pattern**: The output grids retain the original structure of the 0s and 4s from the input. However, some 0s in the input have been changed to 7s in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Locus**: The changes (0 -> 7) occur specifically at positions that were originally 0 in the input grid and are adjacent (including diagonals) to cells containing the value 4.\n6.  **Invariance**: Cells that initially contain 4 remain 4. Cells that initially contain 0 and are *not* adjacent to any 4 remain 0.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
