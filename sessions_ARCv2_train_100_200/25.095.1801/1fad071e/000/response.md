Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input:** The input is a 9x9 grid containing integer values 0, 1, and 2.
2.  **Output:** The output is a 1x5 list (or array) containing binary values (0 or 1).
3.  **Values:**
    *   `0`: Appears to be a background value.
    *   `1`: Forms specific patterns, often appearing in pairs or small groups.
    *   `2`: Also forms patterns, often 2x2 blocks, but seems irrelevant to the output based on the examples.
4.  **Key Pattern:** The examples strongly suggest that the transformation focuses on structures formed by the value `1`. Specifically, 2x2 blocks composed entirely of `1`s seem crucial.
    
```
    1 1
    1 1
    ```

5.  **Transformation:** The process appears to involve identifying these 2x2 blocks of `1`s within the input grid. The number of such blocks dictates the number of `1`s in the output list. The output list always has a fixed length of 5, padded with `0`s if necessary.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
      value_0_role: Background
      value_1_role: Forms target patterns
      value_2_role: Present but appears irrelevant to output

  - name: Target Pattern
    type: Object
    description: A 2x2 block composed entirely of the value 1.
    properties:
      value: 1
      shape: 2x2 square
      size: 4 cells

  - name: Connected Component (of 1s)
    type: Object Grouping
    description: A set of cells with value 1 that are connected horizontally or vertically.
    properties:
      value: 1
      connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right)
      potential_shapes: single cell, line, L-shape, 2x2 block, etc.

  - name: Output List
    type: List
    properties:
      length: 5
      cell_values: [0, 1]
      content_determination: Based on the count of Target Patterns found in the Input Grid.

relationships:
  - description: The output list's content depends on the identification and count of the Target Pattern within the Input Grid.
  - description: Each instance of the Target Pattern found corresponds to one '1' in the output list.
  - description: The Target Pattern is a specific type of Connected Component (of 1s), specifically one that has size 4 and forms a 2x2 square.

actions:
  - name: Identify Connected Components
    input: Input Grid, Value 1
    output: List of Connected Components (of 1s)
    method: Iterate through the grid, use BFS or DFS for cells with value 1, avoiding revisits.

  - name: Filter for Target Pattern
    input: List of Connected Components (of 1s)
    output: Count of components matching the Target Pattern criteria (size 4 and 2x2 shape).

  - name: Generate Output List
    input: Count of Target Patterns
    output: Output List
    method: Create a list with '1' repeated 'Count' times. Pad with '0's to reach a total length of 5.

constants:
  - name: Output Length
    value: 5
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_list`.
2.  Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set or a boolean grid) to keep track of visited cells in the input grid, initially marking all as unvisited.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` from row 0 to 8 and column 0 to 8 of the input grid.
4.  If the cell `(r, c)` contains the value `1` and has not been visited:
    a.  Start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from `(r, c)` to find all connected cells containing `1` (using 4-directional adjacency: up, down, left, right).
    b.  Store all coordinates `(nr, nc)` belonging to this connected component.
    c.  Mark all cells in this component as visited in the tracking structure.
    d.  Check if this connected component forms a 2x2 block:
        i.  Verify the component contains exactly 4 cells.
        ii. If it has 4 cells, find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among the component's coordinates.
        iii. Check if `max_r - min_r == 1` AND `max_c - min_c == 1`.
    e.  If the component is confirmed to be a 2x2 block of `1`s, append the value `1` to the `output_list`.
5.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, determine the current length of `output_list`.
6.  Append the value `0` to `output_list` repeatedly until its total length is 5.
7.  Return the final `output_list`.
