task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
      value_0_role: Background
      value_1_role: Forms target patterns
      value_2_role: Present but appears irrelevant to output

  - name: Target Pattern
    type: Object
    description: A 2x2 block composed entirely of the value 1.
    properties:
      value: 1
      shape: 2x2 square
      size: 4 cells

  - name: Connected Component (of 1s)
    type: Object Grouping
    description: A set of cells with value 1 that are connected horizontally or vertically.
    properties:
      value: 1
      connectivity: 4-directional (up, down, left, right)
      potential_shapes: single cell, line, L-shape, 2x2 block, etc.

  - name: Output List
    type: List
    properties:
      length: 5
      cell_values: [0, 1]
      content_determination: Based on the count of Target Patterns found in the Input Grid.

relationships:
  - description: The output list's content depends on the identification and count of the Target Pattern within the Input Grid.
  - description: Each instance of the Target Pattern found corresponds to one '1' in the output list.
  - description: The Target Pattern is a specific type of Connected Component (of 1s), specifically one that has size 4 and forms a 2x2 square.

actions:
  - name: Identify Connected Components
    input: Input Grid, Value 1
    output: List of Connected Components (of 1s)
    method: Iterate through the grid, use BFS or DFS for cells with value 1, avoiding revisits.

  - name: Filter for Target Pattern
    input: List of Connected Components (of 1s)
    output: Count of components matching the Target Pattern criteria (size 4 and 2x2 shape).

  - name: Generate Output List
    input: Count of Target Patterns
    output: Output List
    method: Create a list with '1' repeated 'Count' times. Pad with '0's to reach a total length of 5.

constants:
  - name: Output Length
    value: 5
