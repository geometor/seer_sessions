"""
For each input line (represented as a list of integers):
1. Determine the total length `L` of the input line.
2. Identify the initial contiguous subsequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the line (`S_initial`).
3. Determine the length `N` of `S_initial`.
4. If `N` is 0, return the line unchanged.
5. Extract the first number from `S_initial` (`first_element`).
6. Extract the subsequence containing all elements of `S_initial` except the first one (`tail_sequence`). The length is `N - 1`.
7. Calculate the number of times `first_element` needs to be repeated: `num_repeats = L - N - (N - 1)`.
8. Construct the output line by concatenating: `S_initial`, `first_element` repeated `num_repeats` times, and `tail_sequence`.
