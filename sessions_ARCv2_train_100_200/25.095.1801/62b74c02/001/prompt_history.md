Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Structure:** The input and output consist of multiple lines. Each line represents an independent transformation instance.
2.  **Line Content:** Each line is a sequence of space-separated integers.
3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input line starts with a sequence of non-zero integers, followed by a sequence of zeros padding the line to a certain length.
4.  **Output Pattern:** Each output line has the same length as the corresponding input line. It starts with the same initial sequence of non-zero integers found in the input. The zeros from the input are replaced by a new sequence. This new sequence consists of repetitions of the *first* number from the initial sequence, followed by the *rest* of the numbers from the initial sequence (excluding the first one).
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves identifying the initial non-zero sequence, using its first element for repetition, and its remaining elements as a suffix, to fill the space originally occupied by zeros. The total length of the line remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: line
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers
      - structure: initial non-zero subsequence followed by zero padding
      - length: L (variable per example, constant within line transformation)
  - object: initial_sequence (S_initial)
    properties:
      - type: subsequence of integers
      - location: prefix of the input line
      - content: all non-zero elements at the start
      - length: N
  - object: first_element
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - source: the first element of S_initial
  - object: tail_sequence
    properties:
      - type: subsequence of integers
      - source: all elements of S_initial except the first
      - length: N - 1
  - object: zero_padding
    properties:
      - type: subsequence of integers
      - content: consists only of zeros
      - location: follows S_initial in the input line
      - length: L - N
  - object: middle_fill
    properties:
      - type: subsequence of integers
      - content: repetitions of first_element
      - length: calculated based on other lengths (L - N - (N - 1))
  - object: output_line
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers
      - length: L (same as input line)
      - structure: concatenation of S_initial, middle_fill, and tail_sequence

relationships:
  - input_line transforms_to output_line
  - output_line length equals input_line length
  - S_initial is the prefix of both input_line (before zeros) and output_line
  - tail_sequence is the suffix of the output_line's generated part
  - middle_fill content is determined by first_element
  - middle_fill length is determined by L, N

actions:
  - identify: S_initial in the input line
  - extract: first_element from S_initial
  - extract: tail_sequence from S_initial
  - calculate: length of middle_fill needed (num_repeats = L - N - (N - 1))
  - generate: middle_fill by repeating first_element num_repeats times
  - construct: output_line by concatenating S_initial, middle_fill, tail_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

For each input line:
1.  Determine the total length `L` of the input line.
2.  Identify the initial contiguous subsequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the line. Call this `S_initial`.
3.  Determine the length `N` of `S_initial`.
4.  If `N` is less than 1 (i.e., the line starts with 0 or is empty), handle as an edge case (though not present in examples, likely output the line unchanged or handle based on specific rules). Assuming N >= 1 based on examples.
5.  Extract the first number from `S_initial`. Call this `first_element`.
6.  Extract the subsequence containing all elements of `S_initial` *except* the first one. Call this `tail_sequence`. The length of `tail_sequence` is `N - 1`.
7.  Calculate the number of times `first_element` needs to be repeated to fill the middle section: `num_repeats = L - N - (N - 1)`.
8.  Construct the output line by concatenating:
    *   The `S_initial` sequence.
    *   The `first_element` repeated `num_repeats` times.
    *   The `tail_sequence`.
9.  Format the output line with space-separated integers.
