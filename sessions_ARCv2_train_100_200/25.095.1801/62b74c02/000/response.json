Each line represents an independent transformation instance.\n2.  **Line Content:** Each line is a sequence of space-separated integers.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** Each input line starts with a sequence of non-zero integers, followed by a sequence of zeros padding the line to a certain length.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** Each output line has the same length as the corresponding input line. It starts with the same initial sequence of non-zero integers found in the input. The zeros from the input are replaced by a new sequence. This new sequence consists of repetitions of the *first* number from the initial sequence, followed by the *rest* of the numbers from the initial sequence (excluding the first one).\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves identifying the initial non-zero sequence, using its first element for repetition, and its remaining elements as a suffix, to fill the space originally occupied by zeros. The total length of the line remains constant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
