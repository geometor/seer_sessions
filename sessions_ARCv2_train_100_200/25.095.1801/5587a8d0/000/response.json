This number acts as a \"background\" and is ignored in the core transformation logic, except possibly for its identification.\n4.  **Foreground Elements:** The transformation focuses on the non-background numbers present in the input grid.\n5.  **Key Property:** The crucial property of the non-background numbers seems to be their frequency or count within the input grid.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a square grid. Its structure consists of concentric square layers, where each layer is filled with a single, unique non-background number from the input.\n7.  **Nesting Order:** The order in which the non-background numbers appear in the nested layers of the output grid (from the center outwards) is"
