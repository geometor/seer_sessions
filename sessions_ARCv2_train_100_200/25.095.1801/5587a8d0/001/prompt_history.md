Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are grids (2D arrays) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Transformation Goal:** The task requires transforming the input grid into a typically smaller output grid based on the properties of the numbers within the input.
3.  **Background Identification:** In each example, one number appears much more frequently than others (e.g., 7 in all examples). This number acts as a "background" and is ignored in the core transformation logic, except possibly for its identification.
4.  **Foreground Elements:** The transformation focuses on the non-background numbers present in the input grid.
5.  **Key Property:** The crucial property of the non-background numbers seems to be their frequency or count within the input grid.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a square grid. Its structure consists of concentric square layers, where each layer is filled with a single, unique non-background number from the input.
7.  **Nesting Order:** The order in which the non-background numbers appear in the nested layers of the output grid (from the center outwards) is
