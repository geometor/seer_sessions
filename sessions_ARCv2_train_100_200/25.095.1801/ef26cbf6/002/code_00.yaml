Objects:
  - Grid: Input/output numerical matrix.
  - Cell: Individual element with row, column, value.
  - SeparatorRow: Row where all values are 4.
  - SeparatorColumn: Column containing the value 4 (often aligned with SeparatorRows).
  - Block: A contiguous horizontal subgrid between SeparatorRows (or grid boundaries).
    Properties:
      - row_span: (start_row, end_row)
      - characteristic_numbers: Set of unique values in the Block, excluding 0, 1, and 4.
      - unique_characteristic_count: Count of elements in characteristic_numbers.
  - VerticalRegion: A contiguous vertical subgrid within a Block, defined by SeparatorColumns.
    Properties:
      - col_span: (start_col, end_col)
  - PlaceholderCell: A Cell with value 1, marking a location for replacement.
  - TargetValue: A non-zero, non-1, non-4 number used for replacement.

Relationships:
  - Grid `contains` Blocks and SeparatorRows.
  - SeparatorRows `define_boundaries_of` Blocks.
  - SeparatorColumns `define_boundaries_of` VerticalRegions within Blocks.
  - The first Block `determines` the transformation mode based on its `unique_characteristic_count`.
  - PlaceholderCells `are_replaced_by` TargetValues.
  - In Mode 1, the TargetValue for a PlaceholderCell `is_derived_from` the unique characteristic number of the Block containing the cell.
  - In Mode 2, the TargetValue for a PlaceholderCell in subsequent Blocks `is_derived_from` the characteristic number of the corresponding VerticalRegion in the first Block.

Actions:
  - identify_separator_rows: Find rows containing only 4s.
  - partition_grid_into_blocks: Use SeparatorRows to segment the grid.
  - find_block_characteristic_numbers: Identify unique non-zero, non-1, non-4 values within a Block.
  - count_first_block_characteristics: Determine the count for mode selection.
  - identify_separator_columns: Find columns containing 4s.
  - define_vertical_regions: Use SeparatorColumns to segment columns.
  - map_region_to_characteristic: (Mode 2) Find the characteristic number within each VerticalRegion of the first Block.
  - replace_placeholders_mode1: For each Block, replace its PlaceholderCells with its single characteristic number.
  - replace_placeholders_mode2: For Blocks after the first, replace PlaceholderCells based on the characteristic number mapped to their VerticalRegion from the first Block.
  - copy_unchanged_cells: Preserve values of cells that are not Placeholders (0s, 4s, original characteristics).
  - reconstruct_grid: Assemble processed Blocks and SeparatorRows.
