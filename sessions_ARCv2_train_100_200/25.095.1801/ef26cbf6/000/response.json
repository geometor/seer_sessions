The core transformation logic appears to operate differently depending on the properties of the *first* block.\n4.  **Characteristic Numbers:** Within each block (or sometimes region), certain non-zero numbers (that are not '4') seem important. These act as identifiers or replacement values. Examples are '7', '3', '8' in `train_1` and '3', '2', '6' in `train_2`.\n5.  **Placeholder (Value 1):** The number '1' acts as a placeholder in the input grid. Its presence indicates a location where a replacement needs to occur.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core task is to replace the placeholder '1's with appropriate Characteristic Numbers. The method for determining the correct Characteristic Number depends on a condition related to the first block.\n    *   **Mode 1 (Block-local replacement):** If the first block contains exactly one unique Characteristic Number, then *each* block finds its *own* unique Characteristic Number, and uses that number to replace the '1's *within that same block*. (`train_1` follows this mode).\n    *   **Mode 2 (First-block reference):** If the first block contains zero or more than one unique Characteristic Number, then the first block remains unchanged. For *subsequent* blocks, the '1's are replaced by Characteristic Numbers found in the *first* block, based on matching vertical regions. (`train_2` follows this mode).\n7.  **Other Values (Value 0):** The number '0' appears to be a background or empty value, generally remaining unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
