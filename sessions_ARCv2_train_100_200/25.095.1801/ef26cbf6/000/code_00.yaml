Objects:
  - Grid: Represents the entire input or output data structure.
    Properties:
      - rows: Number of rows.
      - columns: Number of columns.
      - cells: Collection of Cell objects.
  - Block: A horizontal sub-section of the Grid, separated by SeparatorRows.
    Properties:
      - start_row: Starting row index.
      - end_row: Ending row index.
      - characteristic_numbers: Set of unique non-zero, non-4 numbers within the Block.
  - Cell: An individual element within the Grid/Block.
    Properties:
      - row: Row index.
      - column: Column index.
      - value: The number contained in the cell (0, 1, 4, or other).
  - SeparatorRow: A row consisting entirely of the value 4.
    Properties:
      - row_index: The index of the separator row.
  - VerticalRegion: A vertical sub-section within a Block, defined by SeparatorColumns (columns containing 4s).
    Properties:
      - start_col: Starting column index.
      - end_col: Ending column index.
      - source_characteristic_number: The characteristic number found in the corresponding region of the first block (relevant for Mode 2).
  - Placeholder: A specific cell value (1) indicating a target for replacement.
  - CharacteristicNumber: A non-zero, non-4 value used for identification or replacement.

Relationships:
  - Grid `contains` Blocks.
  - SeparatorRows `separate` Blocks within a Grid.
  - Columns containing 4s `define` VerticalRegions within Blocks.
  - Cells `belong_to` a Block and potentially a VerticalRegion.
  - Blocks `have` CharacteristicNumbers.
  - Placeholders `are_replaced_by` CharacteristicNumbers based on transformation rules.

Actions:
  - split_grid_into_blocks: Using SeparatorRows.
  - find_characteristic_numbers: Within a specified Block or VerticalRegion.
  - count_unique_characteristic_numbers: For the first Block.
  - identify_vertical_regions: Based on columns containing 4s.
  - determine_transformation_mode: Based on the count of unique characteristic numbers in the first Block.
  - replace_placeholders: Applying the rules of the determined mode.
  - copy_cell_value: For cells that are not placeholders or part of the transformation.
  - reconstruct_grid: Combining processed Blocks and SeparatorRows.
