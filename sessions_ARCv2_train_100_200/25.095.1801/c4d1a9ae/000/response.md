Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of numbers (integers). The dimensions of the grid remain constant (10 rows, 8 columns in the examples).
2.  **Content:** The grids contain numerical values. The range of values differs between the two examples (`train_1` uses 2, 4, 5, 6; `train_2` uses 0, 3, 4, 9).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying the globally most frequent number in the input grid (let's call it the `target_value`) and selectively replacing instances of this `target_value` based on the values in their local neighborhood. Other numbers seem to remain unchanged.
4.  **Target Values:** In `train_1`, the most frequent value is 4. In `train_2`, the most frequent value is 0. These are the values being replaced.
5.  **Replacement Logic:** When a `target_value` cell is replaced, its new value seems determined by the values of its neighbors (specifically, the non-`target_value` neighbors in the 3x3 area *excluding* the cell itself). The rule appears to involve finding the mode (most frequent value) among these valid neighbors.
6.  **Mode Mapping:** There seems to be a fixed mapping applied to the calculated mode to determine the final replacement value. (e.g., if the mode of non-target neighbors is 4, the cell becomes 3; if the mode is 9, the cell becomes 4, etc.).
7.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple values are tied for the mode
