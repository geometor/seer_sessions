The numbers used in the input grids are 0, 9, and 4.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output consists of grids of numbers with dimensions 3 rows by 5 columns. The numbers used in the output grids are 0 and 6.\n3.  **Structure:** The input grid appears visually and numerically separated into two halves:\n    *   The top 3 rows contain primarily 0s and 9s.\n    *   The bottom 3 rows contain primarily 0s and 4s.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation reduces the number of rows from 6 to 3 while keeping the number of columns (5) the same. The values are transformed: 9s and 4s from the input seem to influence the placement of 6s in the output, while 0s often remain 0s unless combined with a 9 or 4. The process involves comparing corresponding cells from the top and bottom halves of the input grid.\n\n## Task Facts\n\n"
