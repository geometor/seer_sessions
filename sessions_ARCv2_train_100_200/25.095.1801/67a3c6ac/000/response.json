The input and output grids consistently share the same dimensions in each example pair. The core transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid. The numbers within each row are rearranged, but the set of numbers within a given row remains the same between the input and output, just in a different order. Comparing the input and output rows suggests a spatial reversal or reflection along the vertical axis.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
