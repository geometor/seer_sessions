objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - rows: ordered sequence of 1D arrays
      - columns: ordered sequence of 1D arrays
      - elements: integers
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - rows: ordered sequence of 1D arrays

      - elements: integers
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
  - name: row
    type: 1D array of integers (horizontal slice of the grid)
    properties:

    results_in: output_grid
  - type: correspondence
    from: input_grid row at index `i`
    to: output_grid row at index `i`

actions:
  - name: horizontal_reversal
    operates_on: row
    description: Reverses the order of elements within a row. The first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
