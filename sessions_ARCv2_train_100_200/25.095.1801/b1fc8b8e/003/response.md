"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid containing a pattern of 8s into a 5x5 output grid. 
The transformation rule depends on the width of the bounding box enclosing the 8s 
in the input grid. Specifically:
1. Find all coordinates where the value is 8 in the input grid.
2. Calculate the bounding box of these coordinates.
3. Determine the width of the bounding box (max_col - min_col + 1).
4. Select one of two predefined 2x5 base patterns based on the width:
   - If width is 6, select Pattern A: [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
   - If width is 5, select Pattern B: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
5. Construct the 5x5 output grid using the selected base pattern:
   - Rows 0, 1 are the selected base pattern.
   - Row 2 is all zeros [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   - Rows 3, 4 are the selected base pattern again.
