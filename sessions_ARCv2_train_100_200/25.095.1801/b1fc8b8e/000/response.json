The arrangement of the number 8 forms visual patterns that resemble digits (specifically 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the examples). The number 0 acts as the background.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is consistently a 5x5 grid, also composed of integers 0 and 8.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to be a direct pixel-wise mapping or simple cropping/resizing of the input. Instead, the entire input grid, specifically the shape formed by the '8's, seems to determine which *one of two specific predefined 5x5 patterns* is produced as output.\n4.  **Output Patterns:** There are only two distinct output patterns observed across all examples:\n    *   Pattern 1 (seen in train\\_1, train\\_2):\n        "

The difference lies in the specific pattern of the top two (and bottom two) rows.\n5.  **Classification Logic:** The key is to figure out what property of the input grid/digit determines whether Output Pattern 1 or Output Pattern 2 is generated. Comparing inputs that lead to Pattern 1 (digits '2', '3') versus those leading to Pattern 2 (digits '4', '5', '6'), the distinguishing feature appears to be the width of the bounding box enclosing the '8's in the input grid.\n    *   Inputs '2' and '3' have bounding box widths of 5 and 6, respectively. They map to Output Pattern 1.\n    *   Inputs '4', '5', and '6' all have a bounding box width of 4. They map to Output Pattern 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
