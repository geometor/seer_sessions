Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of the elements of the task:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input is consistently a 6x6 grid composed of integers 0 and 8. The arrangement of the number 8 forms visual patterns that resemble digits (specifically 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the examples). The number 0 acts as the background.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is consistently a 5x5 grid, also composed of integers 0 and 8.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to be a direct pixel-wise mapping or simple cropping/resizing of the input. Instead, the entire input grid, specifically the shape formed by the '8's, seems to determine which *one of two specific predefined 5x5 patterns* is produced as output.
4.  **Output Patterns:** There are only two distinct output patterns observed across all examples:
    *   Pattern 1 (seen in train\_1, train\_2):
        
```
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    *   Pattern 2 (seen in train\_3, train\_4, train\_5):
        
```
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    Both patterns share a common structure: a middle row of all zeros, and the bottom two rows are identical to the top two rows. The difference lies in the specific pattern of the top two (and bottom two) rows.
5.  **Classification Logic:** The key is to figure out what property of the input grid/digit determines whether Output Pattern 1 or Output Pattern 2 is generated. Comparing inputs that lead to Pattern 1 (digits '2', '3') versus those leading to Pattern 2 (digits '4', '5', '6'), the distinguishing feature appears to be the width of the bounding box enclosing the '8's in the input grid.
    *   Inputs '2' and '3' have bounding box widths of 5 and 6, respectively. They map to Output Pattern 1.
    *   Inputs '4', '5', and '6' all have a bounding box width of 4. They map to Output Pattern 2.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input 6x6 grid.
2.  Locate all cells containing the value 8.
3.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses all cells with the value 8. Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) among these cells.
4.  Calculate the width of this bounding box as `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
5.  Define two template 2x5 row patterns:
    *   `Pattern A` = `[[8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]`
    *   `Pattern B` = `[[0, 8, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]`
6.  Select the template pattern based on the calculated `width`:
    *   If the `width` is 5 or 6, select `Pattern A`.
    *   If the `width` is 4, select `Pattern B`.
7.  Construct the final 5x5 output grid:
    *   Set the first two rows (rows 0 and 1) to the selected template pattern.
    *   Set the third row (row 2) to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   Set the last two rows (rows 3 and 4) to be identical to the first two rows (i.e., the selected template pattern).
8.  Output the resulting 5x5 grid.
