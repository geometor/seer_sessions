"""
Processes an input structure containing two 4x4 grids (Grid A and Grid B)
separated by a line of '4 4 4 4'. It generates a 4x4 output grid where
each cell's value depends on the corresponding cells in Grid A and Grid B.
The rule is: if the value in Grid A at (r, c) is 1 OR the value in Grid B
at (r, c) is 2, the output cell at (r, c) is 3. Otherwise, the output cell
is 0.
