The output grid is always smaller than or equal in size to the input grid.\n2.  **Content:** The input grids feature multiple \"objects\" or \"shapes\" composed of identical non-zero digits, set against a background of zeros (0). These objects appear to be connected components where connectivity is defined by adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells sharing the same non-zero digit.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation isolates one specific object from the input grid and presents it as the output. The output grid seems to be the smallest rectangular bounding box that fully encloses the selected object, preserving the original digits within that box from the input grid.\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the objects present in the input with the object shown in the output across all examples, the rule for selecting the object appears to be based on its size. Specifically, the object selected is the one composed of the largest number of connected cells (largest connected component of a non-zero digit). In all provided examples, the object with the most cells is uniquely determined.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Consider cells connected if they share an edge (horizontally or vertically).\n2.  For each identified component, calculate its size by counting the number of cells it comprises.\n3.  Determine the maximum size found among all components.\n4.  Select the connected component that corresponds to this maximum size. (Based on the examples, assume there is only one such largest component).\n5.  Find the minimum bounding box of the selected component. This involves finding the minimum row index, maximum row index, minimum column index, and maximum column index occupied by any cell of this component.\n6.  Extract the rectangular subgrid from the input grid defined by these bounding box coordinates (from minimum row to maximum row, and minimum column to maximum column, inclusive).\n7.  The extracted subgrid is the final output grid."
