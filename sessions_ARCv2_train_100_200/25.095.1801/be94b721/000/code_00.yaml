task_description: Extract the largest connected component of non-zero digits and its bounding box.

elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains digits 0-9
      - contains connected components of non-zero digits (objects)
      - contains background zeros
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - contains digits 0-9
      - represents a subgrid of the input
      - corresponds to the bounding box of the selected object

objects:
  - type: connected_component
    properties:
      - composed of identical non-zero digits
      - connectivity: horizontal and vertical adjacency
      - size: number of cells in the component
      - digit_value: the digit forming the component
      - bounding_box: minimum rectangular area enclosing the component (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)

actions:
  - identify_components: Find all connected components of identical non-zero digits in the input grid.
  - calculate_sizes: Determine the number of cells (size) for each identified component.
  - find_largest_component: Select the component with the maximum size. Assume uniqueness based on examples.
  - determine_bounding_box: Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices for the selected largest component.
  - extract_subgrid: Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box.

relationships:
  - selection: The component chosen for output is the one with the largest size (cell count).
  - output_derivation: The output grid is a direct rectangular slice (subgrid) of the input grid, defined by the bounding box of the largest component.
