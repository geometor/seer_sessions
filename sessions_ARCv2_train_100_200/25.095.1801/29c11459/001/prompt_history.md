Okay, I will analyze the provided task examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
2.  **Key Elements:** The most prominent elements are the non-zero numbers present in the input grid. The vast majority of the grid cells contain zeros.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation occurs on rows containing at least two non-zero numbers. The zeros located horizontally *between* these non-zero numbers are replaced with other non-zero numbers in the output.
4.  **Filling Rule:**
    *   The non-zero numbers from the input grid remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.
    *   Zeros outside the horizontal span between non-zero numbers on a row remain zero.
    *   For zeros *between* two non-zero numbers on the same row, the fill value appears to be determined by proximity to the nearest non-zero "anchor" number on that row.
    *   If a zero is closer to the left non-zero number, it takes the value of the left number.
    *   If a zero is closer to the right non-zero number, it takes the value of the right number.
    *   If a zero is exactly equidistant between the two non-zero numbers, it is filled with the value `5`.
5.  **Scope:** The filling process seems confined to individual rows; there's no apparent interaction between different rows.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Filling horizontal segments between non-zero numbers in a grid based on proximity.

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 5x11 in example 1, 5x11 in example 2)
  - background_value: 0

objects:
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
  - name: non_zero_anchor
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
    identification: A cell with value > 0 in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: non_zero_anchor objects
    on: the same row
    condition: Applies when two or more non_zero_anchors exist on a single row.
  - type: containment
    description: Zero-valued cells located horizontally between two adjacent non_zero_anchors on the same row.

actions:
  - name: identify_anchors
    description: Find all non_zero_anchor objects and their positions in each row of the input grid.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: For each row with two or more anchors, iterate through the cells between adjacent anchors.
    details:
      - target_cells: Cells with value 0 between column `c1+1` and `c2-1`, where `c1` and `c2` are the column indices of adjacent anchors.
      - rule: Determine the fill value based on distance to the left anchor (`val1` at `c1`) and the right anchor (`val2` at `c2`).
      - distance_calculation:
          - dist_left = current_column - c1
          - dist_right = c2 - current_column
      - fill_logic:
          - if dist_left < dist_right: fill with val1
          - if dist_right < dist_left: fill with val2
          - if dist_left == dist_right: fill with 5
  - name: preserve_values
    description: Keep original non_zero_anchor values and zeros not within a fill segment unchanged.

output_generation:
  - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Copy all original non_zero_anchor values to the output grid.
  - Apply the fill_segment action to the relevant zero cells.
  - Copy all remaining zero cells.

constants:
  - name: midpoint_fill_value
    value: 5

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid (let the current row index be `r`).
3.  Find all non-zero numbers ("anchors") in the current row `r`. Record their values and column indices. Store them as pairs `(value, column_index)`, sorted by column index.
4.  If there are fewer than two anchors in the current row `r`:
    *   Copy all values from the input row `r` directly to the output row `r`.
    *   Continue to the next row.
5.  If there are two or more anchors in the current row `r`:
    *   Iterate through adjacent pairs of anchors. Let the left anchor be `(val1, c1)` and the right anchor be `(val2, c2)`.
    *   Copy the anchor values `val1` and `val2` to their respective positions `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` in the output grid.
    *   Iterate through the columns `c` from `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1`.
    *   For each column `c`:
        *   Calculate the distance to the left anchor: `dist_left = c - c1`.
        *   Calculate the distance to the right anchor: `dist_right = c2 - c`.
        *   If `dist_left < dist_right`, set the output grid cell at `(r, c)` to `val1`.
        *   Else if `dist_right < dist_left`, set the output grid cell at `(r, c)` to `val2`.
        *   Else (if `dist_left == dist_right`), set the output grid cell at `(r, c)` to `5`.
    *   After processing all pairs of adjacent anchors for the row, ensure any remaining original zeros (outside the filled segments) are preserved in the output row. *(Self-correction: Step 1 initializes with zeros, and we only overwrite between anchors or at anchor positions, so remaining zeros are handled automatically)*.
6.  After iterating through all rows, return the completed output grid.
