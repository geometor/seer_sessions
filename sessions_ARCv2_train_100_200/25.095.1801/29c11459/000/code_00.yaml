task_description: Filling horizontal segments between non-zero numbers in a grid based on proximity.

grid_properties:
  - type: 2D array of integers
  - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 5x11 in example 1, 5x11 in example 2)
  - background_value: 0

objects:
  - name: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
  - name: non_zero_anchor
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
    identification: A cell with value > 0 in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    between: non_zero_anchor objects
    on: the same row
    condition: Applies when two or more non_zero_anchors exist on a single row.
  - type: containment
    description: Zero-valued cells located horizontally between two adjacent non_zero_anchors on the same row.

actions:
  - name: identify_anchors
    description: Find all non_zero_anchor objects and their positions in each row of the input grid.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: For each row with two or more anchors, iterate through the cells between adjacent anchors.
    details:
      - target_cells: Cells with value 0 between column `c1+1` and `c2-1`, where `c1` and `c2` are the column indices of adjacent anchors.
      - rule: Determine the fill value based on distance to the left anchor (`val1` at `c1`) and the right anchor (`val2` at `c2`).
      - distance_calculation:
          - dist_left = current_column - c1
          - dist_right = c2 - current_column
      - fill_logic:
          - if dist_left < dist_right: fill with val1
          - if dist_right < dist_left: fill with val2
          - if dist_left == dist_right: fill with 5
  - name: preserve_values
    description: Keep original non_zero_anchor values and zeros not within a fill segment unchanged.

output_generation:
  - Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
  - Copy all original non_zero_anchor values to the output grid.
  - Apply the fill_segment action to the relevant zero cells.
  - Copy all remaining zero cells.

constants:
  - name: midpoint_fill_value
    value: 5
