The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Key Elements:** The most prominent elements are the non-zero numbers present in the input grid. The vast majority of the grid cells contain zeros.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation occurs on rows containing at least two non-zero numbers. The zeros located horizontally *between* these non-zero numbers are replaced with other non-zero numbers in the output.\n4.  **Filling Rule:**\n    *   The non-zero numbers from the input grid remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.\n    *   Zeros outside the horizontal span between non-zero numbers on a row remain zero.\n    *   For zeros *between* two non-zero numbers on the same row, the fill value appears to be determined by proximity to the nearest non-zero \"anchor\" number on that row.\n    *   If a zero is closer to the left non-zero number, it takes the value of the left number.\n    *   If a zero is closer to the right non-zero number, it takes the value of the right number.\n    *   If a zero is exactly equidistant between the two non-zero numbers, it is filled with the value `5`.\n5.  **Scope:** The filling process seems confined to individual rows; there's no apparent interaction between different rows.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
