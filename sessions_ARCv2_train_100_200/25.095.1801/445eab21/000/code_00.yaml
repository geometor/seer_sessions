Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - size: 10x10
        - cells: list of lists of integers (0-9)
        - background_digit: 0
  - Shape:
      Properties:
        - digit: integer (non-zero)
        - cells: list of coordinate pairs (row, col) representing the shape's extent
        - area: integer (count of cells belonging to the shape)
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - size: 2x2
        - cells: list of lists of a single integer
        - fill_digit: integer

Relationships:
  - InputGrid contains exactly two distinct Shape objects.
  - Each Shape is composed of cells with the same non-zero digit.
  - OutputGrid's fill_digit is determined by the digit of one Shape from the InputGrid.

Actions:
  - Identify_Shapes: Find all connected components of non-zero cells in the InputGrid.
  - Calculate_Area: For each identified Shape, count the number of cells it occupies.
  - Determine_Digit: For each identified Shape, identify the non-zero digit it is composed of.
  - Select_Dominant_Shape: Compare the areas of the two Shapes and select the Shape with the larger area.
  - Generate_Output: Create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the digit of the Select_Dominant_Shape.
