            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 10x10 grid of single digits. The digit '0' appears to represent the background. Within the grid, there are two distinct connected components (shapes) formed by non-zero digits. Each shape is composed entirely of a single, unique non-zero digit.\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid. All cells in the output grid are filled with the same single digit.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the two non-zero shapes in the input grid, determining a property of these shapes, using that property to select one of the shapes, and then using the digit of the selected shape to construct the 2x2 output grid.\n4.  **Selection Logic:** By comparing the shapes in each example, it appears the selection criteria relates to the size or area (number of cells) of the shapes. The shape with the larger area dictates the digit used in the output grid.\n    *   `train_1`: Shape '6' (area 14) vs Shape '7' (area 16). Output is '7'.\n    *   `train_2`: Shape '7' (area 12) vs Shape '8' (area 14). Output is '8'.\n    *   `train_3`: Shape '4' (area 24) vs Shape '2' (area 8). Output is '4'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
