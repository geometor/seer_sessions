Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 10x10 grid of single digits. The digit '0' appears to represent the background. Within the grid, there are two distinct connected components (shapes) formed by non-zero digits. Each shape is composed entirely of a single, unique non-zero digit.
2.  **Output:** The output is always a 2x2 grid. All cells in the output grid are filled with the same single digit.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the two non-zero shapes in the input grid, determining a property of these shapes, using that property to select one of the shapes, and then using the digit of the selected shape to construct the 2x2 output grid.
4.  **Selection Logic:** By comparing the shapes in each example, it appears the selection criteria relates to the size or area (number of cells) of the shapes. The shape with the larger area dictates the digit used in the output grid.
    *   `train_1`: Shape '6' (area 14) vs Shape '7' (area 16). Output is '7'.
    *   `train_2`: Shape '7' (area 12) vs Shape '8' (area 14). Output is '8'.
    *   `train_3`: Shape '4' (area 24) vs Shape '2' (area 8). Output is '4'.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - size: 10x10
        - cells: list of lists of integers (0-9)
        - background_digit: 0
  - Shape:
      Properties:
        - digit: integer (non-zero)
        - cells: list of coordinate pairs (row, col) representing the shape's extent
        - area: integer (count of cells belonging to the shape)
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - size: 2x2
        - cells: list of lists of a single integer
        - fill_digit: integer

Relationships:
  - InputGrid contains exactly two distinct Shape objects.
  - Each Shape is composed of cells with the same non-zero digit.
  - OutputGrid's fill_digit is determined by the digit of one Shape from the InputGrid.

Actions:
  - Identify_Shapes: Find all connected components of non-zero cells in the InputGrid.
  - Calculate_Area: For each identified Shape, count the number of cells it occupies.
  - Determine_Digit: For each identified Shape, identify the non-zero digit it is composed of.
  - Select_Dominant_Shape: Compare the areas of the two Shapes and select the Shape with the larger area.
  - Generate_Output: Create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the digit of the Select_Dominant_Shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input 10x10 grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected components (shapes) formed by non-zero digits. There will be exactly two such shapes. Treat cells connected horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as part of the same component.
3.  For each identified shape:
    a.  Determine the non-zero digit that constitutes the shape.
    b.  Calculate the area of the shape by counting the total number of cells belonging to it.
4.  Compare the areas calculated for the two shapes.
5.  Select the shape that has the larger area.
6.  Retrieve the digit associated with the selected (larger area) shape.
7.  Construct a 2x2 output grid where every cell contains the digit retrieved in the previous step.
