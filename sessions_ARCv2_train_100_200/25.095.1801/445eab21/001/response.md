Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the two distinct connected components (shapes) of non-zero digits in the 10x10 input grid. Connectivity is defined horizontally and vertically.
2. Calculate the area (number of cells) for each shape.
3. Determine the digit associated with each shape.
4. Select the shape with the larger area.
