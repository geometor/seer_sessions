Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of integers, specifically 9x9 in the examples.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids primarily contain the value 0, with a few instances of the value 5 scattered throughout.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain values 0, 1, and 5. The locations of the 1s and 5s in the output seem related to the locations of the 5s in the input.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** Observing the relationship between an input 5 and the output, it appears that each 5 in the input generates a 3x3 pattern in the output, centered at the original location of the 5.
5.  **The 3x3 Pattern:** The specific pattern generated seems to be:
    
```
    5 1 5
    1 0 1
    5 1 5
    ```

    Note that the center of this pattern (corresponding to the original input 5's location) becomes 0 in the output pattern itself.
6.  **Overlap Handling:** In cases where multiple input 5s are close enough for their generated 3x3 patterns to overlap in the output grid (e.g., `train_1` output around row 6/7, col 2/3 and row 6/7 col 6/7), the non-zero values (1s and 5s) from the patterns seem to be placed onto the grid. If a cell is targeted by multiple patterns, the non-zero value appears to overwrite any existing 0. The examples don't explicitly show overlaps between two non-zero values (like a 1 and a 5, or two 1s), but the logic suggests a simple placement/overwrite mechanism where non-zero values prevail over zero.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 2D Array
  dimensions: 9x9 (based on examples)
  cell_values: Integer
InputGrid:
  inherits: Grid
  cell_values: [0, 5]
OutputGrid:
  inherits: Grid
  cell_values: [0, 1, 5]
Transformation:
  trigger_value: 5 (in input grid)
  action: Generates a pattern in the output grid
Pattern:
  type: 3x3 Array
  structure:
    - [5, 1, 5]
    - [1, 0, 1]
    - [5, 1, 5]
  placement: Centered at the location of the trigger_value in the input grid
  overlay_rule: Non-zero pattern values overwrite existing values in the target output grid cell (starting from an all-zero grid).
Relationship:
  - Each cell containing '5' in the input grid corresponds to the center of a 3x3 pattern applied to the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an `output_grid` of the same dimensions as the `input_grid`, filling it entirely with zeros.
2.  Define the `pattern` as the 3x3 matrix: `[[5, 1, 5], [1, 0, 1], [5, 1, 5]]`.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the `input_grid` at coordinates `(row, col)`.
4.  If the value `input_grid[row][col]` is 5:
    a.  Iterate through the rows of the `pattern` using a relative row index `pattern_row_idx` from 0 to 2 (representing relative offsets -1, 0, 1).
    b.  Iterate through the columns of the `pattern` using a relative column index `pattern_col_idx` from 0 to 2 (representing relative offsets -1, 0, 1).
    c.  Calculate the target coordinates in the `output_grid`: `target_row = row + (pattern_row_idx - 1)`, `target_col = col + (pattern_col_idx - 1)`.
    d.  Check if `target_row` and `target_col` are valid coordinates within the bounds of the `output_grid`.
    e.  If the target coordinates are valid:
        i.  Get the `pattern_value` from `pattern[pattern_row_idx][pattern_col_idx]`.
        ii. If `pattern_value` is not zero (i.e., it's 1 or 5), update the `output_grid` at the target coordinates: `output_grid[target_row][target_col] = pattern_value`.
5.  After iterating through all input cells, return the final `output_grid`.
