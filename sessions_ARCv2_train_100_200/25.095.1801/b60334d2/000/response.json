The locations of the 1s and 5s in the output seem related to the locations of the 5s in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** Observing the relationship between an input 5 and the output, it appears that each 5 in the input generates a 3x3 pattern in the output, centered at the original location of the 5.\n5.  **The 3x3 Pattern:** The specific pattern generated seems to be:\n    "

If a cell is targeted by multiple patterns, the non-zero value appears to overwrite any existing 0. The examples don't explicitly show overlaps between two non-zero values (like a 1 and a 5, or two 1s), but the logic suggests a simple placement/overwrite mechanism where non-zero values prevail over zero.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
