*   **Perception:** The task involves processing 2D grids containing numerical values. The input grids feature patterns resembling the letter 'U', formed by repeating a single non-zero digit. The core transformation involves identifying these 'U' shapes and placing a specific marker ('4') in the output grid based on the location of each 'U'. The output grid otherwise retains the structure and values of the input grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers
          - contains: elements (integers)
          - structure: rows and columns
      - name: U_shape
        properties:
          - composed_of: a single non-zero integer (N)
          - structure: 
              - horizontal bar: three adjacent N's in a row (r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2)
              - vertical legs: two N's below the ends of the bar (r+1, c), (r+1, c+2)
          - location: defined by top-left corner (r, c)
      - name: gap
        properties:
          - associated_with: U_shape
          - location: column index below the middle element of the U_shape's horizontal bar (c+1)
      - name: marker
        properties:
          - value: 4
          - role: indicates position relative to a U_shape in the output

    actions:
      - name: identify_U_shapes
        input: input grid
        output: list of U_shape locations and their constituent number (N)
        logic: Scan the grid for the specific 3x2 pattern defining a U_shape.
      - name: place_marker
        input: 
          - output grid (initially a copy of input)
          - identified U_shape
        output: modified output grid
        logic: For each identified U_shape, locate the column of its 'gap'. Place the marker '4' in this column at the last row of the grid.

    relationships:
      - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
      - The position of the 'marker' (4) in the output grid is determined by the column of the 'gap' associated with each 'U_shape' in the input grid and the grid's height.
      - Multiple 'U_shapes' can exist in a single input grid, each resulting in a corresponding 'marker' in the output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Iterate through each possible top-left position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid to detect 'U' shapes.
    3.  A 'U' shape is identified if:
        *   The cell at (`r`, `c`) contains a non-zero digit `N`.
        *   The cells at (`r`, `c+1`) and (`r`, `c+2`) also contain the digit `N`.
        *   The cells at (`r+1`, `c`) and (`r+1`, `c+2`) also contain the digit `N`.
        *   All these indices must be within the grid boundaries.
    4.  For every 'U' shape identified starting at (`r`, `c`):
        *   Determine the column index of the 'gap', which is `c + 1`.
        *   Determine the index of the last row of the grid (height - 1).
        *   Place the number `4` into the output grid at the position (last row index, gap column index).
    5.  Return the final output grid.
