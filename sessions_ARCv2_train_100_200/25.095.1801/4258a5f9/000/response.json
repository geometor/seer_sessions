            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of numbers. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Key Values:** The grids primarily contain the value 0. The significant values in the input are 5. The output contains the original 5s, but also introduces the value 1.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The value 5 appears to be a \"marker\" or \"source\" value. In the output grid, the original positions of the 5s are preserved. New values (1s) appear in the cells immediately surrounding (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) each 5 from the input grid.\n4.  **Overlap Handling:** In example 1, some locations are neighbors to multiple 5s (e.g., row 2, col 7 is below the 5 at (1,7) and to the right of the 5 at (2,6) - wait, the 5 is at (2,3)... let's recheck example 1. The 5s are at (1, 7), (2, 3), (5, 7), (7, 3). A cell like (2,7) is a neighbor of the 5 at (1,7). A cell like (6,3) is a neighbor of the 5 at (7,3). It seems if a cell is a neighbor to *any* 5, it becomes 1 in the output, unless it originally contained a 5 itself. The output value for these neighboring cells is always 1, regardless of how many 5s they are adjacent to.\n5.  **Boundary Conditions:** The generation of 1s respects the grid boundaries. If a 5 is near an edge or corner, 1s are only generated for valid neighboring positions within the grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
