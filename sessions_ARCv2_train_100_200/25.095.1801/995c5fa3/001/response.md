1. Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 4x4 subgrids using the columns of zeros at indices 4 and 9 as separators. The subgrids correspond to columns 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13.
2. For each of the three subgrids (processed in order from left to right):
    a. Examine the pattern formed by the digit '5'.
    b. Identify which of the four predefined patterns it matches:
        i. Solid Block: All 16 cells are '5'. Map this pattern to the number 2.
        ii. 'U' Shape: The top two rows are [5,5,5,5] and the bottom two rows are [5,0,0,5]. Map this pattern to the number 4.
        iii. Hollow Square: The top and bottom rows are [5,5,5,5] and the middle two rows are [5,0,0,5]. Map this pattern to the number 8.
        iv. Vertical Bars: The top and bottom rows are [5,5,5,5] and the middle two rows are [0,5,5,0]. Map this pattern to the number 3.
3. Record the mapped numbers for the first, second, and third subgrids as N1, N2, and N3, respectively.
4. Construct a 3x3 output grid.
5. Fill the first row of the output grid entirely with the number N1.
6. Fill the second row of the output grid entirely with the number N2.
7. Fill the third row of the output grid entirely with the number N3.
