The number 5 appears to represent the foreground or filled part of the pattern, while 0 represents the background or empty space within the subgrid's boundaries.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output is a 3x3 grid.\n6.  **Output Values:** Each row in the output grid consists of a single digit repeated three times. The digit used in each row corresponds to the pattern identified in the respective input subgrid.\n7.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the pattern in each of the three input subgrids and mapping that pattern to a specific output digit. These three digits then populate the rows of the output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
