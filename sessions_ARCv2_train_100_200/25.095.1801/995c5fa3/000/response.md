**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a grid of numbers (0s and 5s) with fixed dimensions (4 rows, 14 columns).
2.  **Separators:** Columns 4 and 9 consistently contain only 0s, acting as vertical separators.
3.  **Subgrids:** These separators divide the input grid into three distinct 4x4 subgrids (columns 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13).
4.  **Patterns:** Within each 4x4 subgrid, the arrangement of 5s forms one of four recognizable patterns. The number 5 appears to represent the foreground or filled part of the pattern, while 0 represents the background or empty space within the subgrid's boundaries.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output is a 3x3 grid.
6.  **Output Values:** Each row in the output grid consists of a single digit repeated three times. The digit used in each row corresponds to the pattern identified in the respective input subgrid.
7.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the pattern in each of the three input subgrids and mapping that pattern to a specific output digit. These three digits then populate the rows of the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 4x4 subgrids using the columns of zeros at indices 4 and 9 as separators. The subgrids correspond to columns 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13.
2.  For each of the three subgrids (processed in order from left to right):
    a.  Examine the pattern formed by the digit '5'.
    b.  Identify which of the four predefined patterns it matches:
        i.  **Solid Block:** All 16 cells are '5'. Map this pattern to the number `2`.
        ii. **'U' Shape:** The top two rows are `[5,5,5,5]` and the bottom two rows are `[5,0,0,5]`. Map this pattern to the number `4`.
        iii. **Hollow Square:** The top and bottom rows are `[5,5,5,5]` and the middle two rows are `[5,0,0,5]`. Map this pattern to the number `8`.
        iv. **Vertical Bars:** The top and bottom rows are `[5,5,5,5]` and the middle two rows are `[0,5,5,0]`. Map this pattern to the number `3`.
3.  Record the mapped numbers for the first, second, and third subgrids as N1, N2, and N3, respectively.
4.  Construct a 3x3 output grid.
5.  Fill the first row of the output grid entirely with the number N1.
6.  Fill the second row of the output grid entirely with the number N2.
7.  Fill the third row of the output grid entirely with the number N3.
