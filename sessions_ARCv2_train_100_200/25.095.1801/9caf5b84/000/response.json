The transformation rule appears to be consistent across all examples but depends on the statistical properties (specifically, digit frequencies) of the *entire* input grid. Each cell's transformation is determined by whether its digit belongs to a dynamically calculated \"stable set\". All digits not in the stable set are replaced by a constant digit, 7.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
