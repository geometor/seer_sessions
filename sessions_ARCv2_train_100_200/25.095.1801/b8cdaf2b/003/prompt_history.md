Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids containing single digits. The digit '0' acts as a background color.
2.  **Objects:** The non-zero digits form structures within the grid. A key structure appears consistently in the lower part of the input grid: a horizontal segment composed of one color (central color, C) flanked on both sides by another color (boundary color, B). Examples: `6 1 1 1 6`, `8 8 3 8 8`, `2 2 4 4 4 2 2`, `2 4 2`.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying this specific `B... C... B...` structure in the lowest part of the input grid and then adding new pixels of the central color (C) to the grid at locations *above* the identified structure. The original input structure remains in the output.
4.  **Propagation:** The placement of the new C-colored pixels follows specific rules based on the properties (colors B and C, and the number N of central C pixels) of the identified structure. There are two types of propagation:
    *   Diagonal: New C pixels appear vertically above the boundary B pixels. The vertical distance depends on B and N.
    *   Central: Sometimes, a new C pixel appears vertically above the center of the C segment. This also depends on B and N, and the vertical distance is consistently 2 rows up.

**YAML Facts:**

output_type: 2D grid of digits (same dimensions as input)
background_color: 0
objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: A horizontal structure found near the bottom of the input grid.
    properties:
      - central_color (C): The color of the central segment (non-zero, different from boundary_color).
      - boundary_color (B): The color flanking the central segment (non-zero, different from central_color).
      - central_segment_length (N): The number of contiguous pixels of the central_color.
      - row_index (r_orig): The row where the pattern is located.
      - boundary_left_col (c_left): The column index of the leftmost boundary pixel B relevant to the pattern.
      - boundary_right_col (c_right): The column index of the rightmost boundary pixel B relevant to the pattern.
      - central_mid_col (c_mid): The column index of the middle pixel of the central segment C (relevant if N is odd).
actions:
  - id: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input grid from bottom to top to find the first occurrence of the 'pattern' object.
    input: input grid
    output: pattern object properties (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right, c_mid)
  - id: calculate_shifts
    description: Determine the vertical shifts for propagation based on pattern properties.
    input: pattern object properties (B, N)
    output:
      - diagonal_vertical_shift (V_diag)
      - perform_central_propagation (boolean flag)
    logic:
      - V_diag = 3 if (B == 8) or (B == 2 and N > 1) else 2
      - perform_central_propagation = true if (N == 1 and B == 8) or (N > 1 and B == 2) else false
  - id: apply_propagation
    description: Add new pixels to the output grid based on calculated shifts and pattern properties.
    input: input grid, pattern object properties, shifts
    output: modified output grid
    steps:
      - Copy input grid to output grid.
      - Place C at (r_orig - V_diag, c_left) if within bounds.
      - Place C at (r_orig - V_diag, c_right) if within bounds.
      - If perform_central_propagation is true, place C at (r_orig - 2, c_mid) if within bounds.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by adding pixels.
  - The added pixels' color matches the central_color (C) of the identified pattern.
  - The locations of added pixels depend on the row (r_orig), boundary columns (c_left, c_right), middle column (c_mid), boundary color (B), and central segment length (N) of the identified pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid rows from bottom to top.
3.  Identify the first row (`r_orig`) that contains a horizontal pattern consisting of a contiguous block of one non-zero color (`C`) of length `N`, flanked on both the left and right sides by at least one pixel of a different non-zero color (`B`) within the same row. Record the color `C`, color `B`, length `N`, row index `r_orig`, the column index of the leftmost flanking pixel `B` (`c_left`), the column index of the rightmost flanking pixel `B` (`c_right`), and the column index of the middle pixel of the `C` block (`c_mid` - relevant if `N` is odd).
4.  Once the first such pattern is found, stop scanning.
5.  Determine the vertical shift (`V_diag`) for diagonal propagation: if the boundary color `B` is 8, OR if `B` is 2 AND the central length `N` is greater than 1, set `V_diag` to 3; otherwise, set `V_diag` to 2.
6.  Determine if central propagation should occur: central propagation occurs if (the central length `N` is 1 AND the boundary color `B` is 8) OR if (`N` is greater than 1 AND `B` is 2).
7.  Add new pixels to the output grid:
    a.  Place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - V_diag`, `c_left`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    b.  Place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - V_diag`, `c_right`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    c.  If central propagation is determined to occur (from step 6), place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - 2`, `c_mid`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
8.  Return the modified output grid.

Transformation rule:
1. Identify a specific horizontal pattern in the lower part of the input grid. The pattern consists of a central segment of color 'C' (length N) flanked immediately on both sides by a different non-zero color 'B'.
2. Determine vertical propagation shifts based on the properties (B, N) of the identified pattern.
3. Add new pixels of color 'C' to the grid at positions determined by these shifts relative to the original pattern's location. The original pattern remains unchanged.

Specifically:
- Scan rows from bottom to top to find the first occurrence of the pattern 'B... C... B...' where B and C are distinct non-zero colors.
- Record the row index (r_orig), the central color (C), the boundary color (B), the length of the central segment (N), the column index of the leftmost boundary pixel (c_left), the column index of the rightmost boundary pixel (c_right), and the column index of the middle pixel of the central segment (c_mid).
- Calculate the diagonal vertical shift (V_diag): V_diag is 3 if (B == 8) or (B == 2 and N > 1), otherwise V_diag is 2.
- Determine if central propagation should occur: True if (N == 1 and B == 8) or (N > 1 and B == 2).
- Place new pixels of color C at:
    - (r_orig - V_diag, c_left)
    - (r_orig - V_diag, c_right)
    - (r_orig - 2, c_mid) (only if central propagation is determined to occur)
- Ensure added pixels are within grid boundaries.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code successfully identified the core pattern (`B C... B`) in all examples but failed in examples 2 and 3 due to incorrect logic for determining the propagation locations of the new pixels. The errors indicate that the relationship between the pattern properties (specifically the boundary color `B` and the central segment length `N`) and the resulting pixel placements is more complex than initially assumed.

The strategy is to refine the propagation rules based on a case-by-case analysis of the successful and failed examples, establishing specific rules for different combinations of `B` and `N`.

**Metrics and Pattern Analysis:**

Using the `find_pattern` function from the previous attempt to extract pattern details for each training example:


*code_execution:*
```python
import copy
import math

# Reusing the find_pattern function from the previous attempt
def find_pattern(grid: list[list[int]]) -> dict | None:
    """
    Finds the first occurrence (from bottom) of the B-C-B pattern.

    Args:
        grid: The input grid.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing pattern details (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right, c_mid)
        or None if no pattern is found.

background_color: 0
objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: A horizontal structure identified by scanning rows from bottom to top. It's the first row found containing a central segment flanked by boundary pixels.
    properties:
      - central_color (C): The non-zero color of the central contiguous segment.
      - boundary_color (B): The non-zero color flanking the central segment on both sides (must be different from C).
      - central_segment_length (N): The number of contiguous pixels of color C.
      - row_index (r_orig): The row where the pattern is located.
      - boundary_left_col (c_left): The column index of the left boundary pixel B.
      - boundary_right_col (c_right): The column index of the right boundary pixel B.
actions:
  - id: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input grid rows from bottom to top. Find the first row containing a horizontal sequence B C...C B, where B and C are different non-zero colors, C...C is a contiguous segment of length N >= 1, and the B pixels are immediately adjacent to the C segment.
    input: input grid
    output: pattern object properties (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right) or null if not found.
  - id: apply_propagation
    description: Add new pixels of color C to the grid based on the identified pattern's properties (B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right).
    input: input grid, pattern object properties
    output: modified output grid
    logic:
      - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - If no pattern found, return the copied grid.
      - **Case 1:** If B is 8 OR (B is 2 AND N > 1):
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_left - 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_right + 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
      - **Case 2 (Default):** Otherwise:
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by adding pixels based on a specific pattern.
  - The added pixels' color is the central_color (C) of the pattern.
  - The locations of the added pixels depend on the pattern's row (r_orig), boundary columns (c_left, c_right), boundary color (B), and central segment length (N). Three distinct propagation rules cover all observed cases.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid rows from bottom (`row = height - 1`) to top (`row = 0`).
3.  In each row, search for the first occurrence (reading left to right) of a pattern `B C...C B`, where:
    *   `B` is a non-zero color (boundary color).
    *   `C` is a non-zero color different from `B` (central color).
    *   `C...C` represents a contiguous horizontal segment of color `C` with length `N` (where `N >= 1`).
    *   The left `B` pixel is at column `c_left`, immediately to the left of the `C` segment.
    *   The right `B` pixel is at column `c_right`, immediately to the right of the `C` segment.
4.  If such a pattern is found, record its properties (`C`, `B`, `N`, `r_orig` (the current row index), `c_left`, `c_right`) and stop scanning.
5.  If no pattern is found after scanning all rows, return the unchanged output grid.
6.  If a pattern was found, apply propagation rules to add pixels of color `C` to the output grid:
    a.  **Check for Special Propagation Case:** If the boundary color `B` is 8, OR if `B` is 2 AND the central length `N` is greater than 1:
        i.  Calculate target coordinates: `(r_orig - 3, c_left - 1)`, `(r_orig - 3, c_right + 1)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_left)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_right)`.
        ii. For each calculated coordinate `(r, c)`, if it is within the grid boundaries, set `output_grid[r][c] = C`.
    b.  **Default Propagation Case:** Otherwise (if the condition in 6a is false):
        i.  Calculate target coordinates: `(r_orig - 2, c_left)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_right)`.
        ii. For each calculated coordinate `(r, c)`, if it is within the grid boundaries, set `output_grid[r][c] = C`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
