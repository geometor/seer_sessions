            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grids:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids containing single digits. The digit '0' acts as a background color.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-zero digits form structures within the grid. A key structure appears consistently in the lower part of the input grid: a horizontal segment composed of one color (central color, C) flanked on both sides by another color (boundary color, B). Examples: `6 1 1 1 6`, `8 8 3 8 8`, `2 2 4 4 4 2 2`, `2 4 2`.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying this specific `B... C... B...` structure in the lowest part of the input grid and then adding new pixels of the central color (C) to the grid at locations *above* the identified structure. The original input structure remains in the output.\n4.  **Propagation:** The placement of the new C-colored pixels follows specific rules based on the properties (colors B and C, and the number N of central C pixels) of the identified structure. There are two types of propagation:\n    *   Diagonal: New C pixels appear vertically above the boundary B pixels. The vertical distance depends on B and N.\n    *   Central: Sometimes, a new C pixel appears vertically above the center of the C segment. This also depends on B and N, and the vertical distance is consistently 2 rows up.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the first row (`r_orig`) that contains a horizontal pattern consisting of a contiguous block of one non-zero color (`C`) of length `N`, flanked on both the left and right sides by at least one pixel of a different non-zero color (`B`) within the same row. Record the color `C`, color `B`, length `N`, row index `r_orig`, the column index of the leftmost flanking pixel `B` (`c_left`), the column index of the rightmost flanking pixel `B` (`c_right`), and the column index of the middle pixel of the `C` block (`c_mid` - relevant if `N` is odd).\n4.  Once the first such pattern is found, stop scanning.\n5.  Determine the vertical shift (`V_diag`) for diagonal propagation: if the boundary color `B` is 8, OR if `B` is 2 AND the central length `N` is greater than 1, set `V_diag` to 3; otherwise, set `V_diag` to 2.\n6.  Determine if central propagation should occur: central propagation occurs if (the central length `N` is 1 AND the boundary color `B` is 8) OR if (`N` is greater than 1 AND `B` is 2).\n7.  Add new pixels to the output grid:\n    a.  Place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - V_diag`, `c_left`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n    b.  Place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - V_diag`, `c_right`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n    c.  If central propagation is determined to occur (from step 6), place a pixel of color `C` at coordinates (`r_orig - 2`, `c_mid`), if these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
