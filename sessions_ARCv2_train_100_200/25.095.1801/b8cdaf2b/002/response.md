**General Assessment:**

The previous code successfully identified the core pattern (`B C... B`) in all examples but failed in examples 2 and 3 due to incorrect logic for determining the propagation locations of the new pixels. The errors indicate that the relationship between the pattern properties (specifically the boundary color `B` and the central segment length `N`) and the resulting pixel placements is more complex than initially assumed.

The strategy is to refine the propagation rules based on a case-by-case analysis of the successful and failed examples, establishing specific rules for different combinations of `B` and `N`.

**Metrics and Pattern Analysis:**

Using the `find_pattern` function from the previous attempt to extract pattern details for each training example:

``` python
import copy
import math

# Reusing the find_pattern function from the previous attempt
def find_pattern(grid: list[list[int]]) -> dict | None:
    """
    Finds the first occurrence (from bottom) of the B-C-B pattern.

    Args:
        grid: The input grid.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing pattern details (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right, c_mid)
        or None if no pattern is found.
    """

# Analysis of propagation based on pattern and expected output:

# Summary of Propagation Rules derived:
# 1. If B=8: Add C at (r-3, cl-1), (r-3, cr+1), (r-2, cl), (r-2, cr).
# 2. If B=2 and N>1: Add C at (r-3, cl-1), (r-3, cr+1), (r-2, cl), (r-2, cr).
# 3. Otherwise: Add C at (r-2, cl), (r-2, cr).

output_type: 2D grid of digits (same dimensions as input)
background_color: 0
objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: A horizontal structure identified by scanning rows from bottom to top. It's the first row found containing a central segment flanked by boundary pixels.
    properties:
      - central_color (C): The non-zero color of the central contiguous segment.
      - boundary_color (B): The non-zero color flanking the central segment on both sides (must be different from C).
      - central_segment_length (N): The number of contiguous pixels of color C.
      - row_index (r_orig): The row where the pattern is located.
      - boundary_left_col (c_left): The column index of the left boundary pixel B.
      - boundary_right_col (c_right): The column index of the right boundary pixel B.
actions:
  - id: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input grid rows from bottom to top. Find the first row containing a horizontal sequence B C...C B, where B and C are different non-zero colors, C...C is a contiguous segment of length N >= 1, and the B pixels are immediately adjacent to the C segment.
    input: input grid
    output: pattern object properties (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right) or null if not found.
  - id: apply_propagation
    description: Add new pixels of color C to the grid based on the identified pattern's properties (B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right).
    input: input grid, pattern object properties
    output: modified output grid
    logic:
      - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - If no pattern found, return the copied grid.
      - **Case 1:** If B is 8 OR (B is 2 AND N > 1):
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_left - 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_right + 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
      - **Case 2 (Default):** Otherwise:
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by adding pixels based on a specific pattern.
  - The added pixels' color is the central_color (C) of the pattern.
  - The locations of the added pixels depend on the pattern's row (r_orig), boundary columns (c_left, c_right), boundary color (B), and central segment length (N). Three distinct propagation rules cover all observed cases.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a deep copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid rows from bottom (`row = height - 1`) to top (`row = 0`).
3.  In each row, search for the first occurrence (reading left to right) of a pattern `B C...C B`, where:
    *   `B` is a non-zero color (boundary color).
    *   `C` is a non-zero color different from `B` (central color).
    *   `C...C` represents a contiguous horizontal segment of color `C` with length `N` (where `N >= 1`).
    *   The left `B` pixel is at column `c_left`, immediately to the left of the `C` segment.
    *   The right `B` pixel is at column `c_right`, immediately to the right of the `C` segment.
4.  If such a pattern is found, record its properties (`C`, `B`, `N`, `r_orig` (the current row index), `c_left`, `c_right`) and stop scanning.
5.  If no pattern is found after scanning all rows, return the unchanged output grid.
6.  If a pattern was found, apply propagation rules to add pixels of color `C` to the output grid:
    a.  **Check for Special Propagation Case:** If the boundary color `B` is 8, OR if `B` is 2 AND the central length `N` is greater than 1:
        i.  Calculate target coordinates: `(r_orig - 3, c_left - 1)`, `(r_orig - 3, c_right + 1)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_left)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_right)`.
        ii. For each calculated coordinate `(r, c)`, if it is within the grid boundaries, set `output_grid[r][c] = C`.
    b.  **Default Propagation Case:** Otherwise (if the condition in 6a is false):
        i.  Calculate target coordinates: `(r_orig - 2, c_left)`, `(r_orig - 2, c_right)`.
        ii. For each calculated coordinate `(r, c)`, if it is within the grid boundaries, set `output_grid[r][c] = C`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
