task: grid_transformation
input_type: 2D grid of digits
output_type: 2D grid of digits (same dimensions as input)
background_color: 0
objects:
  - id: pattern
    description: A horizontal structure identified by scanning rows from bottom to top. It's the first row found containing a central segment flanked by boundary pixels.
    properties:
      - central_color (C): The non-zero color of the central contiguous segment.
      - boundary_color (B): The non-zero color flanking the central segment on both sides (must be different from C).
      - central_segment_length (N): The number of contiguous pixels of color C.
      - row_index (r_orig): The row where the pattern is located.
      - boundary_left_col (c_left): The column index of the left boundary pixel B.
      - boundary_right_col (c_right): The column index of the right boundary pixel B.
actions:
  - id: identify_pattern
    description: Scan the input grid rows from bottom to top. Find the first row containing a horizontal sequence B C...C B, where B and C are different non-zero colors, C...C is a contiguous segment of length N >= 1, and the B pixels are immediately adjacent to the C segment.
    input: input grid
    output: pattern object properties (C, B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right) or null if not found.
  - id: apply_propagation
    description: Add new pixels of color C to the grid based on the identified pattern's properties (B, N, r_orig, c_left, c_right).
    input: input grid, pattern object properties
    output: modified output grid
    logic:
      - Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - If no pattern found, return the copied grid.
      - **Case 1:** If B is 8 OR (B is 2 AND N > 1):
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_left - 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 3, c_right + 1) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
      - **Case 2 (Default):** Otherwise:
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_left) if within bounds.
          - Add C at (r_orig - 2, c_right) if within bounds.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by adding pixels based on a specific pattern.
  - The added pixels' color is the central_color (C) of the pattern.
  - The locations of the added pixels depend on the pattern's row (r_orig), boundary columns (c_left, c_right), boundary color (B), and central segment length (N). Three distinct propagation rules cover all observed cases.
