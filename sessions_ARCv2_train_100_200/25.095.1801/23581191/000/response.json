            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (specifically 9x9 in the examples) containing single-digit integers.\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist primarily of zeros (0), with exactly two non-zero cells. In the examples, these non-zero values are consistently 8 and 7.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are derived from the input. They contain zeros, the original two non-zero numbers (8 and 7), and a new non-zero number (2). The structure of the non-zero elements in the output forms a distinct pattern related to the input.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The two original non-zero numbers from the input seem to act as \"markers\" or \"seeds\". Let's denote them as Marker1 (value `v1`, position `(r1, c1)`) and Marker2 (value `v2`, position `(r2, c2)`).\n    *   In the output, the entire row `r1` and the entire column `c1` are predominantly filled with `v1`.\n    *   Similarly, the entire row `r2` and the entire column `c2` are predominantly filled with `v2`.\n    *   The filling process seems sequential or layered, as the lines overwrite each other. For example, in `train_1`, filling row 7 with 7s overwrites the 8 previously placed at (7, 3) by the column 3 fill.\n    *   Crucially, the points where these lines *intersect* have special handling:\n        *   The original positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` retain their original values (`v1` and `v2`).\n        *   The *other* intersection points, `(r1, c2)` and `(r2, c1)`, are explicitly set to the value 2.\n    *   All cells not falling on row `r1`, column `c1`, row `r2`, or column `c2` remain zero.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Then, fill the entire `col1` of the new grid with `value1`.\n4.  **Draw Second Cross:** Fill the entire `row2` of the new grid with `value2`. Then, fill the entire `col2` of the new grid with `value2`.

Set the value of the cell at `(row2, col2)` back to `value2`. This ensures the original marker locations hold their correct values, overriding any changes from steps 4 or 5.\n7.  **Finalize:** The modified grid is the final output."
