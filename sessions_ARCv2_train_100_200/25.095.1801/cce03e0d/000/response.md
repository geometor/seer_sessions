*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task involves transforming a smaller input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid (9x9).
    *   The input grid contains numerical values (0, 1, 2).
    *   The output grid is composed of nine 3x3 subgrids, arranged in a 3x3 meta-grid structure.
    *   The content of the output grid depends entirely on the content and structure of the input grid.
    *   Specifically, the original input grid pattern appears in certain 3x3 subgrids of the output grid.
    *   The placement of the input grid pattern within the output grid is determined by the locations of the number '2' in the original input grid.
    *   If the input grid cell at `(row, col)` contains the value '2', then the entire input grid is copied into the output subgrid located at the corresponding `(row, col)` position within the larger 9x9 grid.
    *   If the input grid cell at `(row, col)` does not contain '2', the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output remains filled with '0's (the background value).

      mapping:
        input_cell_position: (r, c)
        maps_to: output_subgrid_position: (r, c)
    relationship:
      - The dimensions of the output grid are determined by squaring the dimensions of the input grid.
      - The output grid is conceptually divided into subgrids matching the size of the input grid.
      - The presence of the value '2' at a specific cell `(r, c)` in the input grid triggers the copying of the entire input grid into the corresponding subgrid `(r, c)` of the output grid.
      - Subgrids in the output corresponding to input cells not containing '2' are filled with the background value '0'.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions 9x9 (3 times the height and 3 times the width of the 3x3 input grid), filled with the background value 0.
    2.  Iterate through each cell of the 3x3 input grid, using its row index `r` (from 0 to 2) and column index `c` (from 0 to 2).
    3.  Check the value of the input grid cell at position `(r, c)`.
    4.  If the value at `input[r, c]` is equal to 2:
        a.  Determine the top-left starting coordinates for the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid: `output_start_row = r * 3`, `output_start_col = c * 3`.
        b.  Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the 9x9 output grid, placing its top-left corner at `(output_start_row, output_start_col)`.
    5.  If the value at `input[r, c]` is not equal to 2, leave the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid filled with 0s (as initialized).
    6.  After checking all cells in the input grid, the resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.
