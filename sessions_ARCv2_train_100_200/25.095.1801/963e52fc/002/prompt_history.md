Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are structured as 2D grids (or matrices) containing numerical digits (specifically 0, 1, 2, 3, 8 in the examples).
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The height (number of rows) of the output grid is always the same as the height of the input grid. The width (number of columns) of the output grid is always exactly double the width of the input grid.
3.  **Content Transformation:** Observing the content row by row:
    *   The sequence of numbers in each output row appears to be directly derived from the corresponding input row.
    *   Comparing an input row with its corresponding output row reveals that the output row consists of the entire input row followed immediately by another identical copy of that input row.
    *   This pattern holds true for all rows, including those containing only zeros and those containing varying patterns of non-zero digits.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Height: H (integer)
        - Width: W (integer)
        - Rows: List of H lists, each containing W integers
  - Output_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Height: H_out (integer)
        - Width: W_out (integer)
        - Rows: List of H_out lists, each containing W_out integers
  - Row:
      Properties:
        - Content: List of integers
        - Length: integer

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid.Height equals Input_Grid.Height (H_out = H)
  - Output_Grid.Width equals Input_Grid.Width multiplied by 2 (W_out = W * 2)
  - For each row index 'i' from 0 to H-1:
      - Output_Grid.Rows[i].Content is derived from Input_Grid.Rows[i].Content

Actions:
  - For each row in the Input_Grid:
    - Identify the corresponding row content (a list of numbers).
    - Concatenate this row content list with itself.
    - Place the resulting concatenated list as the content for the corresponding row in the Output_Grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H` and width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same height `H` and double the width (`W * 2`).
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index 0 to `H-1`.
4.  For the current row index `i`, take the list of numbers representing the input grid's row `i`.
5.  Construct the corresponding row `i` for the output grid by concatenating the input grid's row `i` list with a copy of itself.
6.  Populate the output grid with these newly constructed rows.
```python
import copy

"""
The transformation takes an input grid and produces an output grid with the same height but double the width. Each row in the output grid is created by concatenating the corresponding row from the input grid with itself.
"""

def transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Transforms the input grid by duplicating each row horizontally.

    Args:
        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input 2D grid.

    Returns:
        A new list of lists representing the transformed grid where each
        row is duplicated horizontally.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the rows of the output grid
    output_grid = []

    # Iterate through each row in the input grid
    for row in input_grid:
        # Create a new row by concatenating the current input row with itself
        # This effectively doubles the width of the row by repeating its content
        new_row = row + row
        # Append the newly created row to the output grid
        output_grid.append(new_row)

    # Return the completed output grid
    return output_grid

```
