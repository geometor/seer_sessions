The width (number of columns) of the output grid is always exactly double the width of the input grid.\n3.  **Content Transformation:** Observing the content row by row:\n    *   The sequence of numbers in each output row appears to be directly derived from the corresponding input row.\n    *   Comparing an input row with its corresponding output row reveals that the output row consists of the entire input row followed immediately by another identical copy of that input row.\n    *   This pattern holds true for all rows, including those containing only zeros and those containing varying patterns of non-zero digits.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
