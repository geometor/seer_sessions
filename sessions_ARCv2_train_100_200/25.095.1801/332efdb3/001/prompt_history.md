**Perception:**
The task involves transforming a square grid filled entirely with zeros into another square grid of the same dimensions. The dimensions of the grids in the examples are always odd (5x5, 7x7, 9x9). The output grid contains a specific pattern of ones and zeros. Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with ones. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) contain an alternating pattern of ones and zeros, starting with one in the first column (index 0), then zero (index 1), then one (index 2), and so on. The input grid's content (all zeros) doesn't seem to influence the pattern itself, only the dimensions of the output grid.

**Facts:**

```yaml
- object: input_grid
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers
    - content: filled entirely with 0
    - shape: square
    - dimensions: NxN, where N is always odd in the examples (5, 7, 9)
- object: output_grid
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers
    - content: filled with 0s and 1s
    - shape: square
    - dimensions: Same as input_grid (NxN)
- relationships:
    - output_grid dimensions are determined by input_grid dimensions.
    - output_grid cell values are determined by their row and column indices (i, j).
- transformation_rules:
    - rule_1: If the row index `i` is even, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 1.
    - rule_2: If the row index `i` is odd:
        - rule_2a: If the column index `j` is even, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 1.
        - rule_2b: If the column index `j` is odd, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**
1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the output grid using its row index `i` and column index `j`.
3.  Check if the row index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
4.  If `i` is even, set the value of the cell at `(i, j)` to 1.
5.  If `i` is odd:
    a.  Check if the column index `j` is even (i.e., `j % 2 == 0`).
    b.  If `j` is even, set the value of the cell at `(i, j)` to 1.
    c.  If `j` is odd, set the value of the cell at `(i, j)` to 0.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
