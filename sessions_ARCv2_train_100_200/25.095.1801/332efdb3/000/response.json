The dimensions of the grids in the examples are always odd (5x5, 7x7, 9x9). The output grid contains a specific pattern of ones and zeros. Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with ones. Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) contain an alternating pattern of ones and zeros, starting with one in the first column (index 0), then zero (index 1), then one (index 2), and so on. The input grid's content (all zeros) doesn't seem to influence the pattern itself, only the dimensions of the output grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n"
