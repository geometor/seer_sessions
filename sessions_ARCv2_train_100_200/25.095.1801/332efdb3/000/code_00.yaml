- object: input_grid
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers
    - content: filled entirely with 0
    - shape: square
    - dimensions: NxN, where N is always odd in the examples (5, 7, 9)
- object: output_grid
  properties:
    - type: 2D array of integers
    - content: filled with 0s and 1s
    - shape: square
    - dimensions: Same as input_grid (NxN)
- relationships:
    - output_grid dimensions are determined by input_grid dimensions.
    - output_grid cell values are determined by their row and column indices (i, j).
- transformation_rules:
    - rule_1: If the row index `i` is even, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 1.
    - rule_2: If the row index `i` is odd:
        - rule_2a: If the column index `j` is even, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 1.
        - rule_2b: If the column index `j` is odd, the output cell value at `(i, j)` is 0.
