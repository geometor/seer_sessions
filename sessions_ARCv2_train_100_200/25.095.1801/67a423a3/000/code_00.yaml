task_description: Modifies a grid based on the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line segment.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of digits
      - contains: mostly zeros, a single horizontal non-zero segment, a single vertical non-zero segment
  - object: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - composed_of: non-zero digits
      - orientation: horizontal
  - object: vertical_segment
    properties:
      - composed_of: non-zero digits
      - orientation: vertical
  - object: intersection_point
    properties:
      - location: cell where horizontal_segment and vertical_segment cross
      - value: non-zero digit from input
  - object: neighborhood_3x3
    properties:
      - location: centered at intersection_point
      - size: 3x3 cells
  - object: target_value
    properties:
      - value: 4
      - role: replacement value for surrounding cells

actions:
  - action: identify_intersection
    actor: rule
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates of intersection_point
    method: Find the unique cell belonging to both the horizontal and vertical non-zero segments. (e.g., by finding the row and column index with the highest frequency of non-zero elements).
  - action: modify_neighborhood
    actor: rule
    input: input_grid, intersection_point coordinates
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - Copy input_grid to output_grid.
      - Iterate through the 3x3 neighborhood centered at the intersection_point.
      - For each cell in the neighborhood:
          - If the cell is the center (intersection_point), do nothing (keep original value).
          - If the cell is not the center, change its value in output_grid to target_value (4).
      - Keep all cells outside the 3x3 neighborhood unchanged.

relationships:
  - The horizontal_segment and vertical_segment intersect at exactly one cell, the intersection_point.
  - The modification is localized to the 3x3 neighborhood surrounding the intersection_point.
  - The value of the intersection_point itself is preserved from input to output.
  - All other cells in the 3x3 neighborhood (excluding the center) are changed to 4, regardless of their original value (0 or non-zero).
