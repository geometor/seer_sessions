The key feature is the intersection.\n*   The output grid retains most of the structure of the input grid.\n*   The primary change occurs in a 3x3 area centered around the intersection point of the two lines.\n*   Specifically, the 8 cells surrounding the intersection point are changed to the digit '4' in the output.\n*   The cell at the exact intersection point retains its original value from the input.\n*   Cells outside this 3x3 neighbourhood remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
