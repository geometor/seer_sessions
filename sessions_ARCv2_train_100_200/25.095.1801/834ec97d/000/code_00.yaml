task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: height H, width W
      - content: contains mostly zeros and one non-zero integer N
    location:
      row: r
      column: c

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: height H, width W (same as input)
      - content: derived from input_grid

  - object: non_zero_number
    identifier: N
    properties:
      - value: integer > 0 (e.g., 6, 2, 9)
      - initial_position: (r, c) in input_grid
      - final_position: (r+1, c) in output_grid

  - object: pattern_element
    identifier: P
    properties:
      - value: 4
      - structure: horizontal row pattern (e.g., [4, 0, 4, 0, 4] or [0, 4, 0])
      - dependency: structure depends on the parity of the initial column 'c' of N
      - location: fills rows 0 to 'r' (inclusive) in the output_grid

actions:
  - name: locate_N
    input: input_grid
    output: value N, position (r, c), dimensions (H, W)

  - name: determine_pattern_row
    input: width W, column c
    output: pattern_row P (list of length W)
    logic: P[j] = 4 if j % 2 == c % 2, else P[j] = 0, for j in 0..W-1

  - name: construct_output
    input: H, W, N, r, c, pattern_row P
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - create HxW grid filled with zeros
      - for i from 0 to r: set output_grid[i] = P
      - set output_grid[r+1][c] = N

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The position of N in the output grid is directly below its position in the input grid.
  - The number of rows filled with the pattern P in the output grid is r + 1.
  - The structure of the pattern row P depends on the parity of the column index c.
