            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** Each input is a grid (matrix) of numbers. The grid contains mostly zeros (0) and a single non-zero number at a specific location. The size of the grid varies between examples.\n2.  **Output Data:** Each output is also a grid of the same dimensions as the corresponding input. The output grid contains the original non-zero number, but shifted down one row. Additionally, a pattern involving the number four (4) appears in the rows above the original position of the non-zero number.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves two main actions:\n    *   **Relocation:** The single non-zero number from the input grid is moved one position down (row index increases by 1) while keeping the same column index.\n    *   **Pattern Generation:** Rows in the output grid, starting from the top (row 0) down to the original row of the non-zero number, are filled with a repeating horizontal pattern. This pattern consists of the number 4 and 0. The exact structure of this pattern seems related to the column index of the original non-zero number and the grid's width.\n4.  **Key Observations:**\n    *   The value of the non-zero number (6, 2, 9) is preserved in the output, just its location changes.\n    *   The pattern always uses the number 4.\n    *   The pattern fills all rows *above* the *original* location of the non-zero number, inclusive of the original row itself (rows 0 to `r`, where `r` is the original row index).\n    *   The horizontal pattern (`4 0 4 0 4` or `0 4 0`) depends on the parity (even/odd) of the column index (`c`) where the original non-zero number was found. If `c` is even, the pattern places '4's at even column indices. If `c` is odd, the pattern places '4's at odd column indices.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
