Additionally, four new 2x2 blocks appear in the output grid, generally located towards the corners. The structure and content of these corner blocks vary between examples.\n4.  **Core Object:** The central element is the 2x2 block of non-zero digits in the input. Let's label its elements as:\n    "

The crucial observation is that the *content* and *placement* of these four new blocks depend on the *parity* (odd/even) of the top-left coordinates (r, c) of the original 2x2 block.\n    *   **Example 1:** (r, c) = (1, 1) - Both odd. The corner blocks have specific patterns involving individual elements (A, B, C, D) and zeros, placed relative to (r, c).\n    *   **Examples 2 & 3:** (r, c) = (2, 2) - Both even. The corner blocks are solid 2x2 blocks, each filled with one of the digits (A, B, C, or D), placed at different relative positions compared to Example 1.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
