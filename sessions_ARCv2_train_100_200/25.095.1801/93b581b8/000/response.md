Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 6x6 grids containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Input Pattern:** Each input grid contains exactly one 2x2 block of non-zero digits, surrounded entirely by zeros.
3.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid retains the original 2x2 non-zero block from the input. Additionally, four new 2x2 blocks appear in the output grid, generally located towards the corners. The structure and content of these corner blocks vary between examples.
4.  **Core Object:** The central element is the 2x2 block of non-zero digits in the input. Let's label its elements as:
    
```
    A B
    C D
    ```

    And its top-left coordinate as (r, c) (0-based indexing).
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation preserves the original block and adds four new blocks. The crucial observation is that the *content* and *placement* of these four new blocks depend on the *parity* (odd/even) of the top-left coordinates (r, c) of the original 2x2 block.
    *   **Example 1:** (r, c) = (1, 1) - Both odd. The corner blocks have specific patterns involving individual elements (A, B, C, D) and zeros, placed relative to (r, c).
    *   **Examples 2 & 3:** (r, c) = (2, 2) - Both even. The corner blocks are solid 2x2 blocks, each filled with one of the digits (A, B, C, or D), placed at different relative positions compared to Example 1.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation based on Block Position Parity

Input:
  - Object: InputGrid
    Properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - size: 6x6
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - constraint: contains exactly one 2x2 block of non-zero digits ('SourceBlock') surrounded by zeros.

SourceBlock:
  - Object: A 2x2 subgrid within InputGrid
  - Properties:
    - values: [[A, B], [C, D]] (where A, B, C, D are non-zero digits)
    - position: top-left corner at (r, c)
    - parity: determined by the parity (odd/even) of r and c.

Output:
  - Object: OutputGrid
    Properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - size: 6x6
      - content: digits (0-9)
    Relationships:
      - Contains the original SourceBlock at its original position (r, c).
      - Contains four additional 'CornerBlocks' derived from SourceBlock.

CornerBlocks:
  - Object: Four 2x2 subgrids placed in OutputGrid.
  - Properties:
    - content: depends on the values (A, B, C, D) of SourceBlock and the parity of (r, c).
    - position: depends on the position (r, c) of SourceBlock and the parity of (r, c).
  - Types (based on parity):
    - Type 1 (r=odd, c=odd):
      - TL: [[D, 0], [0, A]] at (r-1, c-1)
      - TR: [[C, C], [0, 0]] at (r-1, c+2)
      - BL: [[B, 0], [B, 0]] at (r+2, c-1)
      - BR: [[A, A], [A, A]] at (r+2, c+2)
    - Type 2 (r=even, c=even):
      - TL: [[D, D], [D, D]] at (r-2, c-2)
      - TR: [[C, C], [C, C]] at (r-2, c+2)
      - BL: [[B, B], [B, B]] at (r+2, c-2)
      - BR: [[A, A], [A, A]] at (r+2, c+2)

Actions:
  1. Identify SourceBlock: Find the 2x2 non-zero block, its values [[A, B], [C, D]], and its top-left position (r, c).
  2. Determine Parity: Check if r and c are odd or even.
  3. Initialize Output: Create OutputGrid as a copy of InputGrid.
  4. Place CornerBlocks: Based on the parity determined in step 2, generate the four CornerBlocks according to the corresponding Type (1 or 2) and place them at the specified coordinates in OutputGrid, overwriting existing values.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Find the Source Block:** Scan the 6x6 input grid to locate the top-left corner (row `r`, column `c`) of the 2x2 block containing non-zero digits. Extract the four digits from this block, assigning them to variables `A` (top-left), `B` (top-right), `C` (bottom-left), and `D` (bottom-right).
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new 6x6 grid, initially identical to the input grid.
3.  **Check Position Parity:** Determine if the row index `r` and the column index `c` are both odd numbers or both even numbers.
4.  **Generate and Place Corner Blocks based on Parity:**
    *   **If `r` is odd AND `c` is odd:**
        *   Create the Top-Left corner block as `[[D, 0], [0, A]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`-1, `c`-1).
        *   Create the Top-Right corner block as `[[C, C], [0, 0]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`-1, `c`+2).
        *   Create the Bottom-Left corner block as `[[B, 0], [B, 0]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`+2, `c`-1).
        *   Create the Bottom-Right corner block as `[[A, A], [A, A]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`+2, `c`+2).
    *   **If `r` is even AND `c` is even:**
        *   Create the Top-Left corner block as `[[D, D], [D, D]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`-2, `c`-2).
        *   Create the Top-Right corner block as `[[C, C], [C, C]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`-2, `c`+2).
        *   Create the Bottom-Left corner block as `[[B, B], [B, B]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`+2, `c`-2).
        *   Create the Bottom-Right corner block as `[[A, A], [A, A]]` and place it in the output grid starting at position (`r`+2, `c`+2).
5.  **Return:** The modified grid is the final output.
