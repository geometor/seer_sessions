Task: Grid Transformation based on Block Position Parity

Input:
  - Object: InputGrid
    Properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - size: 6x6
      - content: digits (0-9)
      - constraint: contains exactly one 2x2 block of non-zero digits ('SourceBlock') surrounded by zeros.

SourceBlock:
  - Object: A 2x2 subgrid within InputGrid
  - Properties:
    - values: [[A, B], [C, D]] (where A, B, C, D are non-zero digits)
    - position: top-left corner at (r, c)
    - parity: determined by the parity (odd/even) of r and c.

Output:
  - Object: OutputGrid
    Properties:
      - type: 2D array (list of lists)
      - size: 6x6
      - content: digits (0-9)
    Relationships:
      - Contains the original SourceBlock at its original position (r, c).
      - Contains four additional 'CornerBlocks' derived from SourceBlock.

CornerBlocks:
  - Object: Four 2x2 subgrids placed in OutputGrid.
  - Properties:
    - content: depends on the values (A, B, C, D) of SourceBlock and the parity of (r, c).
    - position: depends on the position (r, c) of SourceBlock and the parity of (r, c).
  - Types (based on parity):
    - Type 1 (r=odd, c=odd):
      - TL: [[D, 0], [0, A]] at (r-1, c-1)
      - TR: [[C, C], [0, 0]] at (r-1, c+2)
      - BL: [[B, 0], [B, 0]] at (r+2, c-1)
      - BR: [[A, A], [A, A]] at (r+2, c+2)
    - Type 2 (r=even, c=even):
      - TL: [[D, D], [D, D]] at (r-2, c-2)
      - TR: [[C, C], [C, C]] at (r-2, c+2)
      - BL: [[B, B], [B, B]] at (r+2, c-2)
      - BR: [[A, A], [A, A]] at (r+2, c+2)

Actions:
  1. Identify SourceBlock: Find the 2x2 non-zero block, its values [[A, B], [C, D]], and its top-left position (r, c).
  2. Determine Parity: Check if r and c are odd or even.
  3. Initialize Output: Create OutputGrid as a copy of InputGrid.
  4. Place CornerBlocks: Based on the parity determined in step 2, generate the four CornerBlocks according to the corresponding Type (1 or 2) and place them at the specified coordinates in OutputGrid, overwriting existing values.
