The input grid contains numerical values, where 0 likely represents a background color, and non-zero numbers represent specific 'active' colors or elements. The output grid appears to be a larger grid composed of 3x3 subgrids. The structure and content of these subgrids are determined by the values and positions within the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be constructed by replicating a modified version of the input grid pattern into specific locations within the output grid, guided by the positions of non-zero values in the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
