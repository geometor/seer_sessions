Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers).
        - BackgroundValue: 0
        - ActiveValue (V): A single unique non-zero integer present in the grid. (Assumption based on examples).
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 9x9
        - Cells: Contains numerical values (0 or V) derived from InputGrid.
        - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of Subgrids.
  - DerivedPattern:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Content: Determined once per InputGrid. For each cell (ir, ic):
            - If InputGrid[ir][ic] is 0, DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = V.
            - If InputGrid[ir][ic] is V, DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = 0.
  - Subgrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Location: Determined by the corresponding cell position (r, c) in InputGrid (maps to OutputGrid rows 3*r to 3*r+2, cols 3*c to 3*c+2).
        - Content: Either all zeros or a copy of the DerivedPattern.

Relationships:
  - Value Identification: The single non-zero value (V) in the InputGrid is identified.
  - Pattern Generation: A single 3x3 DerivedPattern is created based on the entire InputGrid structure and the value V. The pattern marks the locations of zeros in the InputGrid with the value V.
  - Mapping & Content Placement:
      - Each cell (r, c) in the InputGrid corresponds to a unique 3x3 Subgrid in the OutputGrid at location (3*r, 3*c).
      - If InputGrid[r][c] is 0, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled entirely with 0s.
      - If InputGrid[r][c] is V (non-zero), the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled with a copy of the DerivedPattern.

Actions:
  - Identify Value: Scan the InputGrid to find the unique non-zero value, V. Handle cases where there is no non-zero value or multiple unique non-zero values if necessary (though examples suggest one unique V).
  - Create Pattern: Generate the 3x3 DerivedPattern: Initialize a 3x3 grid with zeros. Iterate through the InputGrid (ir, ic). If InputGrid[ir][ic] == 0, set DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = V.
  - Initialize Output: Create a 9x9 OutputGrid filled with 0s.
  - Iterate and Place: Loop through each cell (r, c) of the 3x3 InputGrid.
      - Check Value: Get the value InputGrid[r][c].
      - Conditional Placement:
          - If InputGrid[r][c] is non-zero (equals V):
              - Determine target Subgrid location in OutputGrid: rows 3*r to 3*r+2, columns 3*c to 3*c+2.
              - Copy the pre-calculated DerivedPattern into this target Subgrid location.
          - If InputGrid[r][c] is 0, do nothing (the target Subgrid remains 0s).
  - Finalize: The resulting OutputGrid is the final output.
