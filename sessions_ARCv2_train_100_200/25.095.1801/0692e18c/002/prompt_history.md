*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid. The input grid contains numerical values, where 0 likely represents a background color, and non-zero numbers represent specific 'active' colors or elements. The output grid appears to be a larger grid composed of 3x3 subgrids. The structure and content of these subgrids are determined by the values and positions within the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be constructed by replicating a modified version of the input grid pattern into specific locations within the output grid, guided by the positions of non-zero values in the input.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - InputGrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 3x3
            - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers)
            - BackgroundValue: 0
            - ActiveValues: Non-zero integers (e.g., 4, 6, 7)
      - OutputGrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 9x9
            - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers) derived from InputGrid
            - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of Subgrids
      - Subgrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 3x3
            - Location: Determined by the corresponding cell position in InputGrid (row `r`, col `c` in InputGrid maps to rows `3*r` to `3*r+2`, cols `3*c` to `3*c+2` in OutputGrid)
            - Content: Determined by the value of the corresponding InputGrid cell and the pattern of non-zero values in the *entire* InputGrid.

    Relationships:
      - Mapping: Each cell `(r, c)` in the InputGrid corresponds to a unique 3x3 Subgrid in the OutputGrid at location `(3*r, 3*c)`.
      - Content Generation:
          - If `InputGrid[r][c]` is 0, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled entirely with 0s.
          - If `InputGrid[r][c]` is a non-zero value `V`, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is generated by:
              - Taking the *structure* of the entire InputGrid.
              - For each cell `(ir, ic)` within the InputGrid:
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is non-zero, the cell `(ir, ic)` within the *Subgrid* is set to `V`.
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is 0, the cell `(ir, ic)` within the *Subgrid* is set to 0.

    Actions:
      - Initialize: Create a 9x9 OutputGrid filled with 0s.
      - Iterate: Loop through each cell `(r, c)` of the 3x3 InputGrid.
      - Check Value: Get the value `V = InputGrid[r][c]`.
      - Conditional Construction:
          - If `V` is non-zero:
              - Determine target Subgrid location in OutputGrid: rows `3*r` to `3*r+2`, columns `3*c` to `3*c+2`.
              - Create a temporary 3x3 pattern:
                  - Iterate through each cell `(ir, ic)` of the InputGrid.
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is non-zero, set the temporary pattern cell `(ir, ic)` to `V`.
                  - Else, set the temporary pattern cell `(ir, ic)` to 0.
              - Place the temporary 3x3 pattern into the target Subgrid location in the OutputGrid.
          - If `V` is 0, do nothing (the target Subgrid remains 0s).
      - Finalize: The resulting OutputGrid is the final output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new 9x9 grid, called `OutputGrid`, and initialize all its cells to 0.
    2.  Iterate through each cell of the 3x3 `InputGrid`, using row index `r` (from 0 to 2) and column index `c` (from 0 to 2).
    3.  Let `V` be the value of the cell `InputGrid[r][c]`.
    4.  If `V` is not equal to 0:
        a.  Create a temporary 3x3 grid, called `SubgridPattern`.
        b.  Iterate through each cell of the `InputGrid` again, using inner row index `ir` (from 0 to 2) and inner column index `ic` (from 0 to 2).
        c.  If the value `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is not equal to 0, set the cell `SubgridPattern[ir][ic]` to the value `V`.
        d.  Otherwise (if `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is 0), set the cell `SubgridPattern[ir][ic]` to 0.
        e.  Copy the contents of the `SubgridPattern` into the `OutputGrid` in the block defined by rows `3*r` to `3*r + 2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c + 2`.
    5.  After iterating through all cells of the `InputGrid`, the `OutputGrid` contains the final result.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the following rule:
1. Initialize a 9x9 output grid with all zeros.
2. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the 3x3 input grid.
3. If the value V at input_grid[r][c] is non-zero:
    a. Define a 3x3 subgrid pattern based on the *entire* input grid's structure:
       - For each cell (ir, ic) in the input grid, if input_grid[ir][ic] is non-zero, the corresponding cell (ir, ic) in the subgrid pattern gets the value V.
       - Otherwise, the cell (ir, ic) in the subgrid pattern gets the value 0.
    b. Place this 3x3 subgrid pattern into the output grid at the location corresponding to the original cell (r, c), specifically in the block from row 3*r to 3*r+2 and column 3*c to 3*c+2.
4. If the value V at input_grid[r][c] is zero, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains all zeros.
5. Return the final 9x9 output grid.
