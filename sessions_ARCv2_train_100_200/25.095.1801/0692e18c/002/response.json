            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified that the output is a 9x9 grid composed of 3x3 subgrids, and that only the subgrids corresponding to non-zero cells in the 3x3 input grid are populated. It also correctly inferred that the value used to populate these subgrids (`V`) is the value from the corresponding input cell.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows that the *pattern* placed within each populated subgrid was incorrect. The previous assumption was that the pattern was the *structure of the input grid itself*, scaled by the value `V`. The actual outputs reveal a different pattern generation method.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-examine the relationship between the input grid and the *single pattern* that appears in *all* populated subgrids within a given example's output.\n2.  Hypothesize how this single pattern is derived from the input grid.\n3.  Verify this hypothesis against all three examples.\n4.  Update the facts and natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding.\n\nBased on a detailed comparison (as performed in the thought block), the pattern placed in a subgrid corresponding to a non-zero input cell `InputGrid[r][c] = V` appears to be constant for a given input grid. This constant pattern is derived by taking the *inverse* of the input grid's structure (where zeros were) and filling those positions with the value `V`.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's confirm the structure using code execution. We'll analyze Example 1.\n\n"
