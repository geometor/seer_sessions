*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid. The input grid contains numerical values, where 0 likely represents a background color, and non-zero numbers represent specific 'active' colors or elements. The output grid appears to be a larger grid composed of 3x3 subgrids. The structure and content of these subgrids are determined by the values and positions within the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be constructed by replicating a modified version of the input grid pattern into specific locations within the output grid, guided by the positions of non-zero values in the input.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - InputGrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 3x3
            - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers)
            - BackgroundValue: 0
            - ActiveValues: Non-zero integers (e.g., 4, 6, 7)
      - OutputGrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 9x9
            - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers) derived from InputGrid
            - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of Subgrids
      - Subgrid:
          Properties:
            - Size: 3x3
            - Location: Determined by the corresponding cell position in InputGrid (row `r`, col `c` in InputGrid maps to rows `3*r` to `3*r+2`, cols `3*c` to `3*c+2` in OutputGrid)
            - Content: Determined by the value of the corresponding InputGrid cell and the pattern of non-zero values in the *entire* InputGrid.

    Relationships:
      - Mapping: Each cell `(r, c)` in the InputGrid corresponds to a unique 3x3 Subgrid in the OutputGrid at location `(3*r, 3*c)`.
      - Content Generation:
          - If `InputGrid[r][c]` is 0, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled entirely with 0s.
          - If `InputGrid[r][c]` is a non-zero value `V`, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is generated by:
              - Taking the *structure* of the entire InputGrid.
              - For each cell `(ir, ic)` within the InputGrid:
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is non-zero, the cell `(ir, ic)` within the *Subgrid* is set to `V`.
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is 0, the cell `(ir, ic)` within the *Subgrid* is set to 0.

    Actions:
      - Initialize: Create a 9x9 OutputGrid filled with 0s.
      - Iterate: Loop through each cell `(r, c)` of the 3x3 InputGrid.
      - Check Value: Get the value `V = InputGrid[r][c]`.
      - Conditional Construction:
          - If `V` is non-zero:
              - Determine target Subgrid location in OutputGrid: rows `3*r` to `3*r+2`, columns `3*c` to `3*c+2`.
              - Create a temporary 3x3 pattern:
                  - Iterate through each cell `(ir, ic)` of the InputGrid.
                  - If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is non-zero, set the temporary pattern cell `(ir, ic)` to `V`.
                  - Else, set the temporary pattern cell `(ir, ic)` to 0.
              - Place the temporary 3x3 pattern into the target Subgrid location in the OutputGrid.
          - If `V` is 0, do nothing (the target Subgrid remains 0s).
      - Finalize: The resulting OutputGrid is the final output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new 9x9 grid, called `OutputGrid`, and initialize all its cells to 0.
    2.  Iterate through each cell of the 3x3 `InputGrid`, using row index `r` (from 0 to 2) and column index `c` (from 0 to 2).
    3.  Let `V` be the value of the cell `InputGrid[r][c]`.
    4.  If `V` is not equal to 0:
        a.  Create a temporary 3x3 grid, called `SubgridPattern`.
        b.  Iterate through each cell of the `InputGrid` again, using inner row index `ir` (from 0 to 2) and inner column index `ic` (from 0 to 2).
        c.  If the value `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is not equal to 0, set the cell `SubgridPattern[ir][ic]` to the value `V`.
        d.  Otherwise (if `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is 0), set the cell `SubgridPattern[ir][ic]` to 0.
        e.  Copy the contents of the `SubgridPattern` into the `OutputGrid` in the block defined by rows `3*r` to `3*r + 2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c + 2`.
    5.  After iterating through all cells of the `InputGrid`, the `OutputGrid` contains the final result.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified that the output is a 9x9 grid composed of 3x3 subgrids, and that only the subgrids corresponding to non-zero cells in the 3x3 input grid are populated. It also correctly inferred that the value used to populate these subgrids (`V`) is the value from the corresponding input cell.

However, the comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` clearly shows that the *pattern* placed within each populated subgrid was incorrect. The previous assumption was that the pattern was the *structure of the input grid itself*, scaled by the value `V`. The actual outputs reveal a different pattern generation method.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-examine the relationship between the input grid and the *single pattern* that appears in *all* populated subgrids within a given example's output.
2.  Hypothesize how this single pattern is derived from the input grid.
3.  Verify this hypothesis against all three examples.
4.  Update the facts and natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding.

Based on a detailed comparison (as performed in the thought block), the pattern placed in a subgrid corresponding to a non-zero input cell `InputGrid[r][c] = V` appears to be constant for a given input grid. This constant pattern is derived by taking the *inverse* of the input grid's structure (where zeros were) and filling those positions with the value `V`.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's confirm the structure using code execution. We'll analyze Example 1.

```
The code execution confirms the hypothesis for all three examples. The pattern placed into the output subgrids is indeed derived by taking the positions of the *zeroes* in the input grid and filling those positions in the pattern with the non-zero value `V` found in the input grid.

**Updated Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Cells: Contains numerical values (integers).
        - BackgroundValue: 0
        - ActiveValue (V): A single unique non-zero integer present in the grid. (Assumption based on examples).
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 9x9
        - Cells: Contains numerical values (0 or V) derived from InputGrid.
        - Structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of Subgrids.
  - DerivedPattern:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Content: Determined once per InputGrid. For each cell (ir, ic):
            - If InputGrid[ir][ic] is 0, DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = V.
            - If InputGrid[ir][ic] is V, DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = 0.
  - Subgrid:
      Properties:
        - Size: 3x3
        - Location: Determined by the corresponding cell position (r, c) in InputGrid (maps to OutputGrid rows 3*r to 3*r+2, cols 3*c to 3*c+2).
        - Content: Either all zeros or a copy of the DerivedPattern.

Relationships:
  - Value Identification: The single non-zero value (V) in the InputGrid is identified.
  - Pattern Generation: A single 3x3 DerivedPattern is created based on the entire InputGrid structure and the value V. The pattern marks the locations of zeros in the InputGrid with the value V.
  - Mapping & Content Placement:
      - Each cell (r, c) in the InputGrid corresponds to a unique 3x3 Subgrid in the OutputGrid at location (3*r, 3*c).
      - If InputGrid[r][c] is 0, the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled entirely with 0s.
      - If InputGrid[r][c] is V (non-zero), the corresponding OutputGrid Subgrid is filled with a copy of the DerivedPattern.

Actions:
  - Identify Value: Scan the InputGrid to find the unique non-zero value, V. Handle cases where there is no non-zero value or multiple unique non-zero values if necessary (though examples suggest one unique V).
  - Create Pattern: Generate the 3x3 DerivedPattern: Initialize a 3x3 grid with zeros. Iterate through the InputGrid (ir, ic). If InputGrid[ir][ic] == 0, set DerivedPattern[ir][ic] = V.
  - Initialize Output: Create a 9x9 OutputGrid filled with 0s.
  - Iterate and Place: Loop through each cell (r, c) of the 3x3 InputGrid.
      - Check Value: Get the value InputGrid[r][c].
      - Conditional Placement:
          - If InputGrid[r][c] is non-zero (equals V):
              - Determine target Subgrid location in OutputGrid: rows 3*r to 3*r+2, columns 3*c to 3*c+2.
              - Copy the pre-calculated DerivedPattern into this target Subgrid location.
          - If InputGrid[r][c] is 0, do nothing (the target Subgrid remains 0s).
  - Finalize: The resulting OutputGrid is the final output.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the unique non-zero value, `V`, present in the 3x3 `InputGrid`. (Assume based on examples that there's exactly one such value if any non-zeros exist). If the grid is all zeros, the output will be all zeros.
2.  Create a 3x3 grid, called `DerivedPattern`, initialized with zeros.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the `InputGrid` using row index `ir` (0-2) and column index `ic` (0-2).
4.  If `InputGrid[ir][ic]` is 0, set `DerivedPattern[ir][ic]` to `V`.
5.  Create a new 9x9 grid, called `OutputGrid`, and initialize all its cells to 0.
6.  Iterate through each cell of the `InputGrid` again, using row index `r` (0-2) and column index `c` (0-2).
7.  If `InputGrid[r][c]` is not equal to 0 (i.e., it equals `V`):
    a.  Determine the top-left corner coordinates for the target subgrid in the `OutputGrid`: `start_row = 3*r`, `start_col = 3*c`.
    b.  Copy the contents of the `DerivedPattern` into the `OutputGrid` in the 3x3 block starting at `(start_row, start_col)`.
8.  The `OutputGrid` now contains the final result.
