task_type: grid_transformation
input_data:
  type: 2D grid
  cell_type: integer (representing color)
  structure: nested rectangular/square regions
output_data:
  type: 2D grid
  cell_type: integer (representing color)
  structure: same spatial structure as input
transformation:
  type: color substitution
  logic: cyclic permutation of three key colors
key_colors:
  - name: Color A
    identification: Color of the outermost border cells.
  - name: Color B
    identification: Color filling the region immediately inside the border (A) and surrounding the innermost shape (C).
  - name: Color C
    identification: Color forming the innermost distinct rectangular/square shape.
relationships:
  - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - The spatial position of each color region is preserved.
actions:
  - Identify the three key colors (A, B, C) based on their spatial roles (Outer, Middle, Inner).
  - Replace every instance of Color A in the input grid with Color C in the output grid.
  - Replace every instance of Color B in the input grid with Color A in the output grid.
  - Replace every instance of Color C in the input grid with Color B in the output grid.
