Each input grid consists of nested rectangular or square structures defined by different colors. The output grid maintains the same structure (shape and arrangement of regions) but with the colors systematically changed. Typically, three dominant colors define the nested layers: an outer border color, an intermediate color, and an inner shape color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
