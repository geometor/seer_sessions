task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: boundary_frame, internal_pattern, corner_values
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: matches the dimensions of the internal_pattern exactly
  - object: boundary_frame
    properties:
      - composed_of: integer 1
      - shape: rectangle
      - location: within input_grid
      - function: separates corner_values from internal_pattern, defines the bounds of the internal_pattern
  - object: internal_pattern
    properties:
      - composed_of: integers 0 and 8
      - location: subgrid located strictly inside the boundary_frame in input_grid
      - structure: defines the structure and dimensions (height 'h', width 'w') of the output_grid
  - object: corner_values
    properties:
      - quantity: 4
      - type: integers (non-1, non-8, potentially 0)
      - location: at the absolute corners (0,0), (0, max_col), (max_row, 0), (max_row, max_col) of the input_grid
      - role: values used to replace '8's in the output_grid based on position within the internal_pattern
  - relationship: internal_pattern_to_output
    properties:
      - action: transform
      - rule: Create an output grid with dimensions identical to the internal_pattern. Iterate through internal_pattern cells. If cell value is 0, copy 0 to the corresponding output cell. If cell value is 8, determine the cell's quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) relative to the center of the internal_pattern and copy the corresponding corner_value (TL, TR, BL, BR) from the input_grid's absolute corners to the output cell.
