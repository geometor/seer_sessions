**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: extracting corner values, identifying an internal pattern bounded by '1's, and replacing '8's within that pattern with corner values based on quadrant, while preserving '0's. However, the implementation failed because it incorrectly sized the output grid. The transformed output grids in the results have the dimensions of the *input* grids, with the correctly transformed pattern embedded within a larger grid of zeros.

The strategy is to correct the output grid creation step. The output grid's dimensions must match the dimensions of the extracted *internal pattern*, not the original input grid. The refined natural language program and subsequent code implementation will focus on ensuring the output grid is initialized with the correct, smaller dimensions derived from the internal pattern.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the dimensions of the input, the expected output, and deduce the dimensions of the internal pattern for each example.

# Okay, the output dimensions for example 2 ARE 4x4. Let me re-examine the input grid.

# This is indeed a 4x4 grid. So the expected output size (4x4) matches the internal pattern size.

# This is a 4x4 grid. The expected output size is 4x4. Matches.

# Conclusion: The dimension mismatch was in the code logic, not the examples.
# The internal pattern dimension matches the output dimension in all cases.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corner Values:** Locate and store the four integer values from the absolute corners of the input grid: Top-Left (TL) at index `[0, 0]`, Top-Right (TR) at `[0, width-1]`, Bottom-Left (BL) at `[height-1, 0]`, and Bottom-Right (BR) at `[height-1, width-1]`.
2.  **Extract Internal Pattern:**
    *   Identify the rectangular subgrid located strictly inside the frame composed of `1`s within the input grid. This subgrid is the "internal pattern" and contains only `0`s and `8`s.
    *   Determine the dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) of this internal pattern grid.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the exact dimensions (`h` x `w`) identified in the previous step.
4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` (row `r` from `0` to `h-1`, column `c` from `0` to `w-1`) of the *internal pattern* grid:
    *   Get the value `v` at `(r, c)` from the internal pattern.
    *   If `v` is `0`, set the value of the *output grid* at `(r, c)` to `0`.
    *   If `v` is `8`, determine the quadrant of the cell `(r, c)` within the internal pattern grid (relative to its center `h/2`, `w/2`):
        *   If `r < h/2` and `c < w/2` (Top-Left quadrant of internal pattern), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the input's TL corner value.
        *   If `r < h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Top-Right quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the input's TR corner value.
        *   If `r >= h/2` and `c < w/2` (Bottom-Left quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the input's BL corner value.
        *   If `r >= h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Bottom-Right quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the input's BR corner value.
5.  **Return Output:** The fully populated `h` x `w` grid is the final output.
