task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: boundary_frame, internal_pattern, corner_values
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: smaller than input_grid, matches dimensions of internal_pattern
  - object: boundary_frame
    properties:
      - composed_of: integer 1
      - shape: rectangle
      - location: within input_grid
      - function: separates corner_values from internal_pattern
  - object: internal_pattern
    properties:
      - composed_of: integers 0 and 8
      - location: inside boundary_frame in input_grid
      - structure: defines the structure and size of the output_grid
  - object: corner_values
    properties:
      - quantity: 4
      - type: integers (non-1, non-8, potentially 0)
      - location: outside boundary_frame, typically at the absolute corners of input_grid (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
      - role: values used to replace '8's in the output_grid based on position
  - relationship: internal_pattern_to_output
    properties:
      - action: transform
      - rule: Iterate through internal_pattern cells. If cell value is 0, copy 0 to corresponding output cell. If cell value is 8, determine the cell's quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) within the internal_pattern and copy the corresponding corner_value (TL, TR, BL, BR) from the input_grid to the output cell.
