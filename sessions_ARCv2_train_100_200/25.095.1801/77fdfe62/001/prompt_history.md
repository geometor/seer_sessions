Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are grids (matrices) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Size Transformation:** The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid.
3.  **Key Numbers:**
    *   `1`: Appears to form a rectangular boundary or frame within the input grid.
    *   `8`: Appears within the region enclosed by the `1`s.
    *   `0`: Appears both inside and outside the `1` boundary.
    *   Other numbers (`2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9` in the examples): Appear outside the `1` boundary, typically at or near the four absolute corners of the input grid.
4.  **Core Structure:** The input seems to consist of four "corner" values located outside a frame of `1`s, and an "internal pattern" of `0`s and `8`s located inside the frame.
5.  **Output Construction:** The output grid's structure and values appear derived from the "internal pattern" (`0`s and `8`s), where the `8`s are selectively replaced by the "corner" values from the input. The `0`s from the internal pattern seem to carry over directly to the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - contains: boundary_frame, internal_pattern, corner_values
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: smaller than input_grid, matches dimensions of internal_pattern
  - object: boundary_frame
    properties:
      - composed_of: integer 1
      - shape: rectangle
      - location: within input_grid
      - function: separates corner_values from internal_pattern
  - object: internal_pattern
    properties:
      - composed_of: integers 0 and 8
      - location: inside boundary_frame in input_grid
      - structure: defines the structure and size of the output_grid
  - object: corner_values
    properties:
      - quantity: 4
      - type: integers (non-1, non-8, potentially 0)
      - location: outside boundary_frame, typically at the absolute corners of input_grid (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
      - role: values used to replace '8's in the output_grid based on position
  - relationship: internal_pattern_to_output
    properties:
      - action: transform
      - rule: Iterate through internal_pattern cells. If cell value is 0, copy 0 to corresponding output cell. If cell value is 8, determine the cell's quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) within the internal_pattern and copy the corresponding corner_value (TL, TR, BL, BR) from the input_grid to the output cell.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:**
    *   Locate the four corner values from the absolute corners of the input grid: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).
    *   Identify the rectangular frame composed of `1`s within the input grid.
    *   Extract the subgrid located strictly inside the `1` frame; this is the "internal pattern" grid, composed of `0`s and `8`s. Note its dimensions (height `h`, width `w`).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions (`h` x `w`) as the internal pattern grid.
3.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` (row `r`, column `c`) of the internal pattern grid:
    *   Get the value `v` at `(r, c)` from the internal pattern.
    *   If `v` is `0`, set the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` to `0`.
    *   If `v` is `8`, determine the quadrant of the cell `(r, c)` within the internal pattern grid:
        *   If `r < h/2` and `c < w/2` (Top-Left quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the TL corner value.
        *   If `r < h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Top-Right quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the TR corner value.
        *   If `r >= h/2` and `c < w/2` (Bottom-Left quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the BL corner value.
        *   If `r >= h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Bottom-Right quadrant), set the output grid value at `(r, c)` to the BR corner value.
4.  **Return Output:** The fully populated grid is the final output.
