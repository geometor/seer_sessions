task_type: grid_transformation
input_type: 2d_integer_grid
output_type: 2d_integer_grid
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: input and output grids have the same dimensions
  - cell_values: non-negative integers
transformation_elements:
  - target_value_1: 2
  - target_value_2: 3
  - replacement_value_1: 0 (replaces 2)
  - replacement_value_2: 8 (replaces 3)
  - zero_value: 0 (often represents background/empty)
  - other_values: integers other than 0, 2, 3 (e.g., 5) appear unaffected
relationship: adjacency (von_neumann_neighborhood)
condition_for_change:
  - A cell with value 2 must be adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a cell with value 3.
action_rules:
  - If a cell containing '2' is adjacent to a cell containing '3':
    - The cell originally containing '2' changes its value to '0' in the output.
    - The cell originally containing '3' changes its value to '8' in the output.
  - These changes seem to apply based on all adjacencies found in the original input grid.
  - Cells not involved in a '2'-'3' adjacency retain their original value.
