            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects are 2D grids (matrices) containing non-negative integers. The key integers involved in the transformation appear to be `0`, `2`, and `3`. Other integers like `5` seem to remain unchanged.\n*   **Properties:** Cells in the grid have a position (row, column) and a value (the integer). Adjacency (sharing an edge, not just a corner - von Neumann neighborhood) between cells is a crucial property.\n*   **Actions:** The core action is a transformation applied to the grid. This transformation involves changing the values of specific cells based on their value and the values of their adjacent neighbors. Specifically, cells with value `2` change to `0`, and cells with value `3` change to `8`.\n*   **Relationships:** The transformation rule is based on the adjacency relationship between cells containing `2` and cells containing `3`. A `2` must be adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a `3` for the transformation to occur at those locations.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
