task_description: "Identify patterns of '5's within 3x3 subgrids of a 3x9 input grid and replace each subgrid with a uniform 3x3 grid filled with a digit corresponding to the identified pattern."

grid_properties:
  input_dimensions: [3, 9]
  output_dimensions: [3, 9]
  input_values: [0, 5]
  output_values: [1, 3, 4, 6, 9] # Based on examples

structure:
  granularity: "3x3 subgrids"
  input_subgrids: 3
  output_subgrids: 3
  subgrid_mapping: "One-to-one correspondence between input and output subgrids based on horizontal position."

transformation:
  type: "Pattern recognition and replacement"
  input_element: "Pattern of '5's within a 3x3 subgrid"
  output_element: "A single digit filling the corresponding 3x3 output subgrid"
  rule: "Each specific pattern of '5's maps to a unique output digit."

identified_patterns:
  - pattern: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]] # Visually like a bottom line
    output_value: 1
  - pattern: [[5, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]] # Or [[5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]] - Visually like '3'
    output_value: 3
  - pattern: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]] # Visually like a center dot
    output_value: 4
  - pattern: [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] # Visually like a top line
    output_value: 6
  - pattern: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]] # Visually like a diagonal '\'
    output_value: 9

assumptions:
  - "The input grid will always be 3x9."
  - "The input grid will only contain 0s and 5s."
  - "Each 3x3 input subgrid will correspond to one of the known patterns."
  - "The transformation operates independently on each 3x3 subgrid."
