These lines act as separators, dividing the grid.\n3.  **Separator Digit Consistency:** The digit used in the separator row is always the same as the digit used in the separator column for a given input grid.\n4.  **Subgrid Extraction:** The output grid is always a subgrid (quadrant) extracted from the input grid, relative to the separator lines. The separator lines themselves are excluded from the output.\n5.  **Quadrant Selection:** The specific quadrant chosen for the output seems to depend on the value of the digit forming the separator lines. In the examples:\n    *   Separator digit `1` or `2` results in the top-left quadrant being selected.\n    *   Separator digit `3` results in the bottom-left quadrant being selected.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
