## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: locating separator lines (a row and column with a single repeating digit `S`) and selecting a quadrant based on `S`. The provided code implemented this logic, successfully solving Examples 2 (S=3 -> Bottom-Left) and 3 (S=1 -> Top-Left).

However, Example 1 (S=2 -> Top-Left) failed. The code extracted the Top-Left quadrant from the input, but the expected output differed. A closer look revealed that the expected output for S=2 appears to be a merge of the input's Top-Left (TL) and Top-Right (TR) quadrants. Specifically, it takes the structure of the TL quadrant but replaces values with corresponding values from the TR quadrant, *unless* the TR value is the separator digit `S` itself.

**Strategy:**
1.  Confirm the separator finding logic is correct (it appears to be).
2.  Refine the quadrant selection/extraction logic:
    *   Keep the rules for S=1 (extract TL) and S=3 (extract BL).
    *   Implement a new rule for S=2: Create the output based on TL dimensions, then populate it by checking the corresponding cell in TR. If TR's value is not `S` (2), use TR's value; otherwise, use TL's value.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) to reflect this revised understanding.

        - Extract quadrant_BL from input_grid. Set as output_grid.
      - If rule is 'merge_TL_TR':
        - Extract quadrant_TL.
        - Extract quadrant_TR.
        - Create an empty output_grid with the same dimensions as quadrant_TL.
        - For each cell (r, c) in output_grid:
          - Get value_tl from quadrant_TL[r][c].
          - Get value_tr from quadrant_TR[r][c].
          - If value_tr is not equal to S (which is 2), set output_grid[r][c] = value_tr.
          - Else (if value_tr is equal to S), set output_grid[r][c] = value_tl.

relationships:
  - The output_grid's content and dimensions depend on the separator digit (S) and the location of the separator lines (R, C).
  - For S=1 and S=3, the output is a direct extraction of a single quadrant (TL or BL, respectively).
  - For S=2, the output is a merge of two quadrants (TL and TR), prioritizing non-separator values from TR.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Separators:**
    *   Scan the `input_grid` to find the unique row (`separator_row`) composed entirely of a single repeating digit. Record the index of this row as `R` and the digit as `S`.
    *   Scan the `input_grid` to find the unique column (`separator_column`) composed entirely of the same digit `S`. Record the index of this column as `C`.

2.  **Determine Processing Rule based on Separator Digit (`S`):**
    *   If `S` is 1: The rule is to extract the **Top-Left** quadrant.
    *   If `S` is 3: The rule is to extract the **Bottom-Left** quadrant.
    *   If `S` is 2: The rule is to merge the **Top-Left** and **Top-Right** quadrants.

3.  **Generate Output Grid:**
    *   **If the rule is Extract Top-Left (S=1):**
        *   Create the `output_grid` by copying all cells from the `input_grid` located at rows 0 to `R-1` and columns 0 to `C-1`.
    *   **If the rule is Extract Bottom-Left (S=3):**
        *   Create the `output_grid` by copying all cells from the `input_grid` located at rows `R+1` to the end and columns 0 to `C-1`.
    *   **If the rule is Merge Top-Left and Top-Right (S=2):**
        *   Define the Top-Left (TL) quadrant: rows 0 to `R-1`, columns 0 to `C-1`.
        *   Define the Top-Right (TR) quadrant: rows 0 to `R-1`, columns `C+1` to the end.
        *   Create an `output_grid` with the same dimensions as the TL quadrant.
        *   Iterate through each position `(r, c)` within the dimensions of the TL quadrant:
            *   Let `value_tl` be the digit at `input_grid[r][c]` (from TL).
            *   Let `value_tr` be the digit at `input_grid[r][c + C + 1]` (from TR, adjusting column index).
            *   If `value_tr` is **not** equal to the separator digit `S` (which is 2), set `output_grid[r][c]` to `value_tr`.
            *   Otherwise (if `value_tr` **is** equal to `S`), set `output_grid[r][c]` to `value_tl`.

4.  Return the generated `output_grid`.
