actions:
  - name: identify_separators
    input: input_grid
    output: separator_row_index (R), separator_column_index (C), separator_digit (S)
    steps:
      - Find the unique row where all elements are identical. Record its index (R) and the repeated digit (S_row).
      - Find the unique column where all elements are identical. Record its index (C) and the repeated digit (S_col).
      - Verify S_row equals S_col. Set separator_digit (S) to this value.
  - name: determine_output_logic
    input: separator_digit (S)
    output: processing_rule (e.g., 'extract_TL', 'extract_BL', 'merge_TL_TR')
    logic:
      - If S is 1, rule is 'extract_TL'.
      - If S is 3, rule is 'extract_BL'.
      - If S is 2, rule is 'merge_TL_TR'.
  - name: generate_output
    input: input_grid, R, C, S, processing_rule
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - If rule is 'extract_TL':
        - Extract quadrant_TL from input_grid. Set as output_grid.
      - If rule is 'extract_BL':
        - Extract quadrant_BL from input_grid. Set as output_grid.
      - If rule is 'merge_TL_TR':
        - Extract quadrant_TL.
        - Extract quadrant_TR.
        - Create an empty output_grid with the same dimensions as quadrant_TL.
        - For each cell (r, c) in output_grid:
          - Get value_tl from quadrant_TL[r][c].
          - Get value_tr from quadrant_TR[r][c].
          - If value_tr is not equal to S (which is 2), set output_grid[r][c] = value_tr.
          - Else (if value_tr is equal to S), set output_grid[r][c] = value_tl.

relationships:
  - The output_grid's content and dimensions depend on the separator digit (S) and the location of the separator lines (R, C).
  - For S=1 and S=3, the output is a direct extraction of a single quadrant (TL or BL, respectively).
  - For S=2, the output is a merge of two quadrants (TL and TR), prioritizing non-separator values from TR.
