            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism: locating separator lines (a row and column with a single repeating digit `S`) and selecting a quadrant based on `S`. The provided code implemented this logic, successfully solving Examples 2 (S=3 -> Bottom-Left) and 3 (S=1 -> Top-Left).\n\nHowever, Example 1 (S=2 -> Top-Left) failed. The code extracted the Top-Left quadrant from the input, but the expected output differed. A closer look revealed that the expected output for S=2 appears to be a merge of the input's Top-Left (TL) and Top-Right (TR) quadrants. Specifically, it takes the structure of the TL quadrant but replaces values with corresponding values from the TR quadrant, *unless* the TR value is the separator digit `S` itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Confirm the separator finding logic is correct (it appears to be).\n2.  Refine the quadrant selection/extraction logic:\n    *   Keep the rules for S=1 (extract TL) and S=3 (extract BL).\n    *   Implement a new rule for S=2: Create the output based on TL dimensions, then populate it by checking the corresponding cell in TR. If TR's value is not `S` (2), use TR's value; otherwise, use TL's value.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) to reflect this revised understanding.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered via `tool_code` execution:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Separator Row: Index=3, Value=2\n    *   Separator Col: Index=3, Value=2\n    *   Separator Digit (S): 2\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Separator Row: Index=2, Value=3\n    *   Separator Col: Index=2, Value=3\n    *   Separator Digit (S): 3\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (11, 11)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Separator Row: Index=5, Value=1\n    *   Separator Col: Index=5, Value=1\n    *   Separator Digit (S): 1\n\n## Facts\n\n"
