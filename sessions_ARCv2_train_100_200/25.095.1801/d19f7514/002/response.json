            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed during execution because it attempted to call the `.split()` method on an object that was already a list, not a string (`AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'`). This indicates that the `transform` function, within the execution environment, receives the input not as a list of raw text lines, but likely as a pre-parsed list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of integers.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the understanding of the input format provided to the `transform` function. We will assume the input is already parsed into a list of lists of integers (12 rows, 4 columns each). The `parse_grid` helper function is therefore unnecessary and should be removed or bypassed. The core transformation logic, which combines the two logical 6x4 grids based on the presence of '3' in the first or '5' in the second, appears sound based on the initial analysis and should be preserved.\n\n**Metrics and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Assumption:** The `transform` function receives input as a single list containing 12 sub-lists, each sub-list holding 4 integers.\n*   **Input Structure:** `list[list[int]]` with shape 12x4.\n*   **Logical Grids:**\n    *   Grid A: Rows 0-5 of the input list. Contains values 0 and 3.\n    *   Grid B: Rows 6-11 of the input list. Contains values 0 and 5.\n*   **Output Structure:** `list[list[int]]` with shape 6x4.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** For indices `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < 6` and `0 <= c < 3`:\n    *   `output[r][c] = 4` if `input[r][c] == 3` or `input[r+6][c] == 5`.\n    *   `output[r][c] = 0` otherwise.\n*   **Error Analysis:** The error occurred consistently across all examples before the core transformation logic could be tested, confirming the issue lies in input handling/parsing mismatch with the execution environment.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
