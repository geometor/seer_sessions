Input:
  format: Two blocks of text data, each representing a grid.
  num_blocks: 2
  block_dimensions: 6 rows x 4 columns
  block_1:
    lines: 1-6
    values: [0, 3]
    identifier: 3
  block_2:
    lines: 7-12
    values: [0, 5]
    identifier: 5
Output:
  format: One block of text data, representing a grid.
  dimensions: 6 rows x 4 columns
  values: [0, 4]
Transformation:
  type: Element-wise combination
  rule: |
    For each cell at position (row, col):
    IF (value in Block 1 at (row, col) is 3) OR (value in Block 2 at (row, col) is 5)
    THEN the output value at (row, col) is 4
    ELSE the output value at (row, col) is 0
Relationships:
  - Input Block 1 and Output have the same dimensions.
  - Input Block 2 and Output have the same dimensions.
  - The output grid is a result of overlaying or combining the conditions from Input Block 1 and Input Block 2.
