This can be interpreted as two distinct 6x4 grids (matrices).\n    *   The first grid (lines 1-6) contains only the numbers 0 and 3.\n    *   The second grid (lines 7-12) contains only the numbers 0 and 5.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output consists of 6 lines, each containing 4 space-separated integers. This corresponds to a single 6x4 grid. The numbers in the output grid are only 0 and 4.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid seems to be derived by combining the two input grids based on a specific rule applied element-wise. By comparing the input grids and the output grid at corresponding positions (row `i`, column `j`):\n    *   If the element in the first input grid (`input1[i][j]`) is 3, the output element (`output[i][j]`) is 4.\n    *   If the element in the second input grid (`input2[i][j]`) is 5, the output element (`output[i][j]`) is 4.\n    *   If neither of the above conditions is met (meaning `input1[i][j]` is 0 AND `input2[i][j]` is 0), the output element (`output[i][j]`) is 0.\n    *   Essentially, the transformation performs a logical OR operation: if `input1[i][j] == 3` OR `input2[i][j] == 5`, then `output[i][j] = 4`, else `output[i][j] = 0`.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
