"""
1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell's value is 0, change the corresponding cell's value in the output grid to 5.
3. Identify all distinct connected components formed by non-zero colored cells in the input grid (using 4-way adjacency).
4. For each identified non-zero connected component:
    a. Check if all cells belonging to this component are located in the first row (row index 0).
    b. If the component is entirely within the first row, find the cell within that component that has the largest column index (the "rightmost" cell).
    c. Change the value of this specific rightmost cell in the output grid to 5.
5. All other non-zero cells (those not part of a component entirely in the first row, or those part of such a component but not the rightmost cell) retain their original value in the output grid.
6. Return the modified output grid.
