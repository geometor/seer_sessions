Input and output grids maintain the same dimensions for each example.\n2.  **Background Color:** Color 0 consistently acts as a background element in the input grids.\n3.  **Foreground Objects:** Non-zero digits (3, 4, 7 in the examples) represent foreground objects or patterns, often forming connected horizontal lines or simple shapes.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary goal seems to be replacing the background color (0) with a new color (5).\n5.  **Conditional Modification:** A secondary transformation modifies certain foreground cells (non-zero digits) by changing them to color 5, based on specific conditions related to their position and the structure they belong to.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
