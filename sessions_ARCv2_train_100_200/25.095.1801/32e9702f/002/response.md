**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the replacement of background color `0` with `5` and the modification of the rightmost cell for components strictly in the first row. However, it failed on examples 1 and 3, indicating a more complex interaction between the original non-zero shapes and the background replacement.

The errors in examples 1 and 3 reveal two key adjustments needed:
1.  **Leftward Propagation:** Zeros (`0`) immediately to the left of a non-zero shape (in the input) take on the color of that shape in the output.
2.  **Rightmost Cell Modification:** The rightmost cell of *each row segment* of a non-zero shape is changed to `5` in the output, not just for components entirely in the first row.

The strategy is to refine the Natural Language Program and the underlying logic to incorporate these two rules. The process involves:
1.  Initializing the output grid by replacing all `0`s with `5`s and keeping original non-zero values.
2.  Identifying non-zero connected components from the *input* grid.
3.  Iterating through these components and applying the leftward propagation rule to the *output* grid based on the *input* grid's structure.
4.  Iterating through the components again and applying the rightmost-cell-per-row modification rule to the *output* grid.
