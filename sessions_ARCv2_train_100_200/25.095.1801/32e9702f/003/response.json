Initialization: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.\n\n2. Background and Leftward Propagation: Iterate through the input grid.\n   - If a cell `(r, c)` in the input contains 0:\n     - Check the cell immediately to its right `(r, c+1)`.\n     - If the right cell exists (within bounds) and is non-zero, set the output cell `output_grid[r][c]` to the value of the right cell `input_grid[r][c+1]`.\n     - Otherwise (right cell is 0 or out of bounds), set the output cell `output_grid[r][c]` to 5.\n   - If a cell `(r, c)` in the input is non-zero, its value is initially kept in the output grid (this happens implicitly by copying).\n\n3. Rightmost Segment Modification: Iterate through each row of the grid.\n   - Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-zero numbers based on the *input* grid.\n   - For each segment found in a row `r`, determine the column index `c_rightmost` of its rightmost cell.\n   - Set the corresponding cell `output_grid[r][c_rightmost]` to 5.\n\n4.
