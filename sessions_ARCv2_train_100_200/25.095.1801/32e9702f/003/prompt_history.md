Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), likely representing colors or states. Input and output grids maintain the same dimensions for each example.
2.  **Background Color:** Color 0 consistently acts as a background element in the input grids.
3.  **Foreground Objects:** Non-zero digits (3, 4, 7 in the examples) represent foreground objects or patterns, often forming connected horizontal lines or simple shapes.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary goal seems to be replacing the background color (0) with a new color (5).
5.  **Conditional Modification:** A secondary transformation modifies certain foreground cells (non-zero digits) by changing them to color 5, based on specific conditions related to their position and the structure they belong to.

**Facts (YAML):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell's value is 0, change the corresponding cell's value in the output grid to 5.
3.  Identify all distinct connected components formed by non-zero colored cells in the input grid (using 4-way adjacency).
4.  For each identified non-zero connected component:
    a.  Check if all cells belonging to this component are located in the first row (row index 0).
    b.  If the component is entirely within the first row, find the cell within that component that has the largest column index (the "rightmost" cell).
    c.  Change the value of this specific rightmost cell in the output grid to 5.
5.  All other non-zero cells (those not part of a component entirely in the first row, or those part of such a component but not the rightmost cell) retain their original value in the output grid.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the replacement of background color `0` with `5` and the modification of the rightmost cell for components strictly in the first row. However, it failed on examples 1 and 3, indicating a more complex interaction between the original non-zero shapes and the background replacement.

The errors in examples 1 and 3 reveal two key adjustments needed:
1.  **Leftward Propagation:** Zeros (`0`) immediately to the left of a non-zero shape (in the input) take on the color of that shape in the output.
2.  **Rightmost Cell Modification:** The rightmost cell of *each row segment* of a non-zero shape is changed to `5` in the output, not just for components entirely in the first row.

The strategy is to refine the Natural Language Program and the underlying logic to incorporate these two rules. The process involves:
1.  Initializing the output grid by replacing all `0`s with `5`s and keeping original non-zero values.
2.  Identifying non-zero connected components from the *input* grid.
3.  Iterating through these components and applying the leftward propagation rule to the *output* grid based on the *input* grid's structure.
4.  Iterating through the components again and applying the rightmost-cell-per-row modification rule to the *output* grid.
