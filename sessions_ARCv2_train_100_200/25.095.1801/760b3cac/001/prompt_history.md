Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The grid dimensions appear constant within each example (6 rows x 9 columns).
2.  **Cell Values:** The grids primarily contain the integer 0, representing a background. Non-zero integers (specifically 4 and 8) represent foreground objects or shapes.
3.  **Objects:** There seem to be two distinct types of objects/shapes present, one characterized by the digit 4 and the other by the digit 8.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the object(s) made of the digit 8. The object(s) made of the digit 4 remain unchanged in all examples.
5.  **Action:** The transformation applied to the '8' object appears to be a horizontal reflection. The reflected points are added to the grid, also using the digit 8.
6.  **Reflection Axis:** The vertical axis of reflection seems related to the bounding box of the '8' object. Specifically, it's either the left edge or the right edge of the bounding box.
7.  **Rule Variation:** The choice between reflecting across the left edge versus the right edge varies between examples.
    *   Example 1: Reflection across the right edge.
    *   Examples 2 & 3: Reflection across the left edge.
8.  **Determining Factor:** The trigger for choosing the reflection edge appears linked to the properties of the '8' object itself. Comparing the examples, the total count of '8' cells seems to be the deciding factor:
    *   Example 1: 7 '8's -> Reflect Right.
    *   Example 2: 5 '8's -> Reflect Left.
    *   Example 3: 4 '8's -> Reflect Left.
    *   A potential threshold (e.g., count >= 6) determines the reflection direction.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    - rows: 6
    - columns: 9
    - background_value: 0
Objects:
  - type: Shape
    identifier: digit 8
    properties:
      - color: 8
    actions:
      - Find bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - Count occurrences (cell_count)
      - Reflect horizontally
  - type: Shape
    identifier: digit 4
    properties:
      - color: 4
    actions:
      - None (remains static)
Relationships:
  - The '8' shape's transformation depends on its own properties (cell_count).
  - The '4' shape is independent and unaffected by the '8' shape or the transformation.
TransformationRule:
  - Identify the set of cells containing '8'.
  - Calculate cell_count for '8's.
  - Calculate min_col and max_col for '8's.
  - If cell_count >= 6:
      - Define reflection axis as `A = max_col + 0.5`.
      - Reflection formula: `reflected_col = 2 * max_col + 1 - original_col`.
  - Else (cell_count < 6):
      - Define reflection axis as `A = min_col - 0.5`.
      - Reflection formula: `reflected_col = 2 * min_col - 1 - original_col`.
  - For each original cell (r, c) containing '8':
      - Calculate reflected_col.
      - If (r, reflected_col) is within grid bounds:
          - Set the cell value at (r, reflected_col) in the output grid to 8.
  - All other cells retain their original values (including '4's and '0's not overwritten by reflected '8's).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Find all locations `(row, column)` in the input grid that contain the value 8. Store these locations.
3.  Count the total number of locations found in step 2. Let this be `count_8`.
4.  If `count_8` is 0, stop and return the initial output grid.
5.  Find the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`) among the locations found in step 2.
6.  Determine the reflection rule based on `count_8`:
    *   If `count_8` is greater than or equal to 6, choose the "reflect right" rule.
    *   Otherwise (`count_8` is less than 6), choose the "reflect left" rule.
7.  Iterate through each original location `(r, c)` containing the value 8:
    *   If the "reflect right" rule was chosen: Calculate the reflected column `c_reflected = (2 * max_col) + 1 - c`.
    *   If the "reflect left" rule was chosen: Calculate the reflected column `c_reflected = (2 * min_col) - 1 - c`.
    *   Check if the calculated `c_reflected` is a valid column index within the grid (i.e., between 0 and the maximum column index, inclusive).
    *   If `c_reflected` is valid, update the output grid by setting the value at location `(r, c_reflected)` to 8.
8.  Return the final output grid.
