            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of integers. The grid dimensions appear constant within each example (6 rows x 9 columns).\n2.  **Cell Values:** The grids primarily contain the integer 0, representing a background. Non-zero integers (specifically 4 and 8) represent foreground objects or shapes.\n3.  **Objects:** There seem to be two distinct types of objects/shapes present, one characterized by the digit 4 and the other by the digit 8.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the object(s) made of the digit 8. The object(s) made of the digit 4 remain unchanged in all examples.\n5.  **Action:** The transformation applied to the '8' object appears to be a horizontal reflection. The reflected points are added to the grid, also using the digit 8.\n6.  **Reflection Axis:** The vertical axis of reflection seems related to the bounding box of the '8' object. Specifically, it's either the left edge or the right edge of the bounding box.\n7.  **Rule Variation:** The choice between reflecting across the left edge versus the right edge varies between examples.\n    *   Example 1: Reflection across the right edge.\n    *   Examples 2 & 3: Reflection across the left edge.\n8.  **Determining Factor:** The trigger for choosing the reflection edge appears linked to the properties of the '8' object itself. Comparing the examples, the total count of '8' cells seems to be the deciding factor:\n    *   Example 1: 7 '8's -> Reflect Right.\n    *   Example 2: 5 '8's -> Reflect Left.\n    *   Example 3: 4 '8's -> Reflect Left.\n    *   A potential threshold (e.g., count >= 6) determines the reflection direction.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
