Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    - rows: 6
    - columns: 9
    - background_value: 0
Objects:
  - type: Shape
    identifier: digit 8
    properties:
      - color: 8
    actions:
      - Find bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - Count occurrences (cell_count)
      - Reflect horizontally
  - type: Shape
    identifier: digit 4
    properties:
      - color: 4
    actions:
      - None (remains static)
Relationships:
  - The '8' shape's transformation depends on its own properties (cell_count).
  - The '4' shape is independent and unaffected by the '8' shape or the transformation.
TransformationRule:
  - Identify the set of cells containing '8'.
  - Calculate cell_count for '8's.
  - Calculate min_col and max_col for '8's.
  - If cell_count >= 6:
      - Define reflection axis as `A = max_col + 0.5`.
      - Reflection formula: `reflected_col = 2 * max_col + 1 - original_col`.
  - Else (cell_count < 6):
      - Define reflection axis as `A = min_col - 0.5`.
      - Reflection formula: `reflected_col = 2 * min_col - 1 - original_col`.
  - For each original cell (r, c) containing '8':
      - Calculate reflected_col.
      - If (r, reflected_col) is within grid bounds:
          - Set the cell value at (r, reflected_col) in the output grid to 8.
  - All other cells retain their original values (including '4's and '0's not overwritten by reflected '8's).
