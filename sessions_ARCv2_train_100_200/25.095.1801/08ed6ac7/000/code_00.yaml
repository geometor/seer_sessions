task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: integers (input: 0, 5; output: 0 and positive integers)
      - dimensions: rows, columns (consistent between input and output)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer
  - object: vertical_segment
    properties:
      - composition: contiguous vertical sequence of cells with value 5 in the input grid
      - identifier: unique positive integer ID assigned during processing
      - key_cell: the top-most cell of the segment
    relationships:
      - located_within: grid
      - composed_of: cells
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all distinct vertical segments of '5's in the input grid.
  - action: assign_ids
    description: Assign sequential positive integer IDs (1, 2, 3, ...) to the identified segments.
    logic: The order of ID assignment is determined by scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right, and assigning the next available ID when the top-most cell of an unassigned segment is encountered.
  - action: transform_grid
    description: Create the output grid by replacing all '5's belonging to a segment with the segment's assigned ID and copying all '0's.
