**Perception of the elements of the task:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid containing only zeros and the digit '5' into a new grid of the same dimensions. The transformation identifies distinct vertical segments composed of '5's within the input grid. Each unique vertical segment is then assigned a positive integer ID (starting from 1). The assignment order is crucial: segments are numbered based on the order in which their top-most '5' is encountered during a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid. In the output grid, all '5's belonging to a particular segment are replaced by that segment's assigned ID, while the zeros remain unchanged.

task_elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - content: integers (input: 0, 5; output: 0 and positive integers)
      - dimensions: rows, columns (consistent between input and output)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - position: (row, column)
      - value: integer
  - object: vertical_segment
    properties:
      - composition: contiguous vertical sequence of cells with value 5 in the input grid
      - identifier: unique positive integer ID assigned during processing
      - key_cell: the top-most cell of the segment
    relationships:
      - located_within: grid
      - composed_of: cells
  - action: identify_segments
    description: Find all distinct vertical segments of '5's in the input grid.
  - action: assign_ids
    description: Assign sequential positive integer IDs (1, 2, 3, ...) to the identified segments.
    logic: The order of ID assignment is determined by scanning the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right, and assigning the next available ID when the top-most cell of an unassigned segment is encountered.
  - action: transform_grid
    description: Create the output grid by replacing all '5's belonging to a segment with the segment's assigned ID and copying all '0's.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros. Create a way to track which '5' cells have already been assigned to a segment (e.g., a visited grid or set). Initialize a counter `current_id` to 1.
2.  **Scan and Assign:** Iterate through the input grid cell by cell, row by row from top to bottom, and column by column from left to right within each row.
3.  **Segment Detection:** For each cell `(r, c)`:
    *   If the cell contains a '5' and has not yet been assigned to a segment:
        *   This cell marks the start (top-most cell encountered in scan order) of a new vertical segment.
        *   Assign `current_id` to this new segment.
        *   Trace vertically downwards from `(r, c)` to find all contiguous '5's in the same column `c`.
        *   For every cell `(i, c)` belonging to this segment (including the starting cell):
            *   Set the value of the cell `(i, c)` in the output grid to `current_id`.
            *   Mark the cell `(i, c)` as assigned/visited.
        *   Increment `current_id` by 1.
4.  **Output:** Once the entire input grid has been scanned, the output grid contains the transformed result. Return the output grid.
