The transformation identifies distinct vertical segments composed of '5's within the input grid. Each unique vertical segment is then assigned a positive integer ID (starting from 1). The assignment order is crucial: segments are numbered based on the order in which their top-most '5' is encountered during a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid. In the output grid, all '5's belonging to a particular segment are replaced by that segment's assigned ID, while the zeros remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML block documenting facts:**\n\n"
