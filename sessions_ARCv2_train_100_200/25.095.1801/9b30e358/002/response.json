            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code failed during execution on both training examples with the same error: `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This error occurred within the `parse_grid_block` helper function, specifically when trying to process `block_str`. This indicates that the variable `block_str`, expected to be a multi-line string representing one of the input grids, was actually a list object during the test execution.\n\nThe likely cause is a mismatch between the input format expected by the `parse_input_string` function (a single multi-line string containing both grids separated by a blank line) and the format actually provided during the testing phase. The parsing logic within the function appears correct for handling the raw string format as described in the task examples.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (discarding the first grid, processing the second grid based on the parity of its height) seems consistent with the input/output examples. The error does not necessitate a change in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, but rather points to an implementation detail or testing environment issue regarding input handling.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the previously derived transformation logic and update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program accordingly, assuming the function will eventually receive the input as a raw multi-line string. The code implementation needs correction to handle the input format correctly, potentially by adjusting the parsing entry point or adding type checking, but the fundamental algorithm remains the same.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nMetrics are gathered by analyzing the provided `input` and `output` text blocks for each example, based on the intended transformation logic. Code execution failed, so these are derived from manual inspection.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `InputGrid1`: Dimensions=5x5, Content=Uniform '5'.\n    *   `InputGrid2`: Dimensions=5x5 (H2=5, Odd), Content=Pattern of '2', '8', '5'.\n    *   `OutputGrid`: Dimensions=10x5. Derived by stacking `InputGrid2` on itself.\n    *   Code Result: `AttributeError`.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `InputGrid1`: Dimensions=6x7, Content=Uniform '3'.\n    *   `InputGrid2`: Dimensions=4x7 (H2=4, Even), Content=Pattern of '9', '2', '3'.\n        *   `TopHalf`: First 2 rows of `InputGrid2`.\n        *   `BottomHalf`: Last 2 rows of `InputGrid2`.\n    *   `OutputGrid`: Dimensions=10x7. Derived by stacking `BottomHalf`, `TopHalf`, `BottomHalf`, `TopHalf`, `BottomHalf`.\n    *   Code Result: `AttributeError`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
