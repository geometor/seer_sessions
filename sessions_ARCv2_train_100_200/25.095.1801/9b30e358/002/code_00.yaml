Objects:
  - InputString:
      Properties:
        - content: Raw multi-line string containing two blocks of text separated by a blank line.
  - InputGrid1:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers (parsed from the first block of InputString)
        - height: H1
        - width: W
        - role: Discarded in transformation
  - InputGrid2:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers (parsed from the second block of InputString)
        - height: H2
        - width: W
        - role: Source for OutputGrid
      ConditionalProperties: # Derived if H2 is even
        - TopHalf: First H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
        - BottomHalf: Last H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H_out
        - width: W

Relationships:
  - InputGrid1.width == InputGrid2.width
  - OutputGrid.width == InputGrid2.width
  - OutputGrid.content is derived exclusively from InputGrid2.content
  - OutputGrid.height (H_out) depends on InputGrid2.height (H2):
      - If H2 is odd, H_out = 2 * H2
      - If H2 is even, H_out = 5 * (H2 / 2) # (2.5 * H2)

Actions:
  - ParseInputString:
      - Split InputString into two text blocks based on the blank line separator.
      - Parse the first text block into InputGrid1 (2D integer array).
      - Parse the second text block into InputGrid2 (2D integer array).
  - DetermineH2Parity: Check if the height of InputGrid2 (H2) is odd or even.
  - ConstructOutput:
      - If H2 is odd: Vertically stack InputGrid2 with itself to form OutputGrid.
      - If H2 is even:
          - Split InputGrid2 horizontally into TopHalf and BottomHalf.
          - Vertically stack components in the order: BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf to form OutputGrid.
