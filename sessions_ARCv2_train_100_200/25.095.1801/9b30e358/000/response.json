            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of two distinct blocks of numerical grids separated by a blank line. Let's call them `InputGrid1` and `InputGrid2`.\n    *   `InputGrid1` appears to be a solid block of a single repeating digit. Its dimensions vary between examples.\n    *   `InputGrid2` contains patterns made of different digits, often including the digit found in `InputGrid1` as a background. Its dimensions also vary.\n    *   The width of `InputGrid1` and `InputGrid2` is always the same within a single example.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a single numerical grid. Its width matches the width of the input grids. Its height varies.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** Comparing the inputs and outputs, `InputGrid1` seems to be entirely disregarded in the transformation. The output grid appears to be constructed solely from the rows of `InputGrid2`.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The way `InputGrid2` is transformed into the `OutputGrid` depends on the number of rows in `InputGrid2` (let's call this height H2):\n    *   **If H2 is odd (Example 1, H2=5):** The `OutputGrid` is formed by vertically stacking `InputGrid2` on top of itself. The resulting height is 2 * H2.\n    *   **If H2 is even (Example 2, H2=4):** `InputGrid2` is conceptually split into a top half (`Top`, first H2/2 rows) and a bottom half (`Bottom`, last H2/2 rows). The `OutputGrid` is constructed by stacking these halves in the sequence: `Bottom`, `Top`, `Bottom`, `Top`, `Bottom`. The resulting height is 5 * (H2/2) or 2.5 * H2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
