Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of two distinct blocks of numerical grids separated by a blank line. Let's call them `InputGrid1` and `InputGrid2`.
    *   `InputGrid1` appears to be a solid block of a single repeating digit. Its dimensions vary between examples.
    *   `InputGrid2` contains patterns made of different digits, often including the digit found in `InputGrid1` as a background. Its dimensions also vary.
    *   The width of `InputGrid1` and `InputGrid2` is always the same within a single example.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a single numerical grid. Its width matches the width of the input grids. Its height varies.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** Comparing the inputs and outputs, `InputGrid1` seems to be entirely disregarded in the transformation. The output grid appears to be constructed solely from the rows of `InputGrid2`.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The way `InputGrid2` is transformed into the `OutputGrid` depends on the number of rows in `InputGrid2` (let's call this height H2):
    *   **If H2 is odd (Example 1, H2=5):** The `OutputGrid` is formed by vertically stacking `InputGrid2` on top of itself. The resulting height is 2 * H2.
    *   **If H2 is even (Example 2, H2=4):** `InputGrid2` is conceptually split into a top half (`Top`, first H2/2 rows) and a bottom half (`Bottom`, last H2/2 rows). The `OutputGrid` is constructed by stacking these halves in the sequence: `Bottom`, `Top`, `Bottom`, `Top`, `Bottom`. The resulting height is 5 * (H2/2) or 2.5 * H2.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputGrid1:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H1
        - width: W
        - type: Background grid (appears unused in transformation)
  - InputGrid2:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H2
        - width: W
        - type: Pattern grid (source for output)
      ConditionalProperties: # Only relevant if H2 is even
        - TopHalf: First H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
        - BottomHalf: Last H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H_out
        - width: W

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid.width == InputGrid2.width
  - OutputGrid.content is derived exclusively from InputGrid2.content
  - OutputGrid.height depends on InputGrid2.height (H2):
      - If H2 is odd, H_out = 2 * H2
      - If H2 is even, H_out = 2.5 * H2 (or 5 * H2 / 2)

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Separate the input text into InputGrid1 and InputGrid2 based on the blank line.
  - DetermineH2Parity: Check if the height of InputGrid2 (H2) is odd or even.
  - ConstructOutput:
      - If H2 is odd: Vertically stack InputGrid2 with itself.
      - If H2 is even:
          - Split InputGrid2 into TopHalf and BottomHalf.
          - Vertically stack components in the order: BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input, identifying two grids separated by a blank line; designate the first as `InputGrid1` and the second as `InputGrid2`.
2.  Discard `InputGrid1`.
3.  Determine the height (number of rows) of `InputGrid2`, let this be `H2`.
4.  Check if `H2` is odd or even.
5.  **If `H2` is odd:** Construct the `OutputGrid` by vertically stacking `InputGrid2` upon a copy of itself (`OutputGrid = stack(InputGrid2, InputGrid2)`).
6.  **If `H2` is even:**
    a.  Divide `InputGrid2` horizontally into two equal halves: `TopHalf` (the first `H2/2` rows) and `BottomHalf` (the last `H2/2` rows).
    b.  Construct the `OutputGrid` by vertically stacking the halves in the following sequence: `BottomHalf`, `TopHalf`, `BottomHalf`, `TopHalf`, `BottomHalf` (`OutputGrid = stack(BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf)`).
7.  Output the resulting `OutputGrid`.
