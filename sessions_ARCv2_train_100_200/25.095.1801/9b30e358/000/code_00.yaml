Objects:
  - InputGrid1:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H1
        - width: W
        - type: Background grid (appears unused in transformation)
  - InputGrid2:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H2
        - width: W
        - type: Pattern grid (source for output)
      ConditionalProperties: # Only relevant if H2 is even
        - TopHalf: First H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
        - BottomHalf: Last H2/2 rows of InputGrid2
  - OutputGrid:
      Properties:
        - content: 2D array of integers
        - height: H_out
        - width: W

Relationships:
  - OutputGrid.width == InputGrid2.width
  - OutputGrid.content is derived exclusively from InputGrid2.content
  - OutputGrid.height depends on InputGrid2.height (H2):
      - If H2 is odd, H_out = 2 * H2
      - If H2 is even, H_out = 2.5 * H2 (or 5 * H2 / 2)

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Separate the input text into InputGrid1 and InputGrid2 based on the blank line.
  - DetermineH2Parity: Check if the height of InputGrid2 (H2) is odd or even.
  - ConstructOutput:
      - If H2 is odd: Vertically stack InputGrid2 with itself.
      - If H2 is even:
          - Split InputGrid2 into TopHalf and BottomHalf.
          - Vertically stack components in the order: BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf.
