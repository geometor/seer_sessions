"""
Processes a raw input string containing two numerical grids separated by blank lines.
The first grid is discarded.
If the second grid (InputGrid2) has an odd number of rows (H2), 
the output is InputGrid2 stacked vertically on top of itself.
If InputGrid2 has an even number of rows (H2), it's split into a top half 
(first H2/2 rows) and a bottom half (last H2/2 rows). The output is constructed 
by vertically stacking these halves in the sequence: BottomHalf, TopHalf, 
BottomHalf, TopHalf, BottomHalf.
