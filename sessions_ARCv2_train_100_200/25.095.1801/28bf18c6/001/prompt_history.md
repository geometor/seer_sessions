Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** An 8x8 grid containing primarily zeros (representing the background) and a small cluster of identical non-zero digits (representing an object or pattern). The non-zero digit varies between examples (2, 8, 1).
2.  **Output:** A 3x6 grid. It appears to be constructed from a smaller 3x3 grid pattern that is repeated twice horizontally.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the relevant 3x3 area within the input grid that contains the non-zero pattern and then duplicating this 3x3 pattern to form the output.
4.  **Key Feature Identification:** The crucial step is locating the correct 3x3 subgrid within the larger 8x8 input. Observing the examples, the 3x3 subgrid corresponds precisely to the smallest bounding box that encloses all the non-zero digits in the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of all non-zero cells within the 8x8 input grid.
2.  Determine the minimum and maximum row indices and the minimum and maximum column indices among these non-zero cells. These define the bounding box of the non-zero cluster.
3.  Verify that the height (max\_row - min\_row + 1) and width (max\_col - min\_col + 1) of this bounding box are both 3.
4.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at the top-left corner of the bounding box (min\_row, min\_col).
5.  Create a new 3x6 output grid.
6.  Copy the extracted 3x3 subgrid into the left half (columns 0-2) of the output grid.
7.  Copy the extracted 3x3 subgrid again into the right half (columns 3-5) of the output grid.
8.  Return the resulting 3x6 output grid.
