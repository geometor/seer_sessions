task_description: Extract a 3x3 subgrid based on the bounding box of non-zero elements and duplicate it horizontally to create the output grid.

elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - content: contains zeros and a cluster of identical non-zero digits
      - role: source data
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - content: derived from input_grid
      - structure: consists of two identical 3x3 subgrids placed side-by-side
      - role: target data
  - object: non_zero_cluster
    properties:
      - type: group of cells
      - location: within input_grid
      - value: identical non-zero digits (e.g., 2, 8, or 1)
      - role: defines the area of interest
  - object: bounding_box
    properties:
      - type: rectangular region
      - definition: smallest rectangle enclosing all non_zero_cluster cells
      - dimensions: 3x3 (based on examples)
      - location: derived from non_zero_cluster coordinates within input_grid
      - role: defines the subgrid to be extracted
  - object: extracted_subgrid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - content: portion of input_grid defined by the bounding_box
      - role: building block for the output_grid

actions:
  - action: find_non_zero_coordinates
    actor: system
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates (row, column) for all non-zero cells
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    actor: system
    input: list of non_zero_coordinates
    output: top_row, left_col, bottom_row, right_col defining the bounding box
    constraints: resulting height and width must be 3
  - action: extract_subgrid
    actor: system
    input:
      - input_grid
      - bounding_box coordinates (top_row, left_col)
    output: 3x3 extracted_subgrid
  - action: construct_output
    actor: system
    input: extracted_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    process: place extracted_subgrid and a copy of it side-by-side
