The non-zero digit varies between examples (2, 8, 1).\n2.  **Output:** A 3x6 grid. It appears to be constructed from a smaller 3x3 grid pattern that is repeated twice horizontally.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the relevant 3x3 area within the input grid that contains the non-zero pattern and then duplicating this 3x3 pattern to form the output.\n4.  **Key Feature Identification:** The crucial step is locating the correct 3x3 subgrid within the larger 8x8 input. Observing the examples, the 3x3 subgrid corresponds precisely to the smallest bounding box that encloses all the non-zero digits in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
