The values used in the output pattern are derived exclusively from the non-zero values present in the input grid.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The process identifies a specific sequence of non-zero numbers from the input and uses this sequence to tile the output grid based on cell coordinates.\n4.  **Sequence Identification:** The sequence consists of the unique non-zero numbers from the input, ordered by their first appearance when scanning the input grid row by row, left to right.\n5.  **Pattern Generation:** The output grid value at position `(r, c)` is determined by cycling through the identified sequence. The specific element chosen depends on the sum of the row and column indices (`r + c`) plus an offset, taken modulo the length of the sequence.\n6.  **Offset Calculation:** The offset appears to be determined by the coordinates `(r0, c0)` of the *first* non-zero element found during the input scan and the length `L` of the sequence. Specifically, the offset `k` is calculated as `(-(r0 + c0)) % L`.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

During the scan, record the coordinates `(r0, c0)` of the very first non-zero element encountered.\n4.

Calculate the length `L` of the sequence list `S`.\n6.  Calculate an offset value `k` using the formula: `k = (-(r0 + c0)) % L`. If no non-zero elements were found, handle this case (e.g., the output might be all zeros, or based on a default sequence/offset, although this scenario isn't present in the examples).
