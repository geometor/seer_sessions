## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming an input grid (matrix) of integers into an output grid of the same dimensions.
1.  **Input Grid:** Contains integers, characterized by a sparse distribution of non-zero values, often clustered or patterned, against a background of zeros.
2.  **Output Grid:** Contains integers, fully populated (no zeros observed in examples), displaying a clear, repeating pattern. The values used in the output pattern are derived exclusively from the non-zero values present in the input grid.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The process identifies a specific sequence of non-zero numbers from the input and uses this sequence to tile the output grid based on cell coordinates.
4.  **Sequence Identification:** The sequence consists of the unique non-zero numbers from the input, ordered by their first appearance when scanning the input grid row by row, left to right.
5.  **Pattern Generation:** The output grid value at position `(r, c)` is determined by cycling through the identified sequence. The specific element chosen depends on the sum of the row and column indices (`r + c`) plus an offset, taken modulo the length of the sequence.
6.  **Offset Calculation:** The offset appears to be determined by the coordinates `(r0, c0)` of the *first* non-zero element found during the input scan and the length `L` of the sequence. Specifically, the offset `k` is calculated as `(-(r0 + c0)) % L`.

## YAML Fact Document


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W)
      - sparsity: contains zero and non-zero elements
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W) (same as input)
      - density: fully populated with non-zero integers from input
      - pattern: repeating, based on coordinates and a sequence
  - name: non_zero_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of unique integers (S)
      - source: derived from non-zero elements of input_grid
      - order: determined by the first appearance (row-major scan)
      - length: L
  - name: first_non_zero_coordinate
    properties:
      - type: tuple (r0, c0)
      - source: coordinates of the first non-zero element in input_grid (row-major scan)
  - name: offset
    properties:
      - type: integer (k)
      - calculation: derived from first_non_zero_coordinate and sequence length L

actions:
  - name: scan_input
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [non_zero_sequence, first_non_zero_coordinate]
    description: Iterate through input_grid (row-major), identify first non-zero element coordinates (r0, c0), and collect unique non-zero elements in order of first appearance to form sequence S.
  - name: calculate_offset
    inputs: [first_non_zero_coordinate, non_zero_sequence]
    outputs: [offset]
    description: Calculate k = (-(r0 + c0)) % L, where L is the length of S.
  - name: populate_output
    inputs: [input_grid dimensions, non_zero_sequence, offset]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: For each cell (r, c) in the output grid, calculate the value using S[(r + c + k) % L].

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have identical dimensions.
  - non_zero_sequence contains only unique, non-zero values from input_grid.
  - The order of non_zero_sequence depends on the row-major scan order of input_grid.
  - offset (k) calculation depends on first_non_zero_coordinate (r0, c0) and length (L) of non_zero_sequence.
  - Each element in output_grid is determined by its coordinates (r, c), the non_zero_sequence (S), its length (L), and the calculated offset (k).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid cell by cell, starting from row 0, column 0, proceeding left-to-right within each row, and then moving to the next row.
3.  During the scan, record the coordinates `(r0, c0)` of the very first non-zero element encountered.
4.  Also during the scan, build an ordered list `S` containing the unique non-zero values from the input grid, adding each unique non-zero value to `S` only the first time it is encountered.
5.  Calculate the length `L` of the sequence list `S`.
6.  Calculate an offset value `k` using the formula: `k = (-(r0 + c0)) % L`. If no non-zero elements were found, handle this case (e.g., the output might be all zeros, or based on a default sequence/offset, although this scenario isn't present in the examples). Assuming non-zero elements exist based on examples.
7.  Create a new output grid of dimensions H x W.
8.  Fill each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid (where `
