objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W)
      - sparsity: contains zero and non-zero elements
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D list or array of integers
      - dimensions: height (H), width (W) (same as input)
      - density: fully populated with non-zero integers from input
      - pattern: repeating, based on coordinates and a sequence
  - name: non_zero_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of unique integers (S)
      - source: derived from non-zero elements of input_grid
      - order: determined by the first appearance (row-major scan)
      - length: L
  - name: first_non_zero_coordinate
    properties:
      - type: tuple (r0, c0)
      - source: coordinates of the first non-zero element in input_grid (row-major scan)
  - name: offset
    properties:
      - type: integer (k)
      - calculation: derived from first_non_zero_coordinate and sequence length L

actions:
  - name: scan_input
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [non_zero_sequence, first_non_zero_coordinate]
    description: Iterate through input_grid (row-major), identify first non-zero element coordinates (r0, c0), and collect unique non-zero elements in order of first appearance to form sequence S.
  - name: calculate_offset
    inputs: [first_non_zero_coordinate, non_zero_sequence]
    outputs: [offset]
    description: Calculate k = (-(r0 + c0)) % L, where L is the length of S.
  - name: populate_output
    inputs: [input_grid dimensions, non_zero_sequence, offset]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: For each cell (r, c) in the output grid, calculate the value using S[(r + c + k) % L].

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have identical dimensions.
  - non_zero_sequence contains only unique, non-zero values from input_grid.
  - The order of non_zero_sequence depends on the row-major scan order of input_grid.
  - offset (k) calculation depends on first_non_zero_coordinate (r0, c0) and length (L) of non_zero_sequence.
  - Each element in output_grid is determined by its coordinates (r, c), the non_zero_sequence (S), its length (L), and the calculated offset (k).
