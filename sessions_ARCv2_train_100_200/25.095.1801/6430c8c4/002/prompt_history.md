**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of a 9x4 grid of integers. A distinct row containing only the digit `4` (`4 4 4 4`) acts as a separator, dividing the input into two main sections.
2.  **Input Sections:**
    *   The top section (rows 0-3) forms a 4x4 grid (let's call it `grid_A`). It primarily uses the digits `0` and `7`.
    *   The bottom section (rows 5-8) forms another 4x4 grid (let's call it `grid_B`). It primarily uses the digits `0` and `2`.
    *   The separator row (row 4) seems purely structural and is discarded.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 4x4 grid of integers. It uses the digits `0` and `3`.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid appears to be generated by comparing `grid_A` and `grid_B` element-wise. A cell in the output grid gets a specific value (3) only when the corresponding cells in *both* `grid_A` and `grid_B` meet a certain condition (being 0). Otherwise, the output cell gets another value (0). The specific non-zero values (7 and 2) in the input grids seem only relevant in that they are *not* 0.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 9 rows x 4 columns
  Structure:
    - Section_A:
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 0-3
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Primarily 0, 7
    - Separator:
        Type: Row
        Location: Row 4
        Values: [4, 4, 4, 4]
        Role: Structural delimiter
    - Section_B:
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 5-8
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Primarily 0, 2
Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Values: 0, 3
Transformation:
  Operation: Element-wise comparison between Section_A and Section_B
  Rule:
    Condition: If cell at (row `r`, col `c`) in Section_A is 0 AND cell at (row `r`, col `c`) in Section_B is 0.
    Result_True: Output cell at (row `r`, col `c`) is 3.
    Result_False: Output cell at (row `r`, col `c`) is 0.
Relationship:
  - Input Section_A maps positionally to Output grid.
  - Input Section_B maps positionally to Output grid.
  - Separator row is ignored in the transformation calculation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two 4x4 input grids: `grid_A` (rows 0-3 of the input) and `grid_B` (rows 5-8 of the input). Ignore the separator row (row 4).
2.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initialized with zeros.
3.  Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 3)`.
4.  For the current position `(r, c)`, check the value of the cell in `grid_A` (i.e., `input[r][c]`) and the value of the corresponding cell in `grid_B` (i.e., `input[r+5][c]`).
5.  If the value in `grid_A` at `(r, c)` is `0` AND the value in `grid_B` at `(r, c)` is `0`, set the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` to `3`.
6.  Otherwise (if either cell in `grid_A` or `grid_B` is not `0`), keep the value of the output grid at `(r, c)` as `0`.
7.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
