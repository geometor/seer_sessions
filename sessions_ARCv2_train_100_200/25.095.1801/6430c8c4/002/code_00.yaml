Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 9 rows x 4 columns
  Structure:
    - Object: Grid_A
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 0-3
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Integers (observed: 0, 7)
        Role: Source for comparison
    - Object: Separator
        Type: Row
        Location: Row 4
        Values: [4, 4, 4, 4]
        Role: Structural delimiter, ignored in transformation
    - Object: Grid_B
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 5-8
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Integers (observed: 0, 2)
        Role: Source for comparison
Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Values: Integers (observed: 0, 3)
Transformation:
  Action: Create_Output_Grid
    Inputs: Grid_A, Grid_B
    Output: Result_Grid (4x4)
    Rule: Element-wise comparison
    Process:
      - Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
      - Condition: Check if the value at `Grid_A[r][c]` is 0 AND the value at `Grid_B[r][c]` is 0.
      - Result_True: Set `Result_Grid[r][c]` to 3.
      - Result_False: Set `Result_Grid[r][c]` to 0.
Relationship:
  - Grid_A provides the first operand for the element-wise comparison.
  - Grid_B provides the second operand for the element-wise comparison.
  - The position (r, c) in Grid_A and Grid_B directly corresponds to the position (r, c) in the Output grid.
  - The specific non-zero values (7 in Grid_A, 2 in Grid_B) only matter insofar as they are *not* 0 for the comparison condition.
