"""
Identify two 4x4 input grids: grid_A (rows 0-3) and grid_B (rows 5-8), ignoring the separator row 4.
Create a new 4x4 output grid, initialized with zeros.
Iterate through each cell position (r, c).
If the cell value at (r, c) in grid_A is 0 AND the corresponding cell value in grid_B is 0, set the output cell at (r, c) to 3.
Otherwise, the output cell remains 0.
Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
