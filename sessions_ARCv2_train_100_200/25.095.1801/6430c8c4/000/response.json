A distinct row containing only the digit `4` (`4 4 4 4`) acts as a separator, dividing the input into two main sections.\n2.  **Input Sections:**\n    *   The top section (rows 0-3) forms a 4x4 grid (let's call it `grid_A`). It primarily uses the digits `0` and `7`.\n    *   The bottom section (rows 5-8) forms another 4x4 grid (let's call it `grid_B`). It primarily uses the digits `0` and `2`.\n    *   The separator row (row 4) seems purely structural and is discarded.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 4x4 grid of integers. It uses the digits `0` and `3`.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The output grid appears to be generated by comparing `grid_A` and `grid_B` element-wise. A cell in the output grid gets a specific value (3) only when the corresponding cells in *both* `grid_A` and `grid_B` meet a certain condition (being 0). Otherwise, the output cell gets another value (0). The specific non-zero values (7 and 2) in the input grids seem only relevant in that they are *not* 0.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
