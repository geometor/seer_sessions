Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 9 rows x 4 columns
  Structure:
    - Section_A:
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 0-3
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Primarily 0, 7
    - Separator:
        Type: Row
        Location: Row 4
        Values: [4, 4, 4, 4]
        Role: Structural delimiter
    - Section_B:
        Type: Subgrid
        Location: Rows 5-8
        Dimensions: 4x4
        Values: Primarily 0, 2
Output:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Values: 0, 3
Transformation:
  Operation: Element-wise comparison between Section_A and Section_B
  Rule:
    Condition: If cell at (row `r`, col `c`) in Section_A is 0 AND cell at (row `r`, col `c`) in Section_B is 0.
    Result_True: Output cell at (row `r`, col `c`) is 3.
    Result_False: Output cell at (row `r`, col `c`) is 0.
Relationship:
  - Input Section_A maps positionally to Output grid.
  - Input Section_B maps positionally to Output grid.
  - Separator row is ignored in the transformation calculation.
