task_type: grid_transformation
description: Fill regions of the grid based on the locations of non-zero values in the input.
components:
  grid:
    type: 2D array
    element_type: integer
    properties:
      - height: number of rows
      - width: number of columns
      - background_value: 0
  cell:
    type: element within the grid
    properties:
      - row_index: integer (0-based)
      - column_index: integer (0-based)
      - value: integer
  non_zero_cell:
    type: cell
    condition: value > 0
    role: initiator of transformation
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
  - name: identify_sources
    description: Find all non_zero_cells in the input grid.
  - name: apply_fill_rule
    description: For each identified source cell, perform horizontal and vertical filling.
    steps:
      - name: fill_right
        input: source_cell (r, c, C), output_grid, grid_width
        output: modified output_grid
        effect: Sets output_grid[r][j] = C for all j from c + 1 to grid_width - 1.
      - name: fill_down_last_column
        input: source_cell (r, c, C), output_grid, grid_height, grid_width
        output: modified output_grid
        effect: Sets output_grid[i][grid_width - 1] = C for all i from r + 1 to grid_height - 1.
processing_order:
  - description: Source cells from the input grid are processed sequentially.
  - standard_order: top-to-bottom (by row), then left-to-right (by column).
  - consequence: Later processing steps can overwrite values set by earlier steps if their fill regions overlap.
