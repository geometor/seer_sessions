The background value is consistently 0.\n2.  **Core Objects**: The primary objects are the grids themselves and the individual cells within them. Cells with non-zero values seem to be the \"active\" elements triggering the transformation.\n3.  **Transformation Type**: The transformation appears to be a \"spreading\" or \"filling\" process originating from the non-zero cells in the input grid.\n4.  **Spreading Pattern**:\n    *   Each non-zero cell `C` at position `(r, c)` in the input influences cells in the output grid.\n    *   The influence spreads horizontally to the right within the same row `r`, starting from column `c + 1` to the last column. All these cells take the value `C`.\n    *   The influence also spreads vertically downwards in the *last* column of the grid, starting from row `r + 1` to the last row. All these cells also take the value `C`.\n5.  **Overwriting**: If multiple non-zero cells influence the same output cell, the one processed later (based on a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input's non-zero cells) determines the final value. The value `C` used for filling always corresponds to the *original* non-zero cell being processed.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
