Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis, selecting the object with the highest density (breaking ties with the largest bounding box area), worked for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2 and 3. The execution results show the code selected Object 7 (density 1.0) in Example 2, while Object 6 (density 0.75) was expected. Similarly, in Example 3, the code would select Object 8 (density 0.875), but Object 5 (density 0.75) was expected (and incorrectly reported as a match in the results).

This indicates the primary selection criterion is not simply maximizing density. A new hypothesis is needed. By examining the properties of the *correctly* selected objects across all examples, a new pattern emerged:

1.  Calculate the number of unique digits within the bounding box of each object (including the background digit 0).
2.  Prioritize the object(s) whose bounding box contains the *minimum* number of unique digits.
3.  If this results in a single object (as in Example 1), select it.
4.  If there's a tie (multiple objects have the same minimum number of unique digits in their bounding box, as in Examples 2 and 3), use a tie-breaker: Select the object among the tied ones whose density (cell_count / bbox_area) is closest to 0.75.
5.  If there's still a tie (e.g., multiple objects have density exactly 0.75 or equidistant from it), use a secondary tie-breaker: select the object with the largest bounding box area.

This revised strategy correctly identifies the target object in all three training examples. The next step is to gather detailed metrics for each object using code execution to verify the properties used in this new hypothesis.
