1.  Identify all distinct connected groups (objects) of non-zero digits in the input grid.
2.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing the object).
    b.  Calculate the area of the bounding box.
    c.  Count the number of cells occupied by the object.
    d.  Calculate the object's density by dividing its cell count by its bounding box area.
3.  Find the maximum density value among all calculated densities.
4.  Select all objects that have this maximum density.
5.  If only one object has the maximum density, choose this object.
6.  If multiple objects share the maximum density, choose the object among them that has the largest bounding box area.
7.  Extract the rectangular region from the input grid defined by the bounding box of the chosen object. This extracted region is the output grid.
