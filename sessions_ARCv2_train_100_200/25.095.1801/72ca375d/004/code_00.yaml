task_elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 10x10 grid of single digits (0-9).
    properties:
      - dimensions: [10, 10]
      - background_digit: 0
      - contains: non_zero_objects
  - element: non_zero_objects
    description: Connected components of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - digit_value: The digit making up the object (1-9).
      - cells: List of coordinates [(row, col), ...] occupied by the object.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all object cells [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col].
  - element: unique_object_digits
    description: The set of unique digit values present across all non_zero_objects in the input grid.
    properties:
      - count: Number of unique digits.
      - values: List of the unique digits.
  - element: median_digit
    description: The median value calculated from the sorted list of unique_object_digits.
    constraints:
      - Assumes an odd number of unique_object_digits based on examples.
  - element: selected_object
    description: The non_zero_object whose digit_value matches the median_digit.
    constraints:
      - Assumes only one object will match the median_digit based on examples.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A rectangular subgrid extracted from the input grid.
    properties:
      - content: Matches the content within the bounding_box of the selected_object.
      - dimensions: Determined by the bounding box size of the selected_object.

transformation:
  input: input_grid
  output: output_grid
  steps:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Find all distinct connected non-zero objects and their digit values in the input grid.
      input: input_grid
      output: list_of_objects
    - action: find_unique_digits
      description: Create a sorted list of unique digit values from all identified objects.
      input: list_of_objects
      output: unique_object_digits_list
    - action: calculate_median_digit
      description: Calculate the median value from the unique_object_digits_list.
      input: unique_object_digits_list
      output: median_digit_value
    - action: select_object_by_median
      description: Identify the object from list_of_objects whose digit_value equals the median_digit_value.
      input: list_of_objects, median_digit_value
      output: selected_object
    - action: determine_bounding_box
      description: Find the bounding box coordinates of the selected_object.
      input: selected_object
      output: bounding_box_coords
    - action: extract_subgrid
      description: Extract the subgrid from the input_grid corresponding to the bounding_box_coords.
      input: input_grid, bounding_box_coords
      output: output_grid

relationships:
  - The output_grid's content and dimensions are determined by the bounding_box of the selected_object.
  - The selected_object is chosen based on its digit_value matching the median of all unique object digit values in the input grid.
