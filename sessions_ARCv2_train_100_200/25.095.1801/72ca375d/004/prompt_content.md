"""
Identify all distinct connected non-zero objects in the input grid.
For each object, determine its bounding box, cell count, bounding box area, density (cell count / area), and the count of unique digits (including 0) within its bounding box.
Find the minimum count of unique digits found across all object bounding boxes.
Select all objects whose bounding box contains this minimum number of unique digits.
If only one object is selected, this is the target object.
If multiple objects are selected (tie in minimum unique digits):
  Calculate the absolute difference between each tied object's density and 0.75.
  Select the object(s) from this tied set whose density difference from 0.75 is the smallest.
If there is still a tie (multiple objects have the same minimum density difference):
  Select the object among these tied objects that has the largest bounding box area. (If still tied, the first one encountered is chosen).
Extract the rectangular region from the input grid defined by the bounding box of the finally selected object. This extracted region is the output grid.
