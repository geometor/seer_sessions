The number of columns varies (7 in the first, 10 in the second).\n2.  **Key Feature**: The transformation primarily involves the non-zero numbers present only in the *first row* of the input grid. All other rows in the input are filled with zeros.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: Each non-zero number `v` found at column `c` in the first row (`row 0`) of the input propagates downwards through the subsequent rows.\n    *   The propagation pattern alternates based on the row index `r` (starting from `r=1`).\n    *   In **odd-numbered rows** (`r = 1, 3, 5, ...`), the value `v` appears in the columns immediately to the left (`c-1`) and right (`c+1`) of the original column `c`, provided these columns exist within the grid boundaries.\n    *   In **even-numbered rows** (`r = 2, 4, ...`), the value `v` appears directly below the original position, in the same column `c`.\n4.  **Independence**: The propagation of each non-zero value from the first row occurs independently. The final output grid is a combination of the original first row and the propagated values in the subsequent rows.\n5.  **Value Preservation**: The numeric value of the propagating number remains the same throughout the process.\n6.  **Grid Initialization**: The output grid retains the initial non-zero values from the first row of the input. The subsequent rows are initially considered empty (or zero-filled) and then populated according to the propagation rule.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
