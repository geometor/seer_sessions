task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - role: input and output container
      - dimensions: variable columns, fixed rows (in examples)
  - element: Cell
    properties:
      - type: integer value (0 or non-zero)
      - location: defined by row and column index
  - element: Initial Value
    properties:
      - type: non-zero integer
      - location: confined to the first row (row 0) of the input grid
      - role: seed for propagation
relationships:
  - type: Propagation
    source: Initial Value at (0, c)
    target: Cells in subsequent rows (r > 0)
    rule:
      - condition: row r is odd
        action: Place value at (r, c-1) and (r, c+1), if columns are valid
      - condition: row r is even
        action: Place value at (r, c)
    properties:
      - value is preserved
      - each initial value propagates independently
actions:
  - action: Identify Initial Values
    inputs: input grid (first row)
    outputs: list of (value, column_index) pairs for non-zero cells
  - action: Propagate Value Downwards
    inputs: (value, column_index) from first row, grid dimensions
    outputs: populated cells in rows 1 to num_rows-1 according to the alternating pattern
  - action: Combine Results
    inputs: original input grid, propagated values
    outputs: final output grid
