Let's call this the \"marker\" color.\n    *   The dominant non-zero integer in the input (e.g., 3 in `train_1`, 2 in `train_2`) represents the \"target\" color.\n    *   In the output grid, all instances of the \"target\" color from the input are replaced by the \"marker\" color.\n    *   The original cell containing the \"marker\" color in the input is replaced by 0 in the output.\n    *   All cells with the value 0 in the input remain 0 in the output.\n    *   The spatial arrangement or shape formed by the non-zero elements is preserved, but the color is changed.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
