Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of a grid (matrix) of digits. The observed digits are 0, 1, and 9. The grid dimensions in the examples are 5 rows by 7 columns.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a grid of digits. The observed digits are 0 and 8. The output grid dimensions in the examples are 5 rows by 3 columns.
3.  **Structure:** The input grid seems to have a distinct structure. The middle column (column index 3, 0-based) consistently contains the digit '1'. This column appears to act as a separator.
4.  **Relationship:** The output grid's dimensions (5x3) match the dimensions of the input grid's sections *if* the central '1' column is removed and the remaining columns are split into two 5x3 sections (columns 0-2 and columns 4-6).
5.  **Transformation:** A transformation occurs based on comparing the corresponding cells in the left (columns 0-2) and right (columns 4-6) sections of the input grid.
    *   The digit '1' from the input's central column is discarded.
    *   The digits '0' and '9' from the left and right sections are used to determine the output digits '0' or '8'.
    *   Observing the examples, an output cell is '8' *only when* the corresponding cells in both the left and right input sections are '0'. In all other cases (0/9, 9/0, 9/9), the output cell is '0'.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform a 2D input grid into a smaller 2D output grid based on a comparison rule applied across a central separator column.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - element_type: integer digits (0, 1, 9)
    - structure: 2D array (e.g., 5x7)
    - features:
        - contains a central column consisting entirely of the digit '1' (separator)
        - can be conceptually divided into a left subgrid and a right subgrid flanking the separator

output_grid:
  properties:
    - element_type: integer digits (0, 8)
    - structure: 2D array (e.g., 5x3)
    - dimensions: Matches the dimensions of the input grid's left/right subgrids.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
  - name: output_grid
  - name: separator_column (part of input_grid)
  - name: left_subgrid (part of input_grid)
  - name: right_subgrid (part of input_grid)

relationships:
  - type: spatial_division
    description: The separator_column divides the input_grid into left_subgrid and right_subgrid.
  - type: correspondence
    description: Each cell (r, c) in the output_grid corresponds to cell (r, c) in the left_subgrid and cell (r, c) in the right_subgrid.

actions:
  - name: identify_separator
    input: input_grid
    output: column index of the separator
  - name: split_grid
    input: input_grid, separator_index
    output: left_subgrid, right_subgrid
  - name: compare_cells
    input: value from left_subgrid cell, value from corresponding right_subgrid cell
    output: transformed value (0 or 8) for the output grid cell
  - name: generate_output
    input: left_subgrid, right_subgrid
    output: output_grid

transformation_rule:
  - step: Locate the separator column (containing only '1's) in the input grid.
  - step: Extract the subgrid to the left of the separator (left_subgrid).
  - step: Extract the subgrid to the right of the separator (right_subgrid).
  - step: Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the left_subgrid.
  - step: For each cell position (row r, column c):
      - Get the value `L` from `left_subgrid[r][c]`.
      - Get the value `R` from `right_subgrid[r][c]`.
      - If `L` is 0 AND `R` is 0, set `output_grid[r][c]` to 8.
      - Otherwise, set `output_grid[r][c]` to 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the central vertical column in the input grid that consists solely of the digit '1'. This column acts as a separator.
2.  Define the 'Left Grid' as the columns of the input grid to the left of the separator column.
3.  Define the 'Right Grid' as the columns of the input grid to the right of the separator column.
4.  Create a new 'Output Grid' with the same number of rows as the input grid and the same number of columns as the Left Grid (or Right Grid).
5.  Iterate through each cell position, specified by its row index `r` and column index `c`, within the dimensions of the Output Grid.
6.  For the current position (`r`, `c`), retrieve the digit from the Left Grid (`left_digit = Left Grid[r][c]`) and the digit from the Right Grid (`right_digit = Right Grid[r][c]`).
7.  Compare the `left_digit` and `right_digit`:
    *   If both `left_digit` and `right_digit` are equal to 0, place the digit 8 in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    *   In all other cases (i.e., if at least one of the digits is not 0), place the digit 0 in the Output Grid at position (`r`, `c`).
8.  After processing all cell positions, the resulting Output Grid is the final output.
