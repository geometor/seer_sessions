Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of a grid of numbers. It's clearly divided into three sections:
    *   A top grid containing `0`s and `2`s.
    *   A single row containing only `4`s, acting as a separator.
    *   A bottom grid containing `0`s and `1`s.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a single grid containing `0`s and `3`s.
3.  **Dimensionality:** The output grid consistently has the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the bottom grid of the input. The top grid in the examples also shares these dimensions, though this might not be a general requirement, only that it covers the same positions as the bottom grid. The separator row (`4`s) is not represented in the output.
4.  **Value Mapping:** The core transformation seems to involve combining information from the cell at a specific position `(row, column)` in the top grid and the cell at the *same* position `(row, column)` in the bottom grid to determine the value for the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing corresponding cells across the top input grid (T), bottom input grid (B), and output grid (O) in the examples, a clear pattern emerges:
    *   If the value in the bottom grid `B[row][col]` is `1`, the output `O[row][col]` is always `3`.
    *   If the value in the bottom grid `B[row][col]` is `0`, the output `O[row][col]` depends on the value in the top grid `T[row][col]`:
        *   If `T[row][col]` is `0`, then `O[row][col]` is `0`.
        *   If `T[row][col]` is `2`, then `O[row][col]` is `3`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Combine information from two input grids based on cell values to produce an output grid.

input_elements:
  - name: Top Grid (T)
    description: The grid located above the separator row.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 2]
      - role: Conditional source for output when Bottom Grid cell is 0.
  - name: Separator Row
    description: A single row containing only the value 4.
    properties:
      - value: 4
      - role: Delimiter between Top Grid and Bottom Grid.
  - name: Bottom Grid (B)
    description: The grid located below the separator row.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 1]
      - role: Primary source/mask for output values.
      - determines_output_dimensions: True

output_elements:
  - name: Output Grid (O)
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 3]
      - dimensions: Same as Bottom Grid (B).

relationships:
  - type: Cell-wise Combination
    description: Each cell O[r][c] in the output grid is determined by the values of T[r][c] and B[r][c].
    rule:
      - condition: B[r][c] == 1
        result: O[r][c] = 3
      - condition: B[r][c] == 0 AND T[r][c] == 0
        result: O[r][c] = 0
      - condition: B[r][c] == 0 AND T[r][c] == 2
        result: O[r][c] = 3

actions:
  - Identify Top Grid (T), Separator Row, and Bottom Grid (B) in the input.
  - Initialize an Output Grid (O) with the dimensions of the Bottom Grid (B).
  - Iterate through each cell position (r, c) within the dimensions of the Bottom Grid.
  - Apply the combination rule based on T[r][c] and B[r][c] to determine O[r][c].
  - Populate the Output Grid (O).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input grid to identify three components: the Top Grid (containing 0s and 2s), the Separator Row (containing 4s), and the Bottom Grid (containing 0s and 1s).
2.  Determine the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the Bottom Grid.
3.  Create a new Output Grid with the same dimensions as the Bottom Grid.
4.  For each cell position, defined by its row index `r` and column index `c`, within the bounds of the Bottom Grid:
    a.  Retrieve the value `b` from the Bottom Grid at `B[r][c]`.
    b.  Retrieve the value `t` from the Top Grid at the corresponding position `T[r][c]`.
    c.  If the value `b` is `1`, set the value of the Output Grid at `O[r][c]` to `3`.
    d.  If the value `b` is `0`:
        i.  If the value `t` is `0`, set the value of the Output Grid at `O[r][c]` to `0`.
        ii. If the value `t` is `2`, set the value of the Output Grid at `O[r][c]` to `3`.
5.  Return the completed Output Grid.
