task_description: Combine information from two input grids based on cell values to produce an output grid.

input_elements:
  - name: Top Grid (T)
    description: The grid located above the separator row.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 2]
      - role: Conditional source for output when Bottom Grid cell is 0.
  - name: Separator Row
    description: A single row containing only the value 4.
    properties:
      - value: 4
      - role: Delimiter between Top Grid and Bottom Grid.
  - name: Bottom Grid (B)
    description: The grid located below the separator row.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 1]
      - role: Primary source/mask for output values.
      - determines_output_dimensions: True

output_elements:
  - name: Output Grid (O)
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 3]
      - dimensions: Same as Bottom Grid (B).

relationships:
  - type: Cell-wise Combination
    description: Each cell O[r][c] in the output grid is determined by the values of T[r][c] and B[r][c].
    rule:
      - condition: B[r][c] == 1
        result: O[r][c] = 3
      - condition: B[r][c] == 0 AND T[r][c] == 0
        result: O[r][c] = 0
      - condition: B[r][c] == 0 AND T[r][c] == 2
        result: O[r][c] = 3

actions:
  - Identify Top Grid (T), Separator Row, and Bottom Grid (B) in the input.
  - Initialize an Output Grid (O) with the dimensions of the Bottom Grid (B).
  - Iterate through each cell position (r, c) within the dimensions of the Bottom Grid.
  - Apply the combination rule based on T[r][c] and B[r][c] to determine O[r][c].
  - Populate the Output Grid (O).
