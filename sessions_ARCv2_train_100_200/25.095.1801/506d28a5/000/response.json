            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of a grid of numbers. It's clearly divided into three sections:\n    *   A top grid containing `0`s and `2`s.\n    *   A single row containing only `4`s, acting as a separator.\n    *   A bottom grid containing `0`s and `1`s.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a single grid containing `0`s and `3`s.\n3.  **Dimensionality:** The output grid consistently has the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the bottom grid of the input. The top grid in the examples also shares these dimensions, though this might not be a general requirement, only that it covers the same positions as the bottom grid. The separator row (`4`s) is not represented in the output.\n4.  **Value Mapping:** The core transformation seems to involve combining information from the cell at a specific position `(row, column)` in the top grid and the cell at the *same* position `(row, column)` in the bottom grid to determine the value for the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing corresponding cells across the top input grid (T), bottom input grid (B), and output grid (O) in the examples, a clear pattern emerges:\n    *   If the value in the bottom grid `B[row][col]` is `1`, the output `O[row][col]` is always `3`.\n    *   If the value in the bottom grid `B[row][col]` is `0`, the output `O[row][col]` depends on the value in the top grid `T[row][col]`:\n        *   If `T[row][col]` is `0`, then `O[row][col]` is `0`.\n        *   If `T[row][col]` is `2`, then `O[row][col]` is `3`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
