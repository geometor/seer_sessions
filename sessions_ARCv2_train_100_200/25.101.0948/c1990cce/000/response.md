## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input:** Each input is a 1D grid (a single row) of variable width. The grid contains mostly white pixels (0) and exactly one red pixel (2).
2.  **Output:** Each output is a 2D grid. The width of the output grid is the same as the width of the input grid. The height of the output grid is also the same as the width of the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation generates a pattern expanding downwards from the initial red pixel in the input.
4.  **Grid Structure:** The output grid's first row (row 0) is an exact copy of the input grid.
5.  **Pattern Generation:** Subsequent rows (row `r > 0`) are generated based on the previous row (`r-1`). A cell `(r, c)` in the output grid receives a non-white value if *exactly one* of its diagonal predecessors in the row above (`(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`) was non-white. This is analogous to the Rule 90 cellular automaton or Pascal's triangle modulo 2, determining the *location* of non-white pixels. Boundary conditions apply (pixels outside the grid are considered white/0).
6.  **Color Assignment:** The color (red=2 or blue=1) assigned to a non-white cell `(r, c)` depends on the state of the grid, likely involving the row index `r` and potentially the colors of the predecessors `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.
    *   Observation 1: Rows 1 and 2 exclusively use red (2) for the generated pattern.
    *   Observation 2
: From row 3 onwards, blue (1) starts appearing, sometimes exclusively, sometimes mixed with red.
    *   Observation 3: A consistent, simple rule for choosing between red and blue for rows `r >= 3` based *only* on the predecessors or row index `r` was not immediately obvious and led to contradictions across examples when simple hypotheses were tested. The exact color assignment rule appears complex. However, the underlying *pattern* of where non-white cells appear follows the XOR/Rule 90 logic.

    observed_rule (partial):

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid of size `W x W`, initially filled with white pixels (0).
3.  Copy the input grid (row) into the first row (row 0) of the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the rows of the output grid from `r = 1` to `W-1`.
5.  For each row `r`, iterate through the columns `c` from `0` to `W-1`.
6.  For each cell `(r, c)`, find the values of the diagonal predecessors in the previous row: `L = output_grid[r-1][c-1]` and `R = output_grid[r-1][c+1]`. Treat out-of-bounds predecessors as white (0).
7.  Apply the pattern generation rule: The cell `(r, c)` should be potentially non-white if `(L != 0) XOR (R != 0)`.
8.  Apply the coloring rule:
    *   If `(L != 0) AND (R != 0)` (i.e., both predecessors are non-white), set `output_grid[r][c] = 0` (white).
    *   Else if `(L != 0) XOR (R != 0)` (i.e., exactly one predecessor is non-white):
        *   If `r <= 2`, set `output_grid[r][c] = 2` (red).
        *   If `r > 2`, examine the non-zero predecessor (`L` or `R`):
            *   If the non-zero predecessor is blue (1), set `output_grid[r][c] = 1` (blue).
            *   If the non-zero predecessor is red (2), set `output_grid[r][c] = 1` (blue). *(Correction based on re-examining transitions like train_1 row 2 -> row 3)*.
    *   Else (both predecessors are white), set `output_grid[r][c] = 0` (white).
*(Self-correction during NL program generation: The coloring rule for r > 2 appears simpler than initially thought - if the XOR condition is met, the resulting color seems to default to blue (1) based on transitions observed, regardless of whether the single non-zero parent was red or blue. Let's refine step 8)*

    *   Else if `L == 0` and `R != 0` (propagation from right):
        *   If `r <= 2`: set `output_grid[r][c] = 2` (red).
        *   If `r > 2`: set `output_grid[r][c] = 1` (blue).
    *   Else if `L != 0` and `R == 0` (propagation from left):
        *   If `r <= 2`: set `output_grid[r][c] = 2` (red).
        *   If `r > 2`: set `output_grid[r][c] = 1` (blue).
    *   Else (`L == 0` and `R == 0`): set `output_grid[r][c] = 0`.
