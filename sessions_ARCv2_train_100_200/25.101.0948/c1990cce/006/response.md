## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the core structure of the task: generating a WxW grid from a W-width input row, copying the first row, and using diagonal neighbors (L, R) from the previous row to generate subsequent rows. It also captured some basic interaction rules like collision (`L!=0, R!=0 -> 0`) and simple propagation (`L=1 -> 1`).

However, the code failed on examples 2 and 3 because the rules governing the propagation of the red color (2), especially for rows `r >= 3`, were incorrect. The simple condition based solely on `dist == 1` was insufficient. Analysis of the discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output revealed that the outcome for red propagation depends on a combination of:
1.  Row index `r` (rules change for `r >= 3`).
2.  Distance from center `dist = abs(c - center_c)`.
3.  Propagation direction (Left vs. Right).
4.  Parity of row index `r` and distance `dist` when `r >= 3` and `dist > 1`.
5.  Additionally, the propagation of blue (1) exhibits asymmetry: propagating left yields 1, while propagating right yields 0.

The strategy is to incorporate these refined observations into the transformation rules, leading to a more accurate natural language program and YAML description. The unexplained anomaly where cells with two white parents (`L=0, R=0`) become blue (1) in specific boundary cases (e.g., Ex2 row 10, col 0; Ex3 row 5, col 0) will be noted but not incorporated into the primary local rule set, as it seems to violate locality or require a separate boundary condition rule.

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on comparing the `Transformed Output` of the previous code (`code_00.py`) with the `Expected Output`:

*   **Example 1:** Match. The previous rules were sufficient for this smaller example.
*   **Example 2:** Failed. 32 pixels off.
    *   Errors start at row `r=4`.
    *   **Key Failure Type 1 (Prop R(2)):** At `(r=4, c=8)`, parents `L=0, R=2`, `dist=2`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 0. The rule `Prop R(2), r>=3, dist>1 -> 2` was wrong here. New rule incorporates parity: `r=4`(even), `dist=2`(even). `r%2 == dist%2` is true. New rule predicts 0. (Corrects this failure).
    *   **Key Failure Type 2 (Prop L(2)):** At `(r=5, c=3)`, parents `L=2, R=0`, `dist=3`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 1. The rule `Prop L(2), r>=3, dist>1 -> 2` was wrong here. New rule incorporates parity: `r=5`(odd), `dist=3`(odd). `r%2 != 0` and `dist%2 != 0` is true. New rule predicts 1. (Corrects this failure).
    *   **Key Failure Type 3 (Prop R(1)):** The rule `Prop R(1) -> 0` was identified correctly by analyzing the *expected* output, but the previous code's output suggested it might have implemented this incorrectly or another rule interfered. The new rules maintain `Prop R(1) -> 0`.
    *   **Anomaly:** `(r=10, c=0)` has `L=0, R=0` but `Expected=1`. Not explained by local rules.
*   **Example 3:** Failed. 6 pixels off (based on re-evaluation, previous report's count might differ).
    *   Errors start at row `r=4`.
    *   **Key Failure Type 1 (Prop R(2)):** At `(r=4, c=5)`, parents `L=0, R=2`, `dist=2`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 0. Similar to Ex2(4,8). New rule incorporates parity: `r=4`(even), `dist=2`(even). `r%2 == dist%2` is true. New rule predicts 0. (Corrects this failure).
    *   **Anomaly:** `(r=5, c=0)` has `L=0, R=0` but `Expected=1`. Not explained by local rules.

**Conclusion:** The refined rules incorporating row/distance parity for red propagation (`r>=3, dist>1`) and the asymmetric blue propagation (`Prop R(1) -> 0`) address the systematic errors observed in the previous code's output for Examples 2 and 3. The boundary anomalies remain unexplained by the core local rules.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid (a single row). Determine its width, `W`.
2.  Identify the column index, `center_c`, of the single red pixel (2) in the input row.
3.  Create an output grid of size `W x W`, initialized with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the input row into the first row (`r=0`) of the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the rows of the output grid from `r = 1` to `W-1`.
6.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the current row `r`:
    a.  Get the values of the diagonal predecessors from the previous row (`r-1`): `L = output_grid[r-1][c-1]` (or 0 if `c=0`) and `R = output_grid[r-1][c+1]` (or 0 if `c=W-1`).
    b.  Calculate the horizontal distance from the center: `dist = abs(c - center_c)`.
    c.  Determine the value (`result`) for `output_grid[r][c]` based on the following prioritized rules:
        i.   **Collision:** If both `L` and `R` are non-white (`L != 0` and `R != 0`), set `result = 0`.
        ii.  **Propagate Left Parent:** If `L` is non-white and `R` is white (`L != 0` and `R == 0`):
            *   If `L` is blue (1), set `result = 1`.
            *   If `L` is red (2):
                *   If `r <= 2`, set `result = 2`.
                *   If `r >= 3`:
                    *   If `dist == 1`, set `result = 1`.
                    *   If `dist > 1`, set `result = 1` if both `r` and `dist` are odd, otherwise set `result = 2`.
        iii. **Propagate Right Parent:** If `L` is white and `R` is non-white (`L == 0` and `R != 0`):
            *   If `R` is blue (1), set `result = 0`.
            *   If `R` is red (2):
                *   If `r <= 2`, set `result = 2`.
                *   If `r >= 3`:
                    *   If `dist == 1`, set `result = 0`.
                    *   If `dist > 1`, set `result = 0` if `r` and `dist` have the same parity (`r % 2 == dist % 2`), otherwise set `result = 2`.
        iv.  **No Propagation:** If both `L` and `R` are white (`L == 0` and `R == 0`), set `result = 0`. (Note: This does not account for rare boundary cases where the expected output is 1).
    d.  Assign the calculated `result` to `output_grid[r][c]`.
7.  After iterating through all rows and columns, return the completed output grid.
