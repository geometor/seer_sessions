            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code (`code_00.py`) correctly identified the core structure of the task: generating a WxW grid from a W-width input row, copying the first row, and using diagonal neighbors (L, R) from the previous row to generate subsequent rows. It also captured some basic interaction rules like collision (`L!=0, R!=0 -> 0`) and simple propagation (`L=1 -> 1`).\n\nHowever, the code failed on examples 2 and 3 because the rules governing the propagation of the red color (2), especially for rows `r >= 3`, were incorrect. The simple condition based solely on `dist == 1` was insufficient. Analysis of the discrepancies between the transformed output and the expected output revealed that the outcome for red propagation depends on a combination of:\n1.  Row index `r` (rules change for `r >= 3`).\n2.  Distance from center `dist = abs(c - center_c)`.\n3.  Propagation direction (Left vs. Right).\n4.  Parity of row index `r` and distance `dist` when `r >= 3` and `dist > 1`.\n5.  Additionally, the propagation of blue (1) exhibits asymmetry: propagating left yields 1, while propagating right yields 0.\n\nThe strategy is to incorporate these refined observations into the transformation rules, leading to a more accurate natural language program and YAML description. The unexplained anomaly where cells with two white parents (`L=0, R=0`) become blue (1) in specific boundary cases (e.g., Ex2 row 10, col 0; Ex3 row 5, col 0) will be noted but not incorporated into the primary local rule set, as it seems to violate locality or require a separate boundary condition rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on comparing the `Transformed Output` of the previous code (`code_00.py`) with the `Expected Output`:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Match. The previous rules were sufficient for this smaller example.\n*   **Example 2:** Failed. 32 pixels off.\n    *   Errors start at row `r=4`.\n    *   **Key Failure Type 1 (Prop R(2)):** At `(r=4, c=8)`, parents `L=0, R=2`, `dist=2`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 0. The rule `Prop R(2), r>=3, dist>1 -> 2` was wrong here. New rule incorporates parity: `r=4`(even), `dist=2`(even). `r%2 == dist%2` is true. New rule predicts 0. (Corrects this failure).\n    *   **Key Failure Type 2 (Prop L(2)):** At `(r=5, c=3)`, parents `L=2, R=0`, `dist=3`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 1. The rule `Prop L(2), r>=3, dist>1 -> 2` was wrong here. New rule incorporates parity: `r=5`(odd), `dist=3`(odd). `r%2 != 0` and `dist%2 != 0` is true. New rule predicts 1. (Corrects this failure).\n    *   **Key Failure Type 3 (Prop R(1)):** The rule `Prop R(1) -> 0` was identified correctly by analyzing the *expected* output, but the previous code's output suggested it might have implemented this incorrectly or another rule interfered. The new rules maintain `Prop R(1) -> 0`.\n    *   **Anomaly:** `(r=10, c=0)` has `L=0, R=0` but `Expected=1`. Not explained by local rules.\n*   **Example 3:** Failed. 6 pixels off (based on re-evaluation, previous report's count might differ).\n    *   Errors start at row `r=4`.\n    *   **Key Failure Type 1 (Prop R(2)):** At `(r=4, c=5)`, parents `L=0, R=2`, `dist=2`. Previous code gave 2. Expected is 0. Similar to Ex2(4,8). New rule incorporates parity: `r=4`(even), `dist=2`(even). `r%2 == dist%2` is true. New rule predicts 0. (Corrects this failure).\n    *   **Anomaly:** `(r=5, c=0)` has `L=0, R=0` but `Expected=1`. Not explained by local rules.\n\n**Conclusion:** The refined rules incorporating row/distance parity for red propagation (`r>=3, dist>1`) and the asymmetric blue propagation (`Prop R(1) -> 0`) address the systematic errors observed in the previous code's output for Examples 2 and 3. The boundary anomalies remain unexplained by the core local rules.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
