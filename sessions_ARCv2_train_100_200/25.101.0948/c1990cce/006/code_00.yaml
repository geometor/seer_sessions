task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: input 1D, output 2D
  input_width: variable (W)
  output_width: W (same as input)
  output_height: W (same as input)
  color_palette: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      color: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red}
      position: (row, column)
  - object_type: pattern
    description: Expanding diamond/triangle pattern originating from a single red pixel. Exhibits complex wave-like propagation and interaction.
    generation_rule: Cellular automaton based on diagonal neighbors (L, R) from the previous row. Rules depend on neighbor colors, row index (r), distance from center (dist), propagation direction, and parity comparisons.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Output grid dimensions (WxW) determined by input grid width W.
  - type: positional
    description: Column index 'center_c' of the initial red pixel is critical. Distance 'dist = abs(c - center_c)' modulates rules.
  - type: temporal
    description: Propagation rules differ significantly for early rows (r=1, 2) versus later rows (r>=3).
  - type: parity_dependency
    description: For r>=3 and dist>1, the propagation result for Red(2) depends on whether r and dist share the same parity (r%2 == dist%2).
  - type: asymmetric_propagation
    description: Blue(1) propagates differently depending on direction (L->1, R->0).
  - type: generation
    description: Each row (r > 0) is generated cell-by-cell based on the state of row (r-1).
    rule_summary: Value at (r, c) depends on L=output[r-1, c-1], R=output[r-1, c+1], their colors, dist, r, and parity(r) vs parity(dist).

    rule_details:
      - for each cell (r, c):
        - get parents L=output[r-1, c-1], R=output[r-1, c+1] (handle boundaries)
        - calculate dist = abs(c - center_c)
        - apply collision/propagation logic:
          - If L!=0 and R!=0: result = 0. # Collision
          - Else if L!=0 and R==0: # Propagate L
            - If L == 1: result = 1.
            - If L == 2:
              - If r <= 2: result = 2.
              - If r >= 3: result = 1 if dist == 1 else (1 if (r%2!=0 and dist%2!=0) else 2).
          - Else if L==0 and R!=0: # Propagate R
            - If R == 1: result = 0. # Blue annihilates right
            - If R == 2:
              - If r <= 2: result = 2.
              - If r >= 3: result = 0 if dist == 1 else (0 if (r%2 == dist%2) else 2).
          - Else (L==0 and R==0): result = 0. # No propagation (Note: Ignores observed boundary anomalies)
        - set output[r, c] = result
