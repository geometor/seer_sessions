import numpy as np

"""
Processes a 1D input grid (single row) containing exactly one red pixel (2).
Generates a 2D square output grid (WxW) where W is the width of the input row.
The first row (r=0) of the output is a copy of the input.
Subsequent rows (r=1 to W-1) are generated based on a cellular automaton rule using the diagonal predecessors (L, R) from the row above (r-1).
The rule depends on the row number (r), the colors of L and R, the propagation direction (L or R), and the horizontal distance ('dist') of the current cell (c) from the column of the initial red pixel ('center_c').

Rule details for cell (r, c):
1. Find center_c: Column index of the red pixel in row 0.
2. Get L = output[r-1, c-1] (or 0 if c=0), R = output[r-1, c+1] (or 0 if c=W-1).
3. Calculate dist = abs(c - center_c).
4. Apply rules:
   a. Collision (L!=0 and R!=0): result = 0.
   b. Propagate L (L!=0, R==0):
      - If L=1: result = 1.
      - If L=2:
         - If r <= 2: result = 2.
         - If r >= 3: result = 1 if dist == 1 else 2.
   c. Propagate R (L==0, R!=0):
      - If R=1: result = 0 (Blue annihilates propagating right).
      - If R=2:
         - If r <= 2: result = 2.
         - If r >= 3: result = 0 if dist == 1 else 2.
   d. No Propagation (L==0, R==0): result = 0.
5. Set output[r, c] = result.
