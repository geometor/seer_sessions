## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt (`code_00.py`) failed because its logic for color propagation and annihilation, particularly the condition based on `dist == 1`, was incorrect. It produced incorrect results even for the first row generated (row 1).

The analysis reveals a more complex interaction based on:
1.  **Row Number (`r`):** The rules for propagation change after row 2 (`r >= 3`).
2.  **Propagation Direction (Left vs. Right):** Propagating a signal (color) from the left parent (`L`) behaves differently than propagating from the right parent (`R`).
3.  **Distance from Center (`dist`):** The distance `abs(c - center_c)` affects the outcome, especially when `dist == 1` for rows `r >= 3`.
4.  **Color:** Blue (1) propagates differently than Red (2). Specifically, Blue seems to annihilate (become 0) when propagated right, but persists (as 1) when propagated left.

The most promising rule set derived (V7.1 in thought process) incorporates these factors and correctly predicts the first 3-4 rows of all examples. Failures in later rows of the larger examples suggest either a further refinement is needed for interactions deep within the pattern or a potential edge case/global property wasn't captured. However, V7.1 represents the best understanding based on the initial, clearer interactions.

**Strategy:**
1.  Adopt the refined rule set (V7.1).
2.  Document this rule set clearly in the YAML facts and Natural Language Program.
3.  Acknowledge the potential for deviation in later, more complex interactions if the coder phase reveals further discrepancies.

## Metrics and Analysis

Metrics will be based on the final derived rules (V7.1 logic):

*   **Input:** 1D grid (1 row, W columns) with one Red(2) pixel at `center_c`.
*   **Output:** 2D grid (W rows, W columns).
*   **Row 0:** Copy of input.
*   **Rows r=1, r=2:** Simple propagation (Red->Red) and collision (Red+Red->White). `output[r, c] = 2` if exactly one diagonal parent `(L, R)` is non-zero (which must be Red), `0` otherwise.
*   **Rows r>=3:** Complex propagation:
    *   Collision (L!=0, R!=0) -> 0
    *   Propagate L(1) -> 1
    *   Propagate L(2) -> 1 if dist=1, else 2
    *   Propagate R(1) -> 0
    *   Propagate R(2) -> 0 if dist=1, else 2
    *   No Propagation (L=0, R=0) -> 0

(No code execution needed here as the rules are derived from manual tracing and comparison against expected outputs).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid (a single row). Determine its width, `W`.
2.  Identify the column index, `center_c`, of the single red pixel (2) in the input row.
3.  Create an output grid of size `W x W`, initialized with white pixels (0).
4.  Copy the input row into the first row (`r=0`) of the output grid.
5.  Iterate through the rows of the output grid from `r = 1` to `W-1`.
6.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the current row `r`:
    a.  Get the values of the diagonal predecessors from the previous row (`r-1`): `L = output_grid[r-1][c-1]` (or 0 if `c=0`) and `R = output_grid[r-1][c+1]` (or 0 if `c=W-1`).
    b.  Calculate the horizontal distance from the center: `dist = abs(c - center_c)`.
    c.  Determine the value for `output_grid[r][c]` based on the following prioritized rules:
        i.   **Collision:** If both `L` and `R` are non-white (`L != 0` and `R != 0`), set the result to `0`.
        ii.  **Propagate Left Parent:** If `L` is non-white and `R` is white (`L != 0` and `R == 0`):
            *   If `L` is blue (1), set the result to `1`.
            *   If `L` is red (2):
                *   If `r <= 2`, set the result to `2`.
                *   If `r >= 3`, set the result to `1` if `dist == 1`, otherwise set the result to `2`.
        iii. **Propagate Right Parent:** If `L` is white and `R` is non-white (`L == 0` and `R != 0`):
            *   If `R` is blue (1), set the result to `0` (Blue annihilates propagating right).
            *   If `R` is red (2):
                *   If `r <= 2`, set the result to `2`.
                *   If `r >= 3`, set the result to `0` if `dist == 1`, otherwise set the result to `2`.
        iv.  **No Propagation:** If both `L` and `R` are white (`L == 0` and `R == 0`), set the result to `0`.
    d.  Assign the calculated result to `output_grid[r][c]`.
7.  After iterating through all rows and columns, return the completed output grid.
