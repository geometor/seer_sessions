Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Processes a 1D input grid containing a single red pixel (2).
Generates a 2D output grid where the width and height are equal to the input width (W).
The first row of the output is a copy of the input.
Subsequent rows (r > 0) are generated based on a cellular automaton rule applied to the previous row (r-1),
considering the diagonal predecessors (L = cell(r-1, c-1), R = cell(r-1, c+1)) and the
horizontal distance ('dist') of the current cell (r, c) from the column of the initial red pixel ('center_c').

Rule details:
1. Collision (L!=0 and R!=0): Output is white (0).
2. Propagate L (L!=0, R==0):
   - If L is blue(1): Output is blue(1).
   - If L is red(2): Output is blue(1) if dist=1, else red(2).
3. Propagate R (L==0, R!=0):
   - If R is blue(1): Output is blue(1).
   - If R is red(2): Output is white(0) if dist=1, else red(2).
4. No Propagation (L==0, R==0): Output is white (0).
