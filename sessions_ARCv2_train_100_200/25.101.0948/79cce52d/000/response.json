Specifically, the output grid has one fewer row and one fewer column than the input grid. Comparing the pixel values, it appears that the output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, obtained by removing the first row and the first column. The pixel colors themselves are not changed; the transformation is purely structural.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
