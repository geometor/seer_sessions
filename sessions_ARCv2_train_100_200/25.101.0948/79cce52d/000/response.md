*   **Perception:**
    The input and output are grids of colored pixels. In all training examples, the output grid is smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has one fewer row and one fewer column than the input grid. Comparing the pixel values, it appears that the output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, obtained by removing the first row and the first column. The pixel colors themselves are not changed; the transformation is purely structural.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    transformation: cropping
    input_grid:
      description: A 2D array of pixels with varying dimensions (observed 7x7 in examples).
      properties:
        - contains_multiple_colors
    output_grid:
      description: A 2D array of pixels derived from the input grid.
      properties:
        - height: input_height - 1
        - width: input_width - 1
        - content: subgrid of the input grid
    cropping_details:
      rows_removed:
        - index: 0 (top row)
      columns_removed:
        - index: 0 (leftmost column)
      remaining_subgrid: input_grid[1:, 1:]
    pixel_values:
      - unchanged during transformation
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input grid.
    2.  Create a new grid by selecting all rows from the input grid starting from the second row (index 1) to the last row.
    3.  From the result of step 2, create the final output grid by selecting all columns starting from the second column (index 1) to the last column.
