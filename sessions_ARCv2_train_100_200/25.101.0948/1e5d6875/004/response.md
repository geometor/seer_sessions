## General Assessment

The previous analysis successfully identified the core mechanism involving L-shapes (Gray 5 or Red 2) defined by a 3+1 pattern in a 2x2 square. The transformation adds new pixels (Yellow 4 or Green 3) based on the L-shape's color, the parity of its corner pixel (C), and the relative position of the missing pixel (MP).

The code based on the initial analysis worked perfectly for Example 1 but failed for Example 2. The discrepancies occurred in the pixels added for the Gray L-shapes. Specifically, the rules derived from Example 1 for handling Gray shapes (especially the distinction between MP "above" C vs "below" C and the role of C's parity) did not generalize correctly to Example 2.

The strategy is to refine the rules for Gray L-shapes based on a comparison between the expected output and the code's output for Example 2, while ensuring the rules remain consistent with Example 1. The rules for Red L-shapes appear correct as they produced the expected output in both examples.

## Metrics

We will re-examine the L-shapes and expected added pixels for both examples, focusing on the Gray shapes to derive the corrected rule.

**Example 1:**

*   Input L-Shapes:
    *   Red: C=(2,4), MP=(1,5), Parity=(even,even), rel_MP=(-1,1)
    *   Gray: C=(3,1), MP=(2,2), Parity=(odd,odd), rel_MP=(-1,1)
    *   Red: C=(7,5), MP=(6,4), Parity=(odd,odd), rel_MP=(-1,-1)
*   Expected Added Pixels:
    *   From Gray C=(3,1): Y@(1,2), Y@(2,2), G@(2,3), G@(3,3). (MP is above C, C is odd,odd -> 4 pixels: Y@MP+(-1,0), Y@MP, G@MP+(0,+1), G@MP+(+1,+1))
    *   From Red C=(2,4): G@(3,4). (Matches rule: C=even,even, relMP=(-1,+1) -> add G@C+(+1,0))
    *   From Red C=(7,5): G@(7,6). (Matches rule: C=odd,odd, relMP=(-1,-1) -> add G@C+(0,+1))

**Example 2:**

*   Input L-Shapes:
    *   Gray: C=(2,1), MP=(1,2), Parity=(even,odd), rel_MP=(-1,1)
    *   Gray: C=(1,6), MP=(2,5), Parity=(odd,even), rel_MP=(+1,-1)
    *   Red: C=(5,2), MP=(6,1), Parity=(odd,even), rel_MP=(+1,-1)
    *   Red: C=(6,5), MP=(5,6), Parity=(even,odd), rel_MP=(-1,1)
*   Expected Added Pixels:
    *   From Gray C=(2,1): Y@(0,2), Y@(1,2), Y@(1,3). (MP is above C, C is *not* odd,odd -> 3 pixels: Y@MP+(-1,0), Y@MP, Y@MP+(0,+1))
    *   From Gray C=(1,6): Y@(2,4), Y@(2,5), Y@(3,5). (MP is below C -> 3 pixels: Y@MP+(0,-1), Y@MP, Y@MP+(+1,0))
    *   From Red C=(5,2): G@(4,2), G@(4,3), G@(5,3). (Matches rule: C=odd,even, relMP=(+1,-1) -> add G L-shape corner C+(-1,+1))
    *   From Red C=(6,5): G@(6,4), G@(7,4), G@(7,5). (Matches rule: C=even,odd, relMP=(-1,+1) -> add G L-shape corner C+(+1,-1))

*   **Code Execution Verification (Mental Walkthrough based on revised Gray rules):**
    *   **Example 1 (Gray):** C=(3,1)(odd,odd), MP=(2,2)(above). Use 4-pixel rule -> Y@(1,2),Y@(2,2),G@(2,3),G@(3,3). **Correct.**
    *   **Example 2 (Gray 1):** C=(2,1)(even,odd), MP=(1,2)(above). Use 3-pixel rule -> Y@(0,2),Y@(1,2),Y@(1,3). **Correct.**
    *   **Example 2 (Gray 2):** C=(1,6)(odd,even), MP=(2,5)(below). Use 3-pixel rule -> Y@(2,4),Y@(2,5),Y@(3,5). **Correct.**

The revised rules for Gray L-shapes now correctly predict the output for both examples.

    output: output_grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. For each new pixel (coord, color), if the coordinate is within bounds and the current color at that coordinate in the copy is the background color (orange 7), update the color.

relationships:
  - Added pixels' locations and colors depend on the source L-shape's color, corner pixel parity, and relative position of the missing pixel.
  - Added pixels only replace the background color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize**: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify L-Shapes**: Scan the input grid for all 2x2 squares containing exactly three pixels of the same color (either gray 5 or red 2) and one background pixel (orange 7).
3.  For each such 2x2 square found:
    a.  Identify the color of the L-shape (gray or red).
    b.  Identify the coordinates of the corner pixel `C = (cr, cc)` (the shape pixel diagonally opposite the background pixel).
    c.  Determine the parity of `C` as `C_parity = (cr % 2, cc % 2)` (0=even, 1=odd).
    d.  Identify the coordinates of the missing background pixel `MP = (mr, mc)`.
    e.  Calculate the relative position of MP to C: `relative_MP = (mr-cr, mc-cc)`.
    f.  Store these properties (color, C, MP, C_parity, relative_MP).
4.  **Process L-Shapes**: Iterate through the identified L-shapes.
5.  **If the L-shape is Gray (5)**:
    a.  Check if MP is above C (`relative_MP[0] == -1`):
        i.  If `C_parity` is (odd, odd) (1, 1):
            - Add Yellow (4) to the output grid at `MP+(-1,0)` and `MP`.
            - Add Green (3) to the output grid at `MP+(0,+1)` and `MP+(+1,+1)`.
            (Add pixels only if the target cell is within bounds and background).
        ii. Else (`C_parity` is not (odd, odd)):
            - Add Yellow (4) to the output grid at `MP+(-1,0)`, `MP`, and `MP+(0,+1)`.
            (Add pixels only if the target cell is within bounds and background).
    b.  Check if MP is below C (`relative_MP[0] == 1`):
        i.  Add Yellow (4) to the output grid at `MP+(0,-1)`, `MP`, and `MP+(+1,0)`.
        (Add pixels only if the target cell is within bounds and background).
6.  **If the L-shape is Red (2)**:
    a.  Check `C_parity` and `relative_MP`:
        i.  If `C_parity` is (1, 1) AND `relative_MP` is `(-1,-1)`: Add Green (3) at `C+(0,+1)`.
        ii. If `C_parity` is (0, 0) AND `relative_MP` is `(-1,+1)`: Add Green (3) at `C+(+1,0)`.
        iii. If `C_parity` is (1, 0) AND `relative_MP` is `(+1,-1)`: Add Green (3) at `C+(-1,0)`, `C+(-1,+1)`, and `C+(0,+1)`.
        iv. If `C_parity` is (0, 1) AND `relative_MP` is `(-1,+1)`: Add Green (3) at `C+(0,-1)`, `C+(+1,-1)`, and `C+(+1,0)`.
        v.  For any other combination, do nothing.
        (Add pixels only if the target cell is within bounds and background).
7.  **Return Output**: Return the modified grid.
