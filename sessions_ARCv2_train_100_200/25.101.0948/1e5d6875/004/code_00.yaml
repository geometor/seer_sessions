objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: 7 (orange)
  - type: shape
    identifier: L-shape
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray) or 2 (red)
      size: 3 pixels
      definition: Found within a 2x2 square containing 3 pixels of the shape color and 1 background pixel.
      corner_pixel (C): The pixel of the L-shape diagonally opposite the background pixel (MP) in the 2x2 square. Has coordinates (cr, cc).
      missing_pixel (MP): The background pixel in the 2x2 square. Has coordinates (mr, mc).
      relative_MP: The coordinates of MP relative to C, i.e., (mr-cr, mc-cc). Can be (-1,-1), (-1,+1), (+1,-1), or (+1,+1). Indicates if MP is "above" (mr < cr) or "below" (mr > cr) C.
      C_parity: The parity (even/odd) of the corner pixel coordinates (cr, cc), represented as (0=even, 1=odd).

actions:
  - name: identify_L_shapes
    input: input_grid
    output: list of L-shapes with properties (color, C, MP, relative_MP, C_parity)
  - name: process_gray_L_shape
    input: gray_L_shape (with properties C, MP, relative_MP, C_parity)
    output: set of new pixels (coordinates and colors: Yellow 4, Green 3)
    details:
      - If MP is "above" C (relative_MP[0] == -1):
          - If C_parity is (odd, odd) (1, 1):
              - Add pixels: Y(4)@MP+(-1,0), Y(4)@MP, G(3)@MP+(0,+1), G(3)@MP+(+1,+1). (4 pixels)
          - Else (C_parity is not (odd, odd)):
              - Add pixels: Y(4)@MP+(-1,0), Y(4)@MP, Y(4)@MP+(0,+1). (3 pixels)
      - If MP is "below" C (relative_MP[0] == 1):
          - Add pixels: Y(4)@MP+(0,-1), Y(4)@MP, Y(4)@MP+(+1,0). (3 pixels)
  - name: process_red_L_shape
    input: red_L_shape (with properties C, MP, relative_MP, C_parity)
    output: set of new pixels (coordinates and color: Green 3)
    details:
      - Based on C_parity and relative_MP:
        - If C_parity=(1, 1) and relative_MP=(-1,-1): Add G(3) @ C+(0,+1).
        - If C_parity=(0, 0) and relative_MP=(-1,+1): Add G(3) @ C+(+1,0).
        - If C_parity=(1, 0) and relative_MP=(+1,-1): Add G(3) L-shape opening Bottom-Left, corner C+(-1,+1). Pixels: C+(-1,0), C+(-1,+1), C+(0,+1).
        - If C_parity=(0, 1) and relative_MP=(-1,+1): Add G(3) L-shape opening Top-Right, corner C+(+1,-1). Pixels: C+(0,-1), C+(+1,-1), C+(+1,0).
        - Other combinations: No action defined based on examples.
  - name: apply_changes
    input: input_grid, list of new pixels to add
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. For each new pixel (coord, color), if the coordinate is within bounds and the current color at that coordinate in the copy is the background color (orange 7), update the color.

relationships:
  - Added pixels' locations and colors depend on the source L-shape's color, corner pixel parity, and relative position of the missing pixel.
  - Added pixels only replace the background color.
