objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: 7 (orange)
  - type: shape
    identifier: L-shape
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray) or 2 (red)
      size: 3 pixels
      connectivity: L-configuration (one pixel connected to two others in the shape)
      corner_pixel: The pixel within the L-shape connected to the other two pixels.
      orientation: Defined by the relative positions of the 3 pixels (e.g., opens Top-Right, Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Left).
      missing_pixel (MP): The unique background pixel adjacent to two pixels of the L-shape, which would complete a 2x2 square containing the L-shape.
actions:
  - name: identify_L_shapes
    input: input_grid
    output: list of L-shapes with properties (color, pixels, corner_pixel, orientation, missing_pixel)
  - name: process_gray_L_shape
    input: gray_L_shape (with properties)
    output: set of new pixels (coordinates and colors: Yellow 4, Green 3)
    condition: Based on L-shape orientation.
    details:
      - Fill the Missing Pixel (MP) with Yellow (4).
      - Add 3 more pixels (Yellow or Green) at specific relative positions to MP, determined by the L-shape's orientation.
        - Orientation "opens Top-Right": Add Y at MP+(-1,0), G at MP+(0,+1), G at MP+(+1,+1).
        - Orientation "opens Bottom-Right": Add Y at MP+(-1,-1), Y at MP+(0,-1), Y at MP+(+1,0).
  - name: process_red_L_shape
    input: red_L_shape (with properties)
    output: set of new pixels (coordinates and color: Green 3)
    condition: Based on the parity of the corner_pixel's coordinates (r, c).
    details:
      - If corner (r, c) is (even, even): Add nothing.
      - If corner (r, c) is (odd, odd): Add Green (3) at MP+(+1,+1).
      - If corner (r, c) is (even, odd): Add a Green (3) L-shape (3 pixels) opening Top-Right, with its corner at C+(+1,-1).
      - If corner (r, c) is (odd, even): Add a Green (3) L-shape (3 pixels) opening Bottom-Left, with its corner at C+(-1,+1).
  - name: apply_changes
    input: input_grid, list of new pixels to add
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a copy of the input grid. For each new pixel (coord, color), if the coordinate is within bounds and the current color at that coordinate in the copy is the background color (orange 7), update the color.
relationships:
  - The added pixels' locations and colors depend on the source L-shape's color, orientation, and corner pixel coordinates.
  - Added pixels only replace the background color.
