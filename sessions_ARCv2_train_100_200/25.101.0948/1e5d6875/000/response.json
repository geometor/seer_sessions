The task involves identifying specific shapes, 3-pixel L-shapes, composed of either gray (5) or red (2) pixels. Based on the color and properties (orientation, location) of these L-shapes, new pixels (yellow 4 and/or green 3) are added to the grid in specific patterns relative to the original L-shapes. The original L-shapes remain unchanged. The rules for adding pixels differ significantly depending on whether the L-shape is gray or red.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each L-shape, record its color, the coordinates of its three pixels, the coordinate of its corner pixel (C), its orientation (e.g., opens Top-Right, Bottom-Right, etc.), and the coordinate of the background pixel (MP) that would complete its 2x2 bounding box.\n3.  **Process Gray L-Shapes**: For each identified gray L-shape:\n    a.  Determine its orientation and its Missing Pixel (MP).\n    b.  Add Yellow (4) to the output grid at coordinate MP, if MP is currently background (orange 7).\n    c.  Based on orientation, determine the coordinates for 3 additional pixels relative to MP:\n        i.  If orientation is \"opens Top-Right\": Target coordinates are MP+(-1,0) [Y], MP+(0,+1) [G], MP+(+1,+1) [G].\n        ii. If orientation is \"opens Bottom-Right\": Target coordinates are MP+(-1,-1) [Y], MP+(0,-1) [Y], MP+(+1,0) [Y].\n        iii. (Define rules for other orientations if needed).\n    d.  For each target coordinate and its associated color (Y or G) from step 3c, add the color to the output grid at that coordinate, provided it's within bounds and currently background (orange 7).\n4.  **Process Red L-Shapes**: For each identified red L-shape:\n    a.  Identify its corner pixel C=(r,c) and its Missing Pixel MP.\n    b.  Check the parity of the corner pixel's coordinates (r, c).\n    c.  Determine the target coordinates and color (Green 3) based on parity:\n        i.  If r=even, c=even: No pixels are added.\n        ii. If r=odd, c=odd: Target coordinate is MP+(+1,+1). Add Green (3).\n        iii. If r=even, c=odd: Target coordinates form a Green (3) L-shape opening Top-Right, with its corner at C+(+1,-1). The three pixels are C+(0,-1), C+(+1,-1), C+(+1,0). Add Green (3) to each.\n        iv. If r=odd, c=even: Target coordinates form a Green (3) L-shape opening Bottom-Left, with its corner at C+(-1,+1). The three pixels are C+(-1,0), C+(-1,+1), C+(0,+1). Add Green (3) to each.\n    d.  For each target coordinate determined in step 4c, add Green (3) to the output grid at that coordinate, provided it's within bounds and currently background (orange 7).\n5.  **Return Output**: The modified grid is the final output."
