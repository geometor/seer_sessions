Natural Language Program Description:
1.  Identify the two main, non-overlapping, non-white objects in the input grid. Determine their minimal bounding boxes. Label the left object 'A' and the right object 'B'.
2.  Extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid from A's bounding box (call this `A_sub`).
3.  Extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid from B's bounding box (call this `B_sub`).
4.  Check if the second row (index 1) of `A_sub` contains any white (0) pixels. Store this boolean result as `A_row1_has_zero`.
5.  Check if the second row (index 1) of `B_sub` contains any white (0) pixels. Store this boolean result as `B_row1_has_zero`.
6.  Take the first row (index 0) of `A_sub` as the initial candidate for the output's first row (`candidate_row_0`).
7.  Take the first row (index 0) of `B_sub` as the initial candidate for the output's second row (`candidate_row_1`).
8.  Define a modification function `modify(row)`: takes a 3-element row, finds the index `k` (0, 1, or 2) of the rightmost non-white pixel. If such a pixel exists, sets `row[k]` to 0. Returns the (potentially modified) row.
9.  If `B_row1_has_zero` is true, apply the `modify` function to `candidate_row_0` to get the final `output_row_0`. Otherwise, `output_row_0` is `candidate_row_0` unmodified.
10. If `A_row1_has_zero` is true, apply the `modify` function to `candidate_row_1` to get the final `output_row_1`. Otherwise, `output_row_1` is `candidate_row_1` unmodified.
11. Check the fourth row (index 3) of the original bounding box of B. Take its first 3 elements. If this 3-element row contains any non-white pixels, set `output_row_2` to this row.
12. Otherwise (if the first 3 elements of B's fourth row are all white), set `output_row_2` to `[0, 0, 0]`.
13. Construct the final 3x3 output grid using `output_row_0`, `output_row_1`, and `output_row_2`.
