**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into a smaller 3x3 output grid. The input grid consistently features two distinct, non-overlapping colored objects (referred to as Object A on the left and Object B on the right), separated by at least one column of white pixels (color 0). These objects are typically 4 rows high and have varying widths and shapes (often C-like). The colors of Object A and Object B change between examples.

The 3x3 output grid seems to be a condensed representation or summary derived from the input objects. Specifically, the output appears to be constructed using information primarily from the top-left 3x3 region of each object's bounding box. The first row of the output seems related to Object A, the second row to Object B, and the third row is often white padding but sometimes derived from Object B's lower part.

A key transformation element appears to be a modification rule: sometimes, the rightmost non-white pixel within a selected 3-pixel row segment is changed to white (0). The application of this modification, as well as the specific rows chosen from the input objects, seems conditionally dependent on the presence of white pixels within certain rows of the objects' top-left 3x3 subgrids.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: A # Left object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels on the left half of the input grid.
    properties:
      color: C_A (variable)
      location: Left side, separated from B by white pixels.
      size: Bounding box height is typically 4.
      subgrid: Top-left 3x3 region of bounding box (A_sub) is relevant.
      pattern_trigger: Presence of white pixels in A_sub's second row (index 1) influences transformation.
  - id: B # Right object
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels on the right half of the input grid.
    properties:
      color: C_B (variable)
      location: Right side.
      size: Bounding box height is typically 4.
      subgrid: Top-left 3x3 region of bounding box (B_sub) is relevant.
      pattern_trigger: Presence of white pixels in B_sub's second row (index 1) influences transformation.
      bottom_row_content: Content of the 4th row (index 3) of B's bounding box influences the output's 3rd row.
output_grid:
  description: A 3x3 grid summarizing parts of A and B.
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    content: Pixels are either white(0), color C_A, or color C_B.
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: [A, B]
    target: output_grid
    details: Output rows are derived from specific rows of A_sub and B_sub, potentially modified based on cross-object pattern triggers. The 3rd output row can depend on B's 4th row or be padding.

    description: Determine if A_sub[1] has zeros, if B_sub[1] has zeros, and if the first 3 cells of bbox_B[3] are non-zero.

      Determine output row 2 based on B_row3_is_nonzero (using bbox_B[3] or [0,0,0]).
      Modification involves setting the rightmost non-zero pixel (within the first 3) to zero.

**Natural Language Program**


```
1.  Identify the two main, non-overlapping, non-white objects in the input grid. Determine their minimal bounding boxes. Label the left object 'A' and the right object 'B'.
2.  Extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid from A's bounding box (call this `A_sub`).
3.  Extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid from B's bounding box (call this `B_sub`).
4.  Check if the second row (index 1) of `A_sub` contains any white (0) pixels. Store this boolean result as `A_row1_has_zero`.
5.  Check if the second row (index 1) of `B_sub` contains any white (0) pixels. Store this boolean result as `B_row1_has_zero`.
6.  Take the first row (index 0) of `A_sub` as the initial candidate for the output's first row (`candidate_row_0`).
7.  Take the first row (index 0) of `B_sub` as the initial candidate for the output's second row (`candidate_row_1`).
8.  Define a modification function `modify(row)`: takes a 3-element row, finds the index `k` (0, 1, or 2) of the rightmost non-white pixel. If such a pixel exists, sets `row[k]` to 0. Returns the (potentially modified) row.
9.  If `B_row1_has_zero` is true, apply the `modify` function to `candidate_row_0` to get the final `output_row_0`. Otherwise, `output_row_0` is `candidate_row_0` unmodified.
10. If `A_row1_has_zero` is true, apply the `modify` function to `candidate_row_1` to get the final `output_row_1`. Otherwise, `output_row_1` is `candidate_row_1` unmodified.
11. Check the fourth row (index 3) of the original bounding box of B. Take its first 3 elements. If this 3-element row contains any non-white pixels, set `output_row_2` to this row.
12. Otherwise (if the first 3 elements of B's fourth row are all white), set `output_row_2` to `[0, 0, 0]`.
13. Construct the final 3x3 output grid using `output_row_0`, `output_row_1`, and `output_row_2`.
