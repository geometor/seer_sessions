            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into a smaller 3x3 output grid. The input grid consistently features two distinct, non-overlapping colored objects (referred to as Object A on the left and Object B on the right), separated by at least one column of white pixels (color 0). These objects are typically 4 rows high and have varying widths and shapes (often C-like). The colors of Object A and Object B change between examples.\n\nThe 3x3 output grid seems to be a condensed representation or summary derived from the input objects. Specifically, the output appears to be constructed using information primarily from the top-left 3x3 region of each object's bounding box. The first row of the output seems related to Object A, the second row to Object B, and the third row is often white padding but sometimes derived from Object B's lower part.\n\nA key transformation element appears to be a modification rule: sometimes, the rightmost non-white pixel within a selected 3-pixel row segment is changed to white (0). The application of this modification, as well as the specific rows chosen from the input objects, seems conditionally dependent on the presence of white pixels within certain rows of the objects' top-left 3x3 subgrids.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
