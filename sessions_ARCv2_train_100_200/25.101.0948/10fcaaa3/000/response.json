            "text": "## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are always exactly double the input grid dimensions (2H x 2W).\n2.  **Tiling:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical or near-identical copies of a \"transformed tile\", arranged in a 2x2 pattern. This transformed tile has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n3.  **Pixel Preservation:** Non-white pixels (colors 1-9) from the input grid are preserved in the output grid. Specifically, if the input has a non-white pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`, the output grid has the same non-white pixel at all four corresponding locations: `(r_in, c_in)`, `(r_in, c_in + W)`, `(r_in + H, c_in)`, and `(r_in + H, c_in + W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.\n4.  **Background Transformation:** White pixels (color 0) in the input grid are transformed into either white (0) or azure (8) pixels in the output grid.\n5.  **Background Pattern:** The pattern of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the background regions of the output grid strongly resembles a checkerboard pattern.\n6.  **Checkerboard Origin:** The checkerboard seems to consistently use azure (8) for the top-left background cell `(0,0)` if the input `I[0][0]` is white, and alternates white(0)/azure(8) based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates `(r+c)`.\n7.  **Rule Consistency:** The rule seems to be:\n    *   Create a base tile (T) the same size as the input (I).\n    *   Copy non-white pixels from I to T.\n    *   For white pixels in I at `(r,c)`, set T[r,c] to azure (8) if `(r+c)` is even, and white (0) if `(r+c)` is odd.\n    *   Construct the output grid by tiling the base tile T in a 2x2 arrangement.\n    *   This rule perfectly explains examples 3 and 4. Examples 1 and 2 match this rule *almost* perfectly, with a few background pixels in the provided example outputs seemingly having their checkerboard color flipped compared to the rule. Given the consistency across examples 3 & 4 and the near-match in 1 & 2, this rule seems the most robust interpretation. The discrepancies in examples 1 & 2 might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a subtle secondary rule not immediately apparent. However, based on the principle of finding the simplest consistent explanation, the checkerboard tile replication is the most likely intended transformation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
