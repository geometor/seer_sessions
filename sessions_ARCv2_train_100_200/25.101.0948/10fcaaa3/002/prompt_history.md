## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are always exactly double the input grid dimensions (2H x 2W).
2.  **Tiling:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical or near-identical copies of a "transformed tile", arranged in a 2x2 pattern. This transformed tile has the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Pixel Preservation:** Non-white pixels (colors 1-9) from the input grid are preserved in the output grid. Specifically, if the input has a non-white pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`, the output grid has the same non-white pixel at all four corresponding locations: `(r_in, c_in)`, `(r_in, c_in + W)`, `(r_in + H, c_in)`, and `(r_in + H, c_in + W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
4.  **Background Transformation:** White pixels (color 0) in the input grid are transformed into either white (0) or azure (8) pixels in the output grid.
5.  **Background Pattern:** The pattern of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the background regions of the output grid strongly resembles a checkerboard pattern.
6.  **Checkerboard Origin:** The checkerboard seems to consistently use azure (8) for the top-left background cell `(0,0)` if the input `I[0][0]` is white, and alternates white(0)/azure(8) based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates `(r+c)`.
7.  **Rule Consistency:** The rule seems to be:
    *   Create a base tile (T) the same size as the input (I).
    *   Copy non-white pixels from I to T.
    *   For white pixels in I at `(r,c)`, set T[r,c] to azure (8) if `(r+c)` is even, and white (0) if `(r+c)` is odd.
    *   Construct the output grid by tiling the base tile T in a 2x2 arrangement.
    *   This rule perfectly explains examples 3 and 4. Examples 1 and 2 match this rule *almost* perfectly, with a few background pixels in the provided example outputs seemingly having their checkerboard color flipped compared to the rule. Given the consistency across examples 3 & 4 and the near-match in 1 & 2, this rule seems the most robust interpretation. The discrepancies in examples 1 & 2 might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a subtle secondary rule not immediately apparent. However, based on the principle of finding the simplest consistent explanation, the checkerboard tile replication is the most likely intended transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new "base tile" grid (T) with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (I) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value `v = I[r][c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not white (i.e., `v != 0`), set the corresponding cell in the base tile `T[r][c] = v`.
    c.  If `v` is white (i.e., `v == 0`):
        i.  Calculate the sum of the coordinates: `s = r + c`.
        ii. If `s` is even (`s % 2 == 0`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to azure (8).
        iii. If `s` is odd (`s % 2 == 1`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to white (0).
5.  Create the output grid (O) with dimensions `2H x 2W`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid (O) from `r=0` to `2H-1` and `c=0` to `2W-1`.
7.  Set the value of the output cell `O[r][c]` by copying the value from the corresponding cell in the base tile: `O[r][c] = T[r % H][c % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid O.
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms an input grid by first creating a 'base tile' of the same dimensions. 
Non-white pixels from the input are copied directly to the base tile. 
White pixels in the input are replaced in the base tile by either azure (8) or white (0) 
based on a checkerboard pattern determined by the parity of the sum of their coordinates (r+c). 
Specifically, if (r+c) is even, the pixel becomes azure (8); if odd, it becomes white (0). 
Finally, the output grid is constructed by tiling this base tile in a 2x2 arrangement, 
resulting in an output grid with dimensions twice those of the input (2H x 2W).
