            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the 2x2 tiling structure and the preservation of non-white pixels. The hypothesis that the background (white input pixels) is filled with a simple checkerboard pattern (azure '8' if `r+c` is even, white '0' if odd) within the base tile, which is then tiled, proved incorrect across all examples. The generated outputs consistently mismatch the expected outputs, particularly in the background regions near the original non-white pixels.\n\nThe discrepancies are not random; they suggest a modification to the simple checkerboard rule based on the context of the non-white pixels. However, several attempts to define this modification based on orthogonal/diagonal adjacency or distance did not yield a rule consistent with all examples.\n\nExample 2 shows the most significant deviation from the simple checkerboard, with multiple background pixels having the opposite color than predicted by parity. Examples 1, 3, and 4 show fewer deviations, mostly involving pixels where the checkerboard predicts azure '8' but the output shows white '0'.\n\nStrategy:\n1.  **Acknowledge Discrepancy:** State clearly that the simple checkerboard rule, while capturing some structure, does not fully explain the provided examples.\n2.  **Refine Rule (Best Effort):** The most promising pattern, especially from Examples 3 & 4, is that the simple checkerboard is applied, but some azure '8' pixels (where r+c is even) are turned into white '0'. The exact condition for this change remains elusive but seems related to being \"away\" from non-white pixels. The opposite change (0->8) also occurs (Ex1, Ex2), making a single rule difficult.\n3.  **Propose Simplest Consistent Rule:** Despite the errors, the \"checkerboard base tile + 2x2 tiling\" is the most identifiable, albeit flawed, underlying pattern. The NL program will describe this, and the facts will note the observed discrepancies as potential complexities or noise. We will proceed with the simple checkerboard rule as the primary hypothesis, lacking a clear alternative that fits all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nUsing `tool_code` to analyze dimensions and differences.\n\n"
