## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the 2x2 tiling structure and the preservation of non-white pixels. The hypothesis that the background (white input pixels) is filled with a simple checkerboard pattern (azure '8' if `r+c` is even, white '0' if odd) within the base tile, which is then tiled, proved incorrect across all examples. The generated outputs consistently mismatch the expected outputs, particularly in the background regions near the original non-white pixels.

The discrepancies are not random; they suggest a modification to the simple checkerboard rule based on the context of the non-white pixels. However, several attempts to define this modification based on orthogonal/diagonal adjacency or distance did not yield a rule consistent with all examples.

Example 2 shows the most significant deviation from the simple checkerboard, with multiple background pixels having the opposite color than predicted by parity. Examples 1, 3, and 4 show fewer deviations, mostly involving pixels where the checkerboard predicts azure '8' but the output shows white '0'.

Strategy:
1.  **Acknowledge Discrepancy:** State clearly that the simple checkerboard rule, while capturing some structure, does not fully explain the provided examples.
2.  **Refine Rule (Best Effort):** The most promising pattern, especially from Examples 3 & 4, is that the simple checkerboard is applied, but some azure '8' pixels (where r+c is even) are turned into white '0'. The exact condition for this change remains elusive but seems related to being "away" from non-white pixels. The opposite change (0->8) also occurs (Ex1, Ex2), making a single rule difficult.
3.  **Propose Simplest Consistent Rule:** Despite the errors, the "checkerboard base tile + 2x2 tiling" is the most identifiable, albeit flawed, underlying pattern. The NL program will describe this, and the facts will note the observed discrepancies as potential complexities or noise. We will proceed with the simple checkerboard rule as the primary hypothesis, lacking a clear alternative that fits all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid (I).
2.  Create a new "base tile" grid (T) with dimensions H x W.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (I) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value `v = I[r][c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not white (`v != 0`), set the corresponding cell in the base tile `T[r][c] = v`.
    c.  If `v` is white (`v == 0`):
        i.  Calculate the coordinate sum parity: `is_even = (r + c) % 2 == 0`.
        ii. Set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to azure (8) if `is_even` is true, otherwise set it to white (0).
        *(Note: This step implements the simple checkerboard hypothesis. Be aware that this step does not fully match the provided examples, which show deviations from this simple rule, especially near non-white pixels. The exact modification rule is undetermined.)*
5.  Create the final output grid (O) with dimensions `2H x 2W`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r_out, c_out)` of the output grid (O) from `r_out=0` to `2H-1` and `c_out=0` to `2W-1`.
7.  Set the value of the output cell `O[r_out][c_out]` by copying the value from the corresponding cell in the base tile using modulo arithmetic: `O[r_out][c_out] = T[r_out % H][c_out % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid O.
