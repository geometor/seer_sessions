## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are always exactly double the input grid dimensions (2H x 2W).
2.  **Tiling:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical or near-identical copies of a "transformed tile", arranged in a 2x2 pattern. This transformed tile has the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Pixel Preservation:** Non-white pixels (colors 1-9) from the input grid are preserved in the output grid. Specifically, if the input has a non-white pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`, the output grid has the same non-white pixel at all four corresponding locations: `(r_in, c_in)`, `(r_in, c_in + W)`, `(r_in + H, c_in)`, and `(r_in + H, c_in + W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
4.  **Background Transformation:** White pixels (color 0) in the input grid are transformed into either white (0) or azure (8) pixels in the output grid.
5.  **Background Pattern:** The pattern of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the background regions of the output grid strongly resembles a checkerboard pattern.
6.  **Checkerboard Origin:** The checkerboard seems to consistently use azure (8) for the top-left background cell `(0,0)` if the input `I[0][0]` is white, and alternates white(0)/azure(8) based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates `(r+c)`.
7.  **Rule Consistency:** The rule seems to be:
    *   Create a base tile (T) the same size as the input (I).
    *   Copy non-white pixels from I to T.
    *   For white pixels in I at `(r,c)`, set T[r,c] to azure (8) if `(r+c)` is even, and white (0) if `(r+c)` is odd.
    *   Construct the output grid by tiling the base tile T in a 2x2 arrangement.
    *   This rule perfectly explains examples 3 and 4. Examples 1 and 2 match this rule *almost* perfectly, with a few background pixels in the provided example outputs seemingly having their checkerboard color flipped compared to the rule. Given the consistency across examples 3 & 4 and the near-match in 1 & 2, this rule seems the most robust interpretation. The discrepancies in examples 1 & 2 might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a subtle secondary rule not immediately apparent. However, based on the principle of finding the simplest consistent explanation, the checkerboard tile replication is the most likely intended transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new "base tile" grid (T) with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (I) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value `v = I[r][c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not white (i.e., `v != 0`), set the corresponding cell in the base tile `T[r][c] = v`.
    c.  If `v` is white (i.e., `v == 0`):
        i.  Calculate the sum of the coordinates: `s = r + c`.
        ii. If `s` is even (`s % 2 == 0`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to azure (8).
        iii. If `s` is odd (`s % 2 == 1`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to white (0).
5.  Create the output grid (O) with dimensions `2H x 2W`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid (O) from `r=0` to `2H-1` and `c=0` to `2W-1`.
7.  Set the value of the output cell `O[r][c]` by copying the value from the corresponding cell in the base tile: `O[r][c] = T[r % H][c % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid O.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the 2x2 tiling structure and the preservation of non-white pixels. The hypothesis that the background (white input pixels) is filled with a simple checkerboard pattern (azure '8' if `r+c` is even, white '0' if odd) within the base tile, which is then tiled, proved incorrect across all examples. The generated outputs consistently mismatch the expected outputs, particularly in the background regions near the original non-white pixels.

The discrepancies are not random; they suggest a modification to the simple checkerboard rule based on the context of the non-white pixels. However, several attempts to define this modification based on orthogonal/diagonal adjacency or distance did not yield a rule consistent with all examples.

Example 2 shows the most significant deviation from the simple checkerboard, with multiple background pixels having the opposite color than predicted by parity. Examples 1, 3, and 4 show fewer deviations, mostly involving pixels where the checkerboard predicts azure '8' but the output shows white '0'.

Strategy:
1.  **Acknowledge Discrepancy:** State clearly that the simple checkerboard rule, while capturing some structure, does not fully explain the provided examples.
2.  **Refine Rule (Best Effort):** The most promising pattern, especially from Examples 3 & 4, is that the simple checkerboard is applied, but some azure '8' pixels (where r+c is even) are turned into white '0'. The exact condition for this change remains elusive but seems related to being "away" from non-white pixels. The opposite change (0->8) also occurs (Ex1, Ex2), making a single rule difficult.
3.  **Propose Simplest Consistent Rule:** Despite the errors, the "checkerboard base tile + 2x2 tiling" is the most identifiable, albeit flawed, underlying pattern. The NL program will describe this, and the facts will note the observed discrepancies as potential complexities or noise. We will proceed with the simple checkerboard rule as the primary hypothesis, lacking a clear alternative that fits all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid (I).
2.  Create a new "base tile" grid (T) with dimensions H x W.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (I) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value `v = I[r][c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not white (`v != 0`), set the corresponding cell in the base tile `T[r][c] = v`.
    c.  If `v` is white (`v == 0`):
        i.  Calculate the coordinate sum parity: `is_even = (r + c) % 2 == 0`.
        ii. Set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to azure (8) if `is_even` is true, otherwise set it to white (0).
        *(Note: This step implements the simple checkerboard hypothesis. Be aware that this step does not fully match the provided examples, which show deviations from this simple rule, especially near non-white pixels. The exact modification rule is undetermined.)*
5.  Create the final output grid (O) with dimensions `2H x 2W`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r_out, c_out)` of the output grid (O) from `r_out=0` to `2H-1` and `c_out=0` to `2W-1`.
7.  Set the value of the output cell `O[r_out][c_out]` by copying the value from the corresponding cell in the base tile using modulo arithmetic: `O[r_out][c_out] = T[r_out % H][c_out % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid O.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid by first creating a 'base tile' of the same dimensions (H x W). 
Non-white pixels from the input grid (I) are copied directly to their corresponding positions in the base tile (T). 
White pixels (0) in the input grid are replaced in the base tile by either azure (8) or white (0) 
based on a simple checkerboard pattern determined by the parity of the sum of their coordinates (r+c). 
If (r+c) is even, the base tile pixel T[r][c] becomes azure (8); if odd, it becomes white (0). 
*Note: This simple checkerboard rule for background pixels does not perfectly match all provided training examples, suggesting a more complex underlying rule potentially influenced by nearby non-white pixels. However, it represents the most consistent pattern observed.*
Finally, the output grid (O) is constructed by tiling this base tile (T) in a 2x2 arrangement, 
resulting in an output grid with dimensions twice those of the input (2H x 2W).
