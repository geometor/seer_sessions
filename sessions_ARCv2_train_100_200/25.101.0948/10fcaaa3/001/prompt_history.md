## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are always exactly double the input grid dimensions (2H x 2W).
2.  **Tiling:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical or near-identical copies of a "transformed tile", arranged in a 2x2 pattern. This transformed tile has the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Pixel Preservation:** Non-white pixels (colors 1-9) from the input grid are preserved in the output grid. Specifically, if the input has a non-white pixel at `(r_in, c_in)`, the output grid has the same non-white pixel at all four corresponding locations: `(r_in, c_in)`, `(r_in, c_in + W)`, `(r_in + H, c_in)`, and `(r_in + H, c_in + W)`, where H and W are the height and width of the input grid.
4.  **Background Transformation:** White pixels (color 0) in the input grid are transformed into either white (0) or azure (8) pixels in the output grid.
5.  **Background Pattern:** The pattern of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the background regions of the output grid strongly resembles a checkerboard pattern.
6.  **Checkerboard Origin:** The checkerboard seems to consistently use azure (8) for the top-left background cell `(0,0)` if the input `I[0][0]` is white, and alternates white(0)/azure(8) based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates `(r+c)`.
7.  **Rule Consistency:** The rule seems to be:
    *   Create a base tile (T) the same size as the input (I).
    *   Copy non-white pixels from I to T.
    *   For white pixels in I at `(r,c)`, set T[r,c] to azure (8) if `(r+c)` is even, and white (0) if `(r+c)` is odd.
    *   Construct the output grid by tiling the base tile T in a 2x2 arrangement.
    *   This rule perfectly explains examples 3 and 4. Examples 1 and 2 match this rule *almost* perfectly, with a few background pixels in the provided example outputs seemingly having their checkerboard color flipped compared to the rule. Given the consistency across examples 3 & 4 and the near-match in 1 & 2, this rule seems the most robust interpretation. The discrepancies in examples 1 & 2 might be errors in the provided examples or indicate a subtle secondary rule not immediately apparent. However, based on the principle of finding the simplest consistent explanation, the checkerboard tile replication is the most likely intended transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new "base tile" grid (T) with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (I) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the value `v = I[r][c]`.
    b.  If `v` is not white (i.e., `v != 0`), set the corresponding cell in the base tile `T[r][c] = v`.
    c.  If `v` is white (i.e., `v == 0`):
        i.  Calculate the sum of the coordinates: `s = r + c`.
        ii. If `s` is even (`s % 2 == 0`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to azure (8).
        iii. If `s` is odd (`s % 2 == 1`), set the base tile cell `T[r][c]` to white (0).
5.  Create the output grid (O) with dimensions `2H x 2W`.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid (O) from `r=0` to `2H-1` and `c=0` to `2W-1`.
7.  Set the value of the output cell `O[r][c]` by copying the value from the corresponding cell in the base tile: `O[r][c] = T[r % H][c % W]`.
8.  Return the output grid O.
