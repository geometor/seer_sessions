task_elements:
  - description: Input grid has a uniform background color with one unique pixel.
    properties:
      background_color: orange (7) - based on examples
      grid_size: Variable (8x8 in examples)
      unique_pixel:
        exists: true
        count: 1
        properties:
          location: (r0, c0)
          color: v0 (different from background)

  - description: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      grid_size: Same as input
      content: Filled with a complex pattern of colors (0-9).

relationships:
  - description: The output grid pattern is determined by the location and color of the unique input pixel.
    input_elements:
      - unique_pixel location (r0, c0)
      - unique_pixel color (v0)
    output_elements:
      - Entire output grid pattern

transformations:
  - description: The value of the output pixel at the location of the unique input pixel is equal to the unique input pixel's color.
    rule: Output[r0][c0] = v0

  - description: The value of every other output pixel is calculated based on its coordinates (r, c), the unique pixel's coordinates (r0, c0), and the unique pixel's color (v0).
    rule: Output[r][c] = Function(r, c, r0, c0, v0) % 10
    notes: The exact nature of the function is complex and not fully determined by the provided examples. It likely involves the relative coordinates (r-r0, c-c0) or Manhattan distance, combined with v0, using modulo 10 arithmetic. Simple common formulas did not fully match the examples.
