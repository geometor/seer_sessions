            "text": "## Perception\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grid consists of a uniform background color (orange, value 7) with a single pixel of a different color at a specific location. Let's call the coordinates of this unique pixel `(r0, c0)` and its color `v0`.\n\nThe output grid is filled with a complex pattern of colors (values 0-9). The transformation seems to depend critically on the location `(r0, c0)` and the color `v0` of the unique input pixel.\n\nObserving the two examples:\n1.  **Example 1:** Input has green (3) at (0, 6). Output is a complex grid.\n2.  **Example 2:** Input has gray (5) at (5, 2). Output is a different complex grid.\n\nKey observations:\n*   The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions (8x8 in both examples).\n*   The color of the output pixel at the location of the unique input pixel `(r0, c0)` is always equal to the unique input color `v0`. That is, `Output[r0][c0] = v0`.\n*   The overall pattern in the output grid changes based on the position and color of the unique input pixel.\n*   The output color `Output[r][c]` for any pixel `(r, c)` appears to be a deterministic function of its coordinates `(r, c)`, the unique pixel's coordinates `(r0, c0)`, and the unique pixel's color `v0`.\n*   Initial hypotheses involving simple functions of Manhattan distance (`d = |r-r0| + |c-c0|`) like `(d + v0) % 10` match some output pixels but fail for others, indicating a more complex relationship. Similarly, linear combinations of coordinates relative to `(r0, c0)` like `(A*(r-r0) + B*(c-c0) + v0) % 10` also failed to consistently explain the patterns with constant coefficients A and B, or coefficients linearly dependent on `v0`.\n\nThe transformation generates a full grid pattern originating from or influenced by the single unique input point. The precise mathematical formula generating the pattern remains unclear from only two examples but involves the coordinates `(r, c)`, the unique point `(r0, c0, v0)`, and likely modulo 10 arithmetic.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record its row `r0`, column `c0`, and color `v0`.\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid.\n3.  **Calculate Output Pixel Values**: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid (from row 0 to height-1, and column 0 to width-1).\n4.  **Determine Pixel Color**: For the current cell `(r, c)`, calculate its color based on a rule involving `r`, `c`, `r0`, `c0`, and `v0`. The specific rule observed is `Output[r][c] = (|r - r0| + |c - c0| + v0) % 10`, where `|x|` denotes the absolute value (Manhattan distance calculation).\n    * *Self-correction during thought process indicated this simple Manhattan distance formula does not perfectly match all pixels in the examples, but it captures the dependency on relative position and the unique value, and matches the unique pixel itself and some neighbors.
