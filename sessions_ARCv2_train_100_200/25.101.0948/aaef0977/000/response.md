## Perception

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The input grid consists of a uniform background color (orange, value 7) with a single pixel of a different color at a specific location. Let's call the coordinates of this unique pixel `(r0, c0)` and its color `v0`.

The output grid is filled with a complex pattern of colors (values 0-9). The transformation seems to depend critically on the location `(r0, c0)` and the color `v0` of the unique input pixel.

Observing the two examples:
1.  **Example 1:** Input has green (3) at (0, 6). Output is a complex grid.
2.  **Example 2:** Input has gray (5) at (5, 2). Output is a different complex grid.

Key observations:
*   The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions (8x8 in both examples).
*   The color of the output pixel at the location of the unique input pixel `(r0, c0)` is always equal to the unique input color `v0`. That is, `Output[r0][c0] = v0`.
*   The overall pattern in the output grid changes based on the position and color of the unique input pixel.
*   The output color `Output[r][c]` for any pixel `(r, c)` appears to be a deterministic function of its coordinates `(r, c)`, the unique pixel's coordinates `(r0, c0)`, and the unique pixel's color `v0`.
*   Initial hypotheses involving simple functions of Manhattan distance (`d = |r-r0| + |c-c0|`) like `(d + v0) % 10` match some output pixels but fail for others, indicating a more complex relationship. Similarly, linear combinations of coordinates relative to `(r0, c0)` like `(A*(r-r0) + B*(c-c0) + v0) % 10` also failed to consistently explain the patterns with constant coefficients A and B, or coefficients linearly dependent on `v0`.

The transformation generates a full grid pattern originating from or influenced by the single unique input point. The precise mathematical formula generating the pattern remains unclear from only two examples but involves the coordinates `(r, c)`, the unique point `(r0, c0, v0)`, and likely modulo 10 arithmetic.

  - description: The value of every other output pixel is calculated based on its coordinates (r, c), the unique pixel's coordinates (r0, c0), and the unique pixel's color (v0).
    rule: Output[r][c] = Function(r, c, r0, c0, v0) % 10
    notes: The exact nature of the function is complex and not fully determined by the provided examples. It likely involves the relative coordinates (r-r0, c-c0) or Manhattan distance, combined with v0, using modulo 10 arithmetic. Simple common formulas did not fully match the examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Unique Pixel**: Scan the input grid to find the pixel whose color is different from the majority background color (expected to be orange, value 7). Record its row `r0`, column `c0`, and color `v0`.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
3.  **Calculate Output Pixel Values**: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid (from row 0 to height-1, and column 0 to width-1).
4.  **Determine Pixel Color**: For the current cell `(r, c)`, calculate its color based on a rule involving `r`, `c`, `r0`, `c0`, and `v0`. The specific rule observed is `Output[r][c] = (|r - r0| + |c - c0| + v0) % 10`, where `|x|` denotes the absolute value (Manhattan distance calculation).
    * *Self-correction during thought process indicated this simple Manhattan distance formula does not perfectly match all pixels in the examples, but it captures the dependency on relative position and the unique value, and matches the unique pixel itself and some neighbors. It represents the most plausible simple hypothesis found.*
5.  **Populate Output Grid**: Assign the calculated color to the cell `(r, c)` in the output grid.
6.  **Return Output Grid**: Once all cells are calculated, return the completed output grid.
