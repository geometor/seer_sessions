Record its row `r0`,\n    column `c0`, and color `v0`.\n2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a new grid with the same height and\n    width as the input grid.\n3.  **Calculate Output Pixel Values**: Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the\n    grid.\n4.  **Determine Pixel Color**: For the current cell `(r, c)`, calculate its color\n    based on the rule: `Output[r][c] = (|r - r0| + |c - c0| + v0) % 10`, where\n    `|x|` denotes the absolute value (Manhattan distance calculation).\n5.  **Populate Output Grid**: Assign the calculated color to the cell `(r, c)`\n    in the output grid.\n6.  **Return Output Grid**: Once all cells are calculated, return the completed\n    output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport collections\nimport math\n\ndef find_unique_pixel(grid: list[list[int]]) -> tuple[int, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the row, column, and value of the single unique pixel in the grid.\n\n    Assumes the background color is the most frequent color and there is\n    exactly one pixel with a different color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid (list of lists of integers).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing (row, column, value) of the unique pixel.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the grid is empty, no unique pixel is found, or more\n                    than one unique pixel is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid cannot be empty\")\n\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0])\n\n    # Count color occurrences to find the background color\n    counts = collections.Counter()\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            counts[grid[r][c]] += 1\n\n    if not counts:\n         # This case would only happen if the grid dimensions were non-zero\n         # but the grid itself was somehow empty, which is unlikely with checks above.\n         raise ValueError(\"Could not count colors in the grid.\")\n\n    # Determine background color (most frequent).
