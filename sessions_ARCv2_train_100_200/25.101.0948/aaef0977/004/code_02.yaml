task_elements:
  - description: Input grid has a uniform background color (orange, 7) with one unique pixel.
    properties:
      background_color: orange (7)
      grid_size: 8x8 (in examples)
      unique_pixel:
        location: (r0, c0)
        color: v0 (different from background)

  - description: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      grid_size: Same as input (8x8)
      content: Filled with a complex pattern of colors (0-9).

relationships:
  - description: The output grid pattern is determined by the location (r0, c0) and color (v0) of the unique input pixel relative to each output cell (r, c).
    input_elements:
      - unique_pixel location (r0, c0)
      - unique_pixel color (v0)
      - output cell coordinates (r, c)
    output_elements:
      - output cell value Output[r][c]

transformations:
  - description: The value of the output pixel at (r, c) is calculated using the Manhattan distance to the unique pixel and a base sequence, cyclically shifted based on the unique pixel's value.
    rule: |
      1. Identify the unique pixel location (r0, c0) and value v0.
      2. For each output cell (r, c), calculate the Manhattan distance:
         d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)
      3. Define a constant base sequence:
         BaseSeq = [3, 4, 0, 5, 2, 8, 9, 6, 1]
      4. Calculate a shift value based on v0:
         Shift = (6 * v0) % 9
      5. Determine the index into the base sequence:
         Index = (d + Shift) % 9
      6. The output value is:
         Output[r][c] = BaseSeq[Index]
    notes:
        - The base sequence has length L=9.
        - The calculation involves modulo 9 arithmetic for the index.
        - This rule was derived from analyzing patterns in both examples and appears consistent, despite a potential anomaly in the previous code execution log for Example 1 verification.
