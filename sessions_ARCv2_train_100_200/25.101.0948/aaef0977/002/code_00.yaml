task_elements:
  - description: Input grid has a uniform background color (orange, 7) with one unique pixel.
    properties:
      background_color: orange (7)
      grid_size: 8x8 (in examples)
      unique_pixel:
        location: (r0, c0)
        color: v0 (different from background)

  - description: Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      grid_size: Same as input (8x8)
      content: Filled with a complex pattern of colors (0-9).

relationships:
  - description: The output grid pattern is determined by the location (r0, c0) and color (v0) of the unique input pixel.
    input_elements:
      - unique_pixel location (r0, c0)
      - unique_pixel color (v0)
    output_elements:
      - Entire output grid pattern

transformations:
  - description: The value of the output pixel at (r, c) is calculated based on its coordinates (r, c), the unique pixel's coordinates (r0, c0), and the unique pixel's color (v0), using modulo 10 arithmetic.
    rule: Output[r][c] = Function(r, c, r0, c0, v0) % 10
    notes:
        - The value at the unique pixel location is its original value: `Output[r0][c0] = v0`.
        - Simple candidate functions like `(|r-r0| + |c-c0| + v0)`, `((r-r0) - (c-c0) + v0)`, `(r - c + K(v0))`, `(A*r + B*c + K(v0))` have been tested and do not match the example outputs.
        - The correct function generates a complex, possibly wave-like or shifted pattern influenced by (r0, c0, v0). The exact nature of this function is still unknown and requires further investigation.
