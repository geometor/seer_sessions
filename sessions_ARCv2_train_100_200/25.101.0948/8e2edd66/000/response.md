Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This represents a 3x scaling factor in both height and width.
2.  **Colors:** Each input-output pair uses only two colors: white (0) and one other "active" color (azure/8, maroon/9, or orange/7). The active color is preserved from input to output.
3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of 3x3 subgrids. The overall 9x9 output can be viewed as a 3x3 arrangement of these smaller 3x3 subgrids.
4.  **Pattern Relationship:** The core transformation involves creating a new 3x3 pattern based on the *inverse* of the input pattern. Where the input grid has a white pixel, the new pattern has an active color pixel, and vice-versa. Let's call this the "inverse pattern".
5.  **Placement Rule:** The placement of this "inverse pattern" into the 3x3 subgrids of the output depends on the values in the original input grid. Specifically, if a cell in the input grid is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output is filled with the "inverse pattern". If a cell in the input grid has the active color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output remains entirely white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions:
    input: 3x3
    output: 9x9
  scaling_factor: 3
  colors:
    background: white (0)
    active: one non-white color (varies per example: 8, 9, 7)
    persistence: active color is preserved from input to output

transformation_elements:
  - object: input_grid (I)
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - contains: background color (0) and one active color (C)
  - object: inverse_pattern (InvP)
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
    derivation:
      - Based on input_grid I and active_color C
      - Rule: InvP[r, c] = C if I[r, c] == 0, else InvP[r, c] = 0
  - object: output_grid (O)
    properties:
      - size: 9x9
      - composition: 3x3 grid of 3x3 subgrids
    derivation:
      - Initialize O with background color (0)
      - Iterate through input_grid I at coordinates (R_sub, C_sub)
      - Condition: Check if I[R_sub, C_sub] == 0
      - Action: If condition is true, copy inverse_pattern InvP to the subgrid of O starting at (R_sub * 3, C_sub * 3)

relationships:
  - output grid structure is determined by input grid values
  - the pattern placed in output subgrids is the inverse of the input grid pattern
  - placement occurs only where the corresponding input grid cell is the background color (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the active color (C) present in the 3x3 input grid (I). This is the color other than white (0).
2.  Create a new 3x3 grid, called the "inverse pattern" (InvP). Initialize it with white (0).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid `I`. If `I[r, c]` is white (0), set the corresponding cell `InvP[r, c]` to the active color `C`.
4.  Create the 9x9 output grid (O) and initialize all its cells to white (0).
5.  Iterate through each cell `(R_sub, C_sub)` of the input grid `I` (where `R_sub` is the row index 0-2, and `C_sub` is the column index 0-2).
6.  Check the value of the input cell `I[R_sub, C_sub]`.
7.  If `I[R_sub, C_sub]` is white (0):
    *   Calculate the top-left coordinates for the corresponding subgrid in the output: `R_out = R_sub * 3`, `C_out = C_sub * 3`.
    *   Copy the 3x3 "inverse pattern" `InvP` into the output grid `O` starting at position `(R_out, C_out)`. That is, for `r` from 0 to 2 and `c` from 0 to 2, set `O[R_out + r, C_out + c] = InvP[r, c]`.
8.  If `I[R_sub, C_sub]` is the active color `C`, do nothing (the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in `O` remains white).
9.  Return the final 9x9 output grid `O`.
