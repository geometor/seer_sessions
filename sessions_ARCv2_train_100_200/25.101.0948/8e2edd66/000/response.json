            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This represents a 3x scaling factor in both height and width.\n2.  **Colors:** Each input-output pair uses only two colors: white (0) and one other \"active\" color (azure/8, maroon/9, or orange/7). The active color is preserved from input to output.\n3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of 3x3 subgrids. The overall 9x9 output can be viewed as a 3x3 arrangement of these smaller 3x3 subgrids.\n4.  **Pattern Relationship:** The core transformation involves creating a new 3x3 pattern based on the *inverse* of the input pattern. Where the input grid has a white pixel, the new pattern has an active color pixel, and vice-versa. Let's call this the \"inverse pattern\".\n5.  **Placement Rule:** The placement of this \"inverse pattern\" into the 3x3 subgrids of the output depends on the values in the original input grid. Specifically, if a cell in the input grid is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output is filled with the \"inverse pattern\". If a cell in the input grid has the active color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output remains entirely white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
