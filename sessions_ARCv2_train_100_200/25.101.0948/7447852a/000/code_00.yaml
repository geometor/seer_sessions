task_context:
  description: Fill segments of white pixels with yellow based on row index and proximity to red pixels.
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example.
    - colors_used: Input uses white(0) and red(2). Output uses white(0), red(2), and yellow(4).
    - transformation_scope: Row-based; each row is processed independently.

objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white(0), red(2), yellow(4)
      - location: (row, column)
  - object_type: segment
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of white pixels within a row.
    types:
      - left_edge: Starts at column 0, ends before the first red pixel.
      - right_edge: Starts after the last red pixel, ends at the last column.
      - internal: Located between two consecutive red pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment.
      - defining_interval_length: Distance between the red pixels defining the segment (for internal) or distance between the edge and the nearest red pixel (for edge segments).

relationships:
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    description: Red pixels define the boundaries of white pixel segments within each row.
  - relationship_type: conditional_filling
    description: >
      White pixel segments are filled with yellow based on conditions involving the row index and the defining_interval_length of the segment.

actions:
  - action_type: identify_red_pixels
    description: For each row, find the column indices of all red pixels.
  - action_type: identify_segments
    description: Based on red pixel locations and grid edges, identify left_edge, right_edge, and internal white pixel segments for each row.
  - action_type: calculate_interval_lengths
    description: Determine the defining interval length for each segment.
  - action_type: fill_segment
    input: segment, row_index, interval_length
    output: modified_grid (segment pixels changed to yellow)
    conditions:
      - If row index is 0:
        - Fill right_edge segment if its defining_interval_length is 1.
        - Fill internal segment if its defining_interval_length is 4.
      - If row index is 1:
        - Fill left_edge segment if its defining_interval_length is 1.
        - Fill internal segment if its defining_interval_length is 2.
      - If row index is 2:
        - Fill left_edge segment if its defining_interval_length is 2.
        - Fill internal segment if its defining_interval_length is 4.
