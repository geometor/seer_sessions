The output grids are the same size and retain the original red pixels but replace some white pixels with yellow (4) pixels. The transformation appears to operate independently on each row. The placement of yellow pixels depends on the row index and the positions of the red pixels within that row.\n\nSpecifically, yellow pixels fill certain segments of white pixels. These segments are defined either by the grid edges and the nearest red pixel, or by pairs of consecutive red pixels within the row. The rule for which segments are filled depends on the row index (0, 1, or 2) and the length of the segment (distance between the red pixels or between a red pixel and the edge).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
