            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code version successfully solved training examples 1 and 3 but failed on example 2. The failure occurred in row 0, where the rightmost pixel was incorrectly changed from white (0) to yellow (4).\n\nAnalysis revealed that the condition for filling the right edge segment in row 0 (`distance_to_edge == 1`) was met in both example 2 and example 3. However, the expected output only shows this segment filled in example 3. Further comparison showed that row 0 in example 2 had two internal segments of length 4, while row 0 in example 3 had four internal segments of length 4.\n\nThis suggests the rule for filling the right edge segment in row 0 (when `distance == 1`) is conditional on the number of qualifying internal segments (length 4) found in that same row. Specifically, the right edge fill seems to occur only if the count of qualifying internal segments is greater than 2.\n\nThe logic for filling edge segments in rows 1 and 2, and for filling internal segments in all rows based on their ordinal position, appears correct and consistent across all examples.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the condition for filling the row 0 right edge segment to include the check on the count of qualifying internal segments.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's confirm the location of the mismatch in Example 2.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
