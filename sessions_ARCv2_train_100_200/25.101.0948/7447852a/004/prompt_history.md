## Perception
The input grids consist of white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grids are the same size and retain the original red pixels but replace some white pixels with yellow (4) pixels. The transformation appears to operate independently on each row. The placement of yellow pixels depends on the row index and the positions of the red pixels within that row.

Specifically, yellow pixels fill certain segments of white pixels. These segments are defined either by the grid edges and the nearest red pixel, or by pairs of consecutive red pixels within the row. The rule for which segments are filled depends on the row index (0, 1, or 2) and the length of the segment (distance between the red pixels or between a red pixel and the edge).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  For each row `r` in the grid (from top row 0 to bottom row H-1):
    a.  Find the column indices of all red (2) pixels in row `r`. Let this list be `red_cols`.
    b.  Get the width `W` of the grid.
    c.  If `red_cols` is not empty:
        i.  **Check Left Edge Segment:** Let `c_first` be the index of the first red pixel (`red_cols[0]`). If `c_first > 0` (meaning the row starts with white pixels):
            *   Calculate the distance `d_left = c_first`.
            *   If row `r` is 1 and `d_left` is 1, change pixels from column 0 to `c_first - 1` to yellow (4).
            *   If row `r` is 2 and `d_left` is 2, change pixels from column 0 to `c_first - 1` to yellow (4).
        ii. **Check Right Edge Segment:** Let `c_last` be the index of the last red pixel (`red_cols[-1]`). If `c_last < W - 1` (meaning the row ends with white pixels):
            *   Calculate the distance `d_right = (W - 1) - c_last`.
            *   If row `r` is 0 and `d_right` is 1, change pixels from column `c_last + 1` to `W - 1` to yellow (4).
        iii. **Check Internal Segments:** Iterate through pairs of consecutive red pixel indices (`c1`, `c2`) from `red_cols`.
            *   Calculate the interval length `L = c2 - c1`.
            *   If row `r` is 0 or 2, and `L` is 4, change pixels from column `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1` to yellow (4).
            *   If row `r` is 1, and `L` is 2, change pixels from column `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1` (which is just column `c1 + 1`) to yellow (4).
3.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis correctly identified the basic elements: row-based transformation, involvement of white(0), red(2), and yellow(4), and the concept of filling white segments defined by red pixels or edges. However, the conditions for filling were oversimplified. The previous code filled *all* segments meeting the basic length criteria for a given row, whereas the examples show that only *specific* segments should be filled based on more complex positional criteria (e.g., the 2nd interval of length 4 in row 0, the 3rd and 6th intervals of length 2 in row 1).

The strategy is to refine the rules by incorporating these positional constraints. We need to identify not just *that* an interval meets the length requirement for its row, but also *which* interval it is in the sequence of qualifying intervals for that row.

**Analysis of Mismatches:**

*   **Example 1:** 16 mismatches.
    *   Row 0: Mismatches at cols 1, 2, 3 (interval 0-4 filled incorrectly) and 9, 10, 11 (interval 8-12 filled incorrectly). Correct fill was 5, 6, 7 (interval 4-8).
    *   Row 1: Mismatches at cols 2 (interval 1-3), 4 (interval 3-5), 8 (interval 7-9), 10 (interval 9-11). Correct fills were col 0 (left edge), 6 (interval 5-7), 12 (interval 11-13).
    *   Row 2: Mismatches at cols 3, 4, 5 (interval 2-6) and 7, 8, 9 (interval 6-10). Correct fills were cols 0, 1 (left edge), 11, 12, 13 (interval 10-14).
*   **Example 2:** 10 mismatches.
    *   Row 0: Mismatches at cols 1, 2, 3 (interval 0-4 filled incorrectly), col 9 (right edge filled correctly, mismatch count seems off here - wait, expected is `...2 0`, transformed is `...2 4`. Yes, mismatch at col 9). Correct fill was 5, 6, 7 (interval 4-8).
    *   Row 1: Mismatches at cols 2 (interval 1-3), 4 (interval 3-5), 8 (interval 7-9). Correct fills were col 0 (left edge), 6 (interval 5-7).
    *   Row 2: Mismatches at cols 3, 4, 5 (interval 2-6 filled incorrectly). Correct fills were cols 0, 1 (left edge). No internal fill expected here.
*   **Example 3:** 21 mismatches.
    *   Row 0: Mismatches at cols 1, 2, 3 (interval 0-4), 9, 10, 11 (interval 8-12), 13, 14, 15 (interval 12-16). Correct fills were 5, 6, 7 (interval 4-8) and 17 (right edge).
    *   Row 1: Mismatches at cols 2 (1-3), 4 (3-5), 8 (7-9), 10 (9-11), 14 (13-15), 16 (15-17). Correct fills were 0 (left edge), 6 (5-7), 12 (11-13).
    *   Row 2: Mismatches at cols 3, 4, 5 (2-6), 7, 8, 9 (6-10). Correct fills were 0, 1 (left edge), 11, 12, 13 (10-14).

The metric analysis confirms the detailed manual analysis: the previous code incorrectly filled *all* intervals meeting the length criteria, while the correct transformation requires selecting specific intervals based on their order among qualifying intervals within the row.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  description: Selectively fill segments of white pixels with yellow based on row index, segment type (edge or internal), segment length, and the segment's ordinal position among other qualifying segments in the row.
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions for each example. Grids are always 3 rows high.
    - colors_used: Input uses white(0) and red(2). Output uses white(0), red(2), and yellow(4).
    - transformation_scope: Row-based; each row (0, 1, 2) is processed independently using different rules.

objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white(0), red(2), yellow(4)
      - location: (row, column)
  - object_type: segment
    definition: A contiguous horizontal sequence of white pixels within a row.
    types:
      - left_edge: Starts at column 0, ends before the first red pixel. Length is `c_first`.
      - right_edge: Starts after the last red pixel, ends at the last column. Length is `width - 1 - c_last`.
      - internal: Located between two consecutive red pixels `c1` and `c2`. Length is `c2 - c1 - 1`.
    properties:
      - interval_length: The distance between the defining elements (edge-to-red or red-to-red). For edge segments, this is `c_first` (left) or `width - 1 - c_last` (right). For internal segments, this is `c2 - c1`.
      - start_col: Starting column index of the white pixel segment.
      - end_col: Ending column index of the white pixel segment.
      - defining_indices: For internal segments, the tuple `(c1, c2)`.
  - object_type: qualifying_interval_list
    definition: A list of internal segments within a single row that meet a specific `interval_length` criterion for that row.
    properties:
      - row_index: The row the list belongs to.
      - required_interval_length: The specific length (`c2-c1`) required for an interval to be included (4 for rows 0/2, 2 for row 1).
      - intervals: Ordered list of internal segments `[(c1_1, c2_1), (c1_2, c2_2), ...]` matching the criteria.
      - count: Number of intervals in the list.

relationships:
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    description: Red pixels define the boundaries of white pixel segments within each row.
  - relationship_type: conditional_filling
    description: >
      White pixel segments are potentially filled with yellow based on conditions involving the row index, segment type (edge/internal), interval length, and the segment's ordinal position (e.g., 2nd, 3rd, 6th) within the list of qualifying internal segments for that row.

actions:
  - action_type: initialize_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid.
  - action_type: identify_red_pixels
    description: For each row, find the column indices of all red pixels.
  - action_type: identify_and_conditionally_fill_edge_segments
    description: For each row, check the left and right edge segments and fill with yellow based on row index and interval length.
      - Row 1, Left Edge: Fill if interval length (distance to edge) is 1.
      - Row 2, Left Edge: Fill if interval length (distance to edge) is 2.
      - Row 0, Right Edge: Fill if interval length (distance to edge) is 1.
  - action_type: identify_qualifying_internal_intervals
    description: For each row, find all internal segments (between consecutive red pixels `c1`, `c2`) and create ordered lists of those segments that match the required interval length for that row (Length 4 for rows 0 & 2; Length 2 for row 1).
  - action_type: conditionally_fill_specific_internal_segments
    description: Based on the row index and the count of qualifying internal intervals, fill specific intervals from the ordered list with yellow.
      - Row 0: If count >= 2, fill the 2nd interval (index 1) from the list of length-4 intervals.
      - Row 1: If count >= 3, fill the 3rd interval (index 2) from the list of length-2 intervals. If count >= 6, also fill the 6th interval (index 5) from the list.
      - Row 2: If count >= 3, fill the 3rd interval (index 2) from the list of length-4 intervals.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Get the width (`W`) of the grid.
3.  For each row index `r` from 0 to 2:
    a.  Find the list of column indices `red_cols` containing red (2) pixels in row `r`.
    b.  If `red_cols` is empty, continue to the next row.
    c.  **Process Edge Segments:**
        i.  **Left Edge:** Get the first red column `c_first = red_cols[0]`. Calculate the interval length `d_left = c_first`.
            *   If `r == 1` and `d_left == 1`, change pixels in `output_grid[r]` from column 0 to `c_first - 1` to yellow (4).
            *   If `r == 2` and `d_left == 2`, change pixels in `output_grid[r]` from column 0 to `c_first - 1` to yellow (4).
        ii. **Right Edge:** Get the last red column `c_last = red_cols[-1]`. Calculate the interval length `d_right = W - 1 - c_last`.
            *   If `r == 0` and `d_right == 1`, change pixels in `output_grid[r]` from column `c_last + 1` to `W - 1` to yellow (4).
    d.  **Process Internal Segments:**
        i.  Create an empty list, `qualifying_intervals`, to store the start and end columns `(c1, c2)` of internal intervals that meet the row-specific length requirement.
        ii. Iterate through consecutive pairs of red pixel columns (`c1`, `c2`) from `red_cols`. Calculate the interval length `L = c2 - c1`.
            *   If `r == 0` or `r == 2`, and `L == 4`, add `(c1, c2)` to `qualifying_intervals`.
            *   If `r == 1`, and `L == 2`, add `(c1, c2)` to `qualifying_intervals`.
        iii. Get the count of qualifying intervals: `count = len(qualifying_intervals)`.
        iv. Fill specific qualifying intervals based on row index `r`:
            *   If `r == 0` and `count >= 2`: Get the second interval `(c1, c2) = qualifying_intervals[1]`. Change pixels in `output_grid[r]` from `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1` to yellow (4).
            *   If `r == 1`:
                *   If `count >= 3`: Get the third interval `(c1, c2) = qualifying_intervals[2]`. Change the pixel at `output_grid[r][c1 + 1]` to yellow (4).
                *   If `count >= 6`: Get the sixth interval `(c1, c2) = qualifying_intervals[5]`. Change the pixel at `output_grid[r][c1 + 1]` to yellow (4).
            *   If `r == 2` and `count >= 3`: Get the third interval `(c1, c2) = qualifying_intervals[2]`. Change pixels in `output_grid[r]` from `c1 + 1` to `c2 - 1` to yellow (4).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
