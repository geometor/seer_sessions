            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the basic elements: row-based transformation, involvement of white(0), red(2), and yellow(4), and the concept of filling white segments defined by red pixels or edges. However, the conditions for filling were oversimplified. The previous code filled *all* segments meeting the basic length criteria for a given row, whereas the examples show that only *specific* segments should be filled based on more complex positional criteria (e.g., the 2nd interval of length 4 in row 0, the 3rd and 6th intervals of length 2 in row 1).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the rules by incorporating these positional constraints. We need to identify not just *that* an interval meets the length requirement for its row, but also *which* interval it is in the sequence of qualifying intervals for that row.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather precise metrics on the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the outputs generated by the previous code (`transformed_output`).\n\n"
