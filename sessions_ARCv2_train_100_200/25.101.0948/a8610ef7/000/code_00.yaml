elements:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: azure (8)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: gray (5)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height, width
      - content: matrix of pixels
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: pixels
    definition: Pixels sharing an edge (orthogonal) or a corner (diagonal). Orthogonal and diagonal neighbors (8 neighbors total) seem relevant.
actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input: pixel (azure=8)
    output: pixel (red=2 or gray=5)
    condition: Based on the colors of the 8 neighboring pixels (within the 3x3 grid centered on the input pixel).
  - name: preserve_color
    input: pixel (white=0)
    output: pixel (white=0)
    condition: Always applies to white pixels.
transformation_rule:
  - description: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - if: input pixel color is white (0)
    then: output pixel color remains white (0).
  - if: input pixel color is azure (8)
    then:
      - step: analyze the 3x3 neighborhood centered on the pixel.
      - step: count the number of neighbors that are also azure (8).
      - step: apply a rule based on this count to determine the output color (red=2 or gray=5).
      - specific_rule_hypothesis (tentative): If the count of azure neighbors is odd, the output is red (2); if the count is even, the output is gray (5). (Note: This specific hypothesis showed inconsistencies during analysis).
