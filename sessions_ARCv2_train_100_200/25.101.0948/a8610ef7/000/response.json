The transformation rule depends on the local neighborhood of the azure pixel.\n4.  **Neighborhood Influence:** The change from azure (8) to red (2) or gray (5) appears to be determined by the configuration of neighboring pixels, specifically the count and color of neighbors within the 3x3 area centered on the pixel.\n5.  **Potential Rule (Parity Check):** A possible, though potentially flawed, hypothesis involves counting the number of azure (8) neighbors (including diagonals) for each azure pixel in the input grid. The parity (odd or even) of this count might determine the output color (e.g., odd count maps to red, even count maps to gray, or vice versa). Initial checks show inconsistencies with this simple rule, suggesting a more complex condition or a different rule altogether. The rule involves mapping 8 -> 2 and 8 -> 5.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
