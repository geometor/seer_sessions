task_description: Generate four corner blocks based on a central 2x2 block.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Constant across input/output pairs (e.g., 6x6 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - element: central_block
    description: A 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Four distinct colors [A, B] in the first row, [C, D] in the second row.
      - location: Defined by the top-left coordinate (r0, c0).
      - uniqueness: There is only one such block in the input.

output_elements:
  - element: preserved_block
    description: The original 2x2 central_block copied to the output.
    properties:
      - colors: Same as central_block [A, B], [C, D].
      - location: Same as central_block (r0, c0).
  - element: corner_blocks
    description: Four rectangular blocks added to the corners of the grid.
    count: 4
    properties:
      - relationship: Each corner block's color and size/position is determined by one color and the position (r0, c0) of the input central_block.
      - block_TL:
          color: D (from input central_block[1, 1])
          location_top_left: (0, 0)
          location_bottom_right: (r0 - 1, c0 - 1)
          size: r0 rows x c0 columns
      - block_TR:
          color: C (from input central_block[1, 0])
          location_top_left: (0, c0 + 2)
          location_bottom_right: (r0 - 1, c0 + 3)
          size: r0 rows x 2 columns
      - block_BL:
          color: B (from input central_block[0, 1])
          location_top_left: (r0 + 2, 0)
          location_bottom_right: (r0 + 3, c0 - 1)
          size: 2 rows x c0 columns
      - block_BR:
          color: A (from input central_block[0, 0])
          location_top_left: (r0 + 2, c0 + 2)
          location_bottom_right: (r0 + 3, c0 + 3)
          size: 2 rows x 2 columns

  - type: generation
    source: input.central_block
    target: output.corner_blocks
    details: The properties (color, size, location) of the four output corner blocks are derived from the colors and location of the input central block as specified above.
