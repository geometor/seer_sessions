            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a grid (appears to be 6x6 in examples) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a single contiguous 2x2 block of four different non-white pixels.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. It retains the original 2x2 block in its original position. Additionally, four new rectangular blocks of solid color appear in the four corners of the output grid.\n3.  **Color Mapping:** The colors of the four corner blocks in the output are determined by the colors in the original 2x2 input block. Specifically, if the input block is `[[A, B], [C, D]]`, the top-left (TL) corner block has color D, the top-right (TR) corner block has color C, the bottom-left (BL) corner block has color B, and the bottom-right (BR) corner block has color A. This corresponds to a reflection or mapping of colors across the center of the 2x2 block to the corners of the grid.\n4.  **Size and Position Mapping:** The size and exact position of the corner blocks depend on the coordinates of the top-left corner of the original 2x2 block in the input grid. Let the input block's top-left corner be at `(r0, c0)`.\n    *   The TL output block (color D) occupies the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(r0-1, c0-1)`. Its size is `r0 x c0`.\n    *   The TR output block (color C) occupies the rectangle from `(0, c0+2)` to `(r0-1, c0+3)`. Its size is `r0 x 2`.\n    *   The BL output block (color B) occupies the rectangle from `(r0+2, 0)` to `(r0+3, c0-1)`. Its size is `2 x c0`.\n    *   The BR output block (color A) occupies the rectangle from `(r0+2, c0+2)` to `(r0+3, c0+3)`. Its size is `2 x 2`.\n5.  **Background:** The rest of the output grid remains white (0), except for the original input block and the four new corner blocks.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
