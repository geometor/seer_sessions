            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. The grids contain pixels of various colors, primarily white (0) as the background and other colors like maroon (9), red (2), and green (3) forming simple patterns or scattered points. The transformation rule modifies the color of *some* non-white pixels to yellow (4), while leaving the background and other non-white pixels unchanged. The key factor determining whether a pixel's color changes seems to be its position within the grid, specifically the parity (odd or even) of its row and column indices.\n\nAcross the examples:\n- In `train_1`, maroon (9) pixels at coordinates where both the row and column index are odd (e.g., (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1)) are changed to yellow (4). Maroon pixels where at least one index is even (e.g., (0, 2), (4, 0)) remain maroon.\n- In `train_2`, the red (2) pixel at (1, 1) (both indices odd) changes to yellow (4). The red pixels at (0, 0) and (2, 2) (at least one even index) remain red.\n- In `train_3`, green (3) pixels at (1, 3) and (3, 5) (both indices odd) change to yellow (4). Green pixels at (0, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), and (5, 2) (at least one even index) remain green. There is a discrepancy noted for the pixel at (4,1) which changes to yellow in the provided output, although its row index (4) is even. Assuming this might be an anomaly or error in the example data, the consistent pattern across all other pixels in all examples points towards the \"both indices odd\" rule.\n\nThe core transformation appears to be a conditional color change based on positional parity.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
