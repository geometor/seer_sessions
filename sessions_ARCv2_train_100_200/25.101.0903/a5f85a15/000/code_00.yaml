task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8, 3x3, 6x6)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - foreground_colors: various (maroon(9), red(2), green(3))
  transformation_type: conditional color replacement
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9
      - position: (row_index, column_index)
      - row_parity: odd or even
      - column_parity: odd or even
relationships:
  - input_pixel -> output_pixel: Mapping based on position.
actions:
  - name: change_color
    target: non-white input pixels
    condition: row_index is odd AND column_index is odd
    result: output pixel color becomes yellow (4)
  - name: preserve_color
    target: white input pixels OR non-white input pixels where condition (row_index is odd AND column_index is odd) is FALSE
    result: output pixel color is the same as input pixel color
output_grid:
  derivation: Modified copy of the input grid based on the actions applied to each pixel.
