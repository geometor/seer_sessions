## Perception

The task involves processing a 2D grid of pixels. Comparing the input and output grids across all three examples reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid is identical to the input grid, but with the leftmost column removed. The dimensions of the output grid are always the same height as the input but one column narrower.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: geometric
properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - grid_dimensions:
      input_height: H
      input_width: W
      output_height: H
      output_width: W - 1
relationship:
  - output_grid: is a subgrid of input_grid
action:
  - remove_column:
      target: input_grid
      column_index: 0 # The first column
      result: output_grid
constraints:
  - The height of the grid remains unchanged.
  - The relative order and values of the pixels in the remaining columns are preserved.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Given an input grid.
2.  Identify and remove the first column (the column at index 0) from the input grid.
3.  Return the resulting grid as the output.
