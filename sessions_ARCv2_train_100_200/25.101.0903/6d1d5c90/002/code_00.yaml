task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: row_reordering_and_column_removal
properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - grid_dimensions:
      input_height: N
      input_width: W
      output_height: N
      output_width: W - 1
  - first_column:
      contains_unique_pixel: true
      unique_pixel_color: 2 (red)
      other_pixel_color: 6 (magenta)
      red_pixel_row_index: k (0-based)
objects:
  - input_grid
  - output_grid
  - first_column_pixels: The pixels in the first column (index 0) of the input grid.
  - remaining_rows: The rows of the input grid after removing the first column.
relationships:
  - output_grid_rows: Are a permutation of the remaining_rows.
  - permutation_order: Depends on the index 'k' of the red pixel in the first_column_pixels.
action:
  - find_red_index: Locate the 0-based row index 'k' of the red pixel (2) in the first column.
  - calculate_start_index: Compute the starting index 's' for the output row order using the formula `s = (5 * k) % N`, where N is the number of rows.
  - remove_first_column: Create an intermediate grid by removing the first column from the input grid.
  - reorder_rows_cyclically: Construct the output grid by arranging the rows of the intermediate grid starting from index 's' and wrapping around.
constraints:
  - The first column always contains exactly one red (2) pixel.
  - The height of the grid remains unchanged.
  - The width of the grid decreases by one.
  - The relative order of pixels within each row is preserved.
