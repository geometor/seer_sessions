            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids have varying dimensions but share a common structure. They are partitioned by single rows and columns of white pixels (color 0) into a larger grid of 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels. The examples show a 3x3 arrangement of these 2x2 blocks.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grid always retains the same number of rows as the input, including the white separator rows. However, the output grid width is always 2 columns. This suggests the output is composed of 2x2 blocks arranged vertically, corresponding to the block rows in the input.\n3.  **Core Task**: The central task appears to be selecting *one* 2x2 block from each \"block row\" of the input grid and applying a specific transformation to it to produce the corresponding 2x2 block in the output.\n4.  **Selection Mechanism**: A selection rule is needed to choose which input block (left, middle, or right) from a given block row is used. Comparing pixel sums within the blocks seems relevant. Usually, the block with the maximum sum is chosen, but in one case (the second block row of the second example), the block with the minimum sum is chosen. This suggests the selection rule might depend on the row index.\n5.  **Transformation Mechanism**: Once a 2x2 input block `[[a, b], [c, d]]` is selected, it undergoes a transformation to produce the 2x2 output block. The transformation appears to depend on the internal pattern or symmetry of the selected block (e.g., if rows are uniform, if columns are uniform, etc.). Several distinct transformation patterns are observed based on equalities between a, b, c, and d. A horizontal reflection is also used, potentially as a default or under specific conditions.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels located between the separators. Group these blocks by their \"block row\" (rows sharing the same horizontal separators). Assume there are three blocks per block row (Left, Middle, Right).\n3.  Initialize an output grid with the same number of rows as the input and 2 columns, filled initially with a default color (e.g., white). Copy the white separator rows from the input to the output.\n4.  Iterate through each block row, identified by its starting row index `r` and block row index `br` (starting from 0):\n    a.  Get the three 2x2 blocks for this row: B_left, B_middle, B_right.\n    b.  Calculate the sum of the four pixel values for each block: Sum_L, Sum_M, Sum_R.\n    c.

If there's a tie for the maximum, select the rightmost block among those tied.\n    d.
