**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids have varying dimensions but share a common structure. They are partitioned by single rows and columns of white pixels (color 0) into a larger grid of 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels. The examples show a 3x3 arrangement of these 2x2 blocks.
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grid always retains the same number of rows as the input, including the white separator rows. However, the output grid width is always 2 columns. This suggests the output is composed of 2x2 blocks arranged vertically, corresponding to the block rows in the input.
3.  **Core Task**: The central task appears to be selecting *one* 2x2 block from each "block row" of the input grid and applying a specific transformation to it to produce the corresponding 2x2 block in the output.
4.  **Selection Mechanism**: A selection rule is needed to choose which input block (left, middle, or right) from a given block row is used. Comparing pixel sums within the blocks seems relevant. Usually, the block with the maximum sum is chosen, but in one case (the second block row of the second example), the block with the minimum sum is chosen. This suggests the selection rule might depend on the row index.
5.  **Transformation Mechanism**: Once a 2x2 input block `[[a, b], [c, d]]` is selected, it undergoes a transformation to produce the 2x2 output block. The transformation appears to depend on the internal pattern or symmetry of the selected block (e.g., if rows are uniform, if columns are uniform, etc.). Several distinct transformation patterns are observed based on equalities between a, b, c, and d. A horizontal reflection is also used, potentially as a default or under specific conditions.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid Structure:
  - Property: Partitioned by white rows/columns.
  - Details: White separators create a macro-grid structure.
  - Objects: 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels within the macro-grid.

Output Grid Structure:
  - Property: Preserves input height and separator rows.
  - Property: Fixed width of 2 columns.
  - Objects: 2x2 blocks arranged vertically.

Relationship: Input -> Output
  - Action: Selection.
    - Input: The three 2x2 blocks in a specific block row of the input.
    - Rule: Based on comparing the sum of pixel values within each block.
      - General Case: Select block with maximum sum (rightmost tie-break).
      - Special Case: For the second block row (index 1), select block with minimum sum.
    - Output: One selected 2x2 input block per block row.
  - Action: Transformation.
    - Input: The selected 2x2 block, denoted `[[a, b], [c, d]]`.
    - Rule: Determined by the internal pattern/symmetry of the selected block:
      - If a=c and c=d: Horizontal Reflection -> `[[b, a], [d, c]]`.
      - Else if a=b and c=d: Pattern T_ca -> `[[c, a], [c, a]]`.
      - Else if a=c and b=d: Pattern T_bbaa -> `[[b, b], [a, a]]`.
      - Else if a=c: Pattern T_ccb -> `[[c, c], [c, b]]`.
      - Else if c=d: Pattern T_abab -> `[[a, b], [a, b]]`.
      - Else if a=b: Pattern T_abbc -> `[[a, b], [b, c]]`.
      - Else (Fallback): Horizontal Reflection -> `[[b, a], [d, c]]`.
    - Output: A transformed 2x2 block.
  - Action: Construction.
    - Input: Transformed 2x2 blocks for each block row.
    - Rule: Place each transformed block into the corresponding rows of the output grid, maintaining separator rows.

Key Concepts:
  - Grid partitioning
  - Object identification (2x2 blocks)
  - Selection based on aggregate property (sum) with row-dependent criteria (max/min)
  - Transformation based on local object properties (internal symmetry)
  - Hierarchical transformation rules
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the rows and columns composed entirely of white pixels (0) in the input grid. These act as separators.
2.  Identify the 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels located between the separators. Group these blocks by their "block row" (rows sharing the same horizontal separators). Assume there are three blocks per block row (Left, Middle, Right).
3.  Initialize an output grid with the same number of rows as the input and 2 columns, filled initially with a default color (e.g., white). Copy the white separator rows from the input to the output.
4.  Iterate through each block row, identified by its starting row index `r` and block row index `br` (starting from 0):
    a.  Get the three 2x2 blocks for this row: B_left, B_middle, B_right.
    b.  Calculate the sum of the four pixel values for each block: Sum_L, Sum_M, Sum_R.
    c.  Select one block (B_selected):
        i.  If this is the second block row (`br == 1`), select the block with the minimum sum. If there's a tie for the minimum, select the rightmost block among those tied.
        ii. Otherwise (for `br != 1`), select the block with the maximum sum. If there's a tie for the maximum, select the rightmost block among those tied.
    d.  Transform the selected block `B_selected = [[a, b], [c, d]]` into a 2x2 output block `O` based on the following prioritized rules:
        i.  If `a == c` and `c == d`, set `O = [[b, a], [d, c]]` (Horizontal Reflection).
        ii. Else if `a == b` and `c == d`, set `O = [[c, a], [c, a]]`.
        iii. Else if `a == c` and `b == d`, set `O = [[b, b], [a, a]]`.
        iv.
 Else if `a == c`, set `O = [[c, c], [c, b]]`.
        v.  Else if `c == d`, set `O = [[a, b], [a, b]]`.
        vi. Else if `a == b`, set `O = [[a, b], [b, c]]`.
        vii. Else (no specific pattern matched), set `O = [[b, a], [d, c]]` (Horizontal Reflection Fallback).
    e.  Place the resulting 2x2 output block `O` into the output grid at the corresponding rows `r` and `r+1`.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
