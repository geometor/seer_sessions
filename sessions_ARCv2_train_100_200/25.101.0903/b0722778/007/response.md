"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following logic:
1. Analyze Input Structure: Identify the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W). Locate the rows and columns consisting entirely of white pixels (0). These act as separators, dividing the grid into a macro-structure containing 2x2 blocks of non-white pixels (Input Blocks). Group these Input Blocks by their row position relative to the horizontal separators, forming Block Rows (indexed `br = 0, 1, 2, ...`). Note the starting row index `r` (0, 3, 6, ...) for each Block Row.
2. Initialize Output: Create a new grid (Output Grid) with dimensions H x 2, filled with white pixels (0).
3. Process Each Block Row: Iterate through each Block Row from `br = 0` up to the last complete row.
    a. Identify Blocks & Sums: For the current Block Row starting at grid row `r`, extract the Input Blocks located at column indices 0, 3, and 6 (if they exist within the grid bounds). Calculate the sum of the four pixel values for each valid Input Block found. Record each block, its sum, and its original block column index (0, 1, or 2).
    b. Select Block:
        i. If the block row index `br` is 1, find the minimum sum among the blocks in this row.
        ii. Otherwise (if `br` is not 1), find the maximum sum among the blocks in this row.
        iii. Identify all candidate blocks achieving the target (min or max) sum.
        iv. From the candidates, select the one with the largest original block column index (the rightmost one). Let the selected block be `[[a, b], [c, d]]`.
    c. Transform Selected Block: Apply the first matching rule from the following prioritized list (Hypothesis 15) to transform `[[a, b], [c, d]]` into the Output Block `O`:
        1. If `a` equals `c` AND `b` equals `d`, then `O = [[b, b], [a, a]]`.
        2. Else if `a` equals `b` AND `c` equals `d`, then `O = [[c, a], [c, a]]`.
        3. Else if `a` equals `c` AND `c` equals `d` (i.e., `a=c=d`), then `O = [[b, a], [d, c]]`.
        4. Else if `a` equals `c`, then `O = [[c, c], [c, b]]`.
        5. Else if `c` equals `d`, then `O = [[a, b], [a, b]]`.
        6. Else if `a` equals `b`, then `O = [[a, b], [b, c]]`.
        7. Else (no other rule matched), `O = [[b, a], [d, c]]`.
    d. Place Output Block: Copy the 2x2 Output Block `O` into the Output Grid, starting at row `r` and column 0.
4. Finalize Separators: Iterate through the Output Grid rows. For any row index `r` that corresponds to a separator row in the input structure (i.e., `r = 2, 5, 8, ...`), ensure the entire row in the Output Grid consists of white pixels (0).
5. Return Output: The completed Output Grid is the result.
6. Note on Failures: Be aware that this program does not correctly reproduce the expected output for Example 1, Block Row 0 (Mismatch) and Example 1, Block Row 1 (Anomaly), based on the provided training data. The program implements the pattern that best fits the majority (6/8) of the cases observed.
