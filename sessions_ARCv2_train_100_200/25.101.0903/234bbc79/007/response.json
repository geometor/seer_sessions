Initialize an empty set `columns_to_remove`.\n3. Find all gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.\n4. For each gray pixel (GP) at position (r, c):\n    a. Find its 8 direct neighbors.\n    b. Identify the distinct non-white (0), non-gray (5) colors among these direct neighbors.\n    c. Determine the 'unique_neighbor_color' (C): This is the color if exactly one such distinct color exists among neighbors; otherwise, it's considered undefined.\n    d. Determine the color the gray pixel will become ('new_color'): It becomes color C if C is defined, otherwise it becomes white (0). Store this change.\n    e. Check the Bridging Condition: The GP is considered \"bridging\" if it is adjacent (8-connectivity) to any neighbor pixel P whose color Cp is non-white, non-gray, AND (C is undefined OR Cp is different from C).\n    f. If the GP is bridging, add its column index `c` to the `columns_to_remove` set.\n5. Apply all stored color changes to the working grid.\n6. Construct the final output grid by selecting only the columns from the modified working grid whose indices are *not* in the `columns_to_remove` set, preserving the original relative order.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int, connectivity=8) -> list[tuple[int, int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets neighbours (value, row, col) of a pixel at (r, c), handling grid boundaries.\n    Supports 8-way (default) or 4-way connectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbours = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if connectivity == 8:\n        deltas = [(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)]\n    elif connectivity == 4:\n        deltas = [(-1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,0)]\n    else:\n        deltas = [] # Should not happen with current usage\n\n    for dr, dc in deltas:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        # Check grid boundaries\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbours.append((grid[nr, nc], nr, nc))\n    return neighbours\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the \"Bridging\" hypothesis for gray pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Handle empty input grid case\n    if input_array.size == 0:\n        return []\n\n    # Create a working copy to store modifications\n    working_grid = np.copy(input_array)\n    rows, cols = input_array.shape\n\n    # Initialize set to store indices of columns to be removed\n    columns_to_remove = set()\n    # Initialize list to store color modifications\n    modifications = [] # Store as (r, c, new_color)\n\n    # Find coordinates of all gray pixels first\n    gray_pixels_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_array[r, c] == 5:\n                gray_pixels_coords.append((r, c))\n\n    # Process each identified gray pixel\n    for r, c in gray_pixels_coords:\n        # Step 4a: Find neighbors\n        direct_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_array, r, c, connectivity=8)\n\n        # Step 4b: Identify distinct non-white/non-gray direct neighbor colors\n        colored_direct_neighbors = [n for n in direct_neighbors if n[0] != 0 and n[0] != 5]\n        distinct_direct_colors = set(n[0] for n in colored_direct_neighbors)\n\n        # Step 4c: Determine unique_neighbor_color (C)\n        unique_neighbor_color = -1 # Sentinel for undefined C\n        if len(distinct_direct_colors) == 1:\n            unique_neighbor_color = list(distinct_direct_colors)[0]\n        # Note: Case len > 1 was not observed, but is handled implicitly (C remains -1)\n\n        # Step 4d: Determine new_color and store modification\n        new_color = 0 # Default to white\n        if unique_neighbor_color != -1:\n            new_color = unique_neighbor_color\n        modifications.append((r, c, new_color))\n\n        # Step 4e: Check the Bridging Condition\n        is_bridging = False\n        for neighbor_val, _, _ in direct_neighbors:\n            # Check if neighbor P has color Cp != 0, != 5\n            if neighbor_val != 0 and neighbor_val != 5:\n                 # Check if C is undefined OR Cp is different from C\n                 if unique_neighbor_color == -1 or neighbor_val != unique_neighbor_color:\n                     is_bridging = True\n                     break # Found a bridging neighbor, no need to check others\n\n        # Step 4f: Mark column for removal if bridging\n        if is_bridging:\n            columns_to_remove.add(c)\n\n    # Step 5: Apply all collected color modifications to the working grid\n    for mod_r, mod_c, mod_color in modifications:\n        working_grid[mod_r, mod_c] = mod_color\n\n    # Step 6: Construct the final output grid by removing marked columns\n    # Create a list of column indices to keep\n    output_cols_indices = [c_idx for c_idx in range(cols) if c_idx not in columns_to_remove]\n\n    # Create the output array\n    if not output_cols_indices:\n         # If all columns are removed or no columns existed initially\n        output_grid_array = np.empty((rows, 0), dtype=int)\n    else:\n        # Select only the columns that are not marked for removal\n        output_grid_array = working_grid[:, output_cols_indices]\n\n    # Convert final numpy array back to list of lists for the return value\n    return output_grid_array.tolist()\n```"
