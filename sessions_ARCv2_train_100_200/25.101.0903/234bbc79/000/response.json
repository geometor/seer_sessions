            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The output grid is generally narrower than the input grid, implying some columns are removed.\n2.  **Key Element:** Gray pixels (color 5) appear to be crucial mediators of the transformation. They are present in the input but absent in the output.\n3.  **Colored Objects:** Non-gray, non-white pixels form colored objects or shapes. These objects seem mostly preserved in the output, but their shapes and positions can be altered by interactions with gray pixels.\n4.  **Gray Pixel Interactions:** The behavior depends on the colored neighbours (adjacent orthogonally or diagonally) of a gray pixel:\n    *   **Expansion:** If a gray pixel is adjacent to pixels of only *one* distinct color (let's call it C), the output grid seems to have color C at the location previously occupied by the gray pixel. (e.g., train\\_1: gray at (2,2) next to red becomes red; train\\_2: gray at (2,1) next to red becomes red).\n    *   **Interaction & Removal:** If a gray pixel is adjacent to pixels of *two different* distinct colors (C1 and C2), this seems to trigger a more complex interaction *and* the removal of the column containing that gray pixel. The gray pixel's original location becomes white in the output. The exact effect on C1 and C2 is complex, but seems to involve one color overwriting or expanding into the space near the other color or the gray pixel (e.g., train\\_1: gray at (1,4) between red and azure leads to column 4 removal and modification of azure shape; gray at (2,8) between azure and magenta leads to column 8 removal and modification of magenta shape).\n    *   **Isolation:** If a gray pixel has no colored neighbours, it likely just becomes white.\n5.  **Column Removal:** Columns containing gray pixels involved in the \"Interaction\" scenario (two different colored neighbours) are consistently removed from the grid.\n6.  **Final State:** The output contains the modified colored shapes, with gray pixels removed (either turned into a specific color, turned white, or removed with their column).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Initialize an empty list of modifications to apply (e.g., `[(row, col, new_color)]`).\n4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n5.  If the pixel `input[r][c]` is gray (5):\n    a.

(Hypothesized Interaction Effect - needs verification/refinement): The interaction potentially causes a swap or modification. For the first two distinct neighbours found, P1(C1) and P2(C2), additional modifications might be needed (e.g., change P1 to C2 and P2 to C1, or other complex shape adjustments based on the examples, which remain slightly ambiguous). *Initially, focus only on setting gray to white and marking column for removal.*\n6.  Apply all collected modifications to the working grid. (Ensure precedence if multiple modifications target the same pixel - typically, the last modification added might take effect, or interaction rules might override expansion rules if they target the same gray pixel).\n7.  Construct the output grid by selecting only the columns from the modified working grid whose index is *not* in the `columns_to_remove` set, preserving the order of the remaining columns."
