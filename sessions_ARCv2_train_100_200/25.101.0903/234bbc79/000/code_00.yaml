elements:
  - role: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Input and Output.
  - role: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - role: object
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color
      - shape
      - location
  - role: special_object
    value: Gray pixel (color 5)
    description: Acts as a catalyst or marker for transformations based on adjacent colored pixels. Not present in the output.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels (including gray) are adjacent if they share an edge or corner (8 neighbours).
  - type: gray_neighbourhood
    description: The set of non-white, non-gray pixels adjacent to a gray pixel.
    properties:
      - distinct_colors_count: The number of unique colors in the neighbourhood (0, 1, or >=2).
      - distinct_colors: The set of unique colors {C1, C2, ...}.

actions:
  - name: classify_gray_pixels
    description: Determine if a gray pixel is 'Expansion' (1 neighbour color), 'Interaction' (>=2 different neighbour colors), or 'Isolated' (0 neighbour colors).
  - name: mark_columns_for_removal
    description: Identify columns containing 'Interaction' gray pixels.
  - name: apply_expansion_rule
    description: For 'Expansion' gray pixels adjacent to color C, change the gray pixel's location to color C in a working copy of the grid.
  - name: apply_interaction_rule
    description: For 'Interaction' gray pixels, change the gray pixel's location to white (0) in the working copy. (Note: Further effects on neighbouring colors C1/C2 occur but are complex to define precisely from examples alone - potentially a swap, overwrite, or shape transformation triggered by the interaction).
  - name: apply_isolation_rule
    description: For 'Isolated' gray pixels, change the gray pixel's location to white (0) in the working copy.
  - name: remove_columns
    description: Construct the final output grid by excluding the columns marked for removal from the modified working copy.
