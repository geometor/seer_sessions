elements:
  - role: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Input and Output.
  - role: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - role: object
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
  - role: special_object
    value: Gray pixel (color 5)
    description: A marker pixel that transforms based on its neighbors and triggers column removal if it 'bridges' different colors.
    properties:
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - unique_neighbor_color (C): In these examples, each gray pixel has 0 or 1 distinct non-white, non-gray neighbor colors in its 8-neighbourhood. If 1, this is color C. If 0, C is effectively undefined or treated as white (0).
      - bridging_status: Boolean indicating if the gray pixel is adjacent (8-connectivity) to any pixel P whose color Cp is non-white, non-gray, AND Cp is different from C (or if C is undefined).

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they share an edge or corner (8 neighbours). Used to find neighbors for color transformation and bridging check.
  - type: color_difference
    description: Comparing the color of a gray pixel's direct neighbor (P) to the gray pixel's unique transforming color (C). Used in the bridging check.

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_pixels_and_properties
    description: Find all gray pixels (color 5). For each, determine its unique non-white/non-gray neighbor color C (if any) and determine its bridging_status.
  - name: determine_columns_to_remove
    description: Identify columns containing gray pixels whose bridging_status is True. Mark these columns for removal.
  - name: apply_color_transformation
    description: Create a working copy of the grid. Change each gray pixel at (r, c) to its determined unique neighbor color C (or to white (0) if C is undefined) in the working copy.
  - name: remove_columns
    description: Construct the final output grid by excluding the columns marked for removal from the modified working copy, preserving the relative order of the remaining columns.
