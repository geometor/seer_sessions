            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt using the \"strictly inside bounding box\" rule for column removal failed for most examples and did not replicate the expected output even for the example where column removal was correctly predicted (Example 4). This indicates the removal rule is incorrect.\n\nThe color transformation rule, where a gray pixel (GP) adopts the color C of its unique non-white/non-gray neighbor, appears consistent. The focus remains on finding the correct condition for column removal.\n\nA new hypothesis is proposed: **Bridging**. A column `c` containing a gray pixel GP is removed if GP is adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* pixel `P` whose color `Cp` is non-white, non-gray, AND `Cp` is different from the gray pixel's unique neighbor color `C`. If the GP only has neighbors that are white, gray, or color `C`, the column is kept.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Verify the Bridging hypothesis using `code_execution` on all training examples.\n2.  If the hypothesis holds, update the Facts (YAML) and Natural Language Program.\n3.  If it fails, further analysis of the relationship between gray pixels, their neighbors, and the overall structure will be required.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following code analyzes each gray pixel to determine its unique direct neighbor color `C` and checks the \"Bridging\" condition: Is the gray pixel adjacent to any pixel `P` with a color `Cp` such that `Cp` is not white, not gray, and `Cp != C`?\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
