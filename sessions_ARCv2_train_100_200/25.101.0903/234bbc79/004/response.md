**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because the hypothesis used for column removal (strictly inside the bounding box of non-white pixels) was not universally applicable across all training examples. While it worked for Example 4 and partially for Example 1, it failed for Examples 2 and 3. The code correctly implemented the color transformation rule (gray pixel adopts the color of its single unique non-white/non-gray neighbor) but incorrectly identified which columns to remove.

The core challenge remains identifying the precise contextual rule that determines whether a column containing a gray pixel should be removed. Several hypotheses were tested (neighbor count, specific neighbor color, position relative to neighbor, position relative to other components, bounding box variations), but none consistently explained all examples. Example 3, in particular, seems distinct, removing three columns where the tested rules predicted fewer or none.

Given the inconsistency, the strategy is to:
1.  Reaffirm the consistent observation: Gray pixels transform into the color of their unique non-white/non-gray neighbor.
2.  Re-adopt the "strictly inside bounding box" rule for column removal, as it was the only rule that perfectly explained at least one example (Example 4). This provides a concrete, implementable rule, even if known to be incomplete for the other examples.
3.  Clearly document this limitation in the analysis and natural language program.
4.  Refine the YAML and Natural Language Program based on this chosen (though imperfect) rule.

**Metrics**

*Code Execution Analysis:*
The following code analyzes the gray pixels and checks if they fall strictly inside the bounding box of all non-white pixels.


```python

            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a working copy of the input grid.
2.  Find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) that contain any non-white (0) pixels. This defines the bounding box. If there are no non-white pixels, the process stops, and the original grid (or an empty grid of the same dimensions) might be the output.
3.  Initialize an empty set called `columns_to_remove`.
4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the *original* input grid.
5.  If the pixel `input_grid[r][c]` is gray (5):
    a.  Find all adjacent (8 neighbors) pixels.
    b.  Identify the unique color `C` present among neighbors that are not white (0) and not gray (5). (Based on the examples, there is always exactly one such color `C`. If none were found, treat `C` as white (0)).
    c.  Modify the working copy: Set `working_grid[r][c] = C`.
    d.  Check the removal condition: If the gray pixel's position `(r, c)` is strictly inside the bounding box (i.e., `min_r < r < max_r` AND `min_c < c < max_c`), add the column index `c` to the `columns_to_remove` set. *(Note: This removal rule is known to be incomplete and only fully matches Example 4 of the training set).*
6.  Construct the final output grid by selecting columns from the `working_grid`. Include only those columns whose index `c` is *not* in the `columns_to_remove` set. Maintain the original relative order of the kept columns.
