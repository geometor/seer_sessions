            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the hypothesis used for column removal (strictly inside the bounding box of non-white pixels) was not universally applicable across all training examples. While it worked for Example 4 and partially for Example 1, it failed for Examples 2 and 3. The code correctly implemented the color transformation rule (gray pixel adopts the color of its single unique non-white/non-gray neighbor) but incorrectly identified which columns to remove.\n\nThe core challenge remains identifying the precise contextual rule that determines whether a column containing a gray pixel should be removed. Several hypotheses were tested (neighbor count, specific neighbor color, position relative to neighbor, position relative to other components, bounding box variations), but none consistently explained all examples. Example 3, in particular, seems distinct, removing three columns where the tested rules predicted fewer or none.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, the strategy is to:\n1.  Reaffirm the consistent observation: Gray pixels transform into the color of their unique non-white/non-gray neighbor.\n2.  Re-adopt the \"strictly inside bounding box\" rule for column removal, as it was the only rule that perfectly explained at least one example (Example 4). This provides a concrete, implementable rule, even if known to be incomplete for the other examples.\n3.  Clearly document this limitation in the analysis and natural language program.\n4.  Refine the YAML and Natural Language Program based on this chosen (though imperfect) rule.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*Code Execution Analysis:*\nThe following code analyzes the gray pixels and checks if they fall strictly inside the bounding box of all non-white pixels.\n\n"
