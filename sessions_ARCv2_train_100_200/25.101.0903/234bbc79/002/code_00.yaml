elements:
  - role: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Input and Output.
  - role: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
  - role: object
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color
      - shape
      - location
  - role: special_object
    value: Gray pixel (color 5)
    description: Acts as a marker for transformations. Always has exactly one distinct non-white/non-gray neighbor color (C) in its 8-neighbourhood in these examples. Its presence can trigger column removal based on context.
    properties:
      - neighbor_color: The single distinct non-white/non-gray color C adjacent to it.
      - context: Positional relationship relative to other gray pixels and colored objects (e.g., 'internal' vs 'external'). # Context rule needs refinement

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they share an edge or corner (8 neighbours).
  - type: gray_neighbourhood
    description: The set of non-white, non-gray pixels adjacent to a gray pixel. Always contains pixels of only one distinct color C.

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_pixels
    description: Find all pixels with color 5.
  - name: determine_neighbor_color
    description: For each gray pixel, find the unique color C of its non-white/non-gray neighbors.
  - name: determine_context_and_removal
    description: For each gray pixel at (r, c), assess its context (e.g., 'internal' vs 'external'). If 'internal', mark column c for removal. # Specific logic for context TBD
  - name: apply_color_transformation
    description: In a working copy of the grid, change each gray pixel (r, c) to its determined neighbor color C.
  - name: remove_columns
    description: Construct the final output grid by excluding the columns marked for removal from the modified working copy.
