task_context:
  grid_size:
    input: [3, 11]
    output: [3, 11]
  components:
    - object: left_block
      location: input grid, rows 0-2, columns 0-2
      size: [3, 3]
      content: variable colors (non-white, non-gray)
    - object: separator_1
      location: input grid, rows 0-2, column 3
      size: [3, 1]
      content: all gray (5)
    - object: middle_block_placeholder
      location: input grid, rows 0-2, columns 4-6
      size: [3, 3]
      content: all white (0)
    - object: separator_2
      location: input grid, rows 0-2, column 7
      size: [3, 1]
      content: all gray (5)
    - object: right_block_placeholder
      location: input grid, rows 0-2, columns 8-10
      size: [3, 3]
      content: all white (0)
transformation:
  - action: copy
    source: input grid, columns 0-3 and column 7
    destination: output grid, same locations
  - action: rotate
    source_object: left_block
    angle: 90 degrees clockwise
    result: middle_block_content
  - action: place
    source: middle_block_content
    destination: output grid, rows 0-2, columns 4-6 (replaces middle_block_placeholder)
  - action: rotate
    source_object: left_block
    angle: 180 degrees
    result: right_block_content
  - action: place
    source: right_block_content
    destination: output grid, rows 0-2, columns 8-10 (replaces right_block_placeholder)
relationships:
  - The content of the middle block in the output grid is determined by a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the left_block from the input grid.
  - The content of the right block in the output grid is determined by a 180-degree rotation of the left_block from the input grid.
  - The left_block and the gray separators from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
