task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - height_constant: True # Grid height remains the same between input and output.
    - width_variable: True # Grid width changes, specifically decreases.
    - background_color: 0 # White '0' is the background color.
  objects:
    - type: contiguous_pixels # Objects are formed by connected pixels of the same non-background color.
    - behavior: preserved_relative_shape # The internal shape of objects seems mostly preserved.
actions:
  - name: identify_empty_columns
    input: input_grid
    description: Find all columns in the input grid that consist entirely of the background color (0).
  - name: remove_columns
    input: input_grid, empty_column_indices
    output: intermediate_grid
    description: Create a new grid structure by excluding the identified empty columns. The width is reduced.
  - name: rearrange_pixels_vertically
    input: intermediate_grid_structure, original_pixel_data
    output: output_grid
    description: Place the non-background pixels from the original non-empty columns into the new grid structure. The final row position of each pixel is determined by a rule that shifts pixels vertically compared to their original row. The exact rule for this vertical shift is complex and not immediately obvious (potentially depending on color, original position, or column context).
relationships:
  - type: column_mapping
    description: A mapping exists between the indices of non-empty columns in the input and the column indices in the output grid.
  - type: vertical_shift
    description: Non-background pixels undergo a vertical shift (change in row index, possibly modulo the grid height) during the transformation. The magnitude and direction of the shift appear dependent on factors yet to be fully determined (e.g., color, column).
