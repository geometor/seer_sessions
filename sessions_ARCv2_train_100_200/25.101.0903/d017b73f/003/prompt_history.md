**Perception**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. Key observations across the examples:
1.  The height of the grid remains unchanged in all examples.
2.  The width of the grid decreases.
3.  The transformation involves removing certain columns from the input grid.
4.  The columns removed appear to be those composed entirely of the background color (white '0').
5.  After removing the empty columns, the content (non-background pixels) from the remaining columns is placed into the new grid.
6.  The vertical position (row) of the pixels in the output grid is often different from their original row in the input grid. This vertical shift seems to be the most complex part of the transformation. It does not appear to be simple gravity, nor a consistent shift based solely on color or original column index. It might depend on the color of the pixel, or perhaps the structure/grouping of the remaining columns.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - height_constant: True # Grid height remains the same between input and output.

    description: Place the non-background pixels from the original non-empty columns into the new grid structure. The final row position of each pixel is determined by a rule that shifts pixels vertically compared to their original row. The exact rule for this vertical shift is complex and not immediately obvious (potentially depending on color, original position, or column context).
relationships:
  - type: column_mapping
    description: A mapping exists between the indices of non-empty columns in the input and the column indices in the output grid.
  - type: vertical_shift
    description: Non-background pixels undergo a vertical shift (change in row index, possibly modulo the grid height) during the transformation. The magnitude and direction of the shift appear dependent on factors yet to be fully determined (e.g., color, column).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all columns in the input grid that contain only the background color (white '0'). Let these be the "empty columns".
3.  Determine the number of non-empty columns. This will be the width of the output grid. The height remains the same as the input grid.
4.  Create a mapping from the original index of each non-empty column to its corresponding index in the output grid (maintaining relative order).
5.  Create a new output grid of the calculated dimensions, initialized with the background color.
6.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
7.  If the pixel `Input[r, c]` is not the background color AND column `c` is not an empty column:
    a.  Determine the new column index `c_new` using the mapping created in step 4.
    b.  Determine the new row index `r_new`. This requires applying a vertical shift rule to the original row `r`. The shift rule appears complex: based on observations, it might depend on the pixel's color (e.g., in the examples with height 3, Red seems to have 0 shift, Magenta and Blue often -1 shift, Azure seems to shift differently). Calculate `r_new = (r + shift_amount) mod grid_height`.
    c.  Place the color `Input[r, c]` into the output grid at position `(r_new, c_new)`. Resolve potential overlaps if necessary (e.g., last pixel mapped wins).
8.  Return the populated output grid.

*(Self-correction note: The exact vertical shift rule (step 7b) is the main uncertainty. It needs further analysis or refinement based on more examples or insights. The current best guess involves a color-dependent shift, but it wasn't perfectly consistent across all examples and colors tested during analysis.)*

The transformation involves two main steps:
1. Column Filtering: Identify and remove columns from the input grid that consist entirely of the background color (0).
2. Pixel Mapping with Vertical Shift: Map the pixels from the remaining (non-empty) columns to a new output grid. The relative horizontal order of these columns is preserved. During this mapping, pixels undergo a vertical shift (change in row index). The rule for this shift, based on analysis of Example 1 Column 6, appears to be dependent on the *new* column index (`c_new`) in the output grid. Specifically, a pixel at original position `(r, c)` moves to `(r_new, c_new)` where `c_new` is the mapped column index and `r_new = (r - c_new) % H`, with `H` being the grid height. Pixels are processed column by column, then row by row within the column; if multiple input pixels map to the same output cell, the one from the highest original row index overwrites others.

**General Assessment**

The previous analysis correctly identified the primary mechanics of the transformation: removing empty columns and preserving the relative horizontal order of the remaining columns. The grid height remains constant. The code implemented this column removal correctly, resulting in output grids of the correct dimensions.

However, the vertical rearrangement of pixels within the remaining columns was modeled incorrectly. The initial hypothesis for the vertical shift (`r_new = (r - c_new) % H`) failed across all examples. A new analysis suggests that each non-empty column from the input is cyclically shifted vertically *as a whole* before being placed in the output grid. The amount of this shift appears to depend on the *original column index* (`c`) of the input column.

**Strategy**

1.  **Refine Shift Rule:** Focus on finding the correct rule that determines the vertical shift amount for each column. The most promising candidate rule identified through manual analysis of Example 1 is `shift = c // H` (original column index integer divided by grid height), which simplifies to `shift = c // 3` for these examples where H=3.
2.  **Test New Rule:** Although manual checks showed this rule fails for Examples 2, 3, and 4, it's the best candidate identified so far. It should be implemented and tested programmatically. The failures on other examples suggest this rule might be incomplete or interact with other factors not yet identified.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the Natural language program to reflect the column-based cyclic shift mechanism and the candidate rule `shift = c // 3`.

**Metrics**

Let's re-analyze the examples based on the new hypothesis: remove empty columns, then apply a vertical cyclic shift `S = c // 3` to each remaining column `c` before placing it at `c_new`.

**Example 1:**
*   Input H=3, W=11. Non-empty `c = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]`. `c_new = [0..8]`.
*   Shifts `S = c // 3`: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
*   Applying these shifts to the corresponding input columns correctly reproduces the output grid. (e.g., Col `c=6`, Input=`[8,8,0]`, Shift= `6//3=2`. Shifted=`[8,0,8]`. Wait, previous analysis said shift=1 worked. `c=6`, `c_new=5`. `I[0,6]=8->O[2,5]`. `I[1,6]=8->O[1,5]`. Needs `(0+S)%3=2` and `(1+S)%3=1`. `S=2` works! Let's recheck previous analysis). Ah, the previous analysis `c_new//3` was `5//3=1`. The current analysis `c//3` is `6//3=2`. So `shift = c // 3` seems correct for Ex 1. Let's recheck `c=8`: `shift=8//3=2`. Input `[0,0,6]`. Shifted `[0,6,0]`. Matches `O[:,6]`. Yes, `shift=c//3` works for Ex1.

**Example 2:**
*   Input H=3, W=11. Non-empty `c = [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]`. `c_new = [0..7]`.
*   Shifts `S = c // 3`: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. Modulo 3: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0]`.
*   Expected Output requires shifts: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
*   Result: `shift = c // 3` **fails** for this example.

**Example 3:**
*   Input H=3, W=11. Non-empty `c = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`. `c_new = [0..7]`.
*   Shifts `S = c // 3`: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`. Modulo 3: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]`.
*   Expected Output requires shifts: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   Result: `shift = c // 3` **fails** for this example.

**Example 4:**
*   Input H=3, W=9. Non-empty `c = [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`. `c_new = [0..6]`.
*   Shifts `S = c // 3`: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.
*   Expected Output requires shifts: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   Result: `shift = c // 3` **fails** for this example.

    input: original_column_index_c, grid_height_H
    output: shift_amount_S
    # description: Calculate the vertical shift amount S for the column based on its original index c. Candidate rule: S = c // H. (Note: This rule works for Ex1 but failed manual checks for Ex2,3,4).
    description: Calculate the vertical shift amount S for the column based on its original index `c`. The rule `S = c // 3` (since H=3) appears to be correct for the first example but incorrect for others, suggesting the rule is more complex or context-dependent.
  - name: apply_vertical_cyclic_shift
    input: column_data, shift_amount_S, grid_height_H
    output: shifted_column_data
    description: Shift the elements of a column vertically and cyclically by S positions. Pixel at row `r` moves to `(r + S) % H`.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    input: list_of_shifted_non_empty_columns, H, W_out
    output: output_grid
    description: Assemble the output grid by placing the shifted non-empty columns in their new positions (`c_new`).
relationships:
  - type: column_mapping
    description: A direct mapping exists between the original index `c` of non-empty columns and their new index `c_new` in the output grid, preserving order. `c_new` is the 0-based index in the sequence of non-empty columns.
  - type: vertical_shift_rule
    # description: The vertical cyclic shift amount `S` applied to a column seems determined by its original index `c` and the grid height `H`. Candidate rule: `S = c // H`. This needs further validation as it doesn't hold for all examples.
    description: The vertical cyclic shift amount `S` applied to a column appears related to its original index `c`. The rule `S = c // 3` works for Example 1 but not others. The true rule remains elusive and might depend on other factors.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid of height `H` and width `W_in`.
2.  Identify the indices `c` of all columns that contain only the background color (0). These are the "empty columns".
3.  Identify the indices `c` of all columns that contain at least one non-background pixel. These are the "non-empty columns". Let the ordered list of these indices be `C_non_empty`.
4.  Determine the output grid dimensions: height `H` (same as input), width `W_out` = number of non-empty columns.
5.  Create a mapping from the original index `c` in `C_non_empty` to its new index `c_new` (from 0 to `W_out - 1`).
6.  Create a new output grid of size `H` x `W_out`, initialized with the background color.
7.  For each original non-empty column index `c` in `C_non_empty`:
    a.  Get the corresponding new column index `c_new` from the mapping.
    b.  Extract the pixel data of the input column `c`.
    c.  Determine the vertical cyclic shift amount `S` for this column. **Candidate Rule:** Calculate `S = c // H` (integer division of original column index by grid height). *_(Self-correction Note: This rule worked for Example 1 but failed manual checks on other examples, indicating it's likely incorrect or incomplete. The true rule needs further investigation)._*
    d.  Create the shifted column data: For each pixel value `p` at row `r` in the input column `c`, its new row is `r_new = (r + S) % H`.
    e.  Place the shifted column data into the output grid at column `c_new`.
8.  Return the populated output grid.
