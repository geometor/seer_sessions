    description: >
      Calculate the vertical cyclic shift amount S for the column.
      The rule is complex and appears context-dependent (differs between examples).
      - For Example 1: S = c_new // H matches the required shifts [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2].
      - For Example 2: Required shifts are S = [0,0,2,2,1,1,1,1]. Rule S = c_new // H fails.
      - For Example 3: Required shifts are S = [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. Rule S = c_new // H fails.
      - For Example 4: Required shifts are S = [0,0,2,2,0,0,0]. Rule S = c_new // H fails.
      A general rule covering all examples has not been identified.

  - type: column_mapping
    description: A direct, order-preserving mapping exists between the original index `c` of non-empty columns and their new index `c_new` in the output grid. `c_new` = position in the sequence of non-empty columns.
  - type: vertical_shift_rule # <--- Key uncertainty here
    description: >
      Each non-empty column undergoes a vertical cyclic shift `S` before being placed in the output grid.
      The amount `S` is currently best described on a per-example basis, as no single rule fits all cases.
      The rule `S = c_new // H` correctly describes Example 1 but fails for others. The factors determining the correct shift in other examples remain unidentified.
