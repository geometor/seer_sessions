**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size**: All training examples have a 5x7 input grid and a 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Color**: Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of a single non-white color (C). The output grid contains only white pixels (0) and pixels of the same non-white color C.
3.  **Transformation**: The transformation appears to compress or summarize the spatial distribution of the non-white pixels from the 5x7 input grid into a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Pattern**: The output grid represents whether the non-white color C is present in specific zones of the input grid. These zones correspond to the corners, edges, and center of the input grid, mapped to the 3x3 output cells.
5.  **Zone Mapping**:
    *   The four corner cells of the input grid map to the four corner cells of the output grid.
    *   The top edge cells (excluding corners) of the input map to the top-middle cell of the output.
    *   The bottom edge cells (excluding corners) of the input map to the bottom-middle cell of the output.
    *   The left edge cells (excluding corners) of the input map to the middle-left cell of the output.
    *   The right edge cells (excluding corners) of the input map to the middle-right cell of the output.
    *   The interior cells of the input map to the center cell of the output.
6.  **Rule**: If any pixel within a specific input zone has the non-white color C, the corresponding output cell is set to C. Otherwise, it remains white (0).

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Summarize pixel presence in zones
Input_Grid_Size: ثابت (5x7)
Output_Grid_Size: ثابت (3x3)
Colors:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Foreground: One non-white color (C), variable across examples but constant within an example.
Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixels
  - Property: Color (White or C)
  - Property: Location (row, col)
Output_Objects:
  - Type: Pixels
  - Property: Color (White or C)
  - Property: Location (row', col') in a 3x3 grid
Transformation: Zoning and Presence Check
Input_Zones (for 5x7 grid):
  - Zone_TL (maps to Output[0,0]): Input[0,0]
  - Zone_T  (maps to Output[0,1]): Input[0, 1:6] (row 0, cols 1 through 5)
  - Zone_TR (maps to Output[0,2]): Input[0,6]
  - Zone_L  (maps to Output[1,0]): Input[1:4, 0] (rows 1 through 3, col 0)
  - Zone_C  (maps to Output[1,1]): Input[1:4, 1:6] (rows 1 through 3, cols 1 through 5)
  - Zone_R  (maps to Output[1,2]): Input[1:4, 6] (rows 1 through 3, col 6)
  - Zone_BL (maps to Output[2,0]): Input[4,0]
  - Zone_B  (maps to Output[2,1]): Input[4, 1:6] (row 4, cols 1 through 5)
  - Zone_BR (maps to Output[2,2]): Input[4,6]
Rule:
  - For each zone in the input grid:
    - Determine if any pixel within that zone has the foreground color C.
    - If yes, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to color C.
    - If no, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to white (0).
Relationship: The output grid is a 3x3 summary indicating the presence of the foreground color in 9 distinct spatial zones of the 5x7 input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the 5x7 input grid.
2.  Identify the non-white foreground color (C) present in the input grid.
3.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Define 9 spatial zones within the 5x7 input grid corresponding to the 9 cells of the 3x3 output grid:
    *   Zone (0,0): Input cell (0,0).
    *   Zone (0,1): Input cells in row 0, columns 1 to 5.
    *   Zone (0,2): Input cell (0,6).
    *   Zone (1,0): Input cells in column 0, rows 1 to 3.
    *   Zone (1,1): Input cells in rows 1 to 3 and columns 1 to 5.
    *   Zone (1,2): Input cells in column 6, rows 1 to 3.
    *   Zone (2,0): Input cell (4,0).
    *   Zone (2,1): Input cells in row 4, columns 1 to 5.
    *   Zone (2,2): Input cell (4,6).
5.  Iterate through each of the 9 zones defined in step 4. For each zone:
    *   Check if any pixel within that zone in the input grid has the foreground color C.
    *   If such a pixel is found, set the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid (e.g., Zone (0,1) corresponds to Output[0,1]) to the foreground color C.
6.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
