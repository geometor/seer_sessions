            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core components (floor, bars) and the actions (stacking, right-alignment). However, it failed on all examples because the rule used to determine the *order* of stacking was incorrect. The previous assumption was that bars stacked based on their original vertical position (lowest first). The results show this is wrong.\n\nExample 1 shows Red (row 2) below Green (row 4).\nExample 3 shows Red (row 0) below Yellow (row 1).\nExample 2 shows a complex order: Gray (row 4), Magenta (row 6), Yellow (row 7), Blue (row 2), Red (row 0), Green (row 1) from bottom to top.\n\nThis implies the sorting key is not simply the original row index. Comparing the bar lengths to the stacking order across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: bars are stacked primarily based on their length in *descending* order (longest bars at the bottom), and secondarily by their original row index in *ascending* order (if lengths are equal, the bar from the higher row goes first).\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Verify the bar identification (color, length, original row) is correct for all examples.\n2.  Confirm the new sorting hypothesis (length descending, then row ascending) matches the required stacking order in all examples.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this corrected sorting rule.\n4.  The subsequent coder phase will need to implement this new sorting logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
