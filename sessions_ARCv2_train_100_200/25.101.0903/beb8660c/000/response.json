The background is white (0).\n\nThe transformation involves rearranging the colored bars located above the azure line. These bars effectively \"fall\" downwards towards the azure line. As they fall, they also shift horizontally to align with the right edge of the grid. They stack upon the azure line (or upon each other) in a specific order: the bar that was originally lowest (closest to the azure line) ends up at the bottom of the stack (directly above the azure line), the next lowest bar stacks on top of that, and so on, up to the bar that was originally highest, which ends up at the top of the stack. The azure line itself remains unchanged in its position. The final output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white except for the unchanged azure line and the rearranged, right-aligned, stacked bars.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the row index of the horizontal azure (8) line (the 'floor') in the input grid.\n3.  Copy this azure line from the input grid to the exact same location in the output grid.\n4.  Scan the input grid rows *above* the azure line to identify all distinct horizontal, contiguous segments (bars) of non-white, non-azure colors. For each bar found, record its color, its length (number of cells), and its original row index.\n5.  Create a list of these identified bars.\n6.  Sort this list of bars based on their original row index in *descending* order (i.e., the bar with the highest row index, which was originally lowest/closest to the floor, comes first).\n7.  Determine the width of the grid.\n8.  Set a variable `current_placement_row` to be the row index immediately above the azure line (`floor_row_index - 1`).\n9.  Iterate through the sorted list of bars (from lowest original bar to highest):\n    a.  Calculate the starting column index for the current bar to make it align with the right edge: `start_column = grid_width - bar_length`.\n    b.  Place the current bar onto the output grid at row `current_placement_row`, spanning columns from `start_column` to `grid_width - 1`, using the bar's color.\n    c.  Decrement `current_placement_row` by 1 to prepare for placing the next bar on top.\n10. The resulting output grid contains the stacked, right-aligned bars above the unchanged azure floor."
