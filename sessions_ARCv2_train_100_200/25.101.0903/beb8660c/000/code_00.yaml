    elements:
      type: horizontal_segment
      properties:
        color: non-white, non-azure
        location: various rows above the floor
        length: variable
        contiguity: horizontal

actions:
  - name: identify_bars
    input: input_grid
    target: bars above the floor
    output: list_of_bars (with color, length, original_row_index)
  - name: sort_bars
    input: list_of_bars
    criteria: original_row_index (descending - lowest first)
    output: sorted_list_of_bars
  - name: place_bars
    input: sorted_list_of_bars, grid_width, floor_row_index
    target: output_grid
    process: iterate through sorted bars, placing each one aligned to the right edge, stacking vertically upwards from the floor row.
  - name: copy_floor
    input: input_grid floor
    target: output_grid
    process: place the floor line in the same position in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Bars are initially located above the floor.
  - type: order
    description: The final vertical stacking order of bars is the reverse of their initial vertical order.
  - type: alignment
    description: In the output, bars are aligned to the right edge of the grid.

grid_properties:
  - width: constant between input and output
  - height: constant between input and output
