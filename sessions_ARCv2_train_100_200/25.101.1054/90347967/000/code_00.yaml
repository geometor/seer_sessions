Transformation: Geometric

Input Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: variable (height H, width W)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains patterns or objects made of non-white pixels

Output Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: same as input (H, W)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: transformed version of input content

Relationships & Actions (based on train_1, train_2):
  - rule: Rotate the entire input grid by 180 degrees.
  - pixel_mapping: Each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) moves to output coordinate (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c).
  - color_preservation: The color of the pixel is preserved during the move.
  - completeness: All pixels participate in the rotation.

Discrepancy:
  - train_3: The input-output pair does not follow the 180-degree rotation rule observed in train_1 and train_2. The transformation appears different and more complex, potentially involving reflections or translations relative to specific features or bounding boxes, but no single alternative rule fits all three examples clearly. The 180-degree rotation remains the most plausible hypothesis based on the first two examples.
