Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions within each example pair. The dimensions vary across examples (3x3, 7x9, 9x9).
2.  **Colors:** The set of colors used and the count of pixels for each non-white color remain the same between the input and output grids. The background color is white (0).
3.  **Transformation:** The spatial arrangement of the non-white pixels changes from input to output.
    *   In `train_1` (3x3 grid), the pattern of non-white pixels appears to be rotated 180 degrees. A pixel at (r, c) in the input moves to (2-r, 2-c) in the output. For example, input(0,0)=Magenta(6) moves to output(2,2)=Magenta(6). Input(2,1)=Blue(1) moves to output(0,1)=Blue(1).
    *   In `train_2` (7x9 grid), the pattern also appears to be rotated 180 degrees around the grid's center. A pixel at (r, c) in the input moves to (6-r, 8-c) in the output. For example, input(3,2)=Green(3) moves to output(3,6)=Green(3). Input(5,1)=Blue(1) moves to output(1,7)=Blue(1).
    *   In `train_3` (9x9 grid), the transformation *does not* appear to be a simple 180-degree rotation of the entire grid, unlike the first two examples. For instance, input(4,0)=Red(2) would map to (4,8) under 180-degree rotation, but the output has Red(2) at (0,6). This specific example seems inconsistent with the pattern observed in the first two.

4.  **Hypothesis:** Based on the first two examples, the most likely transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the entire input grid. The discrepancy in the third example is noted but, lacking further examples, the simplest consistent rule covering the majority (2 out of 3) examples is the 180-degree rotation.

**Facts**


```yaml
Transformation: Geometric

Input Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: variable (height H, width W)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: contains patterns or objects made of non-white pixels

Output Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: same as input (H, W)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - content: transformed version of input content

Relationships & Actions (based on train_1, train_2):
  - rule: Rotate the entire input grid by 180 degrees.
  - pixel_mapping: Each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) moves to output coordinate (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c).
  - color_preservation: The color of the pixel is preserved during the move.
  - completeness: All pixels participate in the rotation.

Discrepancy:
  - train_3: The input-output pair does not follow the 180-degree rotation rule observed in train_1 and train_2. The transformation appears different and more complex, potentially involving reflections or translations relative to specific features or bounding boxes, but no single alternative rule fits all three examples clearly. The 180-degree rotation remains the most plausible hypothesis based on the first two examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions (H x W), initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each row `r` from 0 to H-1:
4.  For each column `c` from 0 to W-1:
5.  Get the color value `v` from the input grid at position (`r`, `c`).
6.  Calculate the target position in the output grid: `target_r = H - 1 - r`, `target_c = W - 1 - c`.
7.  Place the color value `v` into the output grid at position (`target_r`, `target_c`).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
