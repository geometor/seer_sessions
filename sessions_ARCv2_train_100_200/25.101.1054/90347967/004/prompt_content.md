Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Rotates the input grid by 180 degrees around its center. Each pixel at input 
coordinate (r, c) moves to the output coordinate (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c), 
where H is the height and W is the width of the grid. The color of the pixel 
is preserved. This rule accurately describes the transformation for the first 
two training examples. Note that the third training example's provided output 
does not match the result of this transformation.
"""
