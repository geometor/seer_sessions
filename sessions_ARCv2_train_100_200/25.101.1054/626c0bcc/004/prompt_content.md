```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels. 
White pixels remain unchanged. 
Azure pixels are recolored to blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4).

The transformation rule appears related to the local 2x2 pattern starting at 
each azure pixel (r, c), defined as [[input[r,c], input[r,c+1]], 
[input[r+1,c], input[r+1,c+1]]] (out-of-bounds treated as white/0).

However, analysis shows that the same 2x2 pattern can map to different output 
colors in different contexts, indicating this simple rule is insufficient. 
The exact rule resolving this ambiguity is unknown and requires more context 
(e.g., connected component shape, larger neighborhood).

This implementation uses a fixed mapping based on the first observed output for 
each 2x2 pattern across the training examples as a placeholder, but it is 
*known* that this will not produce the correct output for all cases due to 
the identified conflicts.
