*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial attempt to map the 2x2 neighborhood pattern directly to an output color failed, as confirmed by the execution results showing mismatches on all training examples. Further analysis revealed that the same 2x2 input pattern can indeed map to different output colors depending on its context within the grid or connected component. A subsequent hypothesis combining the 8-way neighbor count with the 2x2 pattern also proved insufficient, as conflicts persisted. This indicates the transformation rule is more complex and likely involves recognizing higher-level features, potentially related to the overall shape of the connected component the azure pixel belongs to, or perhaps a larger neighborhood analysis (e.g., 3x3). The most reliable observation so far is that azure pixels with 7 or 8 azure neighbors consistently map to blue (1). For pixels with fewer neighbors, the rule remains elusive. The strategy is to acknowledge the insufficiency of the tested hypotheses and describe the transformation in terms of the knowns (pixel processing, color mapping) and the unknowns (the exact contextual factor that resolves the ambiguity).

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    The previous execution attempt used a placeholder mapping based on the first observation of each 2x2 pattern. As expected, this failed:
    *   Example 1: 11 incorrect pixels (Score: 44.90%)
    *   Example 2: 13 incorrect pixels (Score: 53.06%)
    *   Example 3: 11 incorrect pixels (Score: 44.90%)
    Code execution was used to systematically check mappings:
    1.  Mapping based *only* on the 2x2 pattern showed multiple conflicts (e.g., pattern `(8,0,8,8)` mapped to outputs 2 and 4 in Example 1).
    2.  Mapping based *only* on the 8-way neighbor count showed ambiguity (e.g., 3 neighbors mapped to outputs 1, 2, 3, and 4 across examples).
    3.  Mapping based on the *combination* of (Neighbor Count, 2x2 Pattern) *still* showed conflicts (e.g., key `(3, (8, 0, 0, 0))` mapped to outputs 2 and 3).
    This confirms that the determining factors include more than just these two local properties.

          - if input pixel is azure (8) and has 7 or 8 azure neighbors (8-way), output is blue (1).
        ambiguity: For azure pixels with 1 to 6 neighbors, the rule determining the specific output color (1, 2, 3, or 4) involves context beyond the neighbor count and the immediate 2x2 pattern.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.
    3.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is white (0), the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` remains white (0).
    4.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is azure (8):
        a.  Count the number of adjacent (including diagonals, 8-way) azure neighbors (`NumNeighbors`).
        b.  If `NumNeighbors` is 7 or 8, set the output pixel `output[r, c]` to blue (1).
        c.  If `NumNeighbors` is less than 7:
            i.  Examine the local 2x2 pattern starting at `(r, c)`, treating out-of-bounds areas as white (0). Let this be `Pattern2x2`.
            ii. Determine the output color `C` (from 1, 2, 3, 4) based on a rule that considers `NumNeighbors`, `Pattern2x2`, and potentially other contextual factors (like the overall shape of the connected component the pixel belongs to, or a larger neighborhood pattern) to resolve the ambiguities observed when using only `NumNeighbors` and `Pattern2x2`.
            iii. *(The precise rule for resolving these ambiguities based on the additional context is not yet fully determined from the examples).*
            iv. Set the output pixel `output[r, c]` to the determined color `C`.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
