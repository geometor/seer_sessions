White pixels remain unchanged. Azure pixels \nare recolored to blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4).\n\nThe transformation rule depends on the context of each azure pixel:\n1.  If an azure pixel has 7 or 8 azure neighbors (8-way adjacency), it becomes \n    blue (1).\n2.  If an azure pixel has fewer than 7 azure neighbors, its color depends on \n    a complex rule involving its local 2x2 pattern (top-left, top-right, \n    bottom-left, bottom-right, with out-of-bounds treated as white/0) and \n    potentially other context (like connected component shape or larger \n    neighborhood). \n3.  Analysis shows that the 2x2 pattern alone, the neighbor count alone, or \n    their simple combination is insufficient to uniquely determine the output \n    color for cases with < 7 neighbors, as conflicts arise in the training data.\n\nThis implementation includes the known rule for 7/8 neighbors. For other cases, \nit uses a placeholder mapping based on the first observed output for each \n2x2 pattern, acknowledging that this part of the logic is incomplete and will \nnot produce the correct output for all ambiguous cases.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef count_neighbors(grid: np.ndarray, r: int, c: int, target_color: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of neighbors (8-way adjacency) of a specific color \n    around a given cell (r, c).
