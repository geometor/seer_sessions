*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. The white pixels remain unchanged. The azure pixels are replaced by one of four colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4). The core challenge lies in determining the rule that dictates which of the four colors replaces a specific azure pixel. The transformation appears to depend on the local neighborhood of each azure pixel, specifically the pattern of other azure pixels within a 2x2 square starting at the pixel's location.

*   **Facts:**

        details: Each azure pixel in the input is assigned an output color based on the configuration of azure pixels within the 2x2 square for which the input pixel is the top-left corner. White pixels remain white.
    color_mapping_rule (hypothesis):
      - pattern: '[[8,0],[0,0]]' -> color: 3 # green
      - pattern: '[[8,8],[0,0]]' -> color: 1 # blue
      - pattern: '[[8,0],[8,0]]' -> color: 2 # red
      - pattern: '[[8,0],[0,8]]' -> color: 3 # green
      - pattern: '[[8,8],[8,0]]' -> color: 3 # green
      - pattern: '[[8,8],[0,8]]' -> color: 2 # red
      - pattern: '[[8,0],[8,8]]' -> color: 4 # yellow
      - pattern: '[[8,8],[8,8]]' -> color: 1 # blue
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
    2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid, from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
    3.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is white (0), skip to the next pixel.
    4.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is azure (8):
        a.  Examine the 2x2 neighborhood block starting at `(r, c)`. Consider pixels outside the grid boundaries as white (0). Let this block be `P = [[input[r,c], input[r,c+1]], [input[r+1,c], input[r+1,c+1]]]`.
        b.  Determine the output color `C` based on the pattern `P` according to the following rules:
            *   If `P` is `[[8,0],[0,0]]`, `C` is 3 (green).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,8],[0,0]]`, `C` is 1 (blue).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,0],[8,0]]`, `C` is 2 (red).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,0],[0,8]]`, `C` is 3 (green).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,8],[8,0]]`, `C` is 3 (green).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,8],[0,8]]`, `C` is 2 (red).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,0],[8,8]]`, `C` is 4 (yellow).
            *   If `P` is `[[8,8],[8,8]]`, `C` is 1 (blue).
            *   (Handle patterns not starting with 8 if necessary, though step 4 ensures `input[r,c]` is 8).
        c.  Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[r, c]` to the determined color `C`.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial hypothesis, based primarily on the first training example, correctly identified that azure (8) pixels are transformed based on their 2x2 local neighborhood pattern. However, the specific mapping rules derived were incorrect, leading to failures on all three training examples. The high number of incorrect pixels indicates that several pattern-to-color mappings were wrongly assumed. The strategy is to systematically compare the input 2x2 patterns with the *expected* output colors for *every* azure pixel across all three training examples to derive the definitive mapping rules.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    We need to analyze the discrepancies between the `expected_output` and the `transformed_output` for each example to correct the `pattern_map`.

    *   Let's find the correct mappings from Example 1 by examining the input 2x2 patterns and expected outputs for azure pixels:
        *   (0,1): Pattern `[[8,0],[8,0]]` -> Expected: 2 (Correct in prev code)
        *   (0,4): Pattern `[[8,0],[8,0]]` -> Expected: 4 (Prev code mapped `[[8,0],[8,8]]` -> 4. Let's recheck pixel (0,4). Input neighborhood `[[8,0],[8,8]]`. Expected output 4. Correct in prev code)
        *   (1,0): Pattern `[[8,8],[0,8]]` -> Expected: 2 (Prev code mapped to 2. Wait, previous output was 2, expected is 2. No mismatch here?) Let's re-simulate.
        *   (1,1): Input Pattern `[[8,0],[8,8]]`. Expected: 2. Previous code map `(8,0,8,8)` -> 4. **Correction: (8,0,8,8) -> 2**
        *   (1,4): Input Pattern `[[8,8],[8,8]]`. Expected: 4. Previous code map `(8,8,8,8)` -> 1. **Correction: (8,8,8,8) -> 4**
        *   (1,5): Input Pattern `[[8,0],[8,0]]`. Expected: 4. Previous code map `(8,0,8,0)` -> 2. **Correction: (8,0,8,0) -> 4**
        *   (2,1): Input Pattern `[[8,8],[8,8]]`. Expected: 1. Previous code map `(8,8,8,8)` -> 1. (Prev output 1, Expected 1. No mismatch here?)
        *   (2,2): Input Pattern `[[8,0],[8,0]]`. Expected: 1. Previous code map `(8,0,8,0)` -> 2. **Correction: (8,0,8,0) -> 1** (Wait, this contradicts (1,5) -> 4. Let's look again)
            *   Pixel (1,5): Input `[[8,0],[8,0]]`. Output 4.
            *   Pixel (2,2): Input `[[8,0],[8,0]]`. Output 1.
            *   This contradicts the idea that the 2x2 pattern *alone* determines the output. Let's re-examine the problem structure.

    **Re-Assessment:** The assumption that *only* the 2x2 pattern starting at `(r, c)` determines the color `output[r,c]` seems flawed based on the conflicting mappings for the `[[8,0],[8,0]]` pattern in example 1.

    Let's reconsider the problem. Maybe the transformation isn't pixel-by-pixel based on its top-left 2x2 neighborhood. Could it be related to identifying specific shapes or structures within the azure pixels?

    Looking at the inputs and outputs again:
    *   The azure pixels seem to form shapes resembling tetrominoes or similar small blocks.
    *   The output colors (1, 2, 3, 4) might correspond to different types of these shapes or their orientations.

    Let's analyze the connected components of azure pixels in the inputs and see how they map to the output colors.

    **Example 1:**
    *   Input object 1 (top-left): `[[0,8],[8,8],[0,8],[0,8]]` -> Output colors at corresponding pixels: `[[0,2],[2,2],[0,1],[0,1]]`. This looks like an 'S' shape. Output colors are 2,2,1,1.
    *   Input object 2 (top-right): `[[8,0],[8,8],[8,8],[8,8]]` -> Output colors: `[[4,0],[4,4],[1,1],[1,1]]`. This is a 'Z' or mirrored 'S'. Output colors 4,4,1,1.
    *   Input object 3 (bottom-center): `[[8,8],[0,8]]` -> Output colors: `[[3,3],[0,3]]`. This is an 'L' shape. Output colors 3,3,3.

    **Example 2:**
    *   Input object 1 (top-center): `[[8,8],[8,8],[8,0],[8,8]]` -> Output colors: `[[1,1],[1,1],[2,0],[1,1]]`. Shape: 'T' shape? Output colors: 1,1,1,1,2,1,1.
    *   Input object 2 (middle-left): `[[8,8],[8,8],[8,8]]` -> Output colors: `[[3,3],[3,2],[2,2]]`. Shape: Mirrored 'L'? Output colors: 3,3,3,2,2,2.
    *   Input object 3 (middle-right): `[[8,8],[8,0]]` -> Output colors: `[[4,0],[4,4]]`. Shape: Square block. Output colors: 4,4,4.

    **Example 3:**
    *   Input object 1 (top-left): `[[8,8,8],[8,8,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,8]]` -> Output colors: `[[1,1,4],[1,1,4],[3,3,0],[0,3,2]]`. Shape: Complex block. Output colors: 1,1,4, 1,1,4, 3,3, 3,2.
    *   Input object 2 (middle-right): `[[8],[8],[8]]` -> Output colors: `[[4],[2],[2]]`. Shape: Vertical 3-bar. Output colors: 4,2,2.

    **New Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies connected components (objects) of azure pixels. Each object is recognized as one of four specific shapes (potentially ignoring rotation/reflection, or maybe including them). All pixels belonging to an object identified as shape 'X' are colored with color 'Y'. The four output colors (1, 2, 3, 4) correspond to four distinct shapes.

    Let's try to identify the shapes and their corresponding colors consistently across examples.

    *   **Shape 1 (Color 1 - Blue):**
        *   Ex 1: Object 1 (S-shape) has `1`s at bottom `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Object 2 (Z-shape) has `1`s at bottom `[[1,1],[1,1]]`. Object 3 (L-shape) has no `1`s.
        *   Ex 2: Object 1 (T-shape) has `1`s everywhere except one `2`. Object 3 (Square) has no `1`s.
        *   Ex 3: Object 1 (complex) has `1`s at top-left 2x2 `[[1,1],[1,1]]`. Object 2 (bar) has no `1`s.
        *   Commonality: Shapes containing a 2x2 block of azure seem to get blue (1) assigned to *at least some* pixels, often the 2x2 block itself.
        *   Let's refine: Perhaps it's specifically the 2x2 square block shape `[[8,8],[8,8]]`. If an azure object *is* a 2x2 block, or *contains* a 2x2 block, does it get color 1?
            *   Ex 1, Obj 2: Contains `[[8,8],[8,8]]` at (r=2, c=4). Output colors `[[1,1],[1,1]]` are at (r=2, c=4) and (r=3, c=4) and (r=2, c=5) and (r=3, c=5). Yes.
            *   Ex 1, Obj 1: No 2x2 block.
            *   Ex 2, Obj 1: Contains `[[8,8],[8,8]]` at (r=0, c=2). Output colors `[[1,1],[1,1]]` are at these coords. Yes.
            *   Ex 2, Obj 2: No 2x2 block.
            *   Ex 2, Obj 3: *Is* a 2x2 block `[[8,8],[8,0]]` - wait, this is not a full 2x2 block. Input `[[8,8],[8,8]]` at (r=1, c=3)? Yes. Output `[[1,1],[1,1]]` at (r=1, c=3). Yes.
            *   Ex 3, Obj 1: Contains `[[8,8],[8,8]]` at (r=0, c=0) and (r=1, c=0). Outputs `[[1,1],[1,1]]` at both. Yes.
            *   Ex 3, Obj 2: No 2x2 block.
        *   **Hypothesis 1:** If a connected component of azure pixels contains a 2x2 subgrid of azure pixels, all pixels of that component are colored blue (1).

    *   **Shape 2 (Color 2 - Red):**
        *   Ex 1: Object 1 has `2`s `[[0,2],[2,2]]`. Object 2 has no `2`s. Object 3 has no `2`s.
        *   Ex 2: Object 1 has one `2`. Object 2 has `2`s `[[?,?],[?,2],[2,2]]`. Object 3 has no `2`s.
        *   Ex 3: Object 1 has one `2`. Object 2 has `2`s `[[?],[2],[2]]`.
        *   Commonality: Vertical structures?
            *   Ex 1, Obj 1: Has vertical `[[8],[8],[8]]` at c=1. Output `[[2],[?],[1],[1]]`. Also has `[[8],[8]]` at c=2. Output `[[?],[2],[1],[1]]`.
            *   Ex 2, Obj 2: Has vertical `[[8],[8],[8]]` at c=1. Output `[[3],[3],[2]]`. Also `[[8],[8]]` at c=2. Output `[[3],[2],[2]]`.
            *   Ex 3, Obj 2: *Is* a vertical `[[8],[8],[8]]`. Output `[[4],[2],[2]]`.
        *   **Hypothesis 2:** If a connected component of azure pixels contains a 1x3 vertical block `[[8],[8],[8]]` (and does *not* contain a 2x2 block), all its pixels are colored red (2). (Checking Ex 3 Obj 2: Output is 4,2,2 - not all 2. Hypothesis failed).

    Let's abandon the "color all pixels of the component" idea and go back to pixel-level rules, but maybe the context is larger than 2x2 or depends on object properties.

    What if the color depends on the *number* of azure neighbors (including diagonals)?
    Let's recalculate the mapping based on the 2x2 patterns using *all* examples.

    import numpy as np

    def get_neighbors(grid, r, c):
        h, w = grid.shape
        pattern = []
        for dr in range(2):
            for dc in range(2):
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w:
                    pattern.append(grid[nr, nc])
                else:
                    pattern.append(0) # Treat out of bounds as white

Consistent Mappings Derived:

```
**Revised Assessment:**
The code execution confirms that multiple 2x2 patterns map to *different* output colors depending on the context (location/example), proving the initial hypothesis (pure 2x2 neighborhood mapping) is incorrect. The `(8,0,0,0)` pattern, for example, can map to blue(1), red(2), green(3), or yellow(4). This strongly suggests the rule is not based *solely* on the 2x2 pattern starting at the pixel.

Let's reconsider the shape idea. The four colors likely represent four categories. What defines the category?

Possibility 1: The *entire shape* of the connected component determines the color for *all* pixels within that component.
    *   Let's assign a potential shape type to each component based on visual inspection and see if the output color is consistent within the component.
    *   Ex 1:
        *   Obj1 (S-shape, top-left): `[[0,8],[8,8],[0,8],[0,8]]` -> Outputs `[[0,2],[2,2],[0,1],[0,1]]`. **Inconsistent colors (1, 2).**
    *   This possibility is immediately falsified.

Possibility 2: The color of a pixel depends on its *role* within the connected component or its local context *within* the component.

Let's re-examine the specific conflicting patterns and their locations.
*   `(8,0,8,0)`:
    *   (1, 0, 1) -> 2
    *   (1, 1, 5) -> 4
    *   (1, 2, 2) -> 1
    *   (1, 4, 3) -> 3
*   `(8,8,8,8)`:
    *   (1, 1, 4) -> 4
    *   (1, 2, 1) -> 1
    *   (2, 1, 1) -> 3

This is complex. It's not just the 2x2 pattern. What else varies?

Could it be related to the total size of the connected component the pixel belongs to? Or the number of azure neighbors (4-way or 8-way)?

Let's try classifying based on the number of *azure* pixels in the 2x2 neighborhood.
*   1 azure pixel (`8,0,0,0`): Outputs seen: 1, 2, 3, 4
*   2 azure pixels:
    *   `8,8,0,0`: Outputs seen: 1, 2, 3
    *   `8,0,8,0`: Outputs seen: 1, 2, 3, 4
    *   `8,0,0,8` (diagonal): Not seen in conflicts? Let's check the code output... Pattern `(8, 0, 0, 8)` is missing from the conflict list. Was it consistent? Checking the code... No, it seems it wasn't present in the inputs leading to conflicts. Let's manually check its mappings:
        *   Ex1 (4,3): `[[8,8],[0,8]]` -> Pat `(8,8,0,8)` -> Out 3
        *   Ex2 (1,4): `[[8,0],[0,0]]` -> Pat `(8,0,0,0)` -> Out 4
        *   Ex2 (2,4): `[[8,8],[8,0]]` -> Pat `(8,8,8,0)` -> Out 4
        *   Ex3 (0,2): `[[8,0],[8,8]]` -> Pat `(8,0,8,8)` -> Out 4
        *   Ex3 (1,2): `[[8,8],[0,8]]` -> Pat `(8,8,0,8)` -> Out 4
        *   Ex3 (1,3): `[[8,0],[8,0]]` -> Pat `(8,0,8,0)` -> Out 4
    *   Let's re-run the analysis code carefully. There might be an error in my manual check or the previous code execution output interpretation. The conflicts *prove* the 2x2 rule is insufficient.

**New Strategy:** Assume the 2x2 neighborhood *pattern* defines one of 4 *types* of local structure, corresponding to the output colors (1,2,3,4). Identify which pattern maps to which color definitively.

Let's look for patterns that *always* produce the same output color across all examples:
*   From the conflict analysis, **no** pattern is consistent across all instances.

This means the rule MUST involve more context than the 2x2 square starting at (r,c).

Consider the 4 colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4).
Maybe they relate to orientation or position within a shape?
*   Blue (1): Often seems associated with 2x2 blocks or parts of them.
*   Red (2): Seen in vertical structures, but also horizontal.
*   Green (3): Seen in L-shapes and T-shapes.
*   Yellow (4): Often seen at ends/corners?

Let's look at the simplest pattern `(8,0,0,0)`. It maps to all 4 colors.
*   Ex1 (5,3) -> 3. Location: Bottom of a vertical 2-bar within an L-shape `[[8,8],[0,8]]`.
*   Ex2 (2,5) -> 4. Location: Top-right of a Z-shape `[[0,8,8],[8,8,0]]`. Input neighborhood is `[[8,0],[0,0]]`.
*   Ex3 (3,3) -> 2. Location: Bottom-right of an L-shape `[[8,8],[8,0]]`. Input neighborhood `[[8,0],[0,0]]`.

This suggests the shape of the *entire connected component* matters.

Let's define the four target shapes based on the output colors consistently seen together:
1.  **Shape Blue (1):** Seems related to `[[8,8],[8,8]]` blocks.
2.  **Shape Red (2):** ??? Maybe vertical bars `[[8],[8]]`?
3.  **Shape Green (3):** ??? Maybe L-shapes?
4.  **Shape Yellow (4):** ??? Maybe horizontal bars `[[8,8]]`?

Let's test this: Identify connected components. Classify the shape. Assign the corresponding color.

**Revised Natural Language Program Idea:**
1.  Find all connected components of azure (8) pixels (using 4-way or 8-way adjacency - let's assume 8-way).
2.  For each component:
    a.  Determine its shape or classify it into one of four categories based on its structure. (e.g., contains a 2x2 block, is a vertical bar of length >= 2, is a horizontal bar of length >= 2, is an L-shape, etc.). This is the hard part.
    b.  Assign a color (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the category.
3.  Create the output grid, coloring all pixels of a component with the assigned color. Keep non-azure pixels as white (0).

Let's revisit Ex1, Obj1 (S-shape) `[[0,8],[8,8],[0,8],[0,8]]` -> Outputs `[[0,2],[2,2],[0,1],[0,1]]`. This still contradicts coloring the whole component with one color.

**Final Attempt Strategy:** The color of a pixel `(r, c)` depends on the 2x2 pattern `[[P_tl, P_tr], [P_bl, P_br]]` starting at `(r, c)`, AND potentially the color of its neighbors *in the output grid* which have already been determined (causal dependency). Or, maybe it depends on a larger neighborhood (e.g., 3x3)?

Let's assume the original 2x2 hypothesis is correct, but the *specific mappings* I derived were wrong. Let's try to find the *correct* unique mapping for the 8 non-background patterns.

There are 2^4 = 16 possible 2x2 patterns. Since the top-left is always 8, there are 2^3 = 8 patterns to map.
Patterns: (8,0,0,0), (8,8,0,0), (8,0,8,0), (8,0,0,8), (8,8,8,0), (8,8,0,8), (8,0,8,8), (8,8,8,8)
Colors: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let's tabulate again, very carefully, pixel by pixel.

**Example 1:**
(0,1) P=(8,0,8,0) -> O=2
(0,4) P=(8,0,8,8) -> O=4
(1,0) P=(8,8,0,8) -> O=2
(1,1) P=(8,0,8,8) -> O=2  -> CONFLICT with (0,4)
(1,4) P=(8,8,8,8) -> O=4
(1,5) P=(8,0,8,0) -> O=4  -> CONFLICT with (0,1)
(2,1) P=(8,8,8,8) -> O=1  -> CONFLICT with (1,4)
(2,2) P=(8,0,8,0) -> O=1  -> CONFLICT with (0,1), (1,5)
(2,4) P=(8,8,8,8) -> O=1  -> CONSISTENT with (2,1), CONFLICT with (1,4)
(2,5) P=(8,0,0,0) -> O=1
(3,1) P=(8,8,0,8) -> O=1  -> CONFLICT with (1,0)
(3,2) P=(8,0,0,0) -> O=1  -> CONSISTENT with (2,5)
(3,4) P=(8,8,0,0) -> O=1
(3,5) P=(8,0,0,0) -> O=1  -> CONSISTENT with (2,5), (3,2)
(4,2) P=(8,8,0,8) -> O=3  -> CONFLICT with (1,0), (3,1)
(4,3) P=(8,0,0,0) -> O=3  -> CONFLICT with (2,5), (3,2), (3,5)
(5,3) P=(8,0,0,0) -> O=3  -> CONSISTENT with (4,3), CONFLICT with (2,5), (3,2), (3,5)

The conflicts confirm the simple 2x2 mapping is wrong. There must be another factor.

```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
    2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
    3.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is white (0), set the corresponding output pixel `output[r, c]` to white (0) and continue.
    4.  If the input pixel `input[r, c]` is azure (8):
        a.  Determine the correct output color `C` (from 1, 2, 3, 4) for this pixel based on a rule that considers more than just the 2x2 neighborhood starting at `(r, c)`.
        b.  The exact rule is currently unknown but must account for the observation that identical 2x2 patterns `[[input[r,c], input[r,c+1]], [input[r+1,c], input[r+1,c+1]]]` (handling boundaries as 0) can produce different output colors in different contexts. Factors such as the shape/size of the connected component the pixel belongs to, or a larger neighborhood context, likely play a role.
        c.  Set the output pixel `output[r, c]` to the determined color `C`.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.

    *(Self-Correction: The previous Natural Language Program incorrectly assumed a simple, unique mapping from the 2x2 pattern to the output color. The analysis shows this assumption is false. The program must be revised to reflect the need for additional context to resolve the ambiguity).*
