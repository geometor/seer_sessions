```python

"""
Transforms an input grid where azure (8) pixels are recolored based on the 
pattern of azure pixels in their 2x2 neighborhood (starting at the pixel).
White (0) pixels remain unchanged.

The specific mapping rules for the 2x2 neighborhood patterns (top-left, top-right, 
bottom-left, bottom-right) to the output color for the top-left pixel are:
- (8,0,0,0) -> 3 (green)
- (8,8,0,0) -> 1 (blue)
- (8,0,8,0) -> 2 (red)
- (8,0,0,8) -> 3 (green)
- (8,8,8,0) -> 3 (green)
- (8,8,0,8) -> 2 (red)
- (8,0,8,8) -> 4 (yellow)
- (8,8,8,8) -> 1 (blue)
