White pixels remain unchanged.

Pixels outside the grid \nboundaries are treated as white (0) when forming the pattern.\n\nThe specific mapping rules are:\n- (8, 0, 0, 0) -> 1 (blue)\n- (8, 8, 0, 0) -> 1 (blue)\n- (8, 0, 8, 0) -> 2 (red)\n- (8, 0, 0, 8) -> 1 (blue)\n- (8, 8, 8, 0) -> 3 (green)\n- (8, 8, 0, 8) -> 2 (red)\n- (8, 0, 8, 8) -> 4 (yellow)\n- (8, 8, 8, 8) -> 1 (blue)\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a 2x2 neighborhood pattern-based color transformation to azure pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    # Pad the input array with 0s (white) on the right and bottom edges by 1 cell.\n    # This simplifies extracting 2x2 neighborhoods at the grid boundaries.\n    padded_input = np.pad(input_array, ((0, 1), (0, 1)), mode='constant', constant_values=0)\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with 0s (white)\n    output_array = np.zeros_like(input_array)\n\n    # Define the mapping from 2x2 patterns (flattened tuple) to output colors.\n    # This map was derived by analyzing all training examples and selecting the \n    # most frequent output color for each observed pattern.\n    # The pattern tuple represents (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)\n    pattern_map = {\n        (8, 0, 0, 0): 1,  # blue\n        (8, 8, 0, 0): 1,  # blue\n        (8, 0, 8, 0): 2,  # red\n        (8, 0, 0, 8): 1,  # blue\n        (8, 8, 8, 0): 3,  # green\n        (8, 8, 0, 8): 2,  # red\n        (8, 0, 8, 8): 4,  # yellow\n        (8, 8, 8, 8): 1,  # blue\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel of the original input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current pixel in the original input is azure (8)\n            if input_array[r, c] == 8:\n                # Extract the 2x2 neighborhood from the padded input array.\n                # The top-left of the neighborhood in the padded array corresponds \n                # to the current pixel (r, c) in the original grid.\n                neighborhood = padded_input[r:r+2, c:c+2]\n\n                # Flatten the 2x2 neighborhood into a tuple to use as a key for the map.\n                # Ensure elements are standard Python integers for dictionary lookup.\n                pattern = tuple(int(x) for x in neighborhood.flatten())\n\n                # Look up the corresponding output color from the pattern map.\n                # Default to 0 (white) if the pattern is somehow not found (should not happen if input[r,c] is 8).\n                output_color = pattern_map.get(pattern, 0) \n\n                # Assign the determined color to the output grid at the same position (r, c).\n                output_array[r, c] = output_color\n            else:\n                # If the input pixel is not azure (i.e., it's white 0), \n                # keep it white in the output.
