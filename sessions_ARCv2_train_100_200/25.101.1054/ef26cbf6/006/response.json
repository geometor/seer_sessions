            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code consistently fails to produce the correct output for both training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. Analysis indicates the root cause lies within the `_find_correspondence` function, specifically in the logic used to determine adjacency between source and target regions and verify the presence of a separating yellow line.\n\nThe previous logic checked if the bounding boxes were immediately adjacent (e.g., `s_max_r == t_min_r - 1`) and then verified if the row/column *at that boundary* was yellow. This is incorrect. The yellow separator exists *between* the source and target regions.\n\n*   For vertically adjacent regions (source above target), the condition should be that there is exactly one row separating them (`s_max_r + 1 == t_min_r - 1`), and this separating row (`s_max_r + 1`) must consist of yellow pixels within the overlapping columns.\n*   For horizontally adjacent regions (source left of target), the condition should be that there is exactly one column separating them (`s_max_c + 1 == t_min_c - 1`), and this separating column (`s_max_c + 1`) must consist of yellow pixels within the overlapping rows.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the adjacency conditions and the separator verification logic within the `_find_correspondence` function.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe previous `code_execution` block confirmed the following:\n\n*   **Region Identification (`_find_regions`):** Correctly identifies contiguous non-yellow regions bounded by yellow separators.\n    *   Train 1: 6 regions found.\n    *   Train 2: 6 regions found.\n*   **Region Classification (`_analyze_regions`):** Correctly classifies regions and extracts properties.\n    *   Train 1: 3 source regions (colors 7, 3, 8), 3 target regions (containing blue).\n    *   Train 2: 3 source regions (colors 3, 2, 6), 3 target regions (containing blue).\n*   **Bounding Boxes:** Correctly calculated for each region.\n\nThis confirms the failure point is isolated to the logic connecting source regions to target regions (`_find_correspondence`). The input is processed correctly up to that point, but no mapping is created, leading to the output grid being identical to the input.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
