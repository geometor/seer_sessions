```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on region analysis and color replacement rules.

1.  The grid is partitioned into contiguous regions of non-yellow (4) pixels, using yellow pixels as boundaries.
2.  Regions are classified as either 'source' or 'target':
    - A 'source region' contains exactly one pixel of a unique color (not white 0, yellow 4, or blue 1) and no blue pixels. Its unique color is the 'source color'.
    - A 'target region' contains one or more blue (1) pixels and no other unique non-white/yellow colors.
3.  A correspondence is established between each target region and exactly one source region based on direct adjacency across a yellow separator:
    - Vertical Adjacency: The source region is immediately above the target region (source max_row == target min_row - 1), AND they are separated by a horizontal yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping columns).
    OR
    - Horizontal Adjacency: The source region is immediately to the left of the target region (source max_col == target min_col - 1), AND they are separated by a vertical yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping rows).
4.  All blue (1) pixels within each target region are replaced in the output grid by the source color of its corresponding source region.
5.  All other pixels (white, yellow, source colors) remain unchanged.
