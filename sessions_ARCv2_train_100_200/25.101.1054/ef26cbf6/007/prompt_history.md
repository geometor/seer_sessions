*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    *   Both examples feature prominent yellow (4) lines, acting as separators, dividing the grid into distinct regions.
    *   In `train_1`, horizontal yellow lines separate three row-based regions. In `train_2`, one horizontal and two vertical yellow lines separate six regions (3 upper, 3 lower).
    *   Within some regions, there is a single, unique non-white (0) and non-yellow (4) colored pixel (e.g., orange (7), green (3), azure (8) in `train_1`; green (3), red (2), magenta (6) in `train_2`). These act as "source" colors.
    *   In other regions, there are patterns of blue (1) pixels. These act as "target" pixels.
    *   The transformation involves replacing the blue (1) pixels in a target region with the source color found in a corresponding source region.
    *   The correspondence relationship seems tied to the layout defined by the yellow separators. In `train_1`, the source color is in the left part of a horizontal band, and the target blues are in the right part of the *same* band. In `train_2`, the source color is in an upper region, and the target blues are in the region directly *below* it, separated by the horizontal yellow line.
    *   All pixels that are not blue (1) in the input remain unchanged in the output.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all yellow (4) pixels which form horizontal and/or vertical lines partitioning the grid into distinct regions.
    2.  For each region:
        a.  Check if it contains blue (1) pixels. If yes, mark it as a "target region" and store the coordinates of the blue pixels.
        b.  Check if it contains exactly one pixel of a color other than white (0), yellow (4), or blue (1). If yes, mark it as a "source region" and store this unique color as the "source color".
    3.  Determine the correspondence between target regions and source regions based on their spatial relationship relative to the yellow separators (e.g., vertically adjacent across a horizontal separator, horizontally adjacent within the same band defined by horizontal separators).
    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    5.  For each target region:
        a.  Identify its corresponding source region using the determined mapping.
        b.  Retrieve the source color associated with that source region.
        c.  For every blue (1) pixel coordinate stored for the target region, change the color of the pixel at that coordinate in the output grid to the retrieved source color.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment**

The previous code failed to produce the correct output for both training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. This indicates a failure in the core transformation logic. The analysis suggests the problem lies primarily in the `_find_correspondence` function, which determines how target regions (containing blue pixels) are linked to source regions (containing a unique color). The implemented adjacency rules (vertical priority 1, horizontal priority 2) and the conditions for checking separators were likely incorrect or insufficient to capture the patterns in both examples. Specifically, the horizontal adjacency rule checked for the *absence* of a vertical separator, which contradicts the pattern seen in `train_1`.

**Strategy Revision**

1.  **Correct Correspondence Logic:** Redefine the rules for matching target regions to source regions based on observations from both examples:
    *   **Vertical Adjacency:** A source region is directly above a target region, and they are separated by a continuous segment of yellow pixels along their shared horizontal boundary.
    *   **Horizontal Adjacency:** A source region is directly to the left of a target region, and they are separated by a continuous segment of yellow pixels along their shared vertical boundary.
    *   Implement checks for *both* conditions for each target region. It's assumed only one type of adjacency (either vertical or horizontal) will be relevant per task, but the code should handle both possibilities. There's no evidence of prioritizing one over the other; rather, the layout dictates which adjacency applies.
2.  **Refine Helper Functions:** Ensure the `_is_horizontal_separator` and `_is_vertical_separator` helper functions accurately check the specific segment *between* the bounding boxes of the potential source and target regions.
3.  **Verify Intermediate Steps:** Use code execution to confirm that region identification (`_find_regions`) and property analysis (`_analyze_regions`) work as expected for both training examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the correspondence rules.

**Findings from Metrics:**

*   The region finding and analysis logic correctly identifies the expected number of source and target regions for both examples.
*   The source colors and bounding boxes align with the visual interpretation of the examples.
*   This confirms that the failure point of the previous code was within the `_find_correspondence` function (specifically, its logic for checking adjacency and separators) or potentially the final pixel replacement step (though less likely if the mapping was empty).

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous regions of non-yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Yellow pixels act as boundaries.
3.  Analyze each identified region:
    *   Find all blue (1) pixels within the region.
    *   Find all unique non-white (0), non-yellow (4), non-blue (1) colors within the region.
    *   Classify the region:
        *   If it contains blue (1) pixels (and no other unique colors), mark it as a "target region" and store the coordinates of the blue pixels.
        *   If it contains exactly one unique non-white/yellow/blue color (and no blue pixels), mark it as a "source region" and store the unique color as its "source color".
4.  For each target region:
    *   Search for a corresponding source region based on adjacency rules:
        *   **Check Vertical Adjacency:** Look for a source region whose bottom edge is exactly one row above the target region's top edge. Verify that there is a continuous horizontal segment of yellow (4) pixels separating them along their overlapping columns. If found, record the source color and proceed to the next target region.
        *   **Check Horizontal Adjacency (if no vertical match):** Look for a source region whose right edge is exactly one column to the left of the target region's left edge. Verify that there is a continuous vertical segment of yellow (4) pixels separating them along their overlapping rows. If found, record the source color.
5.  For every target region for which a corresponding source color was found:
    *   Iterate through the stored coordinates of the blue (1) pixels within that target region.
    *   Change the pixel color at each of these coordinates in the *output grid* to the corresponding source color.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
```python

    - A 'target region' contains one or more blue (1) pixels and no other unique non-white/yellow colors.

4.  All blue (1) pixels within each target region are replaced in the output grid by the source color of its corresponding source region.
5.  All other pixels (white, yellow, source colors) remain unchanged.

**General Assessment**

The previous code execution resulted in the input grids being returned unchanged for both training examples. This indicates a failure in the `_find_correspondence` function to establish any link between the identified source regions and target regions. The core logic for region identification and property analysis (`_find_regions`, `_analyze_regions`) appears functional based on the earlier `code_execution` analysis. The error lies specifically in how adjacency and the role of the yellow separators are interpreted to map sources to targets.

The original hypothesis involved prioritized adjacency (vertical then horizontal) and checked for separators *between* overlapping bounding box extents. This needs revision. The examples show:
*   `train_1`: Horizontal correspondence (source left, target right) across a *vertical* separator (column 3).
*   `train_2`: Vertical correspondence (source top, target bottom) across a *horizontal* separator (row 3).

The critical factor is the *type* of yellow separator *directly between* the source and target regions.

**Strategy Revision**

1.  **Correct Correspondence Logic:** Modify `_find_correspondence` to:
    *   Check for potential vertical adjacency (source above target). If `s_max_r == t_min_r - 1`, verify if the row `s_max_r` acts as a horizontal separator between their overlapping columns (`_is_horizontal_separator`).
    *   Check for potential horizontal adjacency (source left of target). If `s_max_c == t_min_c - 1`, verify if the column `s_max_c` acts as a vertical separator between their overlapping rows (`_is_vertical_separator`).
    *   The code should find *one* unique match (either vertical or horizontal) for each target based on these direct separator conditions. No priority is needed; the grid layout dictates the relationship.
2.  **Re-verify Region Analysis:** Although likely correct, ensure the region identification and classification logic remains sound. The `_analyze_regions` function correctly identified source/target regions previously.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe the correspondence rule based on the type of separator *between* adjacent regions.

**Metrics and Analysis**

The previous `code_execution` block already provided the necessary metrics for region analysis:

*   **Train 1:** 6 regions found; 3 source (colors 7, 3, 8), 3 target. Bounding boxes were correctly identified.
*   **Train 2:** 6 regions found; 3 source (colors 3, 2, 6), 3 target. Bounding boxes were correctly identified.

These metrics confirm that the initial stages of processing (region finding and classification) are working. The failure occurred in the subsequent step of linking these classified regions. The crucial missing element was correctly interpreting the role of the yellow separator *between* adjacent source/target pairs.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous regions of non-yellow (4) pixels in the input grid, treating yellow pixels as boundaries.
3.  Analyze each identified region:
    *   Determine if it contains blue (1) pixels.
    *   Determine if it contains exactly one unique non-white (0), non-yellow (4), non-blue (1) color.
    *   Classify the region:
        *   If it contains blue pixels and no unique other color, mark it as a "target region" and store the coordinates of the blue pixels.
        *   If it contains exactly one unique other color and no blue pixels, mark it as a "source region" and store the unique color as its "source color".
4.  Create a mapping to store the corresponding source color for each target region.
5.  For each target region:
    *   Iterate through all source regions to find a match:
        *   **Check for Vertical Adjacency:** If the source region's bottom edge is exactly one row above the target region's top edge, check if the intervening row consists of only yellow (4) pixels within their horizontally overlapping columns. If both conditions are true, map this target region to the source region's color and stop searching for this target.
        *   **Check for Horizontal Adjacency:** If no vertical match was found, check if the source region's right edge is exactly one column to the left of the target region's left edge. Check if the intervening column consists of only yellow (4) pixels within their vertically overlapping rows. If both conditions are true, map this target region to the source region's color and stop searching for this target.
6.  Iterate through the generated mapping:
    *   For each target region in the map, retrieve its corresponding source color.
    *   For every blue (1) pixel coordinate stored for that target region, change the pixel color at that coordinate in the *output grid* to the retrieved source color.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on region analysis and color replacement rules.

1.  The grid is partitioned into contiguous regions of non-yellow (4) pixels, using yellow pixels as boundaries.
2.  Regions are classified as either 'source' or 'target':
    - A 'source region' contains exactly one pixel of a unique color (not white 0, yellow 4, or blue 1) and no blue pixels. Its unique color is the 'source color'.
    - A 'target region' contains one or more blue (1) pixels and no other unique non-white/yellow colors.
3.  A correspondence is established between each target region and exactly one source region based on direct adjacency across a yellow separator:
    - Vertical Adjacency: The source region is immediately above the target region (source max_row == target min_row - 1), AND they are separated by a horizontal yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping columns).
    OR
    - Horizontal Adjacency: The source region is immediately to the left of the target region (source max_col == target min_col - 1), AND they are separated by a vertical yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping rows).
4.  All blue (1) pixels within each target region are replaced in the output grid by the source color of its corresponding source region.
5.  All other pixels (white, yellow, source colors) remain unchanged.

"""
Transforms an input grid based on region analysis and color replacement rules.

1.  The grid is partitioned into contiguous regions of non-yellow (4) pixels, using yellow pixels as boundaries.
2.  Regions are classified as either 'source' or 'target':
    - A 'source region' contains exactly one pixel of a unique color (not white 0, yellow 4, or blue 1) and no blue pixels. Its unique color is the 'source color'.
    - A 'target region' contains one or more blue (1) pixels and no other unique non-white/yellow colors.
3.  A correspondence is established between each target region and exactly one source region based on direct adjacency across a yellow separator:
    - Vertical Adjacency: The source region is immediately above the target region (source max_row == target min_row - 1), AND they are separated by a horizontal yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping columns).
    OR
    - Horizontal Adjacency: The source region is immediately to the left of the target region (source max_col == target min_col - 1), AND they are separated by a vertical yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary (checked within overlapping rows).
4.  All blue (1) pixels within each target region are replaced in the output grid by the source color of its corresponding source region.
5.  All other pixels (white, yellow, source colors) remain unchanged.

**General Assessment**

The provided code consistently fails to produce the correct output for both training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. Analysis indicates the root cause lies within the `_find_correspondence` function, specifically in the logic used to determine adjacency between source and target regions and verify the presence of a separating yellow line.

The previous logic checked if the bounding boxes were immediately adjacent (e.g., `s_max_r == t_min_r - 1`) and then verified if the row/column *at that boundary* was yellow. This is incorrect. The yellow separator exists *between* the source and target regions.

*   For vertically adjacent regions (source above target), the condition should be that there is exactly one row separating them (`s_max_r + 1 == t_min_r - 1`), and this separating row (`s_max_r + 1`) must consist of yellow pixels within the overlapping columns.
*   For horizontally adjacent regions (source left of target), the condition should be that there is exactly one column separating them (`s_max_c + 1 == t_min_c - 1`), and this separating column (`s_max_c + 1`) must consist of yellow pixels within the overlapping rows.

The strategy is to correct the adjacency conditions and the separator verification logic within the `_find_correspondence` function.

**Metrics and Analysis**

The previous `code_execution` block confirmed the following:

*   **Region Identification (`_find_regions`):** Correctly identifies contiguous non-yellow regions bounded by yellow separators.
    *   Train 1: 6 regions found.
    *   Train 2: 6 regions found.
*   **Region Classification (`_analyze_regions`):** Correctly classifies regions and extracts properties.
    *   Train 1: 3 source regions (colors 7, 3, 8), 3 target regions (containing blue).
    *   Train 2: 3 source regions (colors 3, 2, 6), 3 target regions (containing blue).
*   **Bounding Boxes:** Correctly calculated for each region.

This confirms the failure point is isolated to the logic connecting source regions to target regions (`_find_correspondence`). The input is processed correctly up to that point, but no mapping is created, leading to the output grid being identical to the input.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions composed of non-yellow (4) pixels. Yellow pixels serve as boundaries between regions.
3.  For each region, analyze its contents:
    *   Determine if it contains any blue (1) pixels. Store their coordinates if present.
    *   Identify all unique pixel colors other than white (0), yellow (4), and blue (1).
    *   Classify the region:
        *   If it contains blue pixels and has zero unique other colors, designate it a "target region".
        *   If it contains zero blue pixels and exactly one unique other color, designate it a "source region" and store its unique color as the "source color".
    *   Calculate the bounding box (min/max row/column) for each region.
4.  Create an empty mapping to link target regions to their source colors.
5.  For each identified target region:
    *   Iterate through all identified source regions:
        *   **Check Vertical Adjacency:** Test if `source_max_row + 1 == target_min_row - 1`. If true, calculate the overlapping column range between the source and target bounding boxes. Verify that the entire row at index `source_max_row + 1` within this overlapping column range consists only of yellow (4) pixels. If both conditions hold, map the target region to this source region's color and proceed to the next target region.
        *   **Check Horizontal Adjacency (if no vertical match):** Test if `source_max_col + 1 == target_min_col - 1`. If true, calculate the overlapping row range between the source and target bounding boxes. Verify that the entire column at index `source_max_col + 1` within this overlapping row range consists only of yellow (4) pixels. If both conditions hold, map the target region to this source region's color and proceed to the next target region.
6.  Iterate through the created mapping:
    *   For each target region associated with a source color in the mapping:
        *   Retrieve the list of blue pixel coordinates stored for that target region.
        *   For each blue pixel coordinate, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to the mapped source color.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
