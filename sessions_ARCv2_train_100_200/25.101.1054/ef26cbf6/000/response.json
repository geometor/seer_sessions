In `train_2`, one horizontal and two vertical yellow lines separate six regions (3 upper, 3 lower).\n    *   Within some regions, there is a single, unique non-white (0) and non-yellow (4) colored pixel (e.g., orange (7), green (3), azure (8) in `train_1`; green (3), red (2), magenta (6) in `train_2`). These act as \"source\" colors.\n    *   In other regions, there are patterns of blue (1) pixels. These act as \"target\" pixels.\n    *   The transformation involves replacing the blue (1) pixels in a target region with the source color found in a corresponding source region.\n    *   The correspondence relationship seems tied to the layout defined by the yellow separators. In `train_1`, the source color is in the left part of a horizontal band, and the target blues are in the right part of the *same* band. In `train_2`, the source color is in an upper region, and the target blues are in the region directly *below* it, separated by the horizontal yellow line.\n    *   All pixels that are not blue (1) in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
