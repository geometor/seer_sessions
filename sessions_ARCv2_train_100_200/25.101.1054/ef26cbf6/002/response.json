            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed to produce the correct output for both training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. This indicates a failure in the core transformation logic. The analysis suggests the problem lies primarily in the `_find_correspondence` function, which determines how target regions (containing blue pixels) are linked to source regions (containing a unique color). The implemented adjacency rules (vertical priority 1, horizontal priority 2) and the conditions for checking separators were likely incorrect or insufficient to capture the patterns in both examples. Specifically, the horizontal adjacency rule checked for the *absence* of a vertical separator, which contradicts the pattern seen in `train_1`.\n\n**Strategy Revision**\n\n1.  **Correct Correspondence Logic:** Redefine the rules for matching target regions to source regions based on observations from both examples:\n    *   **Vertical Adjacency:** A source region is directly above a target region, and they are separated by a continuous segment of yellow pixels along their shared horizontal boundary.\n    *   **Horizontal Adjacency:** A source region is directly to the left of a target region, and they are separated by a continuous segment of yellow pixels along their shared vertical boundary.\n    *   Implement checks for *both* conditions for each target region. It's assumed only one type of adjacency (either vertical or horizontal) will be relevant per task, but the code should handle both possibilities. There's no evidence of prioritizing one over the other; rather, the layout dictates which adjacency applies.\n2.  **Refine Helper Functions:** Ensure the `_is_horizontal_separator` and `_is_vertical_separator` helper functions accurately check the specific segment *between* the bounding boxes of the potential source and target regions.\n3.  **Verify Intermediate Steps:** Use code execution to confirm that region identification (`_find_regions`) and property analysis (`_analyze_regions`) work as expected for both training examples.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected understanding of the correspondence rules.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
