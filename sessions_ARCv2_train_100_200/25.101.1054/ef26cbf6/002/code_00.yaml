task_description: Replace blue pixels in 'target' regions with the color found in a corresponding 'source' region, based on adjacency across yellow separators.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: Yes
  - background_color: white (0)

elements:
  - type: separator
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Horizontal and/or vertical lines or line segments that partition the grid.
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.

  - type: source_region
    description: A contiguous region of non-yellow pixels containing exactly one pixel of a unique color (not white(0), yellow(4), or blue(1)).
    properties:
      - source_color: The unique non-white/yellow/blue color within the region.
      - location: Bounded by separators or grid edges.
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.
    role: Provides the replacement color.

  - type: target_region
    description: A contiguous region of non-yellow pixels containing one or more blue (1) pixels. Does not contain any other non-white/yellow colors.
    properties:
      - target_pixels: The coordinates of all blue (1) pixels within the region.
      - location: Bounded by separators or grid edges.
    persistence: Blue pixels are replaced in the output.
    role: Defines areas where replacement occurs.

relationships:
  - type: partitioning
    element1: separator (yellow pixels)
    element2: grid
    description: Yellow pixels divide the grid into distinct non-yellow regions.

  - type: correspondence
    element1: target_region
    element2: source_region
    description: |
      Each target region is linked to exactly one source region based on direct adjacency across a yellow separator segment:
      1. Vertical Adjacency: The source region is immediately above the target region, separated by a horizontal yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary.
      OR
      2. Horizontal Adjacency: The source region is immediately to the left of the target region, separated by a vertical yellow line segment spanning their shared boundary.

actions:

  - action: replace_pixels
    inputs: [target_region_pixels, source_color, output_grid]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: Change the color of blue pixels in the target region to the corresponding source color in the output grid.
