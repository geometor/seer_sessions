Transformation Type: Local Pixel Replacement
Grid Properties:
  - Input and Output grids have identical dimensions.
  - The set of colors used might be preserved or slightly altered depending on replacement rules.
Pixel Operation:
  - Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid.
  - For each pixel, examine its color and the colors of its orthogonal neighbors (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
Rule Application:
  - A set of conditional rules determines the output color.
  - Rule Format: IF InputPixelColor == X AND NeighborColorAtPositionP == Y THEN OutputPixelColor = Z
  - Neighbor Positions (P): Can be specific (e.g., Left, Top) or general (e.g., Any orthogonal).
  - Precedence: Rules are applied in a specific order. The first rule that matches determines the output color.
Default Behavior:
  - If no rule matches a given input pixel and its neighbors, the output pixel retains the input pixel's color.
Context Dependence:
  - The specific set of rules (X, Y, P -> Z) varies between the provided examples (`train_1` and `train_2`), indicating the rules are likely dependent on the input context.
