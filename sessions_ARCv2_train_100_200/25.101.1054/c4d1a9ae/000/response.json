            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task requires transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. Analyzing the two examples provided (`train_1` and `train_2`) reveals a consistent transformation mechanism:\n1.  **Local Transformation:** The color of each pixel in the output grid is determined solely by the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid and the colors of its immediate orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.\n2.  **Conditional Rules:** The transformation follows a set of specific, prioritized rules. Each rule checks if the central input pixel has a certain color and if one of its neighbors (in a specific position or any position) has another specific color.\n3.  **Pixel Replacement:** If a rule's conditions are met, the output pixel takes on a new color specified by that rule. If multiple rules could apply to a pixel, a specific precedence order is followed (the first matching rule in the order determines the output).\n4.  **Default Identity:** If no specific rule applies to an input pixel, its color remains unchanged in the output grid.\n5.  **Context-Specific Rules:** While the *mechanism* of transformation (neighbor-based conditional replacement) is consistent across examples, the *specific* rules (which colors interact, what the resulting colors are, and the precedence) differ between `train_1` and `train_2`. This suggests the exact rules might be inferred from the context or patterns within each specific input grid, although the examples provided don't make the inference method explicit.\n\n    *   In `train_1`, only Yellow (4) pixels change, influenced by neighboring Gray (5), Red (2), or Magenta (6).\n    *   In `train_2`, White (0) pixels change if near Yellow (4), and Maroon (9) pixels change if to the right of Green (3).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

The first rule that matches determines the output color.\nDefault Behavior:\n  - If no rule matches a given input pixel and its neighbors, the output pixel retains the input pixel's color.\nContext Dependence:\n  - The specific set of rules (X, Y, P -> Z) varies between the provided examples (`train_1` and `train_2`), indicating the rules are likely dependent on the input context.\n```"
