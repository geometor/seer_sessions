"""
Transforms the input grid based on column context.
The transformation targets the most frequent color in the grid ('T').
For each column, if it contains exactly one non-target color ('C_other'),
all 'T' pixels in that column are changed to a new color determined by 'C_other'
using a predefined mapping. The mapping used depends on the set of colors
present in the overall grid (two patterns identified from training examples).
If a column contains no 'C_other' or multiple 'C_other' colors, 'T' pixels
remain unchanged in that column. Other pixels (not 'T') are never changed.
