Typically, there are three different non-white colors/objects in each input grid. The objects have varying shapes and sizes and are scattered across the grid.\n\nThe output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and represents a cropped view containing exactly one of the objects from the input grid. The cropping is defined by the bounding box of the selected object. The selection criteria for which object is chosen appears to be based on the numerical value of the colors present.\n\nSpecifically, in each example, there are three distinct non-white colors. Let these colors be `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`. If we sort these color values numerically, the object chosen for the output corresponds to the color whose value lies *between* the minimum and maximum color values present in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
