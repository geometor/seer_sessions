task_type: object_selection_and_extraction
input_characteristics:
  - grid_background: white (0)
  - contains_multiple_objects: true
  - object_definition: contiguous block of same non-white color
  - number_of_distinct_non_white_colors: 3 (in all examples)
output_characteristics:
  - grid_background: potentially mixed (includes original object pixels and potentially white pixels from within the object's bounding box)
  - contains_single_object: true
  - output_content: bounding box of a selected object from the input
selection_rule:
  - identify_distinct_colors: Find all unique non-white color values (c1, c2, c3) in the input.
  - sort_colors: Order the colors numerically (min_c, mid_c, max_c).
  - select_object_by_color: The object selected is the one whose color is `mid_c`.
extraction_rule:
  - find_object_pixels: Locate all pixels corresponding to the selected color `mid_c`.
  - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing these pixels.
  - crop_grid: Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the original input grid.
relationships:
  - The output is a subgrid of the input.
  - The specific subgrid (object) chosen depends on a numerical comparison of the color values of all objects present.
