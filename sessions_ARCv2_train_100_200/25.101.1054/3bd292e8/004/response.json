            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial hypothesis, based on simple 8-way adjacency to Red pixels determining the transformation of Orange pixels, failed on all training examples. The previous attempt using 4-way reachability from the top-left Orange pixel also failed. This indicates a more nuanced spatial relationship is at play.\n\nObserving the input and output pairs, especially Example 3, suggests that the Red (2) pixels act as barriers, partitioning the Orange (7) pixels into distinct regions. The transformation seems to depend on whether an Orange pixel belongs to a region connected to the grid's border or an enclosed region.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adopt the \"Border Reachability\" Hypothesis:** Propose that Orange pixels become Green (3) if they are part of a 4-way connected component of Orange pixels that touches the grid border. Orange pixels in components not touching the border become Gray (5).\n2.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Use code execution to test this hypothesis against"

Otherwise, it becomes Gray (5). Red (2) pixels remain Red (2).\n\nWe test this hypothesis by implementing it and comparing its output to the expected output for all training examples.\n\n"

            "text": "**Assessment Update:**\n\nThe \"Border Reachability defines Green/Gray (4-way)\" hypothesis also **failed** on all training examples. This indicates that the core logic is still misunderstood.\n\nLet's review the mismatches from the code execution (by mentally running or adding print statements to the tool code if needed):\n*   Ex1 Expected: `[[3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5, 5], [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], [5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 3, 3]]`\n*   Ex1 Actual (Border Reachability): `[[3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3]]`\n    *   Mismatch: Expected Gray (5) in top-right and bottom-left corners, but got Green (3). This means the hypothesis incorrectly identified these corner Orange pixels as reachable from the border. Why? (0,3) is on the border. (4,0) is on the border. They *start* the Green fill.\n\nThe error is in the premise. If a pixel is on the border, it's reachable. But some border pixels are expected to be Gray.\n\n**Revised Strategy:** The simple geometric concepts (adjacency, reachability) seem insufficient or incorrectly applied. Let's consider the Red pixels not just as blockers, but as having an \"influence\". Maybe it's about the *nearest* Red pixel, or the *number* of adjacent Red pixels? Or perhaps it's a diffusion/propagation process?\n\nLet's reconsider the initial failed hypothesis: Gray if 8-way adjacent to Red, Green otherwise.\n*   Ex1 Input (snippet near top-right):\n    `2 7 7`\n    `2 2 2`\n    `7 7 2`\n*   Ex1 Output (expected):\n    `2 5 5`\n    `2 2 2`\n    `3 3 2`\n*   Pixel (0,3) is Orange(7). Neighbors: (0,2)=R, (1,2)=R, (1,3)=R, (1,4)=R. Adjacent to Red -> Should be Gray(5). Correct.\n*   Pixel (0,4) is Orange(7). Neighbors: (0,3)=O, (1,3)=R, (1,4)=R, (1,5)=R. Adjacent to Red -> Should be Gray(5). Correct.\n*   Pixel (0,6) is Orange(7). Neighbors: (0,5)=O, (1,5)=O, (1,6)=O. Not adjacent to Red -> Should be Green(3). But expected is Gray(5). Why?\n\nWhat if the rule is: **Gray if 8-way adjacent to Red, OR 8-way adjacent to another Orange pixel that will become Gray?** This sounds like a propagation/fill starting from the Red-adjacent Oranges.\n\n**Hypothesis: Propagation from Red Adjacency (8-way)**\n\n1.  Initialize Output Grid: Copy Red(2) pixels. Mark all Orange(7) pixels as potentially Green(3).\n2.  Identify Initial Gray Set: Find all Orange(7) pixels in the input that are 8-way adjacent to any Red(2) pixel. Set their corresponding pixels in the output grid to Gray(5).\n3.  Propagation: Use a queue (BFS). Add all initially Gray pixels to the queue.\n4.  While the queue is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a Gray pixel position `(r, c)`.\n    b.  Examine its 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid.\n    c.  If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is currently marked as potentially Green(3):\n        i.  Change its color to Gray(5).\n        ii. Add `(nr, nc)` to the queue.\n5.  The final output grid contains the result.\n\n**Testing \"Propagation from Red Adjacency (8-way)\" Mentally:**\n\n*   **Ex1:**\n    *   Initial Gray (8-adj to Red): (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3-5), (2,1-5), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,5), (6,0-3), (6,5).\n    *   Place these in queue. Output grid has these as 5, others (that were Orange) as 3.\n    *   Dequeue (0,3). Neighbors? (0,4) is already Gray. (1,3) Gray. (1,4) Gray. (0,2)=Red. Done.\n    *   Dequeue (0,4). Neighbors? (0,3) Gray. (0,5)=Green(3). Change (0,5) to Gray(5), enqueue (0,5). (1,3) Gray. (1,4) Gray. (1,5) Gray.\n    *   Dequeue (0,5). Neighbors? (0,4) Gray. (0,6)=Green(3). Change (0,6) to Gray(5), enqueue (0,6). (1,4) Gray. (1,5) Gray. (1,6)=Green(3). Change (1,6) to Gray(5), enqueue (1,6).\n    *   ... Continue this process. The Gray should spread to fill the top-right and bottom-left corners correctly. The central Green area should remain Green because it's not adjacent to any Red or initial Gray pixel, and the Gray propagation will be blocked by the Red walls.\n    *   This looks very promising!\n\nLet's verify with code execution.\n\n"

If any neighbor is Red (2), set `output[r, c]` to Gray (5) and add the coordinates `(r, c)` to the propagation queue.\n        iii.
