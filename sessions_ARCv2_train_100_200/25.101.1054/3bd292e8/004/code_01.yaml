Input_Colors:
  - Red: 2
  - Orange: 7
Output_Colors:
  - Red: 2
  - Green: 3
  - Gray: 5
Grid_Properties:
  - Size: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions.
Pixel_Transformations:
  - Type: Identity
    Input_Color: Red (2)
    Output_Color: Red (2)
    Description: All Red pixels remain unchanged.
  - Type: Conditional Recolor (Propagation-based)
    Input_Color: Orange (7)
    Output_Color: Green (3) or Gray (5)
    Rule:
      1. Initialize potential output: Copy Red(2) pixels. Tentatively set all input Orange(7) pixels to Green(3) in the output.
      2. Identify Seeds: Find the set 'S' of all Orange(7) input pixels that are 8-way adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one Red(2) input pixel.
      3. Initial Coloring: Change the color of pixels in 'S' from Green(3) to Gray(5) in the output grid.
      4. Propagation: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all pixels in 'S'.
      5. Propagation Rule: The search propagates via 8-way adjacency. If the search moves from a Gray(5) pixel to a neighbor currently marked Green(3), change that neighbor to Gray(5) and add it to the BFS queue.
      6. Final State: Orange pixels that were reached by the propagation (including the initial seeds 'S') are Gray(5). Orange pixels that were never reached remain Green(3).
Objects:
  - Type: Pixel cluster
    Color: Red (2)
    Property: Static barrier, source of propagation trigger.
  - Type: Pixel
    Color: Orange (7)
    Property: Dynamic, color determined by propagation from Red-adjacent pixels.
Relationships:
  - Type: Adjacency (8-way)
    Description: Used to identify initial Orange pixels affected by Red, and for propagation spread.
    Source: Orange Pixel (7) / Gray Pixel (5)
    Target: Red Pixel (2) / Green Pixel (3)
Actions:
  - Action: Identify Red Pixels
  - Action: Identify Orange Pixels
  - Action: Identify Orange Pixels 8-way adjacent to Red Pixels (Seed Gray Pixels)
  - Action: Propagate Gray color (8-way) from Seed Gray pixels through other Orange pixels until no more changes occur.
  - Action: Set remaining Orange pixels to Green.
