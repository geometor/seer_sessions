"""
The transformation rule operates on a grid containing primarily Red (2) and Orange (7) pixels.

1.  Red (2) pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
2.  Orange (7) pixels are transformed into either Green (3) or Gray (5).
3.  The rule for determining Green vs. Gray for Orange pixels is based on their spatial relationship with Red pixels.
4.  Initial Hypothesis (Implemented Below): An Orange (7) pixel becomes Gray (5) if it is 8-way adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one Red (2) pixel in the input grid. Otherwise, it becomes Green (3).
5.  NOTE: Testing revealed this simple adjacency hypothesis does not correctly predict the output for all training examples. The true rule is likely more complex, potentially involving connectivity, regions defined by Red 'walls', or reachability, but a definitive rule hasn't been identified yet. This implementation uses the simple adjacency rule as a baseline.

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
