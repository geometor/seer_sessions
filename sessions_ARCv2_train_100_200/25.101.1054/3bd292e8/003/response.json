Red (2) pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n2.  Orange (7) pixels are transformed into either Green (3) or Gray (5).\n3.  The rule for determining Green vs. Gray for Orange pixels is based on their spatial relationship with Red pixels.\n4.  Initial Hypothesis (Implemented Below): An Orange (7) pixel becomes Gray (5) if it is 8-way adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one Red (2) pixel in the input grid. Otherwise, it becomes Green (3).\n5.  NOTE: Testing revealed this simple adjacency hypothesis does not correctly predict the output for all training examples. The true rule is likely more complex, potentially involving connectivity, regions defined by Red 'walls', or reachability, but a definitive rule hasn't been identified yet. This implementation uses the simple adjacency rule as a baseline.\n\nThe output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _is_valid(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if coordinates are within grid bounds.\"\"\"\n    return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\ndef _has_red_neighbor(grid_np, r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the cell at (r, c) has an 8-way adjacent Red (2) neighbor.\"\"\"\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds and color\n            if _is_valid(nr, nc, height, width) and grid_np[nr, nc] == 2:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the adjacency rule.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient access\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy, Red pixels are already correct.\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current pixel in the input grid is Orange (7)\n            if input_np[r, c] == 7:\n                # Apply the adjacency rule\n                if _has_red_neighbor(input_np, r, c, height, width):\n                    # If adjacent to Red (2), change to Gray (5)\n                    output_np[r, c] = 5\n                else:\n                    # If not adjacent to Red (2), change to Green (3)\n                    output_np[r, c] = 3\n            # Red (2) pixels remain unchanged (handled by the initial copy)\n            # Other colors (if any) would also remain unchanged\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    output_grid = output_np.tolist()\n    return output_grid\n\n```"
