Input_Colors:
  - Red: 2
  - Orange: 7
Output_Colors:
  - Red: 2
  - Green: 3
  - Gray: 5
Grid_Properties:
  - Size: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions.
Pixel_Transformations:
  - Type: Identity
    Input_Color: Red (2)
    Output_Color: Red (2)
    Description: All Red pixels remain unchanged.
  - Type: Conditional Recolor
    Input_Color: Orange (7)
    Output_Color: Green (3) or Gray (5)
    Description: All Orange pixels change color to either Green or Gray.
Observed_Patterns:
  - Pattern: Partitioning
    Source_Color: Orange (7)
    Target_Colors: [Green (3), Gray (5)]
    Description: The original Orange area is partitioned into distinct regions of Green and Gray pixels in the output.
  - Pattern: Spatial Relationship
    Description: The choice between Green and Gray for a given Orange pixel appears related to its spatial relationship with the Red pixels, potentially involving connectivity or blocking, but simple adjacency (8-way or 4-way) or simple reachability (from border or top-left, 8-way or 4-way) does not fully explain the pattern across all examples. Red pixels act as barriers influencing the surrounding Orange pixels' transformation.
Unknowns:
  - The specific rule determining whether an Orange (7) pixel becomes Green (3) or Gray (5) is not yet fully determined. It likely involves a combination of proximity and connectivity relative to the Red (2) pixels.
