The Red pixels form distinct shapes or patterns, while the Orange pixels typically fill the remaining space, acting like a background or field.\n\nThe output grids retain the original Red (2) pixels in their exact positions. The Orange (7) pixels from the input are replaced by either Green (3) or Gray (5) pixels in the output.\n\nThe transformation logic appears to depend on the proximity of the Orange pixels to the Red pixels. Orange pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any Red pixel are changed to Gray (5). Orange pixels that are not adjacent to any Red pixel are changed to Green (3).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
