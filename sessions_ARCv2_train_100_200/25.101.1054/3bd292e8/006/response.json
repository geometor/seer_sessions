            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt using 8-way propagation from Red-adjacent pixels failed, resulting in excessive Gray (5) coloring compared to the expected outputs. The Gray color spread too far, indicating that the propagation mechanism or the adjacency check was incorrect. Specifically, the 8-way propagation likely allowed Gray to \"jump\" diagonally across connections that should have been blocked or separated.\n\nThe most likely correction is to constrain the propagation step. While the initial trigger (identifying Orange pixels adjacent to Red) might still use 8-way adjacency, the subsequent *spread* of the Gray color should likely only occur through 4-way (cardinal) adjacency.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Modify the propagation hypothesis:\n    *   **Seeds:** Orange (7) pixels that are **8-way** adjacent to Red (2) pixels become initial Gray (5) seeds.\n    *   **Propagation:** Gray (5) color spreads from existing Gray (5) pixels to **4-way** adjacent Orange (7) pixels (that are currently marked as potential Green).\n2.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Implement and test this refined hypothesis using code execution against all training examples.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** If verification is successful, update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the correct 8-way seed identification and 4-way propagation rule.\n\n## Metrics and Hypothesis Verification\n\nThe refined hypothesis is:\nAn Orange (7) pixel becomes Gray (5) if:\na) It is 8-way adjacent to a Red (2) pixel in the input.\nb) OR it is 4-way adjacent to another Orange (7) pixel that satisfies condition (a) or (b).\nOtherwise, the Orange (7) pixel becomes Green (3). Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nWe will now test this hypothesis using code execution.\n\n\n"
