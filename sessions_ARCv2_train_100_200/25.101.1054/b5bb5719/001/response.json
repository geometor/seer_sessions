Iterate through each row of the `output_grid`, starting from the second row (row index 1) down to the last row. Let the current row index be `r`.\n3. Within each row `r`, iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.\n4. For the current cell `(r, c)`, check if its color in `output_grid` is Orange (7). If it is not Orange (7), skip the following steps and proceed to the next column `c`.\n5. Identify the two source pixel locations in the row above: `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.\n6. Determine the colors of these source pixels from the `output_grid`. If a source location `(r-1, col)` is outside the grid boundaries (i.e., `col < 0` or `col >= width`), treat its color as Orange (7). Let the left source color be `color1` and the right source color be `color2`.\n7. Check if *both* `color1` and `color2` are non-Orange (i.e., both are Red (2) or Gray (5)). If either source color is Orange (7), do not modify the cell `(r, c)` and proceed to the next column `c`.\n8. If both source colors are non-Orange, apply the transformation rule:\n   a. If `color1` is the same as `color2`:\n      i. If `color1` is Red (2), set the result color to Gray (5).\n      ii. If `color1` is Gray (5), set the result color to Red (2).\n   b. If `color1` is different from `color2`:\n      i. Set the result color to be the same as `color2` (the color of the right source pixel).\n9. Update the cell `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` with the calculated result color.\n10. After processing all columns `c` for the current row `r`, move to the next row `r+1`.\n11. Once all rows from 1 to the end have been processed, the `output_grid` contains the final result. Return the `output_grid`.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on a rule involving two pixels in the row above.\n    The color of a pixel (r, c) below the first row depends on the colors of pixels\n    (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) in the already processed grid, but only if the\n    target pixel (r, c) is initially Orange (7) and both source pixels are\n    either Red (2) or Gray (5).\n    - If the two source pixels are the same (both Red or both Gray), the output\n      pixel becomes the *other* color (Red -> Gray, Gray -> Red).\n    - If the two source pixels are different (one Red, one Gray), the output\n      pixel takes the color of the *right* source pixel (r-1, c+1).\n    Out-of-bounds source pixels are treated as Orange (7).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define colors\n    RED = 2\n    GRAY = 5\n    ORANGE = 7\n    BOUNDARY_COLOR = ORANGE\n\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier indexing and manipulation\n    output_grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Helper function to get color, handling boundary conditions\n    def get_color(grid, r, c):\n        if 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width:\n            return grid[r, c]\n        else:\n            return BOUNDARY_COLOR\n\n    # Iterate through rows starting from the second row (index 1)\n    for r in range(1, height):\n        # Iterate through columns\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell is Orange\n            if output_grid[r, c] == ORANGE:\n                # Get the colors of the two source pixels from the row above\n                # Note: We use the potentially already modified output_grid\n                #       because the transformation depends on the state of the row above.\n                color1 = get_color(output_grid, r - 1, c - 1)\n                color2 = get_color(output_grid, r - 1, c + 1)\n\n                # Check if both source colors are non-Orange (Red or Gray)\n                if color1 != ORANGE and color2 != ORANGE:\n                    # Apply the transformation rule\n                    if color1 == color2:\n                        # If both are the same, swap the color\n                        new_color = GRAY if color1 == RED else RED\n                    else:\n                        # If different, take the color of the right source pixel\n                        new_color = color2\n\n                    # Update the output grid\n                    output_grid[r, c] = new_color\n\n    # Convert the numpy array back to a list of lists before returning\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
