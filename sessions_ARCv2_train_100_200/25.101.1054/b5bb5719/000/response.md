**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Inputs consist of a top row containing patterns of Red (2) and Gray (5) pixels, sometimes mixed with Orange (7). Below the top row, the grid is filled with Orange (7) pixels. Outputs retain the top row of the input unchanged, but the Orange (7) area below is modified by adding Red (2) and Gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Core Colors:** The key colors involved in the transformation are Red (2), Gray (5), and the background Orange (7).
3.  **Transformation Process:** The transformation appears to be a row-by-row generation process starting from row 1. The color of a pixel in the output grid depends on the colors of two specific pixels in the row directly above it in the *already processed* output grid. Specifically, the pixel at `(row, col)` depends on the pixels at `(row-1, col-1)` and `(row-1, col+1)`.
4.  **Color Interaction Rule:** A new pixel color is generated only if both source pixels `(row-1, col-1)` and `(row-1, col+1)` are either Red (2) or Gray (5). The specific rules are:
    *   If the two source pixels are the same color (both Red or both Gray), the output pixel becomes the *other* color (Red -> Gray, Gray -> Red).
    *   If the two source pixels are different colors (one Red, one Gray), the output pixel takes the color of the *right* source pixel `(row-1, col+1)`.
5.  **Conditions:** This color generation only occurs if the target pixel `(row, col)` is currently Orange (7). If it's already non-Orange, it remains unchanged. Pixels outside the grid boundaries are treated as Orange (7) for determining source colors.
6.  **Iterative Nature:** The process iterates row by row, with the generation of row `r` depending on the final state of row `r-1`.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - cells: integers 0-9 (colors)
      - background_color: Orange (7)
      - pattern_colors: [Red (2), Gray (5)]
      - structure: Top row has pattern, rows below are initially background color.

objects:
  - object: Pixel Pattern
    location: Top row (row 0) of the input grid.
    properties:
      - composition: Contains Red (2) and Gray (5) pixels, possibly Orange (7).
      - role: Acts as the initial state (seed) for the transformation process.
  - object: Generated Pixels
    location: Rows below the top row (row > 0) in the output grid.
    properties:
      - colors: Red (2) or Gray (5)
      - origin: Generated based on pixels in the row above.
      - condition: Only appear in cells that were initially Orange (7).

relationships:
  - relationship: Pixel Dependency
    from: Pixel at output `(row, col)` where `row > 0`
    to: Pixels at output `(row-1, col-1)` and output `(row-1, col+1)`
    details: The color of `(row, col)` is determined by the colors of the two specified pixels in the row above, provided `(row, col)` is currently Orange (7) and both source pixels are Red (2) or Gray (5).

actions:
  - action: Initialize Output
    actor: System
    target: Output Grid
    result: Output Grid is a copy of the Input Grid.
  - action: Iterate Rows
    actor: System
    target: Output Grid rows `r` from 1 to height-1
    process: For each row, iterate through columns `c` from 0 to width-1.
  - action: Apply Rule
    actor: System
    target: Pixel at output `(r, c)`
    condition: >
      Requires `output_grid[r, c]` to be Orange (7).
      Requires source pixels `output_grid[r-1, c-1]` and `output_grid[r-1, c+1]` (treating out-of-bounds as Orange 7) to be non-Orange (i.e., Red 2 or Gray 5).
    rule:
      - If `src1 == src2`: result = 5 if src1 == 2 else 2
      - If `src1 != src2`: result = src2 (color of right source)
    result: Updates `output_grid[r, c]` with the calculated result color.

constants:
  - name: Red
    value: 2
  - name: Gray
    value: 5
  - name: Orange
    value: 7
  - name: BoundaryColor
    value: 7 # Color to assume for out-of-bounds source pixels

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid, called `output_grid`, initially identical to the `input_grid`.
2.  Iterate through each row of the `output_grid`, starting from the second row (row index 1) down to the last row. Let the current row index be `r`.
3.  Within each row `r`, iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
4.  For the current cell `(r, c)`, check if its color in `output_grid` is Orange (7). If it is not Orange (7), skip the following steps and proceed to the next column `c`.
5.  Identify the two source pixel locations in the row above: `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.
6.  Determine the colors of these source pixels from the `output_grid`. If a source location `(r-1, col)` is outside the grid boundaries (i.e., `col < 0` or `col >= width`), treat its color as Orange (7). Let the left source color be `color1` and the right source color be `color2`.
7.  Check if *both* `color1` and `color2` are non-Orange (i.e., both are Red (2) or Gray (5)). If either source color is Orange (7), do not modify the cell `(r, c)` and proceed to the next column `c`.
8.  If both source colors are non-Orange, apply the transformation rule:
    a.  If `color1` is the same as `color2`:
        i.  If `color1` is Red (2), set the result color to Gray (5).
        ii. If `color1` is Gray (5), set the result color to Red (2).
    b.  If `color1` is different from `color2`:
        i.  Set the result color to be the same as `color2` (the color of the right source pixel).
9.  Update the cell `(r, c)` in the `output_grid` with the calculated result color.
10. After processing all columns `c` for the current row `r`, move to the next row `r+1`.
11. Once all rows from 1 to the end have been processed, the `output_grid` contains the final result. Return the `output_grid`.
