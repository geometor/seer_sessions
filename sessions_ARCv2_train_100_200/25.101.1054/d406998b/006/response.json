            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code implements the hypothesis that a gray pixel remains gray (5) if and only if it has both a South-West (SW) and a South-East (SE) gray neighbor; otherwise, it turns green (3). Testing this code against all training examples reveals that while this rule captures a significant part of the transformation, it fails consistently across all examples.\n\nThe errors primarily fall into two categories:\n1.  **False Green:** The rule predicts Green (3), but the expected output is Gray (5). This happens for gray pixels lacking the required SW+SE support but which, for other reasons, remain stable.\n2.  **False Gray:** The rule predicts Gray (5) (due to SW+SE support), but the expected output is Green (3). This occurs less frequently (only seen in Ex3 and Ex4) and suggests an override condition where even supported pixels become unstable.\n\nAttempts to refine the rule by considering other neighbors (NW, NE, orthogonal), total neighbor counts, or row positions (top/bottom) did not yield a consistent local rule that resolves all discrepancies (as explored during the thought process). The exceptions seem complex and might depend on non-local patterns or configurations beyond the immediate 8 neighbors.\n\nGiven the difficulty in finding a perfect local rule, the most practical strategy is to proceed with the dominant SW+SE pattern, acknowledging its documented failure modes. The following metrics, YAML, and natural language program are based on this primary rule and its observed performance.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics summarize the performance of the simple SW+SE rule (as implemented in the provided code) against the training examples.\n\n"
