task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
  - Output Grid:
      colors: [white (0), gray (5), green (3)]
      size: same as input grid
  - Transformation Type: Local rule based primarily on diagonal neighbors below the pixel.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: { value: 0, 3, 5 }
      position: { row: int, column: int }
      neighbors: # Relative positions relevant to the primary rule
        - sw: (row+1, col-1)
        - se: (row+1, col+1)
actions:
  - name: transform_pixel
    input: pixel P at (r, c) in input_grid
    output: color for pixel P at (r, c) in output_grid
    logic:
      - IF P is white (0), output is white (0).
      - IF P is gray (5):
          - Check if South-West neighbor exists within grid AND is gray (5). Store result as `has_sw_gray`.
          - Check if South-East neighbor exists within grid AND is gray (5). Store result as `has_se_gray`.
          - IF `has_sw_gray` is True AND `has_se_gray` is True:
              Output is gray (5). # Primary rule - applies most of the time
          - ELSE:
              Output is green (3). # Default change when SW+SE support is lacking
rule_notes:
  - This rule is based on the most frequent pattern observed (SW+SE neighbors support gray stability) but is known to be incomplete.
  - Known Failures Type 1 (Rule predicts 3, Expected 5): The rule incorrectly changes some gray pixels to green. These pixels lack the SW+SE support but remain gray in the expected output. Examples are common across all training cases (see metrics output for specific locations). These often appear to be isolated pixels or ends of diagonal lines that are stable despite lacking downward support.
  - Known Failures Type 2 (Rule predicts 5, Expected 3): The rule incorrectly keeps some gray pixels as gray. These pixels *have* SW+SE support but still change to green in the expected output. This is less common, observed only at Ex3(0,9) and Ex4(1,7). The exact condition overriding the SW+SE support is not identified by local neighbor analysis alone.
