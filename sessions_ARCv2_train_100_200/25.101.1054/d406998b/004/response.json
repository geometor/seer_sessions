            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt used a complex rule based on diagonal neighbor configurations and row position, which failed on multiple examples. The analysis revealed significant inconsistencies across the training set when trying to apply simple local rules (based on 8 neighbors).\n\n1.  The initial hypothesis (\"Stay gray IF AND ONLY IF SW and SE neighbors are gray\") was re-tested and found to be incorrect. It fails to keep pixels gray when it should (e.g., Ex1(0,7)) and fails to change pixels to green when it should (e.g., Ex4(1,7)).\n2.  Analysis of neighbor counts (diagonal, orthogonal, total) for pixels staying gray versus changing green did not reveal a simple threshold or condition that works across all examples. Pixels with the same number of neighbors behave differently in different examples or positions.\n3.  Specific cases like Ex2(2,2) (staying gray with 0 neighbors on bottom row) and Ex3(1,8) (staying gray with 4 neighbors, not on bottom row) contradict simple rules based on neighbor count or row position.\n4.  A potential refinement (\"Stay gray if SW+SE, UNLESS total neighbors >= 3\") correctly handles some specific failure cases (Ex3(0,9), Ex4(1,7)) but doesn't address the many pixels that stay gray *without* having SW+SE neighbors.\n\n**Conclusion:** There isn't a straightforward local rule based on the 8 immediate neighbors that perfectly explains the transformation across all examples. The original hypothesis (SW+SE determines the outcome) is the most frequently recurring pattern, but it has clear exceptions.\n\n**Strategy:** Revert to the simplest identified pattern, the SW+SE rule, as the primary hypothesis. Document its known failure points based on the analysis. The coder will implement this rule, acknowledging its limitations.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics are based on the simple rule: \"A gray pixel stays gray (5) if it has BOTH a gray South-West neighbor AND a gray South-East neighbor. Otherwise, it changes to green (3).\"\n\n"
