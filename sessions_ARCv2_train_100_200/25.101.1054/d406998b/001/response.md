"""
Transforms an input grid based on the local neighborhood of gray (5) pixels.

1. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
2. Gray (5) pixels are evaluated based on their South-West (SW) and South-East (SE) neighbors.
3. If a gray pixel has BOTH a gray SW neighbor AND a gray SE neighbor (both within grid bounds), it remains gray (5) in the output.
4. Otherwise, if a gray pixel does NOT meet the condition in step 3 (i.e., missing one or both SW/SE neighbors, or one or both are out of bounds, or one or both are not gray), it changes to green (3) in the output.
