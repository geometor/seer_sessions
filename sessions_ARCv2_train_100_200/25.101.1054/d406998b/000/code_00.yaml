task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      properties:
        colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
        dimensionality: 2D
  - Output Grid:
      properties:
        colors: [white (0), gray (5), green (3)]
        dimensionality: 2D
        size: same as input grid
  - Pixels:
      types:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - green (3)
  - Objects:
      - gray pixels (color 5) are the primary objects subject to transformation.
      - white pixels (color 0) form the background and remain static.
      - green pixels (color 3) are the result of transforming specific gray pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: The transformation rule depends on the 8-neighbor adjacency (orthogonal and diagonal) of gray pixels.
  - Spatial Configuration: The relative positions of gray neighbors, specifically South-West and South-East, are critical.
Transformation:
  - Rule Type: Local, conditional color change.
  - Condition: A gray pixel's transformation depends on whether it has gray neighbors simultaneously located at its South-West and South-East positions.
  - Input Color -> Output Color Mapping:
      - white (0) -> white (0)
      - gray (5) -> green (3) OR gray (5) (conditional)
