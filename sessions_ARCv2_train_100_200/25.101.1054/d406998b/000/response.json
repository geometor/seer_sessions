They either remain gray (5) or change to green (3).\n5.  **Local Rule:** The change appears to depend on the local neighborhood of each gray pixel, specifically the configuration of its gray neighbors.\n6.  **Neighbor Analysis:** Examining the 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) of each gray pixel seems crucial.\n7.  **Key Pattern:** Gray pixels that have *both* a gray neighbor to their South-West and a gray neighbor to their South-East tend to remain gray. Gray pixels not meeting this specific condition tend to change to green.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
