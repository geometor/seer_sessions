If none of the above conditions for changing a gray pixel are met, it defaults to remaining gray (though the logic covers all cases for num_diag 0, 1, 2, 3+).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport copy\n\ndef get_diagonal_neighbors(grid: list[list[int]], r: int, c: int) -> tuple[dict[str, bool], int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the diagonal neighbors of a pixel and counts how many are gray.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        r: The row index of the pixel.\n        c: The column index of the pixel.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        - A dictionary indicating whether each diagonal neighbor (nw, ne, sw, se) is gray (True) or not (False/missing).\n        - An integer count of gray diagonal neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0])\n    neighbors = {\"nw\": False, \"ne\": False, \"sw\": False, \"se\": False}\n    gray_count = 0\n    \n    coords = {\n        \"nw\": (r - 1, c - 1),\n        \"ne\": (r - 1, c + 1),\n        \"sw\": (r + 1, c - 1),\n        \"se\": (r + 1, c + 1),\n    }\n\n    for direction, (nr, nc) in coords.items():\n        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and grid[nr][nc] == 5:\n            neighbors[direction] = True\n            gray_count += 1\n            \n    return neighbors, gray_count\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:  \n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid as a list of lists of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The transformed output grid as a list of lists of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a deep copy of the input grid.\n    # White pixels remain 0, gray pixels start as 5 and might change to 3.\n    output_grid = copy.deepcopy(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Only process gray pixels\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Get diagonal neighbor information\n                neighbors, num_diag = get_diagonal_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                \n                # Check row position\n                is_top = (r == 0)\n                is_bottom = (r == height - 1)\n                \n                # --- Apply transformation rules ---\n                \n                # Default is to keep gray (5), only change to green (3) if a condition is met.\n                output_color = 5 \n\n                # Rule a: V-Top (SW and SE are gray) - Stays gray (handled by default)\n                is_v_top = neighbors[\"sw\"] and neighbors[\"se\"]\n                if is_v_top:\n                    output_color = 5 # Explicitly keep gray\n                \n                # Rule b: Isolated (0 diagonal gray neighbors)\n                elif num_diag == 0:\n                    if is_bottom:\n                        output_color = 5 # Keep gray if on bottom row\n                    else:\n                        output_color = 3 # Change to green if not on bottom row\n                        \n                # Rule c: Anchor-1 (1 diagonal gray neighbor at specific edges)\n                elif num_diag == 1:\n                    is_anchor1 = (is_top and (neighbors[\"sw\"] or neighbors[\"se\"])) or \\\n                                 (is_bottom and (neighbors[\"nw\"] or neighbors[\"ne\"]))\n                    if is_anchor1:\n                        output_color = 5 # Keep gray if anchor\n                    else:\n                        # Rule d: NonAnchor-1 (1 diagonal gray neighbor, not anchor)\n                        output_color = 3 # Change to green if not anchor\n\n                # Rule e: Diag-2 (2 diagonal gray neighbors, not V-Top)\n                elif num_diag == 2 and not is_v_top:\n                    output_color = 3 # Change to green\n\n                # Rule f: Diag-3+ (3 or more diagonal gray neighbors) - Stays gray (handled by default)\n                elif num_diag >= 3:\n                     output_color = 5 # Explicitly keep gray\n                \n                # Update the output grid\n                output_grid[r][c] = output_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
