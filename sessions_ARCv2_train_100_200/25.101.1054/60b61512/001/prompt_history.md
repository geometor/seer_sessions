Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are square grids (9x9 in the examples) containing pixels of different colors, primarily white (0) as background and yellow (4) forming distinct shapes.
2.  **Color Palette:** The key colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and orange (7). White is the background, yellow forms the input shapes, and orange appears in the output grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation keeps the original yellow pixels unchanged. Some white pixels in the input are changed to orange pixels in the output. The positions of the new orange pixels are always adjacent (including diagonally) to the original yellow pixels.
4.  **Pattern:** The orange pixels appear to fill in certain "gaps", "holes", or "concavities" within or immediately adjacent to the yellow shapes. Specifically, examining 2x2 areas seems relevant.

**Analysis of Transformation Rule:**

Several rules were considered:

*   Changing white cells based on the count of adjacent yellow neighbors (Von Neumann or Moore) proved inconsistent across examples.
*   Iterative application of rules did not resolve inconsistencies.
*   A rule based on identifying 2x2 blocks in the input seems most promising, although it doesn't perfectly match every changed pixel in the provided examples.

**Hypothesized Rule (based on 2x2 blocks):**
The transformation identifies specific local patterns in the input grid. It scans the input grid for all 2x2 blocks. If a 2x2 block contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels and one non-yellow pixel (which appears to always be white (0) in the examples), that non-yellow pixel's corresponding location in the output grid is changed to orange (7). All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.

*Self-Correction/Refinement during analysis:* While this 2x2 rule explains many of the changes (e.g., `(2,0)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,7)` in train\_1 and `(2,1)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(6,6)` in train\_2), it does *not* account for the changes observed at `(6,5)` and `(6,7)` in train\_1, nor `(3,0)` and `(3,1)` in train\_2, according to the provided output grids. There might be an additional condition or a more complex rule at play, or potential inaccuracies in the example outputs. However, the 2x2 rule is the most consistent simple pattern identified.

**Facts (YAML):**

  rule_description: >
    Identifies 2x2 pixel blocks in the input grid.
    If a 2x2 block contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels,
    the remaining pixel (typically white (0)) is changed to orange (7)
    in the corresponding position in the output grid.
relationship:
  - The orange pixels in the output are generated in locations that are white in the input.
  - The generation rule depends on the local configuration of yellow pixels surrounding a white pixel, specifically within a 2x2 neighborhood.
uncertainty:
  - The hypothesized 2x2 rule does not perfectly explain all white-to-orange changes in the provided examples (train_1 pixels (6,5), (6,7); train_2 pixels (3,0), (3,1)). There might be additional rules or nuances.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner `(r, c)` of a 2x2 block within the input grid (where `r` ranges from 0 to height-2 and `c` ranges from 0 to width-2).
3.  For each 2x2 block defined by the top-left corner `(r, c)`:
    a.  Examine the four pixels in
 the input grid: `input[r, c]`, `input[r, c+1]`, `input[r+1, c]`, `input[r+1, c+1]`.
    b.  Count how many of these four pixels are yellow (color 4).
    c.  If the count of yellow pixels is exactly 3:
        i.  Identify the location `(r', c')` of the single non-yellow pixel within this 2x2 block.
        ii. Set the pixel at `output[r', c']` to orange (color 7).
4.  Return the final output grid.
