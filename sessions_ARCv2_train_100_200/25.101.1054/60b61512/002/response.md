## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis identified a promising rule based on 2x2 blocks: if a 2x2 block in the input contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels, the remaining pixel is changed to orange (7) in the output. The provided code implements this rule.

However, the execution results show mismatches between the code's output and the expected output for both training examples. Specifically, the code fails to change certain white pixels to orange that are expected to change, and in one instance during manual analysis (later refuted by re-checking code logic), it seemed the code might change a pixel that wasn't expected to change.

Several alternative hypotheses were explored:
1.  Changing white pixels based on the count of yellow neighbors (Moore neighborhood). This failed due to overlaps in neighbor counts between pixels that change and pixels that do not.
2.  Changing white pixels based on specific configurations of neighbors (e.g., orthogonal pairs, diagonal pairs, 'L' shapes). These rules captured some cases but failed to generalize or missed other required changes.
3.  Combining the 2x2 rule with secondary rules for missed cases. No simple secondary rule was found.
4.  Checking if changing a white pixel would complete a 2x2 block of non-background colors in the output. This also failed to explain all cases.

**Discrepancy Resolution Strategy:**
The core issue is the discrepancy between the code's predicted output (based on the 2x2 rule) and the target expected output. There are three possibilities:
1.  The 2x2 rule is correct, but the provided expected outputs are flawed.
2.  The 2x2 rule is correct, but the provided code or its reported execution results are flawed.
3.  The 2x2 rule is incorrect or incomplete, and a more complex rule is needed.

Assuming the expected outputs are the ground truth, the 2x2 rule is insufficient. The analysis failed to find a single, simple, alternative rule that covers all cases consistently. The most successful rule remains the 2x2 pattern, which correctly identifies 7 out of the 11 total white-to-orange changes across both examples.

The strategy moving forward is to document the transformation based on the observed changes in the expected outputs, acknowledging that the simple 2x2 rule is incomplete. The most likely scenario is a rule based on identifying specific local patterns (like the 2x2=3Y+1W pattern) and possibly other specific neighborhood configurations that signify a 'concave' point relative to the yellow shapes.

## Metrics Gathering

Code was used to accurately count the number of yellow (4) neighbors (Moore neighborhood) for relevant white (0) pixels in the input grids.

**Summary of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1 Changed Pixels (White -> Orange):**
    *   (2, 0): 5 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (5, 5): 4 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (5, 7): 4 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (6, 5): 2 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (6, 7): 2 Yellow Neighbors
*   **Example 2 Changed Pixels (White -> Orange):**
    *   (2, 1): 6 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (3, 0): 1 Yellow Neighbor
    *   (3, 1): 3 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (4, 7): 3 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (5, 5): 4 Yellow Neighbors
    *   (6, 6): 4 Yellow Neighbors
*   **Unchanged White Pixels with Yellow Neighbors:** Counts range from 1 to 4 yellow neighbors. Notably, white pixels with 1, 2, 3, or 4 yellow neighbors exist that *do not* change, overlapping with counts for pixels that *do* change.

  rule_description: >
    Identifies white pixels (0) in the input grid that meet specific
    local neighborhood conditions based on adjacent yellow (4) pixels.
    These identified white pixels are changed to orange (7) in the output grid.
    The conditions appear related to filling 'concave' corners or completing
    local patterns. One condition involves a 2x2 block containing three yellows
    and the white pixel in question. Other conditions apply when this 2x2 rule
    doesn't, but the exact criteria are complex and not fully resolved (based
    on neighbor counts 1, 2, or 3 in specific configurations).
relationship:
  - Orange pixels only appear in the output where white pixels existed in the input.
  - The placement of orange pixels depends entirely on the configuration of nearby yellow pixels in the input grid.
  - The transformation seems aimed at making the yellow shapes 'locally solid' by filling certain types of adjacent white pixels.
uncertainty:
  - The precise, complete rule governing which white pixels change to orange is not definitively determined. The simple 2x2=3Y+1W rule is insufficient.
  - Neighbor count alone is insufficient to determine the change.
  - Specific local 3x3 patterns seem crucial, but a comprehensive list or generalized rule covering all cases (including the exceptions to the 2x2 rule) was not found.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
3.  If the pixel `input[r, c]` is white (color 0):
    a.  Check if its local neighborhood in the input grid matches *any* of the conditions required for it to be changed to orange (color 7). These conditions include, but may not be limited to:
        i.  **Condition 1 (2x2 Fill):** The pixel `(r, c)` is part of a 2x2 block (i.e., blocks with top-left corners at `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, or `(r, c)`) in the input grid that contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels and this one white (0) pixel.
        ii. **Condition 2 (Other Concavities):** The pixel `(r, c)` and its yellow neighbors form another specific pattern indicating a concavity that needs filling (These specific patterns cover cases like `input1[6,5]`, `input1[6,7]`, `input2[3,0]`, `input2[3,1]` which are not covered by Condition 1). *[Note: The exact definition of these other patterns requires further analysis or examples.]*
    b.  If *any* of the required conditions are met, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output[r, c]` to orange (color 7).
4.  Return the final output grid.
