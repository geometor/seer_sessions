            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis identified a promising rule based on 2x2 blocks: if a 2x2 block in the input contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels, the remaining pixel is changed to orange (7) in the output. The provided code implements this rule.\n\nHowever, the execution results show mismatches between the code's output and the expected output for both training examples. Specifically, the code fails to change certain white pixels to orange that are expected to change, and in one instance during manual analysis (later refuted by re-checking code logic), it seemed the code might change a pixel that wasn't expected to change.\n\nSeveral alternative hypotheses were explored:\n1.  Changing white pixels based on the count of yellow neighbors (Moore neighborhood). This failed due to overlaps in neighbor counts between pixels that change and pixels that do not.\n2.  Changing white pixels based on specific configurations of neighbors (e.g., orthogonal pairs, diagonal pairs, 'L' shapes). These rules captured some cases but failed to generalize or missed other required changes.\n3.  Combining the 2x2 rule with secondary rules for missed cases. No simple secondary rule was found.\n4.  Checking if changing a white pixel would complete a 2x2 block of non-background colors in the output. This also failed to explain all cases.\n\n**Discrepancy Resolution Strategy:**\nThe core issue is the discrepancy between the code's predicted output (based on the 2x2 rule) and the target expected output. There are three possibilities:\n1.  The 2x2 rule is correct, but the provided expected outputs are flawed.\n2.  The 2x2 rule is correct, but the provided code or its reported execution results are flawed.\n3.  The 2x2 rule is incorrect or incomplete, and a more complex rule is needed.\n\nAssuming the expected outputs are the ground truth, the 2x2 rule is insufficient. The analysis failed to find a single, simple, alternative rule that covers all cases consistently. The most successful rule remains the 2x2 pattern, which correctly identifies 7 out of the 11 total white-to-orange changes across both examples.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is to document the transformation based on the observed changes in the expected outputs, acknowledging that the simple 2x2 rule is incomplete. The most likely scenario is a rule based on identifying specific local patterns (like the 2x2=3Y+1W pattern) and possibly other specific neighborhood configurations that signify a 'concave' point relative to the yellow shapes.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nCode was used to accurately count the number of yellow (4) neighbors (Moore neighborhood) for relevant white (0) pixels in the input grids.\n\n"
