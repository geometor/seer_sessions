  rule_description: >
    Identifies white pixels (0) in the input grid that meet specific
    local neighborhood conditions based on adjacent yellow (4) pixels.
    These identified white pixels are changed to orange (7) in the output grid.
    The conditions appear related to filling 'concave' corners or completing
    local patterns. One condition involves a 2x2 block containing three yellows
    and the white pixel in question. Other conditions apply when this 2x2 rule
    doesn't, but the exact criteria are complex and not fully resolved (based
    on neighbor counts 1, 2, or 3 in specific configurations).
relationship:
  - Orange pixels only appear in the output where white pixels existed in the input.
  - The placement of orange pixels depends entirely on the configuration of nearby yellow pixels in the input grid.
  - The transformation seems aimed at making the yellow shapes 'locally solid' by filling certain types of adjacent white pixels.
uncertainty:
  - The precise, complete rule governing which white pixels change to orange is not definitively determined. The simple 2x2=3Y+1W rule is insufficient.
  - Neighbor count alone is insufficient to determine the change.
  - Specific local 3x3 patterns seem crucial, but a comprehensive list or generalized rule covering all cases (including the exceptions to the 2x2 rule) was not found.
