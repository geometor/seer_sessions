  rule_description: >
    Identifies 2x2 pixel blocks in the input grid.
    If a 2x2 block contains exactly three yellow (4) pixels,
    the remaining pixel (typically white (0)) is changed to orange (7)
    in the corresponding position in the output grid.
relationship:
  - The orange pixels in the output are generated in locations that are white in the input.
  - The generation rule depends on the local configuration of yellow pixels surrounding a white pixel, specifically within a 2x2 neighborhood.
uncertainty:
  - The hypothesized 2x2 rule does not perfectly explain all white-to-orange changes in the provided examples (train_1 pixels (6,5), (6,7); train_2 pixels (3,0), (3,1)). There might be additional rules or nuances.
