            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt used a pattern-matching approach, defining a set of specific relative coordinate configurations of yellow neighbors (`TRIGGER_PATTERNS`) that should cause a central white pixel to turn orange. This code produced significantly *worse* results than the initial code based purely on the \"2x2 block with 3 yellow pixels\" rule.\n\n*   **Error Type:** The pattern-matching code generated numerous **false positives** \u2013 it changed white pixels to orange when they should have remained white according to the expected output. This indicates that the extracted neighbor patterns, while present in the locations that *should* change, are *also* present in locations that *should not* change. The patterns themselves are not specific enough or lack necessary context.\n*   **Comparison:** The initial code implementing only the 2x2 rule was much closer to the target outputs, only missing two specific pixel changes in each example (false negatives). The pattern-matching code, while attempting to capture those missing pixels, introduced many more errors.\n*   **Conclusion:** The core transformation logic is very likely related to the 2x2 block rule. The discrepancies between the 2x2 rule's output and the expected output might stem from either a slight variation in the rule not yet captured, or potential inaccuracies in the provided expected outputs themselves. Given the failure of the broader pattern-matching, the most reliable approach is to revert to the 2x2 rule as the primary hypothesis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Revert to the logic based on the \"2x2 block contains 3 yellow pixels and 1 white pixel\" rule.\n2.  Explicitly verify which pixels are correctly/incorrectly handled by this rule compared to the expected outputs.\n3.  Document the transformation based on this rule, acknowledging the specific pixels it fails to predict according to the examples.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's re-evaluate the performance of the original \"2x2 rule\" code against the expected outputs to pinpoint the discrepancies accurately.\n\n*Code execution to check the 2x2 rule's predictions:*\n\n"
