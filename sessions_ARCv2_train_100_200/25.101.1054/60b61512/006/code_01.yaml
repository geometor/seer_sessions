task_context:
  grid_size: 9x9 in examples, potentially variable.
  colors_used:
    - white (0) - background
    - yellow (4) - input shapes
    - orange (7) - output derived color
objects:
  - type: shapes
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Contiguous blocks of yellow pixels forming distinct shapes. Remain unchanged in the output.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The background color. Some white pixels change to orange based on a local rule.
transformation:
  type: local_pattern_fill_2x2
  input_pixels_preserved:
    - yellow (4)
    - white (0) pixels not meeting the rule
    - all other colors (if any were present)
  input_pixels_changed:
    - white (0) pixels that are part of a specific 2x2 pattern.
  output_pixels_created:
    - orange (7)
  rule_description: >
    The primary transformation rule identifies 2x2 blocks within the input grid.
    If a 2x2 block consists of exactly three yellow (4) pixels and one white (0) pixel,
    the white pixel's location in the output grid is changed to orange (7).
    All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
relationship:
  - Orange pixels only appear in the output where white pixels existed in the input.
  - The transformation rule is local, depending only on the 2x2 neighborhood containing a white pixel.
uncertainty:
  - This 2x2 rule successfully predicts the majority of the transformations in the training examples.
  - However, it fails to account for a small number of white-to-orange changes present in the expected outputs (specifically at (6,5), (6,7) in example 1 and (3,0), (3,1) in example 2). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear - it could be an additional rule, an edge case, or an inaccuracy in the provided examples.
