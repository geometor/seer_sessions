"""
Transforms the input grid by changing specific white (0) pixels to orange (7).
The transformation rule is based on identifying white pixels whose Moore
neighborhood (8 surrounding cells) contains yellow (4) pixels arranged in
specific patterns. If the set of relative coordinates of a white pixel's
yellow neighbors exactly matches one of the predefined 'trigger patterns'
derived from the training examples, the white pixel is changed to orange.
All other pixels retain their original color.
