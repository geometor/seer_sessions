            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code, based on the \"2x2 block with 3 yellow pixels\" rule, failed to correctly reproduce the expected outputs for both training examples. Specifically, it missed transforming certain white pixels to orange: `(6, 5)` and `(6, 7)` in example 1, and `(3, 0)` and `(3, 1)` in example 2. This indicates the initial rule, while capturing a significant part of the transformation, is incomplete.\n\nThe strategy is to analyze the local neighborhood (specifically, the configuration of yellow neighbors) of the white pixels that *do* change in the expected output, comparing them with those that *don't*. The goal is to identify a more comprehensive set of rules or patterns that correctly predict all transformations. Analysis suggests the transformation is based on identifying specific local configurations of yellow neighbors around a white pixel, corresponding to different types of \"concave\" geometries or points needing filling.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nThe following code analyzes the input grids to find all white pixels that change to orange in the output, and records the relative coordinates of their yellow neighbors (Moore neighborhood). This helps identify the specific local patterns associated with the transformation.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
