The order is determined by scanning the input grid along successive anti-diagonals (where `row + column` is constant, starting from 0). Add each unique non-white color to the sequence `S` the *first* time it is encountered during this scan. Let the length of `S` be `N`.\n4.  **Determine First Color Position:** Record the coordinates `(r0, c0)` where the *first* color added to the sequence `S` (i.e., `S[0]`) appears in the input grid during the anti-diagonal scan.\n5.  **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the pattern offset `k` using the formula `k = -(r0 + c0) mod N`. Note that the modulo operation should handle negative results correctly to produce an offset in the range `[0, N-1]`.\n6.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n7.  **Fill Output Grid:** For each cell in the new grid at position (`row`, `col`):\n    *   Calculate the index `idx = (row + col + k) mod N`.\n    *   Set the color of the cell (`row`, `col`) to the color at index `idx` in the sequence `S` (i.e., `S[idx]`).\n8.  **Finalize:** The fully filled new grid is the output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by tiling a diagonal pattern based on the sequence of unique non-white colors found in the input.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1. Find unique non-white colors and their order of appearance by scanning anti-diagonals.\n    2. Determine the coordinates (r0, c0) of the first appearance of the first color in the sequence.\n    3.
