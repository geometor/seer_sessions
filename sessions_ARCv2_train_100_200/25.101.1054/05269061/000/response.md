*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input is a square grid (7x7 in all examples) containing mostly white pixels (0) and a few scattered non-white pixels.
    *   The output is also a square grid of the same dimensions (7x7) but is completely filled with non-white pixels.
    *   The non-white pixels in the output grid form a repeating diagonal pattern.
    *   The specific colors used in the output pattern are exactly the unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
    *   The number of unique non-white colors in the input determines the cycle length of the repeating pattern (3 in all examples).
    *   The order of colors within the repeating sequence seems to be determined by the spatial arrangement or order of appearance of the unique colors in the input. Specifically, scanning along anti-diagonals (constant `row + column`) seems to establish the sequence order.
    *   The starting color of the pattern at the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid appears to define an offset for the diagonal pattern rule `(row + column + offset) % sequence_length`.

        # This seems circular based on observation, as k depends on output[0,0].
        # Re-evaluation: Maybe the offset is determined directly from the input?
        # Let's check input positions.
        # train_1: S=[1,2,4], k=1. Input colors start at r+c=2 (1 at (0,2)), r+c=3 (1 at (1,2), 2 at(0,3)), r+c=4 (1 at(2,2), 2 at(1,3), 4 at(0,4))...
        #   Minimum r+c for first color (1) is 2. Minimum r+c for second color (2) is 3. Minimum r+c for third color (4) is 4. Sum = 2+3+4 = 9. 9 % 3 = 0. Doesn't match k=1.
        #   Maybe k depends on the index of the *first* color found in the sequence?
        #   train_1: First color found is 1 (at r+c=2). Index of 1 in S=[1,2,4] is 0. k=1. No direct match.
        #   train_2: First color found is 2 (at r+c=0). Index of 2 in S=[2,8,3] is 0. k=0. Match!
        #   train_3: First color found is 8 (at r+c=4). Index of 8 in S=[8,3,4] is 0. k=2. No direct match.
        # Let's stick with the observation: k is the index of output[0,0] in S. While this seems predictive, it might be derivable from input structure in a way not yet clear, or it might be constant for specific sequence types. Let's assume for now the relationship k = index(output[0,0], S) holds and might be simplified later.
        # For the natural language program, we will use the observed relationship.
        input: color_sequence S, output_grid[0,0] # Ideally derived from input only

      - action: generate_output_grid
        input: input_grid dimensions (H, W), color_sequence S, pattern_offset k
        output: output_grid
        method: For each cell (row, col) from (0,0) to (H-1, W-1), calculate color = S[ (row + col + k) % N ], where N is the length of S. Assign this color to output_grid[row, col].

*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Identify Colors:** Find all unique non-white pixel colors present in the input grid. Let this set be `C`.
3.  **Determine Sequence:** Create an ordered sequence `S` from the colors in `C`. The order is determined by scanning the input grid along successive anti-diagonals (where `row + column` is constant, starting from 0). For each anti-diagonal, find the non-white pixels. Add any color from `C` to the sequence `S` the *first* time it is encountered during this scan. Continue until all colors from `C` are in `S`. Let the length of `S` be `N`.
4.  **Determine Offset:** Determine the pattern offset `k`. (*Observationally, this offset `k` is the index within the sequence `S` of the color that appears at the top-left corner (0,0) of the corresponding output grid. The exact rule to determine `k` purely from the input needs further refinement, but for implementation, we'll assume `k` can be found.* Let's re-evaluate the examples based on the first color's position and the sequence.
    *   train\_1: S=[1, 2, 4]. First color 1 appears first at (0,2). r+c = 2. `k = (index_in_S(1) - (0+2)) mod 3 = (0 - 2) mod 3 = -2 mod 3 = 1`. Matches k=1.
    *   train\_2: S=[2, 8, 3]. First color 2 appears first at (0,0). r+c = 0. `k = (index_in_S(2) - (0+0)) mod 3 = (0 - 0) mod 3 = 0`. Matches k=0.
    *   train\_3: S=[8, 3, 4]. First color 8 appears first at (0,4). r+c = 4. `k = (index_in_S(8) - (0+4)) mod 3 = (0 - 4) mod 3 = -4 mod 3 = 2`. Matches k=2.
    *   **Refined Offset Rule:** Find the coordinates `(r0, c0)` where the *first* color of the sequence `S` (i.e., `S[0]`) first appears in the input grid. The offset `k` is calculated as `k = (0 - (r0 + c0)) mod N`, which simplifies to `k = -(r0 + c0) mod N`.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6.  **Fill Output Grid:** For each cell in the new grid at position (`row`, `col`):
    *   Calculate the index `idx = (row + col + k) mod N`.
    *   Set the color of the cell (`row`, `col`) to the color at index `idx` in the sequence `S` (i.e., `S[idx]`).
7.  **Finalize:** The fully filled new grid is the output.
