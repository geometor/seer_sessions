actions:
  - name: analyze_input_column
    actor: transformation_rule
    object: input_grid
    details: Calculate the sum of values in the third column (index 2).
  - name: select_output_pattern
    actor: transformation_rule
    object: pattern_A or pattern_B
    details: Choose which pattern becomes the output_grid based on the analysis result.

relationships:
  - type: determines
    subject: sum of input_grid's third column
    object: selection between pattern_A and pattern_B
    condition: If sum >= 32, select pattern_A; otherwise, select pattern_B.
  - type: assignment
    subject: selected pattern (pattern_A or pattern_B)
    object: output_grid
    details: The selected pattern becomes the final output grid.
