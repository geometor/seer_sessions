These likely represent two states, such as off/on or empty/filled.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves a reduction in grid size from 6x6 to 5x5. Crucially, the output grid does not seem to be a direct subgrid or simple modification (like element-wise changes) of the input.\n4.  **Output Patterns:** Observing the outputs across the examples reveals that there are only two distinct output grids generated:\n    *   **Pattern A** (for inputs 1 and 2):\n        "

(Sum = 8\\*4 = 32)\n    *   Inputs 3, 4, and 5 each have three 8s in their third column. (Sum = 8\\*3 = 24)\n7.  **Rule Hypothesis:** The rule is likely: If the sum of the elements in the third column (index 2) of the input grid is 32 (or greater), output Pattern A. Otherwise, output Pattern B.\n\n## Factual Analysis (YAML)\n\n"
