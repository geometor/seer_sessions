            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids of numbers (specifically, single digits). The grid dimensions appear consistent (9x9 in the examples).\n2.  **Key Values:** The input grids primarily contain the numbers '6' and '7'. The output grids contain '7' along with other numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9).\n3.  **Background Value:** The number '7' seems to act as a static background. Its position and value largely remain unchanged from input to output.\n4.  **Target Value:** The number '6' in the input is the target for transformation. All '6's are replaced by other numbers in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate on connected groups (components) of '6's. Cells containing '6' that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) form a single component.\n6.  **Component Replacement:** Each connected component of '6's in the input is replaced entirely by a *single*, uniform number in the output.\n7.  **Replacement Rule:** The specific number used for replacement depends on the properties of the component. Observing the examples, the size (number of cells) of the component is a primary factor. Furthermore, for components of size 3, the shape (specifically, whether it forms a straight line or an L-shape) determines the replacement value.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
