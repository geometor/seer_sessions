task_description: Extract the bounding box of a specific object from an input grid based on density.

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    rows: 10
    columns: 10
    cell_type: digit (0-9)
    properties:
      - background_value: 0
      - objects:
          description: Connected components of identical non-zero digits.
          connectivity: orthogonal (up, down, left, right)
          count_per_example: 3 (observed)

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - content: Subgrid extracted from the input grid.
      - source: Corresponds to the bounding box of a selected object from the input.
