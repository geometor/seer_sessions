Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** A 10x10 grid containing numerical digits. The digit '0' represents the background. Non-zero digits represent different 'colors' or 'types' of objects.
2.  **Objects:** Within the input grid, there are distinct shapes formed by connected cells of the same non-zero digit. Connectivity appears to be orthogonal (up, down, left, right), not diagonal. Each example seems to contain exactly three distinct non-zero objects.
3.  **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid, also containing digits. The content of the output grid appears to be a direct copy of a specific portion of the input grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify which specific object from the input grid should be selected and then extract the rectangular region (bounding box) enclosing that object to form the output.

**Discerning the Logic:**

*   The selection of the object doesn't seem based solely on color value, size (number of cells), or bounding box area alone, as different examples prioritize objects differently based on these individual metrics.
*   Let's consider the "density" of each object within its bounding box (number of object cells / total cells in bounding box).
    *   **Train 1:**
        *   Object 4: 4 cells / (2x2 area) = density 1.0
        *   Object 8: 6 cells / (2x4 area) = density 0.75
        *   Object 2: 7 cells / (2x4 area) = density 0.875
        *   Highest density is 1.0 (Object 4). Output is the bounding box of Object 4.
    *   **Train 2:**
        *   Object 2: 5 cells / (2x4 area) = density 0.625
        *   Object 7: 4 cells / (2x3 area) = density ~0.667
        *   Object 6: 6 cells / (2x4 area) = density 0.75
        *   Highest density is 0.75 (Object 6). Output is the bounding box of Object 6.
    *   **Train 3:**
        *   Object 3: 4 cells / (3x3 area) = density ~0.444
        *   Object 5: 6 cells / (2x4 area) = density 0.75
        *   Object 8: 7 cells / (2x5 area) = density 0.70
        *   Highest density is 0.75 (Object 5). Output is the bounding box of Object 5.

*   The consistent rule appears to be: identify the object with the highest density within its own bounding box and output that bounding box.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all distinct objects, where an object is a group of connected cells having the same non-zero digit. Consider cells connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same object.
2.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its cells).
    b.  Count the number of cells belonging to the object (its "mass").
    c.  Calculate the area of its bounding box (height * width).
    d.  Calculate the object's density by dividing its mass by its bounding box area.
3.  Select the object that has the highest density value.
4.  Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid that falls within the bounding box of the selected highest-density object.
