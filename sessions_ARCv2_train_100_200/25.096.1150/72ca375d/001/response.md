"""
Identify all distinct objects (connected components of the same non-zero digit) in the input grid.
For each object, calculate its bounding box (smallest rectangle containing all its cells).
Calculate the object's "mass" (number of cells belonging to the object).
Calculate the area of the object's bounding box (height * width).
Calculate the object's density (mass / area).
Select the object with the highest density.
Return the subgrid from the input corresponding to the bounding box of the selected highest-density object.
