Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Dimensions:** The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output (10 rows x 8 columns in the examples).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves selectively changing specific integer values within the grid. The changes are not uniform; they depend on the *position* (specifically, the column) of the value being changed.
4.  **Target Value:** In each example pair, there seems to be one specific integer value that is subject to modification (e.g., `4` in `train_1`, `0` in `train_2`).
5.  **Conditional Replacement:** If a cell contains the target value, its value in the output grid is determined by its column index. Cells *not* containing the target value retain their original value.
6.  **Column-Based Rules:** A specific set of rules maps column indices to replacement values for the target integer. These rules appear unique to each task instance.

**Facts (YAML):**

        - column_indices: [0, 1]

        - column_indices: [3, 4]
          replacement_value: 5
        - column_indices: [6]
          replacement_value: 2
        - default: keep_original # For target value 4 in other columns
      example_2: # target_value = 0
        - column_indices: [0, 1, 2]
          replacement_value: 3
        - column_indices: [4]
          replacement_value: 9
        - column_indices: [6, 7]
          replacement_value: 4
        - default: keep_original # For target value 0 in columns 3, 5
  unmodified_elements:
    description: All cells whose value does not match the target_value remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new grid (`output_grid`) as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  **Identify Target:** Determine the specific integer `target_value` that undergoes transformation in this task instance (e.g., 4 or 0).
3.  **Define Column Rules:** Establish the set of rules mapping column indices to replacement values for the `target_value`. This includes:
    *   Which columns trigger a replacement.
    *   What the replacement value is for each specified column (or group of columns).
    *   Implicitly, that the `target_value` remains unchanged if its column is not mentioned in the rules.
4.  **Iterate and Transform:** Go through each cell of the `input_grid`, accessing its row index `r`, column index `c`, and value `v`.
5.  **Apply Rules:**
    *   Check if the current cell's value `v` is equal to the `target_value`.
    *   If `v` matches the `target_value`:
        *   Check if the current column index `c` corresponds to any defined replacement rule.
        *   If a rule exists for column `c`, update the cell at `output_grid[r][c]` with the specified replacement value.
        *   If no rule exists for column `c`, the cell `output_grid[r][c]` retains the `target_value` (as it was copied initially).
    *   If `v` does not match the `target_value`, the cell `output_grid[r][c]` remains unchanged from the initial copy.
6.  **Finalize:** Return the completed `output_grid`.

"""
Transforms a 2D grid of integers by conditionally replacing occurrences of a specific 
target integer based on their column index.

The transformation logic identifies a 'target_value' (the integer to be potentially replaced).
It then defines a set of rules mapping specific column indices to replacement values. 
The grid is iterated through cell by cell. If a cell's value matches the 'target_value' 
and its column index has a corresponding rule, the value in the output grid is updated 
with the replacement value specified by the rule. If a cell's value matches the 
'target_value' but its column index does not have a specific rule, or if the cell's 
value does not match the 'target_value' at all, the original value is retained 
in the output grid.

The specific target_value and column-to-replacement rules are derived from the 
provided training examples and hardcoded for this specific transformation instance. 
Based on train_1: target_value = 4, rules = {0: 6, 1: 6, 3: 5, 4: 5, 5: 6, 6: 2}.
Based on train_2: target_value = 0, rules = {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 3, 4: 9, 6: 4, 7: 4}.

Note: This implementation assumes the rules for 'train_1' apply, as a general method
to deduce rules from only the input grid is not specified.
