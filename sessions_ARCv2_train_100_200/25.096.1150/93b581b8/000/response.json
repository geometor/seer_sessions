            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these grid examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a 6x6 grid containing mostly zeros, except for a single 2x2 block of non-zero integers. The location of this 2x2 block varies between examples (top-left at (1,1) in train_1, top-left at (2,2) in train_2 and train_3).\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output is also a 6x6 grid. It retains the original 2x2 non-zero block from the input in the exact same position. Additionally, four new patterns of numbers appear in the corners of the output grid.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation involves two main parts:\n    *   Copying the original 2x2 block.\n    *   Generating four corner patterns based on the *values* and *location* of the original 2x2 block.\n4.  **Corner Pattern Values:** The values used in the corner patterns are derived directly from the values within the input 2x2 block. Let the input block be `[[A, B], [C, D]]`. The mapping appears to be:\n    *   Value `D` (bottom-right of input block) is used for the top-left corner pattern.\n    *   Value `C` (bottom-left of input block) is used for the top-right corner pattern.\n    *   Value `B` (top-right of input block) is used for the bottom-left corner pattern.\n    *   Value `A` (top-left of input block) is used for the bottom-right corner pattern.\n5.  **Corner Pattern Shapes/Locations:** The shape, size, and exact placement of these corner patterns depend critically on the coordinates `(r, c)` of the top-left cell of the input 2x2 block.\n    *   When the input block is at `(1, 1)` (train_1), the corner patterns are placed starting at `(0,0)`, `(0,3)`, `(3,0)`, and `(3,3)` respectively, and have varying shapes (single cell, row segment, column segment, 2x2 block).\n    *   When the input block is at `(2, 2)` (train_2, train_3), the corner patterns are placed starting at `(0,0)`, `(0,4)`, `(4,0)`, and `(4,4)` respectively, and all have a 2x2 block shape, filled entirely with the corresponding value (D, C, B, or A).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
