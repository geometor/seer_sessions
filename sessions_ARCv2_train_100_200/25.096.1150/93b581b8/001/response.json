Let the top-left corner of this block be at coordinates (r, c). Let the values in the block be:\n    A = input_grid[r][c]\n    B = input_grid[r][c+1]\n    C = input_grid[r+1][c]\n    D = input_grid[r+1][c+1]\n\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n\n3.  **Generate Corner Patterns:** Modify the output grid by adding patterns in the corners. The shape, location, and value of these patterns depend on the coordinates (r, c) of the input block.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Input block at (1, 1)** (i.e., r=1, c=1)\n        *   Top-Left: Place value D at (0, 0).\n        *   Top-Right: Place value C in cells (0, 3) and (0, 4).\n        *   Bottom-Left: Place value B in cells (3, 0) and (4, 0).\n        *   Bottom-Right: Place value A in a 2x2 block starting at (3, 3).\n\n    *   **Case 2: Input block at (2, 2)** (i.e., r=2, c=2)\n        *   Top-Left: Place value D in a 2x2 block starting at (0, 0).\n        *   Top-Right: Place value C in a 2x2 block starting at (0, 4).\n        *   Bottom-Left: Place value B in a 2x2 block starting at (4, 0).\n        *   Bottom-Right: Place value A in a 2x2 block starting at (4, 4).\n\n4.  **Return Result:** The modified grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_block_location(grid_np: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the top-left corner (r, c) of the 2x2 non-zero block.\"\"\"\n    h, w = grid_np.shape\n    for r in range(h -
