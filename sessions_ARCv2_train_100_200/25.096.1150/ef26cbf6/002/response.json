            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code failed because the logic derived primarily from `train_1` was too simplistic and didn't generalize correctly to `train_2`. Specifically:\n\n1.  **First Segment Rule:** The assumption that the first segment *always* uses its internal unique key (if one exists) for replacement was partially correct but incomplete. `train_2` showed that if the first segment has *multiple* keys, no replacement occurs.\n2.  **Subsequent Segment Rule:** The assumption that subsequent segments *always* use the keys from the immediately preceding segment based on vertical regions was incorrect. `train_1` showed that subsequent segments might *also* use their own internal unique key if one exists. `train_2` showed that if a subsequent segment has *no* internal keys, *then* it uses the keys from the preceding segment based on regions.\n\nThe refined strategy is to analyze each segment independently:\n\n1.  Determine the number of unique key digits (non-0, non-1, non-4) within the current segment.\n2.  Determine the mapping of vertical regions to the first key digit found within that region for the current segment.\n3.  Apply replacement rules based on the number of unique keys found:\n    *   **One unique key:** Replace all '1's in the segment with that key.\n    *   **Zero unique keys:** Replace '1's based on the region-key mapping from the *last segment that had keys*.\n    *   **Multiple unique keys:** Do not replace '1's in this segment.\n4.  Update the \"memory\" of the last segment's region-key mapping *only if* the current segment contained any key digits.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze the differences programmatically.\n\n"

            "text": "**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The errors occur in the second and third segments (after the first and second horizontal separators). The code correctly processed the first segment (replacing 1s with 7) but failed to replace the 1s in subsequent segments. The expected output replaces 1s with 3 in the second segment and 8 in the third segment. Notably, 3 is the key digit *within* the second segment, and 8 is the key digit *within* the third segment. This confirms the hypothesis that segments with a single unique internal key use that key for replacement.\n*   **Example 2:** The errors occur only in the second segment (after the horizontal separator). The first segment had multiple keys (3, 2, 6), and the code correctly left the 1s unchanged, matching the expected output. The second segment contains only 0s, 1s, and 4s (no internal keys). The code made *some* replacements but not all, and some were incorrect (e.g., `(5,1)` became 3 instead of expected 3, `(6,1)` became 3 instead of expected 3, `(6,9)` became 6 instead of expected 6 - wait, these seem correct in the actual output trace but wrong in the diff? Let me recheck the provided `actual_2`). Ah, the `actual_2` provided in the prompt seems inconsistent with the code's likely logic based on the previous description. The `code_output` diffs are likely based on the *actual* execution trace from the test run. The `code_output` shows that the code failed to replace many `1`s and replaced others incorrectly according to the expected output. The expected output clearly uses the keys from the *first* segment (3, 2, 6) applied according to the *region* of the `1` in the second segment. This confirms the hypothesis for segments with *no* internal keys.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
