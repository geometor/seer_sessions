Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output consist of multiple rows, each containing a sequence of single-digit integers. The number of rows and the length of rows can vary between examples, but within a single example pair, the number of rows remains the same, and the length of output rows is one less than the input rows.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation applied to each row is the removal of its first element. The remaining elements in the row maintain their relative order.
3.  **Row Ordering:** The key difference between examples lies in the final ordering of the transformed rows.
    *   In Example 1, the transformed rows maintain their original relative order from the input.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the transformed rows are reordered. Observing these examples reveals that the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically (treating each row as a sequence for comparison).
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The difference in ordering behavior (preserving order vs. sorting) seems to depend on a specific condition related to the input. Comparing the inputs, the distinguishing factor appears to be the value of the very first element (top-left corner) of the input grid.
    *   If the top-left element is `2` (as in Example 1), the original order is preserved.
    *   If the top-left element is `6` (as in Examples 2 and 3), the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers.
  elements:
    - object: row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers within the grid.
      properties:
        - index: The original position (0-based) of the row in the input grid.
        - elements: The sequence of integers in the row.
        - first_element: The integer at the first position of the row.
    - object: top_left_element
      description: The integer located at the first row and first column of the input grid.
      properties:
        - value: The numerical value of the element.

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  elements:
    - object: transformed_row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers, derived from an input row by removing its first element.
      properties:
        - elements: The sequence of integers remaining after removal.

Transformation:
  actions:
    - name: remove_first_element
      input: row
      output: transformed_row
      description: Removes the element at the first position of an input row.
    - name: conditional_sort
      input: list_of_transformed_rows, top_left_element_value
      output: sorted_list_of_transformed_rows
      description: >
        Orders the list of transformed_rows.
        If the top_left_element_value is 2, the original relative order is maintained.
        Otherwise (e.g., if it's 6), the rows are sorted lexicographically.
  relationships:
    - The final order of rows in the output grid depends on the value of the top_left_element of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid of numbers.
2.  Identify the value of the element in the top-left corner (first row, first column). Let this be `control_value`.
3.  Create a list to store the transformed rows.
4.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Remove the first element from the row.
    b.  Add the resulting sequence of elements (the transformed row) to the list.
5.  If `control_value` is equal to `2`:
    a.  The final output grid consists of the transformed rows in the same relative order they were generated (matching the original input row order).
6.  Otherwise (if `control_value` is not `2`):
    a.  Sort the list of transformed rows lexicographically.
    b.  The final output grid consists of the sorted transformed rows.
7.  Format the resulting list of rows as the output grid.

import copy

"""
