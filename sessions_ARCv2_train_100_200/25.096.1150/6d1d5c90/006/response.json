            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the primary transformation (removing the first element of each row) and the conditional behavior based on the top-left element (`2` vs. `6`). However, the execution results show that the specific sorting rule applied when the top-left element is `6` was oversimplified.\n\nThe code failed on Example 2, where the top-left element is `6`, but the standard lexicographical sort did not produce the expected output. Example 3 also has `6` in the top-left, and the lexicographical sort *did* work. This strongly suggests an additional condition influences the sorting method when the top-left element is `6`.\n\nComparing the inputs of Example 2 and Example 3, the key difference appears to be the value of the element at the start of the *second* row (`input[1][0]`). In Example 2, it's `6`; in Example 3, it's `8`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the hypothesis: The sorting rule when `input[0][0] == 6` depends on `input[1][0]`.\n    *   If `input[0][0] == 2`: Preserve original order.\n    *   If `input[0][0] == 6` and (`input` has < 2 rows OR `input[1][0] != 6`): Sort lexicographically (ascending).\n    *   If `input[0][0] == 6` and `input[1][0] == 6`: Use the specific sorting order observed in Example 2.\n2.  Determine the specific sorting rule for the `input[0][0] == 6` and `input[1][0] == 6` case by analyzing the relationship between the transformed rows and the expected output order in Example 2. The observed order seems to be: sort primarily by the last element of the transformed row (descending), and secondarily by lexicographical order (ascending) to resolve ties.\n3.  Update the documentation (Facts YAML) and the Natural Language Program to reflect this more complex conditional logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the sorting hypothesis for Example 2 (`input[0][0] == 6` and `input[1][0] == 6`).\n\n*   Input Rows (Example 2):\n    "
