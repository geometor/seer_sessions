"""
Transforms an input grid of numbers based on the value of its top-left element.
For each row in the input grid, the first element is removed.
If the top-left element of the original input grid is 2, the resulting rows maintain their original relative order.
Otherwise (e.g., if the top-left element is 6), the resulting rows are sorted lexicographically.
