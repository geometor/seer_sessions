            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code successfully processed Example 1 where the top-left element was `2`, correctly preserving the original order of the transformed rows. It also correctly processed Example 2 where the top-left element was `6`, correctly sorting the transformed rows lexicographically.\n\nHowever, the provided `Transformed Output` for Example 3, generated by the previous incorrect code (`code_00.py`), did not match the `Expected Output`. The failure occurred because the previous code implemented an incorrect sorting logic (dependent on the second row's first element) instead of simple lexicographical sorting when the top-left element is `6`.\n\nThe strategy is to revert to the simpler, initially observed logic:\n1.  Transform each row by removing its first element.\n2.  Check the top-left element of the original grid.\n3.  If it's `2`, maintain the original order of transformed rows.\n4.  If it's `6` (or any other value based on the examples), sort the transformed rows lexicographically.\n\nThis simpler logic correctly explains all three provided training examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the metrics based on the *intended* logic (which matches the initial natural language program provided in the previous step).\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Top-Left: 2\n*   Action: Preserve order after removing the first element.\n*   Input Rows: 6\n*   Output Rows: 6\n*   Row Length Change: Input length N -> Output length N-1.\n*   Result: The provided `Transformed Output` matches the `Expected Output`. Match: True.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Top-Left: 6\n*   Action: Sort transformed rows lexicographically.\n*   Input Rows: 6\n*   Output Rows: 6\n*   Row Length Change: Input length N -> Output length N-1.\n*   Result: The provided `Transformed Output` matches the `Expected Output`. Match: True.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Top-Left: 6\n*   Action: Sort transformed rows lexicographically.\n*   Input Rows: 6\n*   Output Rows: 6\n*   Row Length Change: Input length N -> Output length N-1.\n*   Result: The `Transformed Output` shown in the prompt (from `code_00.py`) *did not* match the `Expected Output`. However, applying the correct logic (lexicographical sort) *does* produce the `Expected Output`.\n\nLet's verify the lexicographical sort for Example 3's transformed rows:\nInput:\n"
