Input:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers.
  elements:
    - object: row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers within the grid.
      properties:
        - index: The original position (0-based) of the row in the input grid.
        - elements: The sequence of integers in the row.
        - first_element: The integer at the first position of the row.
    - object: top_left_element
      description: The integer located at the first row and first column of the input grid.
      properties:
        - value: The numerical value of the element (e.g., 2 or 6).

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  elements:
    - object: transformed_row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers, derived from an input row by removing its first element.
      properties:
        - elements: The sequence of integers remaining after removal.

Transformation:
  actions:
    - name: remove_first_element_from_rows
      input: input_grid
      output: list_of_transformed_rows
      description: Iterates through each row of the input grid, removes the first element from the row, and collects the resulting shorter rows into a list. The relative order matches the input grid's row order at this stage.
    - name: conditional_row_ordering
      input: list_of_transformed_rows, top_left_element_value
      output: final_output_grid
      description: >
        Determines the final order of the transformed rows based on the top_left_element_value.
        If the top_left_element_value is 2, the rows in the list_of_transformed_rows maintain their current (original) relative order.
        If the top_left_element_value is not 2 (e.g., 6 based on examples), the rows in the list_of_transformed_rows are sorted lexicographically in ascending order.
  relationships:
    - The final order of rows in the output grid depends solely on the value of the top_left_element of the input grid.
