            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output consist of multiple rows, each containing a sequence of single-digit integers. The number of rows and the length of rows can vary between examples, but within a single example pair, the number of rows remains the same, and the length of output rows is one less than the input rows.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation applied to each row is the removal of its first element. The remaining elements in the row maintain their relative order.\n3.  **Row Ordering:** The key difference between examples lies in the final ordering of the transformed rows.\n    *   In Example 1, the transformed rows maintain their original relative order from the input.\n    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the transformed rows are reordered. Observing these examples reveals that the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically (treating each row as a sequence for comparison).\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** The difference in ordering behavior (preserving order vs. sorting) seems to depend on a specific condition related to the input. Comparing the inputs, the distinguishing factor appears to be the value of the very first element (top-left corner) of the input grid.\n    *   If the top-left element is `2` (as in Example 1), the original order is preserved.\n    *   If the top-left element is `6` (as in Examples 2 and 3), the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
