Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output consist of multiple rows, each containing a sequence of single-digit integers. The number of rows and the length of rows can vary between examples, but within a single example pair, the number of rows remains the same, and the length of output rows is one less than the input rows.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental operation applied to each row is the removal of its first element. The remaining elements in the row maintain their relative order.
3.  **Row Ordering:** The key difference between examples lies in the final ordering of the transformed rows.
    *   In Example 1, the transformed rows maintain their original relative order from the input.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the transformed rows are reordered. Observing these examples reveals that the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically (treating each row as a sequence for comparison).
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The difference in ordering behavior (preserving order vs. sorting) seems to depend on a specific condition related to the input. Comparing the inputs, the distinguishing factor appears to be the value of the very first element (top-left corner) of the input grid.
    *   If the top-left element is `2` (as in Example 1), the original order is preserved.
    *   If the top-left element is `6` (as in Examples 2 and 3), the transformed rows are sorted lexicographically.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers.
  elements:
    - object: row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers within the grid.
      properties:
        - index: The original position (0-based) of the row in the input grid.
        - elements: The sequence of integers in the row.
        - first_element: The integer at the first position of the row.
    - object: top_left_element
      description: The integer located at the first row and first column of the input grid.
      properties:
        - value: The numerical value of the element.

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  elements:
    - object: transformed_row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers, derived from an input row by removing its first element.
      properties:
        - elements: The sequence of integers remaining after removal.

Transformation:
  actions:
    - name: remove_first_element
      input: row
      output: transformed_row
      description: Removes the element at the first position of an input row.
    - name: conditional_sort
      input: list_of_transformed_rows, top_left_element_value
      output: sorted_list_of_transformed_rows
      description: >
        Orders the list of transformed_rows.
        If the top_left_element_value is 2, the original relative order is maintained.
        Otherwise (e.g., if it's 6), the rows are sorted lexicographically.
  relationships:
    - The final order of rows in the output grid depends on the value of the top_left_element of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid of numbers.
2.  Identify the value of the element in the top-left corner (first row, first column). Let this be `control_value`.
3.  Create a list to store the transformed rows.
4.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Remove the first element from the row.
    b.  Add the resulting sequence of elements (the transformed row) to the list.
5.  If `control_value` is equal to `2`:
    a.  The final output grid consists of the transformed rows in the same relative order they were generated (matching the original input row order).
6.  Otherwise (if `control_value` is not `2`):
    a.  Sort the list of transformed rows lexicographically.
    b.  The final output grid consists of the sorted transformed rows.
7.  Format the resulting list of rows as the output grid.
