Input:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers.
  elements:
    - object: row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers within the grid.
      properties:
        - index: The original position (0-based) of the row in the input grid.
        - elements: The sequence of integers in the row.
        - first_element: The integer at the first position of the row.
    - object: top_left_element
      description: The integer located at the first row and first column of the input grid.
      properties:
        - value: The numerical value of the element.

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A grid of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  elements:
    - object: transformed_row
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers, derived from an input row by removing its first element.
      properties:
        - elements: The sequence of integers remaining after removal.

Transformation:
  actions:
    - name: remove_first_element
      input: row
      output: transformed_row
      description: Removes the element at the first position of an input row.
    - name: conditional_sort
      input: list_of_transformed_rows, top_left_element_value
      output: sorted_list_of_transformed_rows
      description: >
        Orders the list of transformed_rows.
        If the top_left_element_value is 2, the original relative order is maintained.
        Otherwise (e.g., if it's 6), the rows are sorted lexicographically.
  relationships:
    - The final order of rows in the output grid depends on the value of the top_left_element of the input grid.
