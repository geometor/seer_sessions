Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of digits. The size of the grid remains constant (8x8 in the examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited set of digits, primarily 7, 5, and 2 in the input, and 7, 5, 2, 4, and 3 in the output.
3.  **Background:** The digit '7' appears to function as a background color, filling most of the grid.
4.  **Objects:** Clusters of digits '5' and '2' form distinct shapes or objects within the background in the input grid.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some background cells ('7') to new digits ('3' or '4'). The original '5' and '2' objects seem to remain unchanged in their positions and values.
6.  **Rule Dependency:** The change from '7' to '3' or '4' depends on the proximity of the '7' cell to the '2' and '5' objects in the input grid. Specifically, '4's appear near '5's, and '3's appear near '2's. The relationship considers the 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals).

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
3.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is 7 (the background color):
    a.  Examine the 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) surrounding `input[r][c]` in the *input* grid. Be careful to handle boundary conditions (cells outside the grid are not considered neighbors).
    b.  Count how many of these neighbors have the value 2 (`count2`).
    c.  Count how many of these neighbors have the value 5 (`count5`).
    d.  Apply the following rules to determine the value of the corresponding output cell `output[r][c]`:
        i.  If `count5` is greater than 0 AND `count2` is 0, set `output[r][c]` to 4.
        ii. If `count2` is greater than 0 (regardless of `count5`), set `output[r][c]` to 3.
        iii. Otherwise (if both `count2` and `count5` are 0), `output[r][c]` remains 7 (as initialized).
4.  If the value of the input cell `input[r][c]` is not 7, its value is already copied to `output[r][c]` in step 1, so no further action is needed for this cell.
5.  After checking all cells, the final `output` grid is the result of the transformation.
