Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers
  properties:
    - dimensions: constant (e.g., 8x8)
    - background_color: 7
Objects:
  type: contiguous regions of non-background cells
  properties:
    - colors: [2, 5]
    - location: preserved in output
Transformation:
  type: modification of background cells
  target_cells: cells with value 7 in the input
  output_colors: [3, 4]
  rules:
    - condition: based on the values of 8 neighboring cells (orthogonal and diagonal) in the input grid
Relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    directions: 8 (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
    applies_to: determining neighbors for transformation rules
Rules_Derived:
  - name: Rule_5_to_4
    input_cell_value: 7
    condition: >
      Has one or more neighbors with value 5 AND
      Has zero neighbors with value 2.
    action: change input cell value to 4 in the output.
  - name: Rule_2_to_3
    input_cell_value: 7
    condition: >
      Has one or more neighbors with value 2 AND
      Has zero neighbors with value 5.
    action: change input cell value to 3 in the output.
  - name: Rule_2_and_5_to_3
    input_cell_value: 7
    condition: >
      Has one or more neighbors with value 2 AND
      Has one or more neighbors with value 5.
    action: change input cell value to 3 in the output.
  - name: Rule_No_Change
    input_cell_value: 7
    condition: >
      Has zero neighbors with value 2 AND
      Has zero neighbors with value 5.
    action: keep input cell value 7 in the output.
  - name: Rule_Object_Preservation
    input_cell_value: [2, 5] # or any non-7 value
    action: keep input cell value in the output.
