Focus on the central three rows of the input grid (rows 1, 2, and 3, 
using 0-based indexing). Identify the column within this central area that 
contains only zeros (this is the separator, typically column 4). Extract 
the 3x3 subgrid located immediately to the left of the separator column 
(columns 1-3). Call this PatternA. Extract the 3x3 subgrid located 
immediately to the right of the separator column (columns 5-7). Call this 
PatternB. Determine the ReplacementValue based on the specific arrangement 
of 5s in PatternA: If PatternA matches [[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]], the 
ReplacementValue is 1. If PatternA matches [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]], 
the ReplacementValue is 2. If PatternA matches [[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]], 
the ReplacementValue is 3. Construct the 3x3 output grid by iterating 
through each cell of PatternB. For each cell in PatternB: If the cell value 
is 5, place the determined ReplacementValue in the corresponding cell of the 
output grid. If the cell value is 0, place 0 in the corresponding cell of 
the output grid. The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
