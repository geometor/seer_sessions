*   **Perception**: The input is a 5x9 grid containing primarily 0s and some 5s. The 5s are concentrated within the central three rows (rows 1-3, 0-indexed) and appear to form two distinct 3x3 patterns separated by a column of 0s. The output is always a 3x3 grid containing 0s and a single non-zero digit (1, 2, or 3). The specific non-zero digit used in the output seems determined by the first 3x3 pattern of 5s in the input, while the positions of the non-zero digits in the output correspond to the positions of the 5s in the second 3x3 pattern in the input.

```yaml
    objects:
      - InputGrid:
          description: A 2D grid, typically 5x9, containing 0s and 5s.
          properties:
            - dimensions: [height, width]
            - values: integers (0, 5)
      - CentralArea:
          description: The subgrid of InputGrid comprising rows 1, 2, and 3.
          properties:
            - location: Rows 1-3 (0-indexed)
            - contains: two 3x3 patterns and a separator column
      - SeparatorColumn:
          description: A column within the CentralArea consisting entirely of 0s.
          properties:
            - location: Typically column 4 (0-indexed)
            - values: all 0s
      - PatternA:
          description: The 3x3 subgrid within CentralArea located to the left of the SeparatorColumn.
          properties:
            - location: Rows 1-3, Columns 1-3
            - values: 0s and 5s
            - role: Determines the 'ReplacementValue' for the output.
      - PatternB:
          description: The 3x3 subgrid within CentralArea located to the right of the SeparatorColumn.
          properties:
            - location: Rows 1-3, Columns 5-7
            - values: 0s and 5s
            - role: Determines the structure/shape of the OutputGrid.
      - OutputGrid:
          description: A 3x3 grid derived from the input.
          properties:
            - dimensions: [3, 3]
            - values: integers (0 and a ReplacementValue from {1, 2, 3})
      - ReplacementValue:
          description: An integer (1, 2, or 3) determined by the configuration of PatternA.
          properties:
            - value: 1, 2, or 3
            - dependency: derived from PatternA's specific arrangement of 5s.

    relationships:
      - defines: PatternA defines the ReplacementValue.
      - maps_to: PatternB maps to the OutputGrid structure.
      - separates: SeparatorColumn separates PatternA and PatternB.

    actions:
      - extract: Identify and extract PatternA and PatternB from the CentralArea based on the SeparatorColumn.
      - determine_value: Analyze PatternA to determine the corresponding ReplacementValue (1, 2, or 3).
        - if PatternA is [[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]], ReplacementValue is 1.
        - if PatternA is [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]], ReplacementValue is 2.
        - if PatternA is [[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]], ReplacementValue is 3.
      - transform: Create the OutputGrid by taking PatternB and replacing all occurrences of the value 5 with the determined ReplacementValue. Keep 0s as 0s.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Focus on the central three rows of the input grid (rows 1, 2, and 3, using 0-based indexing).
    2.  Identify the column within this central area that contains only zeros (this is the separator, typically column 4).
    3.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid located immediately to the left of the separator column (columns 1-3). Call this `PatternA`.
    4.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid located immediately to the right of the separator column (columns 5-7). Call this `PatternB`.
    5.  Determine the `ReplacementValue` based on the specific arrangement of 5s in `PatternA`:
        *   If `PatternA` matches `[[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]]`, the `ReplacementValue` is 1.
        *   If `PatternA` matches `[[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]`, the `ReplacementValue` is 2.
        *   If `PatternA` matches `[[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]]`, the `ReplacementValue` is 3.
    6.  Construct the 3x3 output grid by iterating through each cell of `PatternB`.
    7.  For each cell in `PatternB`:
        *   If the cell value is 5, place the determined `ReplacementValue` in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
        *   If the cell value is 0, place 0 in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
    8.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
