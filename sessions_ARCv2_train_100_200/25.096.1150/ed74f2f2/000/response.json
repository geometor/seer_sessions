The 5s are concentrated within the central three rows (rows 1-3, 0-indexed) and appear to form two distinct 3x3 patterns separated by a column of 0s. The output is always a 3x3 grid containing 0s and a single non-zero digit (1, 2, or 3). The specific non-zero digit used in the output seems determined by the first 3x3 pattern of 5s in the input, while the positions of the non-zero digits in the output correspond to the positions of the 5s in the second 3x3 pattern in the input.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
