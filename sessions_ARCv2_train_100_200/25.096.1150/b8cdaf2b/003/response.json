Find the bottom-most row 'r' containing any non-zero values. If r is 0 or non-existent, return the input grid unchanged.\n2. In row 'r', search for a pattern consisting of two identical non-zero \"flanker\" cells (color F) at columns c_left and c_right (c_left < c_right - 1).\n3. Between these flankers, identify the first contiguous segment of a *different* non-zero color 'C' (from column c_start to c_end).\n4. Verify structural integrity:\n    a. All cells in row 'r' between the left flanker and the start of the contained segment (columns c_left + 1 to c_start - 1, if any) must have color F.\n    b. All cells in row 'r' between the end of the contained segment and the right flanker (columns c_end + 1 to c_right - 1, if any) must have color F.\n    c. All cells in the row directly above the contained segment (row r-1, columns c_start to c_end) must have color F.\n5. If such a valid pattern is found:\n    a. Rule Type 1: If the contained segment 'C' directly touches both flankers (i.e., c_start == c_left + 1 and c_end == c_right - 1), add two new cells of color C at positions (r-2, c_left) and (r-2, c_right), checking grid boundaries.\n    b. Rule Type 2: Otherwise (if there are intermediate F cells between flankers and the contained segment in row r), add four new cells of color C at positions (r-3, c_left), (r-3, c_right), (r-2, c_left + 1), and (r-2, c_right - 1), checking grid boundaries.\n6. The original input grid cells remain unchanged. Add the new cells to a copy of the input grid.\n7. Stop searching after finding and applying the first valid pattern.\n8. Return the modified grid.
