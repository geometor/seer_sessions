            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**1. Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both are 2D grids containing single-digit non-negative integers. 0 represents the background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation adds new non-zero cells to the grid. The original non-zero cells from the input remain unchanged in the output.\n*   **Key Structure:** The process seems triggered by a specific pattern found in the lowest rows of the input grid. This pattern involves a pair of identical non-zero numbers (\"flankers\") in the lowest non-zero row, enclosing a different non-zero number (\"contained\"), with specific values required in the row directly above.\n*   **Added Elements:** The color (number) added matches the \"contained\" color. The positions of the added elements depend on the positions of the \"flankers\" and potentially the structure between the flankers and the contained element.\n*   **Two Placement Patterns:** Two distinct patterns emerge for placing the new elements, observed across the examples. One pattern places two elements two rows above the flankers, aligned horizontally with them. The other pattern places four elements: two elements three rows above the flankers (aligned horizontally) and two elements two rows above, horizontally adjacent inwards from the flankers.\n*   **Pattern Trigger Detail:** The core pattern requires:\n    *   Lowest row `r` with non-zero cells.\n    *   Identical flanker cells `F` at `(r, c_left)` and `(r, c_right)`.\n    *   A contained segment of cells `C` (where `C != F`) between `c_left` and `c_right` in row `r`. Let the contained segment span columns `c_start` to `c_end`.\n    *   Any cells between the flankers and the contained segment in row `r` must be color `F`.\n    *   The cells in row `r-1` directly above the contained segment (columns `c_start` to `c_end`) must all be color `F`.\n*   **Distinguishing Placement Rules:** The crucial factor determining which placement rule applies seems to be whether the contained segment `C` directly touches *both* flankers `F` in row `r` (i.e., if `c_start == c_left + 1` and `c_end == c_right - 1`).\n\n**2.
