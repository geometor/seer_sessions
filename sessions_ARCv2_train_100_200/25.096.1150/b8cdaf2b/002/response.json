            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core pattern involving \"flankers\" (F) and a \"contained\" element (C) in the lowest non-zero row `r`. It also correctly deduced the requirement for the cells above the contained element (in row `r-1`) to match the flanker color F. Two distinct placement rules were identified based on whether the contained element C is immediately adjacent to both flankers in row `r`.\n\nHowever, the execution results for `train_2` and `train_3` show that the *implementation* of the placement logic in the previous code was incorrect, even though the natural language description aimed for the correct rules. The reported `Transformed Output` for these examples placed the new pixels incorrectly compared to the `Expected Output`.\n\nThe core logic differentiating the two placement types seems sound, but the exact coordinates used in Rule Type 2 (when intermediate F's exist between flankers and C in row `r`) need correction based on the `Expected Output` of `train_2` and `train_3`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-examine the failed examples (`train_2`, `train_3`) to precisely determine the correct coordinates for the four pixels added in Rule Type 2.\n2.  Confirm that the coordinates for Rule Type 1 (used in `train_1` and `train_4`) remain correct.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected coordinate logic for Rule Type 2.\n4.  No code execution is strictly necessary for metrics *gathering* at this stage, as the previous report provides the necessary inputs, expected outputs, and failed transformed outputs. The analysis will focus on comparing these provided grids.\n\n**Metrics Analysis (Based on Provided Data):**\n\n*   **Train_1:**\n    *   Pattern: `F=6, C=1`. `r=4`. `c_left=0, c_right=4`. `contained_start=1, contained_end=3`.\n    *   Row `r-1` above C (`grid[3, 1:4]`): `[6, 6, 6]`. Matches F.\n    *   `contained_touches_flankers`: `True` (`1 == 0+1` and `3 == 4-1`).\n    *   Rule Type 1 applied. Adds C=1 at `(r-2, c_left)=(2,0)` and `(r-2, c_right)=(2,4)`.\n    *   Result: **Correct**.\n*   **Train_2:**\n    *   Pattern: `F=8, C=3`. `r=4`. `c_left=0, c_right=4`. `contained_start=2, contained_end=2`.\n    *   Row `r-1` above C (`grid[3, 2]`): `[8]`. Matches F.\n    *   `contained_touches_flankers`: `False` (`2 != 0+1`). Intermediate Fs exist at `(4,1)` and `(4,3)`.\n    *   Rule Type 2 should be applied.\n    *   Expected Output adds C=3 at: `(1, 0)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`.\n    *   Previous Code Output added C=3 at: `(1, 0)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`. -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   Correct Coordinates (Rule 2): `(r-3, c_left)`, `(r-3, c_right)`, `(r-2, c_left+1)`, `(r-2, c_right-1)`.\n*   **Train_3:**\n    *   Pattern: `F=2, C=4`. `r=6`. `c_left=0, c_right=6`. `contained_start=2, contained_end=4`.\n    *   Row `r-1` above C (`grid[5, 2:5]`): `[2, 2, 2]`. Matches F.\n    *   `contained_touches_flankers`: `False` (`2 != 0+1`). Intermediate Fs exist at `(6,1)` and `(6,5)`.\n    *   Rule Type 2 should be applied.\n    *   Expected Output adds C=4 at: `(3, 0)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 5)`.\n    *   Previous Code Output added C=4 at: `(3, 0)`, `(3, 5)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 4)`. -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   Correct Coordinates (Rule 2): `(r-3, c_left)`, `(r-3, c_right)`, `(r-2, c_left+1)`, `(r-2, c_right-1)`.\n*   **Train_4:**\n    *   Pattern: `F=2, C=4`. `r=2`. `c_left=0, c_right=2`. `contained_start=1, contained_end=1`.\n    *   Row `r-1` above C (`grid[1, 1]`): `[2]`. Matches F.\n    *   `contained_touches_flankers`: `True` (`1 == 0+1` and `1 == 2-1`).\n    *   Rule Type 1 applied. Adds C=4 at `(r-2, c_left)=(0,0)` and `(r-2, c_right)=(0,2)`.\n    *   Result: **Correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis confirms the two rules and their trigger conditions are correct. The specific coordinates for Rule Type 2 needed correction based on the expected outputs of train_2 and train_3. The coordinates are `(r-3, c_left)`, `(r-3, c_right)`, `(r-2, c_left+1)`, `(r-2, c_right-1)`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find the index `r` of the bottom-most row in the `input_grid` that contains at least one non-zero value. If no such row exists or `r` is 0, return the `output_grid` unchanged.\n3.  Iterate through all possible pairs of columns `c_left` and `c_right` (`c_left < c_right - 1`) in row `r`.\n4.  Check if the cells at `(r, c_left)` and `(r, c_right)` have the same non-zero color, `F` (flanker color).\n5.  If flankers `F` are found:\n    a.  Search for the first contiguous segment of a *different* non-zero color `C` within row `r`, strictly between `c_left` and `c_right`. Record its start column `c_start` and end column `c_end`. If no such segment `C` exists, or if `C` equals `F`, continue to the next flanker pair.\n    b.  Verify that all cells in row `r` between `c_left` and `c_start` (i.e., columns `c_left + 1` to `c_start - 1`) have color `F`. If this range is empty (`c_start == c_left + 1`), this condition is met. If not met, continue to the next flanker pair.\n    c.  Verify that all cells in row `r` between `c_end` and `c_right` (i.e., columns `c_end + 1` to `c_right - 1`) have color `F`. If this range is empty (`c_end == c_right - 1`), this condition is met. If not met, continue to the next flanker pair.\n    d.  Verify that all cells in row `r-1` between columns `c_start` and `c_end` (inclusive) have the flanker color `F`. If not met, continue to the next flanker pair.\n    e.  If all checks (a-d) pass, a valid pattern instance is found. Determine the placement rule:\n        i.  **Rule Type 1:** If the contained segment `C` directly touches both flankers (`c_start == c_left + 1` AND `c_end == c_right - 1`), add two new cells of color `C` to the `output_grid` at positions `(r-2, c_left)` and `(r-2, c_right)`, provided these coordinates are within the grid bounds.\n        ii. **Rule Type 2:** Otherwise (if there are intermediate `F` cells between the flankers and the contained segment `C` in row `r`), add four new cells of color `C` to the `output_grid` at positions `(r-3, c_left)`, `(r-3, c_right)`, `(r-2, c_left + 1)`, and `(r-2, c_right - 1)`, provided these coordinates are within the grid bounds.\n    f.  Once a valid pattern is found and applied, stop searching and proceed to return the result. (Assuming only one pattern instance per grid based on examples).\n6.  Return the `output_grid`."
