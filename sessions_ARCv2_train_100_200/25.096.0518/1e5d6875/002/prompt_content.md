Previous Code:
```python
import copy

"""
Transforms a grid of digits based on the proximity of specific values (2 and 5) to a background value (7).

Iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains the value 7, it counts the number of its 8 neighbors (including diagonals) that contain the value 2 and the number of neighbors that contain the value 5.

Transformation rules for a cell containing 7:
- If it has neighbors with value 2 but no neighbors with value 5, it becomes 3.
- If it has neighbors with value 5 but no neighbors with value 2, it becomes 4.
- If it has neighbors with both values 2 and 5:
    - If the count of neighbors with value 2 is greater than or equal to the count of neighbors with value 5, it becomes 3.
    - Otherwise (count of 5s is greater), it becomes 4.
- If it has no neighbors with value 2 or 5, it remains 7.
Cells not containing 7 remain unchanged.
