            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are 8x8 grids containing single digits.\n2.  **Values:** The digits present are 2, 5, and 7 in the input. The output introduces digits 3 and 4, while retaining 2, 5, and 7.\n3.  **Background:** The digit 7 appears to be a background or default value. Many 7s remain unchanged.\n4.  **Active Elements:** Digits 2 and 5 seem to be the active elements influencing the transformation. They remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some of the background 7s into either 3s or 4s. This change appears localized around the positions of the 2s and 5s.\n6.  **Neighborhood Influence:** The transformation of a 7 seems dependent on its neighboring cells (including diagonals).\n    *   In `train_1`, 7s near 2s tend to become 3s (`output[2][3]`, `output[3][3]`, `output[3][4]`, `output[7][6]`).\n    *   In `train_1`, 7s near 5s tend to become 4s (`output[1][2]`, `output[2][2]`).\n    *   In `train_2`, 7s near 2s tend to become 3s (`output[4][2]`, `output[4][3]`, `output[7][4]`, `output[7][5]`).\n    *   In `train_2`, 7s near 5s tend to become 4s (`output[1][2]`, `output[1][3]`, `output[2][4]`, `output[2][5]`, `output[3][5]`, `output[3][6]`).\n7.  **Conflict Resolution:** When a 7 is near both 2s and 5s, a rule determines the outcome.\n    *   In `train_1`, `input[2][3]` (7) has neighbors: one 5, two 2s. It becomes 3.\n    *   In `train_1`, `input[3][3]` (7) has neighbors: one 5, two 2s. It becomes 3.\n    *   In `train_1`, `input[2][2]` (7) has neighbors: three 5s, zero 2s. It becomes 4.\n    *   This suggests a comparison: if the count of neighboring 2s is greater than or equal to the count of neighboring 5s, the 7 becomes a 3. Otherwise (if count of 5s is greater), it becomes a 4.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
