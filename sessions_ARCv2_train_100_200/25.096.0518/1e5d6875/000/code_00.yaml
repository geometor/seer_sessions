task_description: "Transform a grid of digits based on the proximity of specific values (2 and 5) to a background value (7)."
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - size: 8x8 (in examples)
      - values: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (2, 3, 4, 5, or 7)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
      - neighbors: set of 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals, handling boundaries)
  - value: 7
    role: background/default value, potentially transformable
  - value: 2
    role: active influencer, transforms nearby 7s primarily to 3s
  - value: 5
    role: active influencer, transforms nearby 7s primarily to 4s
  - value: 3
    role: output value, result of transforming a 7 influenced primarily by 2s
  - value: 4
    role: output value, result of transforming a 7 influenced primarily by 5s
actions:
  - name: iterate_cells
    description: Process each cell of the input grid.
  - name: check_value
    description: Determine the value of the current cell.
  - name: count_neighbors
    description: For a given cell, count how many of its 8 neighbors have the value 2 and how many have the value 5.
  - name: apply_transformation_rule
    description: Based on the cell's original value and the counts of its neighbors (2s and 5s), determine the output cell value.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Cells are related to their immediate neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
  - type: influence
    description: Values 2 and 5 in neighboring cells influence the transformation of a cell containing 7.
  - type: comparison
    description: The counts of neighboring 2s and 5s are compared to decide the transformation outcome (3 or 4) when both types of neighbors exist.
