**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the action of removing the first element from each input row. The code implemented this and then sorted the resulting rows lexicographically. This approach succeeded perfectly for `train_3` but failed for `train_1` and `train_2`, indicating that the sorting logic derived solely from the first example (or the simplest interpretation) is insufficient or that the expected outputs for `train_1` and `train_2` might be inconsistent with the rule demonstrated in `train_3`.

The core issue lies in the ordering of the output rows. The simple lexicographical sort of the modified rows (input rows minus the first element) does not match the expected output order in `train_1` and `train_2`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Sorting:** Use code execution to confirm the exact result of standard lexicographical sorting on the modified rows for each example.
2.  **Compare Verified Sort with Expected Output:** Directly compare the verified sorted output with
