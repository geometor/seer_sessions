Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Format:** The input consists of multiple lines. Each line contains a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.
2.  **Output Format:** The output also consists of multiple lines, mirroring the structure of the input, with each line containing a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.
3.  **Transformation Observation:**
    *   In all examples, the first integer from each input line is consistently absent in the corresponding output structure.
    *   The remaining integers from each input line form a sequence in the output.
    *   The order of these resulting sequences in the output block is different from their original order in the input block.
    *   Comparing the sequences (after removing the first element) from the input block to the sequences in the output block reveals that the output sequences are sorted. The sorting appears to be lexicographical based on the sequence of remaining numbers.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read all lines from the input block.
2.  For each input line:
    a.  Parse the line into a sequence of integers.
    b.  Create a new sequence containing all integers from the parsed sequence *except* the first one.
3.  Collect all the new sequences created in step 2b.
4.  Sort the collected sequences lexicographically (treating each sequence as a comparable unit, comparing element by element from left to right).
5.  Construct the output block by placing each sorted sequence on a new line, with its integers separated by spaces.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the action of removing the first element from each input row. The code implemented this and then sorted the resulting rows lexicographically. This approach succeeded perfectly for `train_3` but failed for `train_1` and `train_2`, indicating that the sorting logic derived solely from the first example (or the simplest interpretation) is insufficient or that the expected outputs for `train_1` and `train_2` might be inconsistent with the rule demonstrated in `train_3`.

The core issue lies in the ordering of the output rows. The simple lexicographical sort of the modified rows (input rows minus the first element) does not match the expected output order in `train_1` and `train_2`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Sorting:** Use code execution to confirm the exact result of standard lexicographical sorting on the modified rows for each example.
2.  **Compare Verified Sort with Expected Output:** Directly compare the verified sorted output with
