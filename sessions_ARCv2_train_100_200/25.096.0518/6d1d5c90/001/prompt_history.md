Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Format:** The input consists of multiple lines. Each line contains a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.
2.  **Output Format:** The output also consists of multiple lines, mirroring the structure of the input, with each line containing a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.
3.  **Transformation Observation:**
    *   In all examples, the first integer from each input line is consistently absent in the corresponding output structure.
    *   The remaining integers from each input line form a sequence in the output.
    *   The order of these resulting sequences in the output block is different from their original order in the input block.
    *   Comparing the sequences (after removing the first element) from the input block to the sequences in the output block reveals that the output sequences are sorted. The sorting appears to be lexicographical based on the sequence of remaining numbers.

**Facts:**


```yaml

      - type: collection
      - contains: input_sequence[]

      - length: n
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - contains: integer[]
      - length: n-1 (derived from corresponding input_sequence)
  - name: integer
    properties:
      - type: numerical digit
      - position: index within a sequence (e.g., first, second, ...)

actions:
  - name: parse

  - name: remove_first

    input: input_sequence
    output: modified_sequence
  - name: collect
    description: Gather all the modified sequences generated from the input block.
    input: modified_sequence[]

  - name: sort
    description: Arrange the collected modified sequences in ascending lexicographical order.
    input: collection_of_modified_sequences
    output: sorted_collection_of_sequences
  - name: format
    description: Present the sorted sequences, each on a new line, with integers separated by spaces.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence (via remove_first action)
  - type: ordering
    basis: lexicographical comparison
    applied_to: collection_of_modified_sequences
    result: sorted_collection_of_sequences (forms the output_block)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read all lines from the input block.
2.  For each input line:
    a.  Parse the line into a sequence of integers.
    b.  Create a new sequence containing all integers from the parsed sequence *except* the first one.
3.  Collect all the new sequences created in step 2b.
4.  Sort the collected sequences lexicographically (treating each sequence as a comparable unit, comparing element by element from left to right).
5.  Construct the output block by placing each sorted sequence on a new line, with its integers separated by spaces.
