  - name: output_block
    properties:
      - type: collection
      - contains: output_sequence[]
  - name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - contains: integer[]
      - length: n
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence
      - contains: integer[]
      - length: n-1 (derived from corresponding input_sequence)
  - name: integer
    properties:
      - type: numerical digit
      - position: index within a sequence (e.g., first, second, ...)

actions:
  - name: parse
    description: Read input lines and convert each into a sequence of integers.
  - name: remove_first
    description: For each input sequence, create a new sequence by excluding the integer at the first position.
    input: input_sequence
    output: modified_sequence
  - name: collect
    description: Gather all the modified sequences generated from the input block.
    input: modified_sequence[]
    output: collection_of_modified_sequences
  - name: sort
    description: Arrange the collected modified sequences in ascending lexicographical order.
    input: collection_of_modified_sequences
    output: sorted_collection_of_sequences
  - name: format
    description: Present the sorted sequences, each on a new line, with integers separated by spaces.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence (via remove_first action)
  - type: ordering
    basis: lexicographical comparison
    applied_to: collection_of_modified_sequences
    result: sorted_collection_of_sequences (forms the output_block)
