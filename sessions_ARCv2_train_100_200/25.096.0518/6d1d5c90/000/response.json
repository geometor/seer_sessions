Each line contains a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.\n2.  **Output Format:** The output also consists of multiple lines, mirroring the structure of the input, with each line containing a sequence of space-separated single-digit integers.\n3.  **Transformation Observation:**\n    *   In all examples, the first integer from each input line is consistently absent in the corresponding output structure.\n    *   The remaining integers from each input line form a sequence in the output.\n    *   The order of these resulting sequences in the output block is different from their original order in the input block.\n    *   Comparing the sequences (after removing the first element) from the input block to the sequences in the output block reveals that the output sequences are sorted. The sorting appears to be lexicographical based on the sequence of remaining numbers.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
