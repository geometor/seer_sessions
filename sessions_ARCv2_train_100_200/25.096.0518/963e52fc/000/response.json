The grids vary in size (width and height) across examples. Some rows consist entirely of zeros, while others contain patterns of non-zero integers.\n2.  **Output:** A rectangular grid of integers. The output grid always has the same height as the corresponding input grid. The width of the output grid is always exactly double the width of the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The content of the output grid appears to be formed by taking the entire input grid and placing an identical copy of it immediately to its right. Each row in the output grid is formed by concatenating the corresponding input row with itself.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
