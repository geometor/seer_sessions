**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified that the output grid has the same height and double the width of the input grid. The first attempt assumed a simple horizontal duplication of the input grid (concatenating each row with itself). The test results show this was only correct for Example 2. Examples 1 and 3 failed, indicating a more complex transformation rule for generating the second half of the output rows.

The errors in Examples 1 and 3 occur in rows containing non-zero numbers. Comparing the expected output with the simple duplication reveals that the appended section is not an exact copy of the input row but seems to be a *continuation* of a pattern present in the input row.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify the grid dimensions using `tool_code`.
2.  For each non-zero row in the input, identify the smallest repeating sequence (pattern) starting from the beginning of the row.
3.  Hypothesize that the output row is generated by repeating this identified pattern until the row reaches double the original width.
4.  Update the facts and natural language program based on this pattern repetition hypothesis.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Dimensions:** The code confirms that for all examples, the output height matches the input height, and the output width is exactly double the input width.
*   **Mismatches:** The code correctly identifies the rows where the initial transformation failed (Row 2 in Example 1, Rows 2 & 3 in Example 3). Example 2 had no mismatches.
*   **Patterns:**
    *   Example 1, Row 2 (index 2): Pattern `[2, 3, 3]`, length 3. Correctly identified.
    *   Example 2, Row 1 (index 1): Pattern `[2, 8]`, length 2. Correctly identified.
    *   Example 2, Row 2 (index 2): Pattern `[2, 8]`, length 2. Correctly identified.
    *   Example 3, Row 2 (index 2): Pattern `[1, 2, 2]`, length 3. Correctly identified.
    *   Example 3, Row 3 (index 3): The code identified pattern `[2, 1, 2]` with length 3. Let's re-check my manual analysis: Input `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`.
        *   Check p=3: `r[0]=2`, `r[3]=2`; `r[1]=1`, `r[4]=1`; `r[2]=2`, `r[5]=2`; `r[3]=2`, `r[6]=2`; `r[4]=1`, `r[7]=1`. Yes, `[2, 1, 2]` of length 3 *is* the smallest repeating pattern according to the code's logic (`row[i] == pattern[i % p_len]`). My manual check for p=6 was looking for `r[j] == r[j+p]`, which is slightly different. The code's approach seems more robust for constructing the extended row. Let's test row 3 with pattern `P=[2,1,2]`, p=3. Output width 16.
        *   Output: `[P[0],P[1],P[2], P[0],P[1],P[2], P[0],P[1],P[2], P[0],P[1],P[2], P[0],P[1],P[2], P[0]]`
        *   `= [2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2]`
        *   Expected Output Row 4: `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]`
        *   This *doesn't* match the expected output. The pattern finding logic or the overall transformation rule needs refinement.

**Revisiting the Pattern Hypothesis:**

Maybe the pattern isn't necessarily the *smallest* repeating unit in the mathematical sense used by the code. Perhaps the "pattern" is simply the entire content of the input row, and this pattern is repeated cyclically?

Let `r` be the input row of width `W`. Let `OutputRow` have width `2*W`.
`OutputRow[k] = r[k % W]` for `k` from 0 to `2*W - 1`.

Let's test this simpler hypothesis:

*   **Example 1, Row 3:** `r = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2]`. W=7. Output width 14.
    *   Output row: `r[0%7], r[1%7], ..., r[6%7], r[7%7], r[8%7], ..., r[13%7]`
    *   `= r[0], r[1], ..., r[6], r[0], r[1], ..., r[6]`
    *   `= [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2]` - This is the `Transformed Output` from the *first* attempt (simple duplication) and is **incorrect**.

**Third Hypothesis: Repeat the pattern identified by the *correct* output.**

Let's look at the relationship between the input row and the *correct* output row.
Output row = `InputRow + AppendedPart`

*   **Example 1, Row 3:**
    *   `Input = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2]` (W=7)
    *   `Append= [3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]` (Length 7)
    *   `Output= [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]` (Length 14)
    *   Is `Append` related to `Input`? `Append` is `Input` shifted left by 1, with wrap-around? `shift_left([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2]) = [3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]`. No.
    *   Is the whole `Output` a repetition of `[2, 3, 3]`? Yes: `[2,3,3, 2,3,3, 2,3,3, 2,3,3, 2,3]`. The pattern `[2, 3, 3]` is repeated to fill the 14 slots.

*   **Example 3, Row 3:**
    *   `Input = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]` (W=8)
    *   `Append= [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (Length 8)
    *   `Output= [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (Length 16)
    *   Is the whole `Output` a repetition of `[1, 2, 2]`? Yes: `[1,2,2, 1,2,2, 1,2,2, 1,2,2, 1,2,2, 1]`. The pattern `[1, 2, 2]` is repeated to fill the 16 slots.

*   **Example 3, Row 4:**
    *   `Input = [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (W=8)
    *   `Append= [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]` (Length 8)
    *   `Output= [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]` (Length 16)
    *   Is the whole `Output` a repetition of `[2, 1, 2]`? No. `[2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2,1,2, 2]` - Mismatch.
    *   Is the whole `Output` a repetition of `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (the input row)? No.
    *   Is the whole `Output` a repetition of some *other* pattern? Let's check the output `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]`.
        *   p=1? No. p=2? No. p=3? No. p=4? No. p=5? No.
        *   p=6? `O[0]=2, O[6]=2`; `O[1]=1, O[7]=1`; `O[2]=2, O[8]=2`; `O[3]=2, O[9]=2`; `O[4]=1, O[10]=1`; `O[5]=2, O[11]=2`. Yes.
        *   The pattern is `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]` (length 6).
        *   Let's reconstruct the output using `P = [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]`: `[P[0..5], P[0..5], P[0..3]]`
        *   `= [2,1,2,2,1,2, 2,1,2,2,1,2, 2,1,2,2]` - This matches the Expected Output for Row 4.

**Final Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule is:
1.  Determine the output dimensions (H, 2*W).
2.  For each input row `r`:
    a.  If `r` is all zeros, the output row is all zeros (length 2*W).
    b.  If `r` is non-zero:
        i.  Find the **fundamental repeating pattern** `P` and its length `p` within the row `r`. This pattern must start at index 0 and be the shortest sequence such that the *entire* input row `r` can be described as repetitions of `P` (i.e., `r[k] == P[k % p]` for all `k` from 0 to `W-1`). *This was the pattern finding logic used in the `tool_code`.*
        ii. Construct the output row by repeating this pattern `P` cyclically until the row has length `2*W`. (i.e., `OutputRow[k] = P[k % p]` for all `k` from 0 to `2*W - 1`).

This hypothesis correctly explains all examples, including the problematic Row 4 of Example 3 where the pattern identified by the code (`[2, 1, 2]`, p=3) works for the *output* generation, even if it didn't seem to immediately explain the input structure perfectly at first glance during manual inspection. The code's pattern finding was correct, and applying that pattern to the doubled width generates the correct output.

**Updated YAML Facts**


```yaml
Objects:
  - Input_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Height: H (integer)
        - Width: W (integer)
        - Content: 2D array of integers (rows)
  - Output_Grid:
      Properties:
        - Height: H (integer, same as Input_Grid height)
        - Width: 2 * W (integer, double the Input_Grid width)
        - Content: 2D array of integers (rows)
  - Row_Pattern:
      Properties:
        - Sequence: P (list of integers)
        - Length: p (integer, > 0)
      Context: Derived from a non-zero Input_Grid row 'r'. It's the smallest sequence P starting at r[0] such that r[k] == P[k % p] for all 0 <= k < W.

Actions:
  - Identify_Pattern:
      Input: Input_Row (r)
      Output: Row_Pattern (P, p)
      Description: Finds the shortest repeating pattern P (length p) starting at index 0 that generates the Input_Row r when repeated cyclically.
  - Extend_Row_Pattern:
      Input: Row_Pattern (P, p), Target_Width (2 * W)
      Output: Extended_Row (list of integers)
      Description: Creates a new row by repeating the pattern P cyclically (using modulo p arithmetic on indices) until the row reaches the Target_Width.
  - Transform_Grid:
      Input: Input_Grid
      Output: Output_Grid
      Description: For each row in Input_Grid, if the row is all zeros, the corresponding Output_Grid row is all zeros (width 2*W). Otherwise, Identify_Pattern for the row, then Extend_Row_Pattern using the identified pattern P and length p to generate the corresponding Output_Grid row (width 2*W).

Relationships:
  - Output_Grid is derived from Input_Grid.
  - Output_Grid.Height equals Input_Grid.Height.
  - Output_Grid.Width equals 2 * Input_Grid.Width.
  - Each Output_Grid row is generated based on the repeating pattern found in the corresponding Input_Grid row.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid. Note its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Prepare an output grid with height H and width (2 * W).
3.  Process each row of the input grid from top to bottom (row index `i` from 0 to H-1):
    a.  Let the current input row be `r`.
    b.  Check if all elements in `r` are zero.
        i.  If yes, fill the corresponding output row (row `i`) with zeros.
        ii. If no (the row contains non-zero elements):
            1.  Find the shortest repeating pattern `P` (of length `p`) starting from the first element of `r`, such that `r` is formed by repeating `P`. Specifically, find the smallest positive integer `p` where `r[k] == r[k % p]` for all `k` from 0 to `W-1`. The pattern `P` is the first `p` elements of `r`.
            2.  Construct the corresponding output row (row `i` of the output grid) by repeating the pattern `P` cyclically. The element at column `k` (from 0 to 2*W - 1) in the output row will be `P[k % p]`.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
