"""
Transforms an input grid based on its shape and the number of 2x2 blocks of '2's.

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (rows and columns).
2.  Check if the grid is square (rows == columns).
3.  If the grid is square, the output is 0.
4.  If the grid is not square:
    a.  Count the number of non-overlapping 2x2 subgrids consisting entirely of the digit 2.
    b.  If the count of such 2x2 subgrids is exactly 1, the output is 8.
    c.  Otherwise (count is 0 or greater than 1), the output is 0.
