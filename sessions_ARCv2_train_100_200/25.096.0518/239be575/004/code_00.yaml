objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - digits: [0, 2, 8]
      - rows: integer (number of rows)
      - columns: integer (number of columns)
      - shape: derived property (square if rows == columns, non-square otherwise)
      - count_8: integer (total number of '8's in the grid)
  - name: two_by_two_square_pattern
    properties:
      - structure: [[2, 2], [2, 2]]
      - count_in_grid: integer (number of occurrences in input_grid)
  - name: output_value
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - possible_values: [0, 8]

  - name: determine_output
    description: Calculate the output_value based on the grid shape, pattern count, and count of eights.

relationships:
  - If input_grid.shape is square, output_value is 0.
  - If input_grid.shape is non-square:
      - output_value depends on two_by_two_square_pattern.count_in_grid and input_grid.count_8.
      - If two_by_two_square_pattern.count_in_grid is exactly 2 AND input_grid.count_8 is NOT 13, then output_value is 8.
      - Otherwise (if count is not 2 OR count_8 is 13), output_value is 0.
