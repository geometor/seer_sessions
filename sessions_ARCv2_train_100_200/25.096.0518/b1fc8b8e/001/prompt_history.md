## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input is a 6x6 grid of integers (0 and 8). The output is a 5x5 grid of integers (0 and 8).
2.  **Color Palette:** Only two distinct numbers (colors) are used: 0 (representing perhaps black or background) and 8 (representing perhaps red or foreground).
3.  **Dimensionality Change:** The grid size reduces from 6x6 to 5x5.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit distinct, highly structured patterns. There appear to be two primary patterns for the output grid, determined by the content of the input grid.
5.  **Row Patterns:** The output grids are constructed from a small set of predefined 1x5 row patterns. Let's identify them:
    *   `P0 = 0 0 0 0 0` (Zero row)
    *   `P1 = 8 8 0 8 8`
    *   `P2 = 0 8 0 0 8`
6.  **Conditional Output Generation:** The specific arrangement of these row patterns (P0, P1, P2) in the 5x5 output depends on a condition evaluated on the input grid.
    *   **Output Pattern 1:** Observed in `train_1` and `train_2`. The structure is `P1, P1, P0, P1, P1`.
    *   **Output Pattern 2:** Observed in `train_3`, `train_4`, and `train_5`. The structure is `P2, P1, P0, P2, P1`.
7.  **Trigger Condition:** The switch between Output Pattern 1 and Output Pattern 2 seems to depend on the presence of a specific 3x3 pattern within the 6x6 input grid. The pattern that triggers Output Pattern 1 appears to be a 3x3 subgrid where the top two rows consist entirely of 8s (`[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [*, *, *]]`, where '*' can be 0 or 8). If this pattern is found anywhere in the input, Output Pattern 1 is generated; otherwise, Output Pattern 2 is generated.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define three constant row patterns of size 1x5:
    *   `P0` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   `P1` = `[8, 8, 0, 8, 8]`
    *   `P2` = `[0, 8, 0, 0, 8]`
2.  Search the input 6x6 grid for any occurrence of a 3x3 subgrid where the top row is `[8, 8, 8]` and the second row is `[8, 8, 8]` (the third row can be anything). Let's call this the "Trigger Pattern".
3.  If the Trigger Pattern is found anywhere in the input grid:
    *   Construct the 5x5 output grid by stacking the rows in the following order: `P1`, `P1`, `P0`, `P1`, `P1`.
4.  If the Trigger Pattern is *not* found anywhere in the input grid:
    *   Construct the 5x5 output grid by stacking the rows in the following order: `P2`, `P1`, `P0`, `P2`, `P1`.
5.  Return the constructed 5x5 grid as the output.
