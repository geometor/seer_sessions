transformation:
  - operation: pattern_detection
    description: Check the input grid for a specific 3x3 pattern.
    details:
      - pattern_name: TriggerPattern
      - pattern_definition: A 3x3 subgrid where the first row is [8, 8, 8] and the second row is [8, 8, 8]. The third row can contain any combination of 0s and 8s.
