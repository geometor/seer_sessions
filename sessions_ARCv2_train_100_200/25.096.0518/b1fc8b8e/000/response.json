The output is a 5x5 grid of integers (0 and 8).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Only two distinct numbers (colors) are used: 0 (representing perhaps black or background) and 8 (representing perhaps red or foreground).\n3.  **Dimensionality Change:** The grid size reduces from 6x6 to 5x5.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit distinct, highly structured patterns. There appear to be two primary patterns for the output grid, determined by the content of the input grid.\n5.  **Row Patterns:** The output grids are constructed from a small set of predefined 1x5 row patterns. Let's identify them:\n    *   `P0 = 0 0 0 0 0` (Zero row)\n    *   `P1 = 8 8 0 8 8`\n    *   `P2 = 0 8 0 0 8`\n6.  **Conditional Output Generation:** The specific arrangement of these row patterns (P0, P1, P2) in the 5x5 output depends on a condition evaluated on the input grid.\n    *   **Output Pattern 1:** Observed in `train_1` and `train_2`. The structure is `P1, P1, P0, P1, P1`.\n    *   **Output Pattern 2:** Observed in `train_3`, `train_4`, and `train_5`. The structure is `P2, P1, P0, P2, P1`.\n7.  **Trigger Condition:** The switch between Output Pattern 1 and Output Pattern 2 seems to depend on the presence of a specific 3x3 pattern within the 6x6 input grid. The pattern that triggers Output Pattern 1 appears to be a 3x3 subgrid where the top two rows consist entirely of 8s (`[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [*, *, *]]`, where '*' can be 0 or 8). If this pattern is found anywhere in the input, Output Pattern 1 is generated; otherwise, Output Pattern 2 is generated.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
