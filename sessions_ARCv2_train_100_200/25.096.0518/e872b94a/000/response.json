The value 5 appears to represent foreground pixels or filled cells, while 0 represents the background. The arrangement of 5s often forms visual patterns or shapes, sometimes resembling characters or digits, which may or may not be contiguous (forming one or more connected components).\n2.  **Output:** The output is a 1D array (list) containing only the integer value 0. The length of this output array varies between examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task is to determine the rule that dictates the *length* of the output array based on the properties of the input grid. The content of the output array is constant (all zeros).\n4.  **Key Observation:** The length of the output array seems related to the spatial extent of the '5' cells in the input grid. Specifically, it appears connected to the dimensions of the minimal bounding box enclosing all the '5' cells.\n\n## YAML Documentation\n\n"

Find the minimum row (`min_row`), maximum row (`max_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), and maximum column (`max_col`) among the locations identified in step 1.\n4.  Calculate the height of the bounding box: `H = max_row - min_row + 1`.\n5.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `W = max_col - min_col + 1`.\n6.  Determine the minimum dimension: `m = min(W, H)`.\n7.  Determine the output length `L` based on the value of `m` according to the observed pattern:\n    *   If `m` is 2, set `L` to 2.\n    *   If `m` is 6, set `L` to 3.\n    *   If `m` is 9, set `L` to 5.\n    *   If `m` is 10, set `L` to 4.\n    *   (For other values of `m`, the rule needs further generalization, but a likely candidate is related to `ceil(m / 2)` with specific adjustments for `m=2` and `m=10`).\n8.
