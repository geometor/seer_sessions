task_description: Determine the length of an output array of zeros based on the spatial properties of '5' values in an input grid.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D list of integers (0 or 5)
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable rows and columns
      - content: contains 0s (background) and 5s (foreground)
      - structure: 5s form patterns or shapes, potentially multiple connected components
  - element: output_array
    type: 1D list of integers
    properties:
      - content: contains only the value 0
      - length: variable, determined by the input grid

transformation:
  input: input_grid
  output: output_array
  steps:
    - Find all cells containing the value 5 in the input_grid.
    - If no 5s are found, the output is likely empty or has a default length (behavior not fully specified by examples, assuming at least one 5 exists based on examples).
    - Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all cells with value 5.
    - Calculate the width (W) and height (H) of this bounding box.
    - Calculate the minimum of these two dimensions: m = min(W, H).
    - Determine the output length (L) by applying a specific function 'f' to 'm': L = f(m).
    - Based on the provided examples, the function 'f' has the following observed values:
        - f(2) = 2
        - f(6) = 3
        - f(9) = 5
        - f(10) = 4
      (The general rule for f(m) for arbitrary 'm' is not fully determined from these examples alone but seems related to ceil(m/2) or similar, with specific adjustments).
    - Construct the output_array consisting of L zeros.

relationships:
  - The length of the output_array is a function of the minimum dimension of the bounding box of the '5' cells in the input_grid.
