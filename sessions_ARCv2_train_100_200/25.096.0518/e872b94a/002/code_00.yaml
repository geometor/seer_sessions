task_description: >
  Determine the dimensions of a column vector (a grid with one column)
  filled with zeros. The number of rows in this column vector is derived
  from the minimum dimension (height or width) of the minimal bounding box
  enclosing all foreground pixels (value 5) in the input grid, according
  to a specific mapping rule.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D list of integers (0 or 5)
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable rows and columns
      - content: contains 0s (background) and 5s (foreground)
      - structure: 5s form patterns or shapes
  - element: bounding_box
    type: conceptual rectangle
    properties:
      - defined_by: min/max row and column of '5' valued cells in input_grid
      - height: number of rows spanned by the box
      - width: number of columns spanned by the box
  - element: min_dimension
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: minimum of bounding_box height and width
  - element: output_column_vector
    type: 2D list of integers (list of lists)
    properties:
      - content: contains only the value 0
      - structure: N rows, 1 column (N x 1 grid)
      - num_rows: Determined by applying a specific mapping function to min_dimension

transformation:
  input: input_grid
  output: output_column_vector
  steps:
    - Find all coordinates (row, col) containing the value 5 in the input_grid.
    - If no 5s are found, return an empty list representing a 0x0 grid.
    - Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all found coordinates.
    - Calculate the height (H) and width (W) of this bounding box.
    - Calculate the minimum dimension: m = min(H, W).
    - Determine the required number of rows (L) for the output using the mapping:
        - If m=2, L=2
        - If m=6, L=3
        - If m=9, L=5
        - If m=10, L=4
        - (Hypothesized fallback for unobserved m: L = ceil(m/2))
    - Construct the output_column_vector: Create a list containing L inner lists, where each inner list contains the single integer 0.

relationships:
  - The number of rows in the output_column_vector is a function of the min_dimension derived from the input_grid's bounding box.
  - The output_column_vector always has exactly one column.
