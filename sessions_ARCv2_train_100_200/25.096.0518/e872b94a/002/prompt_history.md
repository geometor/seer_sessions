## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input:** The input is a 2D grid (matrix) containing integer values, specifically 0 and 5. The dimensions of the grid vary between examples. The value 5 appears to represent foreground pixels or filled cells, while 0 represents the background. The arrangement of 5s often forms visual patterns or shapes, sometimes resembling characters or digits, which may or may not be contiguous (forming one or more connected components).
2.  **Output:** The output is a 1D array (list) containing only the integer value 0. The length of this output array varies between examples.
3.  **Transformation:** The core task is to determine the rule that dictates the *length* of the output array based on the properties of the input grid. The content of the output array is constant (all zeros).
4.  **Key Observation:** The length of the output array seems related to the spatial extent of the '5' cells in the input grid. Specifically, it appears connected to the dimensions of the minimal bounding box enclosing all the '5' cells.

## YAML Documentation


```yaml
task_description: Determine the length of an output array of zeros based on the spatial properties of '5' values in an input grid.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D list of integers (0 or 5)
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable rows and columns
      - content: contains 0s (background) and 5s (foreground)
      - structure: 5s form patterns or shapes, potentially multiple connected components
  - element: output_array
    type: 1D list of integers
    properties:
      - content: contains only the value 0
      - length: variable, determined by the input grid

transformation:
  input: input_grid
  output: output_array
  steps:
    - Find all cells containing the value 5 in the input_grid.
    - If no 5s are found, the output is likely empty or has a default length (behavior not fully specified by examples, assuming at least one 5 exists based on examples).
    - Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all cells with value 5.
    - Calculate the width (W) and height (H) of this bounding box.
    - Calculate the minimum of these two dimensions: m = min(W, H).
    - Determine the output length (L) by applying a specific function 'f' to 'm': L = f(m).
    - Based on the provided examples, the function 'f' has the following observed values:
        - f(2) = 2
        - f(6) = 3
        - f(9) = 5
        - f(10) = 4
      (The general rule for f(m) for arbitrary 'm' is not fully determined from these examples alone but seems related to ceil(m/2) or similar, with specific adjustments).
    - Construct the output_array consisting of L zeros.

relationships:
  - The length of the output_array is a function of the minimum dimension of the bounding box of the '5' cells in the input_grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all locations `(row, col)` in the input grid that contain the value 5.
2.  If no cells contain 5, produce an empty output array (or handle as an edge case if specified).
3.  Find the minimum row (`min_row`), maximum row (`max_row`), minimum column (`min_col`), and maximum column (`max_col`) among the locations identified in step 1.
4.  Calculate the height of the bounding box: `H = max_row - min_row + 1`.
5.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `W = max_col - min_col + 1`.
6.  Determine the minimum dimension: `m = min(W, H)`.
7.  Determine the output length `L` based on the value of `m` according to the observed pattern:
    *   If `m` is 2, set `L` to 2.
    *   If `m` is 6, set `L` to 3.
    *   If `m` is 9, set `L` to 5.
    *   If `m` is 10, set `L` to 4.
    *   (For other values of `m`, the rule needs further generalization, but a likely candidate is related to `ceil(m / 2)` with specific adjustments for `m=2` and `m=10`).
8.  Create a list containing `L` elements, where each element is the integer 0.
9.  Return the created list.
