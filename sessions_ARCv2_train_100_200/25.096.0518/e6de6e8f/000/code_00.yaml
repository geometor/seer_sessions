 perceptive_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2 rows x 12 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 2]
      - format: two lines of space-separated integers
      - role: encodes a single digit identifier
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8 rows x 7 columns
      - cell_values: [0, 2, 3]
      - format: multiple lines of space-separated integers
      - role: displays a visual representation of a digit
  - object: color_0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background color
  - object: color_2
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - role: primary encoding and drawing color
  - object: color_3
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - role: marker color in output
      - location: fixed at output_grid[0][3]
  - object: input_block
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2 rows x 2 columns
      - composition: formed by adjacent pairs of columns from the input_grid
      - quantity: 6 blocks per input_grid
      - role: basic unit of the input encoding scheme
  - object: block_sequence
    properties:
      - composition: ordered list of the 6 input_blocks derived from an input_grid
      - role: unique identifier for a specific digit
  - object: digit_pattern
    properties:
      - representation: predefined 7x7 grid pattern using color_2
      - identity: corresponds to a specific decimal digit (e.g., '1', '7', '4')
      - role: the shape to be drawn in the output grid (rows 1-7)
 relationships:
  - type: parsing
    from: input_grid
    to: input_block
    details: The input_grid is parsed column-wise into 6 sequential 2x2 input_blocks.
  - type: encoding
    from: block_sequence
    to: digit_pattern
    details: Each unique sequence of 6 input_blocks maps to a specific digit_pattern (e.g., the sequence in train_1 maps to the '1' pattern, train_2 to '7', train_3 to '4').
  - type: generation
    from: digit_pattern
    to: output_grid
    details: The output_grid is created by placing the marker (color_3) at [0,3] and drawing the mapped digit_pattern using color_2 in rows 1 through 7. Background is color_0.
