This can be interpreted as a 2x12 grid of cells, where 0 and 2 represent distinct states or colors (e.g., background and foreground).\n2.  **Output:** The output is an 8x7 grid of integers (0, 2, or 3). It appears visually distinct from the input. Color 0 seems to be the background. Color 2 forms shapes within the grid. Color 3 appears only once in a fixed position (top row, middle column).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to interpret the 2x12 input grid as an encoded representation of a single digit. The specific pattern in the input determines which digit's shape is drawn in the output grid using color 2. The output grid also includes a fixed marker (color 3).\n4.  **Encoding:** The input's 12 columns seem to be grouped into six pairs, forming six 2x2 blocks. The specific sequence of these six unique 2x2 blocks determines which digit is selected.\n5.  **Output Patterns:** The outputs for the training examples correspond to visual representations of the digits '1', '7', and '4', respectively, drawn within the 7 rows below the marker.\n6.  **Colors/States:**\n    *   `0`: Background color in both input and output.\n    *   `2`: Primary drawing color in input encoding and output digit shapes.\n    *   `3`: Special marker color, appearing only in the output at a fixed location (0, 3).\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"

Divide this grid into six consecutive 2x2 blocks by taking column pairs (columns 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12). Record the sequence of these six 2x2 blocks.\n4.  **Identify Digit:** Compare the obtained sequence of six 2x2 blocks against predefined sequences known to correspond to specific digits ('1', '7', '4' based on examples). Determine the matching digit.\n5.  **Select Pattern:** Retrieve the predefined 7x7 pixel pattern associated with the identified digit. This pattern uses color `2` for the digit's shape and color `0` for the background within its 7x7 area.\n6.  **Draw Pattern:** Copy the selected 7x7 digit pattern into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row 1, column 0. This populates rows 1 through 7 of the output grid.\n7.  **Finalize:** The resulting 8x7 grid is the final output."
