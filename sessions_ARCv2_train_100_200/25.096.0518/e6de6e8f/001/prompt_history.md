## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input:** The input consists of two lines of text, each containing 12 space-separated integers (either 0 or 2). This can be interpreted as a 2x12 grid of cells, where 0 and 2 represent distinct states or colors (e.g., background and foreground).
2.  **Output:** The output is an 8x7 grid of integers (0, 2, or 3). It appears visually distinct from the input. Color 0 seems to be the background. Color 2 forms shapes within the grid. Color 3 appears only once in a fixed position (top row, middle column).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to interpret the 2x12 input grid as an encoded representation of a single digit. The specific pattern in the input determines which digit's shape is drawn in the output grid using color 2. The output grid also includes a fixed marker (color 3).
4.  **Encoding:** The input's 12 columns seem to be grouped into six pairs, forming six 2x2 blocks. The specific sequence of these six unique 2x2 blocks determines which digit is selected.
5.  **Output Patterns:** The outputs for the training examples correspond to visual representations of the digits '1', '7', and '4', respectively, drawn within the 7 rows below the marker.
6.  **Colors/States:**
    *   `0`: Background color in both input and output.
    *   `2`: Primary drawing color in input encoding and output digit shapes.
    *   `3`: Special marker color, appearing only in the output at a fixed location (0, 3).

      - composition: formed by adjacent pairs of columns from the input_grid
      - quantity: 6 blocks per input_grid
      - role: basic unit of the input encoding scheme
  - object: block_sequence
    properties:
      - composition: ordered list of the 6 input_blocks derived from an input_grid
      - role: unique identifier for a specific digit
  - object: digit_pattern
    properties:
      - representation: predefined 7x7 grid pattern using color_2
      - identity: corresponds to a specific decimal digit (e.g., '1', '7', '4')
      - role: the shape to be drawn in the output grid (rows 1-7)
 relationships:
  - type: parsing
    from: input_grid
    to: input_block
    details: The input_grid is parsed column-wise into 6 sequential 2x2 input_blocks.
  - type: encoding
    from: block_sequence
    to: digit_pattern
    details: Each unique sequence of 6 input_blocks maps to a specific digit_pattern (e.g., the sequence in train_1 maps to the '1' pattern, train_2 to '7', train_3 to '4').
  - type: generation
    from: digit_pattern
    to: output_grid
    details: The output_grid is created by placing the marker (color_3) at [0,3] and drawing the mapped digit_pattern using color_2 in rows 1 through 7. Background is color_0.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an 8x7 grid and fill it entirely with the background color `0`.
2.  **Place Marker:** Set the cell at row 0, column 3 of the output grid to the marker color `3`.
3.  **Parse Input:** Read the two input lines to form a 2x12 grid. Divide this grid into six consecutive 2x2 blocks by taking column pairs (columns 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12). Record the sequence of these six 2x2 blocks.
4.  **Identify Digit:** Compare the obtained sequence of six 2x2 blocks against predefined sequences known to correspond to specific digits ('1', '7', '4' based on examples). Determine the matching digit.
5.  **Select Pattern:** Retrieve the predefined 7x7 pixel pattern associated with the identified digit. This pattern uses color `2` for the digit's shape and color `0` for the background within its 7x7 area.
6.  **Draw Pattern:** Copy the selected 7x7 digit pattern into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row 1, column 0. This populates rows 1 through 7 of the output grid.
7.  **Finalize:** The resulting 8x7 grid is the final output.
