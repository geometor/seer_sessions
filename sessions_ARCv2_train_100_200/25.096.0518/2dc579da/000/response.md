Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers.
2.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids seem to possess a specific structure: a single horizontal row and a single vertical column are composed entirely of the same number (the "delimiter number"). These lines intersect at a single cell, also containing the delimiter number, effectively dividing the grid into four quadrants.
3.  **Delimiter Identification:** The delimiter number and its corresponding row/column indices are key features. This number is not necessarily the most frequent number overall but is characterized by forming these complete lines.
4.  **Unique Element:** In each example, there appears to be exactly one number that occurs only once in the entire input grid. The position of this unique number relative to the delimiter lines seems important.
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is always one of the four quadrants defined by the delimiter lines in the input grid.
6.  **Quadrant Selection:** The specific quadrant chosen for the output appears to be determined by the location of the unique number. The quadrant containing the unique number is the one selected as the output.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Identify the number (`delimiter_num`) that constitutes a complete horizontal row and a complete vertical column. Record the index of this row (`delimiter_row_idx`) and the index of this column (`delimiter_col_idx`).
2.  **Locate the unique element:** Find the number within the input grid that appears exactly once. Record its row index (`unique_row_idx`) and column index (`unique_col_idx`).
3.  **Determine the target quadrant based on the unique element's position relative to the delimiter lines:**
    *   If the unique element's row index is less than the delimiter row index (`unique_row_idx < delimiter_row_idx`) and its column index is less than the delimiter column index (`unique_col_idx < delimiter_col_idx`), select the **Top-Left** quadrant.
    *   If the unique element's row index is less than the delimiter row index (`unique_row_idx < delimiter_row_idx`) and its column index is greater than the delimiter column index (`unique_col_idx > delimiter_col_idx`), select the **Top-Right** quadrant.
    *   If the unique element's row index is greater than the delimiter row index (`unique_row_idx > delimiter_row_idx`) and its column index is less than the delimiter column index (`unique_col_idx < delimiter_col_idx`), select the **Bottom-Left** quadrant.
    *   If the unique element's row index is greater than the delimiter row index (`unique_row_idx > delimiter_row_idx`) and its column index is greater than the delimiter column index (`unique_col_idx > delimiter_col_idx`), select the **Bottom-Right** quadrant.
4.  **Extract the selected quadrant as the output grid:**
    *   For **Top-Left**: Extract the subgrid from the input grid from row 0 up to (but not including) `delimiter_row_idx`, and from column 0 up to (but not including) `delimiter_col_idx`.
    *   For **Top-Right**: Extract the subgrid from the input grid from row 0 up to (but not including) `delimiter_row_idx`, and from column `delimiter_col_idx + 1` to the end.
    *   For **Bottom-Left**: Extract the subgrid from the input grid from row `delimiter_row_idx + 1` to the end, and from column 0 up to (but not including) `delimiter_col_idx`.
    *   For **Bottom-Right**: Extract the subgrid from the input grid from row `delimiter_row_idx + 1` to the end, and from column `delimiter_col_idx + 1` to the end.
