These lines intersect at a single cell, also containing the delimiter number, effectively dividing the grid into four quadrants.\n3.  **Delimiter Identification:** The delimiter number and its corresponding row/column indices are key features. This number is not necessarily the most frequent number overall but is characterized by forming these complete lines.\n4.  **Unique Element:** In each example, there appears to be exactly one number that occurs only once in the entire input grid. The position of this unique number relative to the delimiter lines seems important.\n5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is always one of the four quadrants defined by the delimiter lines in the input grid.\n6.  **Quadrant Selection:** The specific quadrant chosen for the output appears to be determined by the location of the unique number. The quadrant containing the unique number is the one selected as the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
