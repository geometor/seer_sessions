Comparing `train_4` with the others reveals a difference. In `train_4`, the input grid (`I`) is identical to its 180-degree rotation (`R180`), whereas in other examples, `I` is not equal to `R180`. This suggests the transformation rule changes based on whether the input grid possesses 180-degree rotational symmetry.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
