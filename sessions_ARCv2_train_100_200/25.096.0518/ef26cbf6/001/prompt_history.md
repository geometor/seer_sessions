Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are numerical grids.
2.  **Separators:** The number `4` acts as a separator, forming consistent horizontal and vertical lines across examples. These lines partition the grid into distinct rectangular regions or "cells".
3.  **Background:** The number `0` appears to be a background or empty value, generally remaining unchanged.
4.  **Target Number:** The number `1` appears to be a placeholder or target number that gets transformed in the output.
5.  **Color Numbers:** Other numbers (2, 3, 6, 7, 8 in the examples) act like "colors". Their key role seems to be determining the replacement value for the `1`s.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves replacing the `1`s based on the "color" found in related cells, respecting the boundaries defined by the `4`s. There appears to be a priority system for determining which color source to use.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - contains: Numbers
    - partitioned_by: Number_4
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Assuming standard digits
      Roles:
        - 0: Background
        - 4: Separator
        - 1: Target (placeholder to be replaced)
        - Others (2,3,5,6,7,8): SourceColor
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular region within the grid bounded by grid edges or lines of Number_4.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: [top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col]
        - contains: Numbers
      Relationships:
        - above: Cell (same columns, previous row section)
        - below: Cell (same columns, next row section)
        - left_of: Cell (same rows, previous column section)
        - right_of: Cell (same rows, next column section)
Actions:
  - Identify_Cells: Determine the boundaries of all cells based on Number_4 separators.
  - Find_Unique_SourceColor: Within a given Cell, find if there is exactly one unique Number that is not 0, 1, or 4.
  - Replace_Target: Change all occurrences of Number_1 within a target Cell to a specified SourceColor.
Relationships:
  - Propagation_Rule: The SourceColor used to replace Number_1 in a target Cell is determined by checking other Cells in a specific order of priority (Vertical > Horizontal).
  - Boundary_Respect: Transformations occur strictly within the boundaries of each Cell defined by Number_4. Number_4 itself is never changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all horizontal rows and vertical columns consisting entirely of the number `4`. These act as separators.
3.  Use the separators and grid boundaries to define distinct rectangular `Cells`. Each cell is a maximal block of numbers not containing `4`. Note the row-section and column-lane index for each cell.
4.  Iterate through each `Cell` in the grid (e.g., row-section by row-section, then column-lane by column-lane within that section). Let the current cell be `TargetCell`, located at section `i` and lane `j`.
5.  Check if `TargetCell` contains any instance of the number `1`. If it does not, proceed to the next cell.
6.  If `TargetCell` contains `1`s, attempt to find a `SourceColor` to replace them:
    a.  **Vertical Priority:** Look at the `SourceCellAbove` located at section `i-1` and lane `j` (if `i > 0`). Find if `SourceCellAbove` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.
    b.  **Horizontal Priority:** If no `PaintColor` was found from `SourceCellAbove` (either because `i=0` or the cell above didn't have a unique source color), look at the `SourceCellLeft` located at section `i` and lane `j-1` (if `j > 0`). Find if `SourceCellLeft` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.
    c.  **(Self Check - Lower Priority, inferred):** *If no `PaintColor` was found from above or left, check within the `TargetCell` itself. Find if `TargetCell` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.* (Note: This step wasn't strictly necessary for the examples but seems a logical fallback).
7.  If a `PaintColor` was successfully determined in step 6, replace *all* instances of the number `1` within the `TargetCell` in the *output grid* with the found `PaintColor`.
8.  If no `PaintColor` was determined after checking all priority sources, leave the `1`s in the `TargetCell` unchanged in the output grid.
9.  After iterating through all cells, the final output grid is complete.
