```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies horizontal rows and vertical columns entirely composed of the number 4, treating them as separators.
2. These separators divide the grid into rectangular cells.
3. For each cell containing the number 1:
    a. It first checks the cell directly above it (if one exists). If that cell contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4, that number (the 'PaintColor') is used.
    b. If no PaintColor is found from the cell above, it checks the cell directly to its left (if one exists). If that cell contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4, that number is used as the PaintColor.
    c. If a PaintColor is determined from either the cell above or the cell to the left, all instances of the number 1 within the current cell are replaced by the PaintColor in the output grid.
    d. If no PaintColor is found, the 1s in the current cell remain unchanged.
4. Numbers 0 and 4, and cells not containing 1, remain unchanged.
