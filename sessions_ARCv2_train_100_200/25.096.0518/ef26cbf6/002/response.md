**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed to replicate the transformation shown in the training examples. Specifically, the output grids generated by the code were identical to the input grids, meaning the '1' values were never replaced. The initial natural language program and the code logic correctly identified the core concepts: separators (4), cells, target value (1), source colors (other digits), and a priority-based replacement (check above, then left).

The failure analysis strongly suggests the error lies in the implementation of identifying the correct "source" cell (above or left). The code appears to impose overly strict alignment requirements (requiring exact column matches for the cell above, and exact row matches for the cell left), whereas the examples imply that any cell in the adjacent section (defined by separators) that overlaps with the target cell's corresponding dimension should be considered. The first such overlapping cell encountered (based on a consistent iteration order) should be checked for a unique source color.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the definition of how "above" and "left" source cells are identified based on separator-defined regions and overlap, rather than strict alignment.
2.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined understanding.
3.  Use code execution to gather precise metrics about cell structures and source color locations in the examples to confirm the refined hypothesis.

**Revised Assessment after Metrics**

The metrics calculation, using the *revised* logic (overlap instead of exact alignment), still fails to find the source colors. This indicates the error isn't just the strict alignment check in the previous code, but potentially a misunderstanding of how source colors propagate or which cells are considered sources.

Let's re-re-examine Example 1:
*   Target Cell 1: Bounds (0, 3, 4, 7). Contains 1s. Output color is 7.
    *   Cell physically above doesn't exist.
    *   Cell physically left is (0, 3, 0, 3). Contains 7. `_find_unique_source_color` should return 7.
    *   Why did the metrics code report "Source Left: None found"? Ah, the metrics code *also* used the faulty logic from the original attempt when looking for sources! It checked `if unique_color is not None:` *inside* the loop for finding candidates, but didn't assign it properly or handle the priority logic correctly within the analysis script itself.

Let's manually trace the logic with the *intended* refined rules:
*   **Example 1, Target Cell 1 (0,3,4,7):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: No cells above (r_start=0).
    *   Check Left: Cell (0,3,0,3) ends at column 3 (`ec=3`), which is `c_start-1`. Rows 0-3 overlap with target rows 0-3. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,0,3): `[[0,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique non-0,1,4 is 7. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 7. MATCHES output.
*   **Example 1, Target Cell 2 (4,7,4,7):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: Cell (0,3,4,7) ends at row 3 (`er=3`), which is `r_start-1`. Columns 4-7 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,4,7): `[[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]`. Contains 1s, no unique *source* color. NO.
    *   Check Left: Cell (4,7,0,3) ends at column 3 (`ec=3`), which is `c_start-1`. Rows 4-7 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (4,7,0,3): `[[0,0,0],[0,3,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique non-0,1,4 is 3. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 3. MATCHES output.
*   **Example 1, Target Cell 3 (8,11,4,7):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: Cell (4,7,4,7) ends at row 7 (`er=7`), which is `r_start-1`. Columns 4-7 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (4,7,4,7): `[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]`. Contains 1s, no unique *source* color. NO.
    *   Check Left: Cell (8,11,0,3) ends at column 3 (`ec=3`), which is `c_start-1`. Rows 8-11 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (8,11,0,3): `[[0,0,0],[0,8,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique non-0,1,4 is 8. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 8. MATCHES output.

*   **Example 2, Target Cell 1 (4,7,0,3):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: Cell (0,3,0,3) ends at row 3 (`er=3`). Columns 0-3 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,0,3): `[[0,0,0],[0,3,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique source is 3. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 3. MATCHES output.
*   **Example 2, Target Cell 2 (4,7,4,7):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: Cell (0,3,4,7) ends at row 3 (`er=3`). Columns 4-7 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,4,7): `[[0,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique source is 2. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 2. MATCHES output.
*   **Example 2, Target Cell 3 (4,7,8,11):** Contains 1s.
    *   Check Above: Cell (0,3,8,11) ends at row 3 (`er=3`). Columns 8-11 overlap. Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,8,11): `[[0,0,0],[0,6,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique source is 6. YES.
    *   Paint Color = 6. MATCHES output.

**Conclusion:** The initial refined hypothesis (overlap instead of exact alignment) *is* correct. The metrics script failed because it incorrectly implemented the check for source colors during analysis. The original natural language program's core logic was closer, but the implementation was flawed. The key is the correct definition of adjacency based on shared separators and overlap.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - cell_values: Numbers
  Structure:
    - Separators: Lines (rows/columns) composed entirely of Number_4.
    - Cells: Rectangular regions defined by grid boundaries and Separators. Each cell occupies a specific row_section and column_section.
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Observed digits
      Roles:
        - 0: Background (ignored for color finding)
        - 4: Separator (defines cells, unchanged)
        - 1: Target (replaced by SourceColor)
        - Others (2,3,5,6,7,8): SourceColor (potential replacement values)
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular subgrid defined by `(start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col)`.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: Tuple[int, int, int, int]
        - content: Subgrid of Numbers
      State:
        - has_target: Boolean (contains Number_1)
        - unique_source_color: Optional[Number] (exactly one Number other than 0, 1, 4 exists within)
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      - Cell_Above: A cell in the row_section immediately preceding the target cell's row_section, which has horizontal overlap (shares some columns) with the target cell.
      - Cell_Left: A cell in the column_section immediately preceding the target cell's column_section, which has vertical overlap (shares some rows) with the target cell.
  - Color_Priority:
      - Vertical_First: The SourceColor from Cell_Above is prioritized.
      - Horizontal_Second: The SourceColor from Cell_Left is used only if no SourceColor is found in Cell_Above.
Actions:
  - Identify_Separators: Find all rows and columns filled with Number_4.
  - Define_Cells: Determine the boundaries of all Cells based on Separators and grid edges.
  - Find_Unique_Source_Color: Check if a Cell contains exactly one unique SourceColor value.
  - Determine_Paint_Color: For a Target Cell:
      1. Find Cell_Above (if exists). If it has a unique_source_color, use it as Paint_Color.
      2. If no Paint_Color found, find Cell_Left (if exists). If it has a unique_source_color, use it as Paint_Color.
  - Replace_Targets: Within a Target Cell, change all instances of Number_1 to the determined Paint_Color. If no Paint_Color was determined, Number_1 remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify separator lines: Find all row indices `r` where the entire row `input[r]` consists only of the number `4`, and all column indices `c` where the entire column `input[:, c]` consists only of `4`.
3.  Define cells: Use the grid boundaries and the identified separator lines to partition the grid into distinct rectangular cells. Record the boundaries `(start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col)` for each cell.
4.  Iterate through each defined cell (let's call it the `TargetCell` with boundaries `tr_start, tr_end, tc_start, tc_end`).
5.  Check if the `TargetCell` subgrid (from the *input* grid) contains the number `1`. If not, continue to the next cell.
6.  If the `TargetCell` contains `1`, initialize a `PaintColor` variable to `None`.
7.  **Check Above:**
    a.  If `tr_start > 0` (i.e., the cell is not in the top-most row section), search for a potential `SourceCellAbove`.
    b.  Iterate through all defined cells. A cell (`sr_start, sr_end, sc_start, sc_end`) is a candidate `SourceCellAbove` if its bottom boundary is exactly above the target's top boundary (`sr_end == tr_start`) AND it has horizontal overlap with the target cell (`max(sc_start, tc_start) < min(sc_end, tc_end)`).
    c.  For the *first* such candidate found (based on iteration order): extract its subgrid from the *input* grid and check if it contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4.
    d.  If such a unique number is found, assign it to `PaintColor` and stop searching for `SourceCellAbove`.
8.  **Check Left:**
    a.  If `PaintColor` is still `None` AND `tc_start > 0` (i.e., the cell is not in the left-most column section), search for a potential `SourceCellLeft`.
    b.  Iterate through all defined cells. A cell (`sr_start, sr_end, sc_start, sc_end`) is a candidate `SourceCellLeft` if its right boundary is exactly to the left of the target's left boundary (`sc_end == tc_start`) AND it has vertical overlap with the target cell (`max(sr_start, tr_start) < min(sr_end, tr_end)`).
    c.  For the *first* such candidate found: extract its subgrid from the *input* grid and check if it contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4.
    d.  If such a unique number is found, assign it to `PaintColor` and stop searching for `SourceCellLeft`.
9.  **Apply Color:** If `PaintColor` is not `None` (meaning a source color was found either above or left), then modify the *output grid*: for every position `(r, c)` within the `TargetCell` boundaries (`tr_start <= r < tr_end`, `tc_start <= c < tc_end`), if the *input* grid at `(r, c)` is `1`, set the *output* grid at `(r, c)` to `PaintColor`.
10. After iterating through all cells, return the modified output grid.
