            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed to replicate the transformation shown in the training examples. Specifically, the output grids generated by the code were identical to the input grids, meaning the '1' values were never replaced. The initial natural language program and the code logic correctly identified the core concepts: separators (4), cells, target value (1), source colors (other digits), and a priority-based replacement (check above, then left).\n\nThe failure analysis strongly suggests the error lies in the implementation of identifying the correct \"source\" cell (above or left). The code appears to impose overly strict alignment requirements (requiring exact column matches for the cell above, and exact row matches for the cell left), whereas the examples imply that any cell in the adjacent section (defined by separators) that overlaps with the target cell's corresponding dimension should be considered. The first such overlapping cell encountered (based on a consistent iteration order) should be checked for a unique source color.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the definition of how \"above\" and \"left\" source cells are identified based on separator-defined regions and overlap, rather than strict alignment.\n2.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined understanding.\n3.  Use code execution to gather precise metrics about cell structures and source color locations in the examples to confirm the refined hypothesis.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

This indicates the error isn't just the strict alignment check in the previous code, but potentially a misunderstanding of how source colors propagate or which cells are considered sources.\n\nLet's re-re-examine Example 1:\n*   Target Cell 1: Bounds (0, 3, 4, 7). Contains 1s. Output color is 7.\n    *   Cell physically above doesn't exist.\n    *   Cell physically left is (0, 3, 0, 3).

Check `_find_unique_source_color` for cell (0,3,4,7): `[[0,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]`. Unique source is 2. YES.\n    *   Paint Color = 2. MATCHES output.\n*   **Example 2, Target Cell 3 (4,7,8,11):** Contains 1s.\n    *   Check Above: Cell (0,3,8,11) ends at row 3 (`er=3`). Columns 8-11 overlap.

MATCHES output.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial refined hypothesis (overlap instead of exact alignment) *is* correct. The metrics script failed because it incorrectly implemented the check for source colors during analysis. The original natural language program's core logic was closer, but the implementation was flawed. The key is the correct definition of adjacency based on shared separators and overlap.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If `tr_start > 0` (i.e., the cell is not in the top-most row section), search for a potential `SourceCellAbove`.\n    b.  Iterate through all defined cells. A cell (`sr_start, sr_end, sc_start, sc_end`) is a candidate `SourceCellAbove` if its bottom boundary is exactly above the target's top boundary (`sr_end == tr_start`) AND it has horizontal overlap with the target cell (`max(sc_start, tc_start) < min(sc_end, tc_end)`).\n    c.  For the *first* such candidate found (based on iteration order): extract its subgrid from the *input* grid and check if it contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4.\n    d.  If such a unique number is found, assign it to `PaintColor` and stop searching for `SourceCellAbove`.\n8.  **Check Left:**\n    a.  If `PaintColor` is still `None` AND `tc_start > 0` (i.e., the cell is not in the left-most column section), search for a potential `SourceCellLeft`.\n    b.  Iterate through all defined cells. A cell (`sr_start, sr_end, sc_start, sc_end`) is a candidate `SourceCellLeft` if its right boundary is exactly to the left of the target's left boundary (`sc_end == tc_start`) AND it has vertical overlap with the target cell (`max(sr_start, tr_start) < min(sr_end, tr_end)`).\n    c.  For the *first* such candidate found: extract its subgrid from the *input* grid and check if it contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4.\n    d.  If such a unique number is found, assign it to `PaintColor` and stop searching for `SourceCellLeft`.\n9.  **Apply Color:** If `PaintColor` is not `None` (meaning a source color was found either above or left), then modify the *output grid*: for every position `(r, c)` within the `TargetCell` boundaries (`tr_start <= r < tr_end`, `tc_start <= c < tc_end`), if the *input* grid at `(r, c)` is `1`, set the *output* grid at `(r, c)` to `PaintColor`.\n10. After iterating through all cells, return the modified output grid."
