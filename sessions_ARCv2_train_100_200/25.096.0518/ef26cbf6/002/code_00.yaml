Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - cell_values: Numbers
  Structure:
    - Separators: Lines (rows/columns) composed entirely of Number_4.
    - Cells: Rectangular regions defined by grid boundaries and Separators. Each cell occupies a specific row_section and column_section.
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Observed digits
      Roles:
        - 0: Background (ignored for color finding)
        - 4: Separator (defines cells, unchanged)
        - 1: Target (replaced by SourceColor)
        - Others (2,3,5,6,7,8): SourceColor (potential replacement values)
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular subgrid defined by `(start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col)`.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: Tuple[int, int, int, int]
        - content: Subgrid of Numbers
      State:
        - has_target: Boolean (contains Number_1)
        - unique_source_color: Optional[Number] (exactly one Number other than 0, 1, 4 exists within)
Relationships:
  - Adjacency:
      - Cell_Above: A cell in the row_section immediately preceding the target cell's row_section, which has horizontal overlap (shares some columns) with the target cell.
      - Cell_Left: A cell in the column_section immediately preceding the target cell's column_section, which has vertical overlap (shares some rows) with the target cell.
  - Color_Priority:
      - Vertical_First: The SourceColor from Cell_Above is prioritized.
      - Horizontal_Second: The SourceColor from Cell_Left is used only if no SourceColor is found in Cell_Above.
Actions:
  - Identify_Separators: Find all rows and columns filled with Number_4.
  - Define_Cells: Determine the boundaries of all Cells based on Separators and grid edges.
  - Find_Unique_Source_Color: Check if a Cell contains exactly one unique SourceColor value.
  - Determine_Paint_Color: For a Target Cell:
      1. Find Cell_Above (if exists). If it has a unique_source_color, use it as Paint_Color.
      2. If no Paint_Color found, find Cell_Left (if exists). If it has a unique_source_color, use it as Paint_Color.
  - Replace_Targets: Within a Target Cell, change all instances of Number_1 to the determined Paint_Color. If no Paint_Color was determined, Number_1 remains unchanged.
