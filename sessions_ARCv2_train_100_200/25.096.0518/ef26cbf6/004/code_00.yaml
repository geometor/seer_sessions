Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - contains: Numbers
    - partitioned_by: Number_4
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Observed values
      Roles:
        - 0: Background
        - 4: Separator
        - 1: Target (to be replaced)
        - Others (2,3,6,7,8): SourceColor
  - Separator:
      Definition: A horizontal row or vertical column consisting entirely of Number_4.
      Function: Divides the grid into logical sections.
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular region bounded by grid edges or Separators.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: [start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col]
        - logical_coordinates: [row_index, column_index] # Based on sections
        - contains: Numbers
      Relationships:
        - above: Cell (same column_index, row_index - 1)
        - left_of: Cell (same row_index, column_index - 1)
Actions:
  - Identify_Separators: Find all rows and columns filled with Number_4.
  - Define_Cells: Determine the boundaries and logical coordinates of all cells based on Separators and grid edges.
  - Find_Unique_SourceColor: Within a given Cell, check if there is exactly one unique Number that is not 0, 1, or 4. Return this number if found, else None.
  - Determine_PaintColor: For a TargetCell (containing Number_1):
      1. Check the Cell 'above'. If it exists and has a Unique_SourceColor, use that as PaintColor.
      2. Else, check the Cell 'left_of'. If it exists and has a Unique_SourceColor, use that as PaintColor.
      3. Otherwise, no PaintColor is determined.
  - Replace_Target: If a PaintColor is determined for a TargetCell, change all occurrences of Number_1 within that cell to the PaintColor.
Relationships:
  - Propagation_Priority: The PaintColor is sourced first from 'above', then from 'left_of'.
  - Boundary_Integrity: Transformations (replacement of 1s) occur strictly within the boundaries of each TargetCell. Separators (Number_4) and Background (Number_0) remain unchanged. SourceColor numbers in source cells remain unchanged.
