"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1.  Identifies horizontal rows and vertical columns entirely composed of the number 4, treating them as separators.
2.  These separators divide the grid into rectangular cells.
3.  For each cell containing the number 1 (TargetCell):
    a.  It first checks for cells directly above it (sharing the top separator line and overlapping horizontally). If the first such cell found contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4, that number (the 'PaintColor') is chosen.
    b.  If no PaintColor is found from the cells above, it checks for cells directly to its left (sharing the left separator line and overlapping vertically). If the first such cell found contains exactly one unique number other than 0, 1, or 4, that number is used as the PaintColor.
    c.  If a PaintColor is determined from either the cells above or the cells to the left, all instances of the number 1 within the TargetCell are replaced by the PaintColor in the output grid.
    d.  If no PaintColor is found, the 1s in the TargetCell remain unchanged.
4.  Numbers 0 and 4, and cells not containing 1, remain unchanged.
