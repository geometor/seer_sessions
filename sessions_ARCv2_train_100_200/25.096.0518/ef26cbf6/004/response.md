**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the grid structure, the role of '4' as a separator, '0' as background, and '1' as the target for replacement. The concept of non-zero/non-one/non-four numbers acting as "source colors" within separated "cells" was also accurate. However, the previous code failed because the logic for determining *which* adjacent cell provides the source color and the precise conditions for adjacency were incorrect.

The failures show that '1's were never replaced, indicating the code did not successfully find a valid source color based on its adjacency rules. Re-analysis of the examples reveals a clear priority:
1.  Check the cell directly *above* the target cell (in the same column section, previous row section). If it contains exactly one unique non-0/1/4 number, use that number as the `PaintColor`.
2.  *Only if* no color was found above, check the cell directly *to the left* of the target cell (in the same row section, previous column section). If it contains exactly one unique non-0/1/4 number, use that number as the `PaintColor`.

The implementation error likely stemmed from how "directly above" and "directly to the left" were translated into boundary comparisons across the separators. The strategy is to redefine adjacency based on logical cell coordinates derived from the separators, rather than complex boundary overlap checks.

**Metrics Gathering**

We need to confirm the cell structure and coordinates for each example.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - contains: Numbers
    - partitioned_by: Number_4
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Observed values
      Roles:
        - 0: Background
        - 4: Separator
        - 1: Target (to be replaced)
        - Others (2,3,6,7,8): SourceColor
  - Separator:
      Definition: A horizontal row or vertical column consisting entirely of Number_4.
      Function: Divides the grid into logical sections.
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular region bounded by grid edges or Separators.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: [start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col]
        - logical_coordinates: [row_index, column_index] # Based on sections
        - contains: Numbers
      Relationships:
        - above: Cell (same column_index, row_index - 1)
        - left_of: Cell (same row_index, column_index - 1)
Actions:
  - Identify_Separators: Find all rows and columns filled with Number_4.
  - Define_Cells: Determine the boundaries and logical coordinates of all cells based on Separators and grid edges.
  - Find_Unique_SourceColor: Within a given Cell, check if there is exactly one unique Number that is not 0, 1, or 4. Return this number if found, else None.
  - Determine_PaintColor: For a TargetCell (containing Number_1):
      1. Check the Cell 'above'. If it exists and has a Unique_SourceColor, use that as PaintColor.
      2. Else, check the Cell 'left_of'. If it exists and has a Unique_SourceColor, use that as PaintColor.
      3. Otherwise, no PaintColor is determined.
  - Replace_Target: If a PaintColor is determined for a TargetCell, change all occurrences of Number_1 within that cell to the PaintColor.
Relationships:
  - Propagation_Priority: The PaintColor is sourced first from 'above', then from 'left_of'.
  - Boundary_Integrity: Transformations (replacement of 1s) occur strictly within the boundaries of each TargetCell. Separators (Number_4) and Background (Number_0) remain unchanged. SourceColor numbers in source cells remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all horizontal rows and vertical columns consisting entirely of the number `4`. These are the `Separators`.
3.  Use the `Separators` and grid boundaries to define distinct rectangular `Cells`. Assign logical coordinates `(row_index, column_index)` (starting from 0,0 for the top-left cell) to each cell based on its position relative to the separators. Store a mapping between these coordinates and the cell's boundary coordinates `(start_row, end_row, start_col, end_col)`.
4.  Iterate through each `Cell` using its logical coordinates `(ri, ci)`. Let the current cell be `TargetCell`.
5.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to `TargetCell` from the *input* grid. Check if this subgrid contains any instance of the number `1`. If not, proceed to the next cell.
6.  If `TargetCell` contains `1`s, attempt to find a `PaintColor`:
    a.  Initialize `PaintColor` to `None`.
    b.  **Check Above:** If `ri > 0` (the cell is not in the top row section), find the logical coordinates of the cell above: `coords_above = (ri - 1, ci)`. Retrieve the boundaries for `coords_above`. Extract the subgrid for the cell above from the *input* grid. Check if this subgrid contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If yes, assign this unique number to `PaintColor`.
    c.  **Check Left:** If `PaintColor` is still `None` *and* `ci > 0` (the cell is not in the leftmost column section), find the logical coordinates of the cell to the left: `coords_left = (ri, ci - 1)`. Retrieve the boundaries for `coords_left`. Extract the subgrid for the cell to the left from the *input* grid. Check if this subgrid contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If yes, assign this unique number to `PaintColor`.
7.  **Apply Color:** If a `PaintColor` was determined (is not `None`), then within the boundary coordinates of the `TargetCell`, replace all instances of the number `1` in the *output grid* with the determined `PaintColor`.
8.  If no `PaintColor` was determined, the `1`s within the `TargetCell` remain unchanged in the output grid (as initially copied).
9.  After iterating through all cells, return the modified output grid.
