Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: [rows, columns]
    - contains: Numbers
    - partitioned_by: Number_4
Objects:
  - Number:
      Values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Assuming standard digits
      Roles:
        - 0: Background
        - 4: Separator
        - 1: Target (placeholder to be replaced)
        - Others (2,3,5,6,7,8): SourceColor
  - Cell:
      Definition: A rectangular region within the grid bounded by grid edges or lines of Number_4.
      Properties:
        - boundaries: [top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col]
        - contains: Numbers
      Relationships:
        - above: Cell (same columns, previous row section)
        - below: Cell (same columns, next row section)
        - left_of: Cell (same rows, previous column section)
        - right_of: Cell (same rows, next column section)
Actions:
  - Identify_Cells: Determine the boundaries of all cells based on Number_4 separators.
  - Find_Unique_SourceColor: Within a given Cell, find if there is exactly one unique Number that is not 0, 1, or 4.
  - Replace_Target: Change all occurrences of Number_1 within a target Cell to a specified SourceColor.
Relationships:
  - Propagation_Rule: The SourceColor used to replace Number_1 in a target Cell is determined by checking other Cells in a specific order of priority (Vertical > Horizontal).
  - Boundary_Respect: Transformations occur strictly within the boundaries of each Cell defined by Number_4. Number_4 itself is never changed.
