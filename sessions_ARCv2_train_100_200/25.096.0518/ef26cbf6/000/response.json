These lines partition the grid into distinct rectangular regions or \"cells\".\n3.  **Background:** The number `0` appears to be a background or empty value, generally remaining unchanged.\n4.  **Target Number:** The number `1` appears to be a placeholder or target number that gets transformed in the output.\n5.  **Color Numbers:** Other numbers (2, 3, 6, 7, 8 in the examples) act like \"colors\". Their key role seems to be determining the replacement value for the `1`s.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves replacing the `1`s based on the \"color\" found in related cells, respecting the boundaries defined by the `4`s. There appears to be a priority system for determining which color source to use.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.\n2.  Identify all horizontal rows and vertical columns consisting entirely of the number `4`. These act as separators.\n3.  Use the separators and grid boundaries to define distinct rectangular `Cells`. Each cell is a maximal block of numbers not containing `4`. Note the row-section and column-lane index for each cell.\n4.  Iterate through each `Cell` in the grid (e.g., row-section by row-section, then column-lane by column-lane within that section). Let the current cell be `TargetCell`, located at section `i` and lane `j`.\n5.  Check if `TargetCell` contains any instance of the number `1`. If it does not, proceed to the next cell.\n6.  If `TargetCell` contains `1`s, attempt to find a `SourceColor` to replace them:\n    a.  **Vertical Priority:** Look at the `SourceCellAbove` located at section `i-1` and lane `j` (if `i > 0`). Find if `SourceCellAbove` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.\n    b.  **Horizontal Priority:** If no `PaintColor` was found from `SourceCellAbove` (either because `i=0` or the cell above didn't have a unique source color), look at the `SourceCellLeft` located at section `i` and lane `j-1` (if `j > 0`). Find if `SourceCellLeft` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.\n    c.  **(Self Check - Lower Priority, inferred):** *If no `PaintColor` was found from above or left, check within the `TargetCell` itself. Find if `TargetCell` contains exactly one unique number that is *not* `0`, `1`, or `4`. If such a unique number exists, designate it as the `PaintColor`.* (Note: This step wasn't strictly necessary for the examples but seems a logical fallback).\n7.  If a `PaintColor` was successfully determined in step 6, replace *all* instances of the number `1` within the `TargetCell` in the *output grid* with the found `PaintColor`.\n8.  If no `PaintColor` was determined after checking all priority sources, leave the `1`s in the `TargetCell` unchanged in the output grid.\n9.  After iterating through all cells, the final output grid is complete."
