Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows x 9 columns
    - Element Values: Integers {0, 4, 5, 8}
    - Structure: Contains a central separator column (index 4) always filled with '4'.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows x 4 columns
    - Element Values: Integers {0, 2}

Objects & Relationships:
  - Input Row: A sequence of 9 integers.
  - Output Row: A sequence of 4 integers.
  - Separator: The element '4' at column index 4 in each input row.
  - Left Subgrid: Columns 0-3 of an input row.
  - Right Subgrid: Columns 5-8 of an input row.
  - Transformation: Operates independently on each row.
  - Core Action: Element-wise comparison between the Left Subgrid and Right Subgrid.
    - For each column index `j` from 0 to 3:
      - Compare element `L_j` (from Left Subgrid) and element `R_j` (from Right Subgrid).
      - Generate output element `O_j` based on the comparison rule.

Comparison Rule:
  - IF (L_j == 0 AND R_j != 0) OR (L_j != 0 AND R_j == 0):
      THEN O_j = 2
  - ELSE:
      THEN O_j = 0
