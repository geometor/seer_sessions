Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is consistently a 5x9 grid of integers. The output is consistently a 5x4 grid of integers. This suggests a transformation that reduces the width of the grid while preserving the number of rows.
2.  **Row Independence:** Comparing the transformations row by row across different examples suggests that each row in the input is transformed independently to produce the corresponding row in the output.
3.  **Input Values:** The input grids use the integers 0, 8, 4, and 5.
4.  **Output Values:** The output grids use only the integers 0 and 2.
5.  **Separator Column:** Column index 4 (the 5th column) in the input grid consistently contains the value 4 across all examples and all rows. This column does not appear to have a direct counterpart in the output and likely acts as a separator.
6.  **Subgrids:** The separator column divides the input grid (excluding the separator itself) into two subgrids for each row: a left subgrid (columns 0-3) and a right subgrid (columns 5-8). Both subgrids are 4 columns wide, matching the width of the output grid.
7.  **Element-wise Operation:** The transformation appears to involve comparing elements at the same column index within the left and right subgrids to determine the output element at that index. Let `L_j` be the element at column `j` (0-3) in the left subgrid and `R_j` be the element at column `j` (0-3) in the right subgrid (corresponding to input columns 5-8). The output element `O_j` seems to depend on `L_j` and `R_j`.
8.  **Comparison Logic:**
    *   Comparing `L_j` and `R_j`:
        *   If one is 0 and the other is non-zero (5 or 8), the output `O_j` is 2.
        *   If both are 0, the output `O_j` is 0.
        *   If one is 8 and the other is 5, the output `O_j` is 0.
    *   This logic simplifies to: `O_j` is 2 if *exactly one* of `L_j` or `R_j` is 0. Otherwise, `O_j` is 0.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows x 9 columns
    - Element Values: Integers {0, 4, 5, 8}
    - Structure: Contains a central separator column (index 4) always filled with '4'.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: 5 rows x 4 columns
    - Element Values: Integers {0, 2}

Objects & Relationships:
  - Input Row: A sequence of 9 integers.
  - Output Row: A sequence of 4 integers.
  - Separator: The element '4' at column index 4 in each input row.
  - Left Subgrid: Columns 0-3 of an input row.
  - Right Subgrid: Columns 5-8 of an input row.
  - Transformation: Operates independently on each row.
  - Core Action: Element-wise comparison between the Left Subgrid and Right Subgrid.
    - For each column index `j` from 0 to 3:
      - Compare element `L_j` (from Left Subgrid) and element `R_j` (from Right Subgrid).
      - Generate output element `O_j` based on the comparison rule.

Comparison Rule:
  - IF (L_j == 0 AND R_j != 0) OR (L_j != 0 AND R_j == 0):
      THEN O_j = 2
  - ELSE:
      THEN O_j = 0
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  For the current input row, identify the left subgrid (elements at column indices 0, 1, 2, 3) and the right subgrid (elements at column indices 5, 6, 7, 8). Ignore the element at column index 4.
3.  Initialize an empty output row.
4.  Iterate through the column indices `j` from 0 to 3.
5.  Get the element `L_j` from the left subgrid at index `j` and the element `R_j` from the right subgrid at index `j`.
6.  Compare `L_j` and `R_j`:
    *   If exactly one of the elements (`L_j` or `R_j`) is equal to 0, append the value 2 to the output row.
    *   Otherwise (if both are 0, or if neither is 0), append the value 0 to the output row.
7.  After iterating through all four column indices, the output row is complete. Add this row to the final output grid.
8.  Repeat steps 2-7 for all input rows.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
