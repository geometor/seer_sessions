            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is consistently a 5x9 grid of integers. The output is consistently a 5x4 grid of integers. This suggests a transformation that reduces the width of the grid while preserving the number of rows.\n2.  **Row Independence:** Comparing the transformations row by row across different examples suggests that each row in the input is transformed independently to produce the corresponding row in the output.\n3.  **Input Values:** The input grids use the integers 0, 8, 4, and 5.\n4.  **Output Values:** The output grids use only the integers 0 and 2.\n5.  **Separator Column:** Column index 4 (the 5th column) in the input grid consistently contains the value 4 across all examples and all rows. This column does not appear to have a direct counterpart in the output and likely acts as a separator.\n6.  **Subgrids:** The separator column divides the input grid (excluding the separator itself) into two subgrids for each row: a left subgrid (columns 0-3) and a right subgrid (columns 5-8). Both subgrids are 4 columns wide, matching the width of the output grid.\n7.  **Element-wise Operation:** The transformation appears to involve comparing elements at the same column index within the left and right subgrids to determine the output element at that index. Let `L_j` be the element at column `j` (0-3) in the left subgrid and `R_j` be the element at column `j` (0-3) in the right subgrid (corresponding to input columns 5-8). The output element `O_j` seems to depend on `L_j` and `R_j`.\n8.  **Comparison Logic:**\n    *   Comparing `L_j` and `R_j`:\n        *   If one is 0 and the other is non-zero (5 or 8), the output `O_j` is 2.\n        *   If both are 0, the output `O_j` is 0.\n        *   If one is 8 and the other is 5, the output `O_j` is 0.\n    *   This logic simplifies to: `O_j` is 2 if *exactly one* of `L_j` or `R_j` is 0. Otherwise, `O_j` is 0.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
