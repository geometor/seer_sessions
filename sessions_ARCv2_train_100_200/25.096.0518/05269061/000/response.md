Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) of integers.
2.  **Grid Size:** The grids in the examples are consistently 7x7.
3.  **Input Content:** Input grids contain mostly zeros (0) and a few non-zero digits scattered within. The non-zero digits appear to form sparse patterns or might be related to specific locations.
4.  **Output Content:** Output grids are fully populated with non-zero digits. The digits seem to repeat in a clear, structured pattern across the entire grid. There are no zeros in the output.
5.  **Relationship:** The specific non-zero digits present in the output grid are exactly the set of unique non-zero digits found in the corresponding input grid. The output grid essentially "tiles" the grid space using a repeating sequence derived from the input's non-zero digits.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill a grid based on a repeating sequence derived from non-zero elements in the input grid.

input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - shape: [height, width] (e.g., 7x7)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: Contains predominantly zeros and a sparse set of unique non-zero digits.

output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as the input.
    properties:
      - shape: [height, width] (matches input)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: Fully populated with non-zero digits, forming a repeating pattern. Contains no zeros.

transformation_elements:
  - element: non_zero_digits
    description: The set of unique digits greater than zero present in the input grid.
    source: input_grid
    role: Defines the palette of digits for the output pattern.
  - element: sequence
    description: An ordered sequence composed of the unique non-zero digits from the input.
    derivation: Determined by the order in which unique non-zero digits are first encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column.
    role: Forms the repeating unit for the output pattern.
  - element: sequence_length (k)
    description: The number of unique non-zero digits in the sequence.
    role: Determines the cycle length of the pattern.
  - element: first_non_zero_position
    description: The (row, column) coordinates (r0, c0) of the first non-zero digit encountered during the scan.
    role: Used to calculate the starting phase/offset of the pattern.
  - element: pattern_offset (O)
    description: An integer offset used to determine the starting point of the sequence within the output grid pattern.
    derivation: Calculated as `O = (k - (r0 + c0) % k) % k`.
    role: Adjusts the phase of the repeating pattern based on the position of the first non-zero input element.
  - element: output_pattern_rule
    description: The rule to determine the value of each cell in the output grid.
    formula: output[i][j] = sequence[((i + j) % k + O) % k]
    role: Defines how the sequence fills the output grid based on cell coordinates and the calculated offset.

relationships:
  - The set of digits used in the output grid's pattern is identical to the set of unique non-zero digits in the input grid.
  - The order of digits in the repeating sequence is determined by the scan order of their first appearance in the input.
  - The specific value at an output cell `(i, j)` depends on the sum of its coordinates `(i + j)`, the sequence derived from the input, the sequence length `k`, and an offset `O` calculated from the position `(r0, c0)` of the first non-zero input digit.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty ordered list called `sequence` and a set called `seen_digits`. Also, store the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid. Initialize variables `first_row` and `first_col` to track the position of the first non-zero digit found (e.g., set them to -1).
2.  Iterate through the input grid, row by row (`i` from 0 to height-1), and within each row, column by column (`j` from 0 to width-1).
3.  For each cell `input[i][j]`:
    *   If the value is non-zero (`input[i][j] > 0`) and this digit has not been seen before (i.e., it's not in `seen_digits`):
        *   Add the digit `input[i][j]` to the end of the `sequence` list.
        *   Add the digit `input[i][j]` to the `seen_digits` set.
        *   If this is the very first non-zero digit encountered (`first_row` is still -1), record its position: set `first_row = i` and `first_col = j`.
4.  Determine the length of the sequence, `k = length(sequence)`.
5.  Calculate the pattern offset `O` using the position of the first non-zero digit found: `O = (k - (first_row + first_col) % k) % k`. Handle the case where `k` might be zero if the input has no non-zero digits (though examples suggest `k` > 0). If k is 0, the output could be all zeros or handled as an edge case. Assuming k > 0 based on examples.
6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
7.  Iterate through the output grid cells, row by row (`i` from 0 to height-1), and column by column (`j` from 0 to width-1).
8.  For each output cell `output[i][j]`, calculate the index into the sequence: `sequence_index = ((i + j) % k + O) % k`.
9.  Set the value of the output cell `output[i][j]` to the digit found at `sequence[sequence_index]`.
10. Return the completed output grid.
