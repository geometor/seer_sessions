task_description: Fill a grid based on a repeating sequence derived from non-zero elements in the input grid.

input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers.
    properties:
      - shape: [height, width] (e.g., 7x7)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: Contains predominantly zeros and a sparse set of unique non-zero digits.

output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers, same dimensions as the input.
    properties:
      - shape: [height, width] (matches input)
      - element_type: integer
      - content: Fully populated with non-zero digits, forming a repeating pattern. Contains no zeros.

transformation_elements:
  - element: non_zero_digits
    description: The set of unique digits greater than zero present in the input grid.
    source: input_grid
    role: Defines the palette of digits for the output pattern.
  - element: sequence
    description: An ordered sequence composed of the unique non-zero digits from the input.
    derivation: Determined by the order in which unique non-zero digits are first encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, then column by column.
    role: Forms the repeating unit for the output pattern.
  - element: sequence_length (k)
    description: The number of unique non-zero digits in the sequence.
    role: Determines the cycle length of the pattern.
  - element: first_non_zero_position
    description: The (row, column) coordinates (r0, c0) of the first non-zero digit encountered during the scan.
    role: Used to calculate the starting phase/offset of the pattern.
  - element: pattern_offset (O)
    description: An integer offset used to determine the starting point of the sequence within the output grid pattern.
    derivation: Calculated as `O = (k - (r0 + c0) % k) % k`.
    role: Adjusts the phase of the repeating pattern based on the position of the first non-zero input element.
  - element: output_pattern_rule
    description: The rule to determine the value of each cell in the output grid.
    formula: output[i][j] = sequence[((i + j) % k + O) % k]
    role: Defines how the sequence fills the output grid based on cell coordinates and the calculated offset.

relationships:
  - The set of digits used in the output grid's pattern is identical to the set of unique non-zero digits in the input grid.
  - The order of digits in the repeating sequence is determined by the scan order of their first appearance in the input.
  - The specific value at an output cell `(i, j)` depends on the sum of its coordinates `(i + j)`, the sequence derived from the input, the sequence length `k`, and an offset `O` calculated from the position `(r0, c0)` of the first non-zero input digit.
