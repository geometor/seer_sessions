The non-zero digits appear to form sparse patterns or might be related to specific locations.\n4.  **Output Content:** Output grids are fully populated with non-zero digits. The digits seem to repeat in a clear, structured pattern across the entire grid. There are no zeros in the output.\n5.  **Relationship:** The specific non-zero digits present in the output grid are exactly the set of unique non-zero digits found in the corresponding input grid. The output grid essentially \"tiles\" the grid space using a repeating sequence derived from the input's non-zero digits.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Also, store the dimensions (height, width) of the input grid. Initialize variables `first_row` and `first_col` to track the position of the first non-zero digit found (e.g., set them to -1).\n2.

Determine the length of the sequence, `k = length(sequence)`.\n5.  Calculate the pattern offset `O` using the position of the first non-zero digit found: `O = (k - (first_row + first_col) % k) % k`. Handle the case where `k` might be zero if the input has no non-zero digits (though examples suggest `k` > 0). If k is 0, the output could be all zeros or handled as an edge case. Assuming k > 0 based on examples.\n6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n7.  Iterate through the output grid cells, row by row (`i` from 0 to height-1), and column by column (`j` from 0 to width-1).\n8.  For each output cell `output[i][j]`, calculate the index into the sequence: `sequence_index = ((i + j) % k + O) % k`.\n9.  Set the value of the output cell `output[i][j]` to the digit found at `sequence[sequence_index]`.\n10. Return the completed output grid."
