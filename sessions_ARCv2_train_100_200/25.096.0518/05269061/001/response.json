Scan the input grid row by row, then column by column, to find all unique \n   non-zero digits. Record these digits in the order they are first encountered \n   to form a sequence.\n2. Note the coordinates (r0, c0) of the first non-zero digit found during the scan.\n3. Determine the length 'k' of the sequence of unique non-zero digits.\n4. Calculate an offset 'O' based on the position of the first non-zero digit: \n   O = (k - (r0 + c0) % k) % k. This offset aligns the pattern correctly.\n5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n6. Fill each cell (i, j) of the output grid using the formula: \n   output[i][j] = sequence[((i + j) % k + O) % k]. This creates a repeating \n   diagonal pattern based on the derived sequence and offset.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills an output grid based on a repeating sequence derived from the unique \n    non-zero elements found in the input grid, considering the position of the \n    first non-zero element for pattern alignment.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    if not input_grid or not input_grid[0]:\n        return [] # Handle empty input grid\n    height = len(input_grid)\n    width = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Find unique non-zero digits sequence and first position ---\n    sequence = []\n    seen_digits = set()\n    first_row, first_col = -1, -1\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            value = input_grid[r][c]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Record position of the very first non-zero digit\n                if first_row == -1:\n                    first_row = r\n                    first_col = c\n                \n                # Add to sequence if it's a new non-zero digit\n                if value not in seen_digits:\n                    seen_digits.add(value)\n                    sequence.append(value)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Determine sequence length k ---\n    k = len(sequence)\n\n    # Handle edge case: If no non-zero digits were found\n    if k == 0:\n        # Based on examples, output is never all zeros if input has non-zeros.\n        # If input *is* all zeros, returning an all-zero grid might be appropriate.\n        # Or, if the task guarantees non-zero inputs, this check might be redundant.\n        # Let's assume based on task structure, k will be > 0.\n        # If requirement changes, return [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)] here.\n        # For now, we'll proceed assuming k > 0 as per examples.\n        # If k=0 and we proceeded, it would lead to division by zero error.\n         # Based on observed examples, inputs always seem to have non-zero elements.\n         # If an all-zero input is possible and needs specific handling, \n         # we might return an all-zero grid of the same size.\n         # For now, assume k > 0.\n         pass # If we needed to handle k=0 explicitly, code would go here.\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate the pattern offset O ---\n    # Ensure k > 0 before calculating offset to avoid division by zero\n    offset = 0\n    if k > 0:\n        # This calculation ensures the pattern starts correctly relative \n        # to the first non-zero element's position.\n        # O = (k - ((first_row + first_col) % k)) % k # equivalent simpler form\n        offset = (-(first_row + first_col)) % k\n\n\n    # --- Step 5 & 6: Create and fill the output grid ---\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if k > 0: # Check k again to prevent index error if sequence is empty\n                # Calculate the index in the sequence for the current cell (r, c)\n                # The formula uses (r + c) creating diagonal patterns.\n                # The offset adjusts the starting point of the sequence.\n                sequence_index = (r + c + offset) % k\n                output_grid[r][c] = sequence[sequence_index]\n            # else: output_grid[r][c] remains 0 (if we handled k=0 case)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
