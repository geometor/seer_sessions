"""
Transforms an input grid containing sparse non-zero digits into an output grid 
filled with a repeating sequence derived from those non-zero digits.

The transformation involves these steps:
1. Scan the input grid row by row, then column by column, to find all unique 
   non-zero digits. Record these digits in the order they are first encountered 
   to form a sequence.
2. Note the coordinates (r0, c0) of the first non-zero digit found during the scan.
3. Determine the length 'k' of the sequence of unique non-zero digits.
4. Calculate an offset 'O' based on the position of the first non-zero digit: 
   O = (k - (r0 + c0) % k) % k. This offset aligns the pattern correctly.
5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
6. Fill each cell (i, j) of the output grid using the formula: 
   output[i][j] = sequence[((i + j) % k + O) % k]. This creates a repeating 
   diagonal pattern based on the derived sequence and offset.
