            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core task: finding connected objects, calculating properties (like density), selecting one object based on these properties, and extracting its representation within its bounding box. The code succeeded on Examples 1 and 3 but failed on Example 2, indicating the selection criteria (maximum density with area/position tie-breaking) were incorrect or incomplete.\n\nThe failure occurred because a single-cell object (digit '7' at (3,6) in Example 2) achieved the maximum possible density (1.0), overriding the intended selection (digit '6'). This suggests the selection criteria need refinement.\n\nStrategy:\n1.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use the `find_objects` function to recalculate properties (digit, size, bounding box, area, density) for all objects in all examples.\n2.  **Analyze Selection Failure:** Compare the properties of the incorrectly selected object ('7' with density 1.0) and the expected object ('6' with density 0.75) in Example 2.\n3.  **Refine Selection Criteria:** Develop new selection rules that correctly identify the target object in all examples. Based on the analysis, the likely criteria involve maximum density, potentially filtering out single-cell objects first, and using maximum size as the primary tie-breaker for density.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected selection logic.\n\n**Metrics Report**\n"

Correct.\n*   Example 2: Single-cell '7' has max density (1.0) and is selected by the `Density -> Size -> Pos` rule. Incorrect (expected '6').\n*   Example 3: '5' has max density (0.75) and max size (6) among those with max density, and is selected. Correct.\n\nThe `Density -> Size -> Pos` selection rule *still fails* on Example 2 because the single-cell '7' object wins on density alone.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** The task might intend to *ignore* single-cell objects entirely when determining which object to extract.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Example 2 filtering out the single-cell '7':\n*   Remaining Objects:\n    *   Digit 2: Size 5, Density 0.6250\n    *   Digit 6: Size 6, Density 0.7500\n    *   Digit 7 (larger): Size 3, Density 0.7500\n*   Applying `Density -> Size -> Pos` to *filtered* list:\n    *   Max density is 0.75 (objects '6' and '7').\n    *   Tie-breaker: Max size. '6' (size 6) vs '7' (size 3).\n    *   Select object '6'. This is CORRECT.\n\nThis filtering approach also works for Examples 1 and 3 as they contain no single-cell objects to filter.\n\n**Final Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Identify all connected non-zero objects and calculate their properties (digit, cells, size, bounding box, area, density).\n2.  Filter out any objects with a `size` of 1.\n3.  From the remaining (filtered) objects, select the one using the following prioritized criteria:\n    a.  Maximum `density`.\n    b.  Tie-breaker 1: Maximum `size`.\n    c.  Tie-breaker 2: Minimum `min_r` (top-most).\n    d.  Tie-breaker 3: Minimum `min_c` (left-most).\n4.
