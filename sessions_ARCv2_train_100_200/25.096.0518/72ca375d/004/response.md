**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the core task: finding connected objects, calculating properties (like density), selecting one object based on these properties, and extracting its representation within its bounding box. The code succeeded on Examples 1 and 3 but failed on Example 2, indicating the selection criteria (maximum density with area/position tie-breaking) were incorrect or incomplete.

The failure occurred because a single-cell object (digit '7' at (3,6) in Example 2) achieved the maximum possible density (1.0), overriding the intended selection (digit '6'). This suggests the selection criteria need refinement.

Strategy:
1.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use the `find_objects` function to recalculate properties (digit, size, bounding box, area, density) for all objects in all examples.
2.  **Analyze Selection Failure:** Compare the properties of the incorrectly selected object ('7' with density 1.0) and the expected object ('6' with density 0.75) in Example 2.
3.  **Refine Selection Criteria:** Develop new selection rules that correctly identify the target object in all examples. Based on the analysis, the likely criteria involve maximum density, potentially filtering out single-cell objects first, and using maximum size as the primary tie-breaker for density.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected selection logic.

**Revised Metrics Analysis & Strategy Adjustment**

The metrics calculation confirms the initial analysis:
*   Example 1: '4' has max density (1.0) and is selected. Correct.
*   Example 2: Single-cell '7' has max density (1.0) and is selected by the `Density -> Size -> Pos` rule. Incorrect (expected '6').
*   Example 3: '5' has max density (0.75) and max size (6) among those with max density, and is selected. Correct.

The `Density -> Size -> Pos` selection rule *still fails* on Example 2 because the single-cell '7' object wins on density alone.

**New Hypothesis:** The task might intend to *ignore* single-cell objects entirely when determining which object to extract.

Let's re-evaluate Example 2 filtering out the single-cell '7':
*   Remaining Objects:
    *   Digit 2: Size 5, Density 0.6250
    *   Digit 6: Size 6, Density 0.7500
    *   Digit 7 (larger): Size 3, Density 0.7500
*   Applying `Density -> Size -> Pos` to *filtered* list:
    *   Max density is 0.75 (objects '6' and '7').
    *   Tie-breaker: Max size. '6' (size 6) vs '7' (size 3).
    *   Select object '6'. This is CORRECT.

This filtering approach also works for Examples 1 and 3 as they contain no single-cell objects to filter.

**Final Revised Strategy:**

1.  Identify all connected non-zero objects and calculate their properties (digit, cells, size, bounding box, area, density).
2.  Filter out any objects with a `size` of 1.
3.  From the remaining (filtered) objects, select the one using the following prioritized criteria:
    a.  Maximum `density`.
    b.  Tie-breaker 1: Maximum `size`.
    c.  Tie-breaker 2: Minimum `min_r` (top-most).
    d.  Tie-breaker 3: Minimum `min_c` (left-most).
4.  Extract the selected object into a new grid based on its bounding box, placing the object's digit only at the locations corresponding to its original cells.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
InputType: Grid
InputProperties:
  - Size: 10x10 (variable size generally assumed)
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0-9)
  - Background: Represented by digit 0
  - Objects: Formed by connected non-zero cells of the same digit

OutputType: Grid
OutputProperties:
  - Size: Variable, determined by the selected object's bounding box
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0 or the digit of the selected object)

Transformation: Object Selection and Extraction

ObjectIdentification:
  - Method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar connectivity analysis.
  - PropertiesCalculated:
    - digit: The common digit of the object's cells.
    - cells: Set of (row, col) coordinates belonging to the object.
    - size: Count of cells in the object.
    - bounding_box: Coordinates (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
    - area: Height * Width of the bounding box.
    - density: size / area.

SelectionCriteria:
  - FilterCondition: Exclude objects where `size` is 1.
  - PrimarySortKey: Maximum `density`.
  - SecondarySortKey: Maximum `size`.
  - TertiarySortKey: Minimum `min_r` (top-most).
  - QuaternarySortKey: Minimum `min_c` (left-most).
  - Action: Select the single object that ranks highest based on these prioritized criteria applied to the filtered list.

ExtractionSteps:
  - Retrieve the `bounding_box`, `digit`, and `cells` of the `selected_object`.
  - Create an output grid with dimensions based on the `bounding_box` height and width.
  - Initialize the output grid with 0s.
  - For each `(r, c)` coordinate in the `selected_object.cells`:
    - Calculate the relative position `(output_r, output_c)` within the output grid: `output_r = r - min_r`, `output_c = c - min_c`.
    - Set `output_grid[output_r][output_c]` to the `selected_object.digit`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct connected groups of identical non-zero digits ("objects") in the input grid.
2.  For each object, determine its digit, the set of coordinates it occupies (`cells`), its total number of cells (`size`), and its bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column).
3.  Calculate the `area` (height * width) of each object's bounding box.
4.  Calculate the `density` (`size` / `area`) for each object.
5.  Create a filtered list of objects, excluding any object whose `size` is exactly 1.
6.  If the filtered list is empty, return an empty grid or handle as appropriate.
7.  From the filtered list, select the single `target_object` based on the following criteria, applied in order:
    a.  The object with the highest `density`.
    b.  If there's a tie in density, the object with the largest `size`.
    c.  If there's still a tie, the object whose bounding box starts at the lowest row index (`min_r`).
    d.  If there's still a tie, the object whose bounding box starts at the lowest column index (`min_c`).
8.  Get the `bounding_box` (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c), `digit`, and `cells` of the `target_object`.
9.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(max_r - min_r + 1)` rows and `(max_c - min_c + 1)` columns, initialized with 0s.
10. Iterate through each coordinate `(r, c)` in the `target_object.cells`. For each coordinate, set the value of the cell at `output_grid[r - min_r][c - min_c]` to the `target_object.digit`.
11. Return the generated output grid.
