InputType: Grid
InputProperties:
  - Size: 10x10 (variable size generally assumed)
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0-9)
  - Background: Represented by digit 0
  - Objects: Formed by connected non-zero cells of the same digit

OutputType: Grid
OutputProperties:
  - Size: Variable, determined by the selected object's bounding box
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0 or the digit of the selected object)

Transformation: Object Selection and Extraction

ObjectIdentification:
  - Method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) or similar connectivity analysis.
  - PropertiesCalculated:
    - digit: The common digit of the object's cells.
    - cells: Set of (row, col) coordinates belonging to the object.
    - size: Count of cells in the object.
    - bounding_box: Coordinates (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
    - area: Height * Width of the bounding box.
    - density: size / area.

SelectionCriteria:
  - FilterCondition: Exclude objects where `size` is 1.
  - PrimarySortKey: Maximum `density`.
  - SecondarySortKey: Maximum `size`.
  - TertiarySortKey: Minimum `min_r` (top-most).
  - QuaternarySortKey: Minimum `min_c` (left-most).
  - Action: Select the single object that ranks highest based on these prioritized criteria applied to the filtered list.

ExtractionSteps:
  - Retrieve the `bounding_box`, `digit`, and `cells` of the `selected_object`.
  - Create an output grid with dimensions based on the `bounding_box` height and width.
  - Initialize the output grid with 0s.
  - For each `(r, c)` coordinate in the `selected_object.cells`:
    - Calculate the relative position `(output_r, output_c)` within the output grid: `output_r = r - min_r`, `output_c = c - min_c`.
    - Set `output_grid[output_r][output_c]` to the `selected_object.digit`.
