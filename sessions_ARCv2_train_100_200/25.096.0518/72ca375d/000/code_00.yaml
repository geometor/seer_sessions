InputType: Grid
InputProperties:
  - Size: 10x10
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0-9)
  - Background: Represented by digit 0
  - Objects: Formed by connected non-zero cells of the same digit

OutputType: Grid
OutputProperties:
  - Size: Variable, smaller than input
  - Cells: Contain single digits (0 or the digit of the selected object)

Transformation: Object Selection and Extraction

SelectionCriteria:
  - Identify all distinct connected non-zero objects.
  - For each object:
      - Calculate its size (number of cells).
      - Determine its bounding box.
      - Calculate the area of its bounding box.
      - Calculate its density (size / area).
  - Select the object with the maximum density.
  - (Assumption: No ties in maximum density in provided examples; if ties occur, a secondary rule like smallest bounding box area or top-left position might be needed).

ExtractionSteps:
  - Get the bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) and digit (D) of the selected object.
  - Create an output grid with dimensions (max_row - min_row + 1) x (max_col - min_col + 1).
  - Iterate through the cells (r, c) within the bounding box range in the input grid.
  - If input[r][c] == D, set output[r - min_row][c - min_col] = D.
  - Otherwise, set output[r - min_row][c - min_col] = 0.

Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from a sub-region (bounding box) of the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid depends on the single object selected based on the maximum density criterion.
