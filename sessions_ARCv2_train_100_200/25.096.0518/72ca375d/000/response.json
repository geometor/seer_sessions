            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A 10x10 grid of single digits (0-9). The non-zero digits form distinct, potentially overlapping or adjacent, connected shapes or \"objects\". 0 represents the background.\n2.  **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid containing digits.\n3.  **Objects:** Within the input grid, contiguous blocks of the same non-zero digit can be considered as distinct objects.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task seems to involve identifying one specific object from the input grid based on some criteria and then extracting a representation of that object as the output.\n5.  **Extraction Logic:** The output grid appears to correspond to the bounding box of the selected object. Within this bounding box, cells matching the selected object's digit retain their value, while all other cells (including background 0s and potentially parts of other objects falling within the bounding box) are set to 0 in the output.\n6.  **Selection Criteria:** The critical step is determining *which* object is selected. Analyzing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, the object made of '4' is selected. Its bounding box is 2x2, area 4, and it contains 4 cells (density 4/4 = 1.0). Other objects ('8', '2') have lower densities (5/6, 6/10 respectively).\n    *   In `train_2`, the object made of '6' is selected. Its bounding box is 2x4, area 8, and it contains 6 cells (density 6/8 = 0.75). Other objects ('2', '7') have lower densities (5/8, 4/6 respectively).\n    *   In `train_3`, the object made of '5' is selected. Its bounding box is 2x4, area 8, and it contains 6 cells (density 6/8 = 0.75). Other objects ('3', '8') have lower densities (4/6, 9/14 respectively).\n    *   The pattern suggests selecting the object with the highest \"density\", calculated as the number of cells in the object divided by the area of its bounding box.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
