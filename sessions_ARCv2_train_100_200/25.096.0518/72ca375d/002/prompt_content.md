"""
This function transforms an input grid based on identifying connected objects of non-zero digits. 
It calculates the 'density' (number of cells / bounding box area) for each object. 
The object with the highest density is selected. 
The output is a grid representing the bounding box of the selected object, 
containing the object's digit where the object exists within the box, and 0 otherwise.
