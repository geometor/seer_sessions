            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of integers, representing colors (0 typically being the background). The grid dimensions vary between examples.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, with some specific cells changing color from 0 to a non-zero color. The transformation adds new colored points based on a pattern derived from the input.\n3.  **Key Feature - Bottom Row:** The bottom row of the input grid seems critical. It contains patterns of non-zero colors that determine the transformation.\n4.  **Source Identification:** Within the bottom row, there appears to be a \"source\" element. This source is characterized by its color and its central position within a contiguous block of non-zero colors in that row.\n    *   In `train_1`, the source is the central '1' from the `1 1 1` block.\n    *   In `train_2`, the source is the central '3' from the `3` block.\n    *   In `train_3`, the source is the central '4' from the `4 4 4` block.\n    *   In `train_4`, the source is the central '4' from the `4` block.\n5.  **Projection Pattern:** New points are added in the rows *above* the source cell. These points use the *source color*. They form a symmetrical pattern expanding upwards and outwards from the source cell's column.\n6.  **Projection Rule Dependency:** The exact pattern (the \"slope\" of the diagonal projection) depends on the *length* of the contiguous block containing the source color in the bottom row.\n    *   If the block length is 1 (e.g., `train_2`, `train_4`), the projection seems to follow one rule (`abs(horizontal_offset) = vertical_offset - 1`).\n    *   If the block length is greater than 1 (e.g., `train_1`, `train_3`, which have length 3), the projection follows another rule (`abs(horizontal_offset) = vertical_offset`).\n7.  **No Overwriting:** The added points only change cells that were originally 0 (background color). Existing non-zero cells from the input are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
