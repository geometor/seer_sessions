task_description: Projects a symmetrical pattern upwards from a source element identified in the bottom row, coloring background cells.

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - size: variable height (H) and width (W)
      - background_color: 0
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - coordinates: (row, column) where 0 <= row < H, 0 <= column < W
      - color: integer
  - object: bottom_row
    properties:
      - index: R = H - 1
      - content: a row of cells from the input grid
  - object: source_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous horizontal sequence of non-zero cells within the bottom_row
      - selection_criteria: the block whose geometric center is closest to the grid's horizontal center ((W-1)/2.0)
      - length: L (number of cells in the selected block)
  - object: source_cell
    properties:
      - location: the centermost cell within the selected source_block
      - coordinates: (R, C)
      - color: X (the color value of the source cell)
  - object: projected_points
    properties:
      - color: X (same as source_cell color)
      - condition: added only if the target cell (r, c) is currently background_color (0)
      - pattern_origin_row: R (bottom row index)
      - pattern_origin_col: C (source cell column index)
      - symmetry: symmetrical around column C
      - vertical_distance: k = R - r (where r is the target row index, k >= 2)
      - horizontal_distance: d = abs(C - c) (where c is the target column index)
      - distance_relationship:
          - if L == 1: d = k - 1
          - if L > 1: d = k

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: source_block
    to: bottom_row
    details: source_block is identified within the bottom_row based on contiguity and proximity to the grid center.
  - type: derivation
    from: source_cell
    to: source_block
    details: source_cell is the central element of the source_block.
  - type: derivation
    from: projected_points.pattern (specifically distance_relationship)
    to: source_block.length (L)
    details: The formula relating horizontal distance (d) to vertical distance (k) depends on L.
  - type: dependency
    from: projected_points.color
    to: source_cell.color (X)
    details: Projected points adopt the color of the source cell.
  - type: constraint
    on: projected_points
    details: |
      Projection starts two rows above the source row (minimum k=2).
      Projection stops if target coordinates (r, c) go outside grid boundaries (0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W).
      Projection only modifies cells with the background color (0).

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    steps:
      - create output_grid as a deep copy of input_grid
  - action: identify_source
    steps:
      - determine grid dimensions H, W
      - get bottom row R = H - 1
      - find all contiguous non-zero blocks in input_grid[R]
      - calculate geometric center for each block
      - select the block closest to the grid's horizontal center ((W-1)/2.0)
      - if no block found, terminate transformation
      - determine source_block length L
      - determine source_cell coordinates (R, C) and color X
  - action: project_pattern
    steps:
      - determine projection rule: if L == 1 use d = k - 1, else use d = k
      - iterate vertical distance k from 2 up to R (inclusive, covering rows R-2 down to 0)
      - calculate target row r = R - k
      - calculate horizontal distance d using the determined rule
      - calculate target columns: c_left = C - d, c_right = C + d
      - for c in [c_left, c_right]:
        - check if target coordinates (r, c) are within grid bounds (0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W)
        - check if output_grid[r][c] is background_color (0)
        - if both conditions met, set output_grid[r][c] = X
  - action: finalize
    steps:
      - return output_grid
