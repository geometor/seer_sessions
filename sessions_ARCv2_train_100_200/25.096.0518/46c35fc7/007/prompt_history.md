Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of single digits.
2.  **Grid Size:** The grids consistently have dimensions of 7x7 in all examples.
3.  **Background Value:** The digit '7' appears frequently and seems to act as a static background or padding. Cells containing '7' in the input remain '7' in the output.
4.  **Transformation Regions:** Changes between input and output occur within localized, contiguous 3x3 blocks where the digits are *not* '7'.
5.  **Transformation Type:** Within these 3x3 blocks, the digits are rearranged. Comparing the input and output blocks suggests a specific geometric transformation. Testing rotations and reflections reveals a pattern: a 90-degree clockwise rotation followed by swapping the corner elements along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**

task_description: Transform a 7x7 grid of digits based on local transformations within 3x3 subgrids.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - contains: cells
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer digit (0-9)
  - object: background_cell
    description: A cell whose value is 7.
    properties:
      - value: 7
      - behavior: Remains unchanged during transformation.
  - object: active_block
    description: A contiguous 3x3 subgrid composed entirely of non-background cells.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner coordinates within the main grid
      - contains: non-7 digits
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the grid to find these blocks.
      - transform: Apply a specific sequence of operations to the digits within the block.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background cells map directly from input to output at the same location.
  - Active blocks in the input are transformed and placed into the corresponding location in the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Rotate_and_Swap_Corners
  - steps:
    - 1: Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input where none of the cells contain the digit 7.
    - 2: For each identified 3x3 block:
      - a: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the digits within the block.
      - b: Swap the digit at the top-left corner (0,0 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-right corner (2,2 relative to block).
      - c: Swap the digit at the top-right corner (0,2 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-left corner (2,0 relative to block).
    - 3: Construct the output grid by placing the transformed blocks into their original locations and copying all background (7) cells directly from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7), potentially filled with a placeholder value or copied from the input.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains the background digit '7', copy its value to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
3.  Identify all possible 3x3 subgrids within the input grid.
4.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if all nine cells within it contain digits *other than* '7'.
5.  If a 3x3 subgrid consists entirely of non-'7' digits (an "active block"):
    a.  Extract the 3x3 block of digits from the input.
    b.  Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on this extracted block.
    c.  After rotation, swap the element at the block's relative coordinates (0, 0) with the element at (2, 2).
    d.  After the first swap, swap the element now at the block's relative coordinates (0, 2) with the element now at (2, 0).
    e.  Place the resulting transformed 3x3 block into the corresponding position in the output grid, overwriting any values previously copied (which should only have been '7's if the block detection logic is correct relative to step 2).
6.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code implementation failed because the transformation logic applied was incorrect (rotate then swap corners) and potentially the identification criteria for the blocks to be transformed was misidentified initially (non-7 blocks vs. 7-centered blocks). The comparison between the transformed output and the expected output showed significant discrepancies across all examples.

The analysis revealed a consistent pattern when reversing the order of operations (swap corners first, then rotate clockwise) and applying this transformation specifically to 3x3 subgrids *centered* on the digit '7'. This revised hypothesis successfully maps the input to the output for all three provided training examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Block Identification:** Modify the logic to identify 3x3 blocks based *only* on whether their central cell (relative position 1,1) contains the digit '7'.
2.  **Correct Transformation Sequence:** Implement the transformation for identified blocks as:
    a.  Swap the top-left (0,0) element with the bottom-right (2,2) element.
    b.  Swap the top-right (0,2) element with the bottom-left (2,0) element.
    c.  Rotate the resulting 3x3 block 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Update Grid:** Place the transformed block back into the output grid at the corresponding location. Cells not part of these transformations remain unchanged.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's confirm the locations and counts of 3x3 blocks centered on '7' in each input grid.

**Correction:** My manual analysis missed many potential 3x3 blocks. The code output shows there are many more 3x3 blocks centered on '7' than I initially identified by just looking for the obvious "active" areas. However, looking closely at the *outputs*, changes *only* happen in the areas I originally identified.

Input 1 Output 1 comparison: Changes occur only around (0,0) block and (4,3) block (top-left coords). Both have a '7' in the center.
Input 2 Output 2 comparison: Changes occur only around (2,2) block. Center is '7'.
Input 3 Output 3 comparison: Changes occur only around (1,3) block and (4,0) block. Both centers are '7'.

Why are the other '7'-centered blocks not changing?
Let's look at Input 1, block top-left (0,2): `[[5, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]`. Center is 7.
Swap corners: `[[9, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [5, 7, 7]]`
Rotate: `[[5, 1, 9], [7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]`
If this transformation happened, the output grid around (0,2) would be different. But it's not. The output grid matches the input grid in this area.

Hypothesis refinement #2: The transformation *only* applies to 3x3 blocks centered on '7' *IF* that block also contains non-7 values. Or perhaps, *all* values other than the center must be non-7?

Let's re-examine the blocks that *do* change:
- Ex1, Block (0,0): `[[9, 6, 5], [8, 7, 1], [0, 8, 9]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.
- Ex1, Block (4,3): `[[1, 8, 4], [4, 7, 6], [6, 2, 4]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.
- Ex2, Block (2,2): `[[5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 9], [4, 3, 0]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.
- Ex3, Block (1,3): `[[6, 5, 5], [5, 7, 6], [1, 5, 1]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.
- Ex3, Block (4,0): `[[8, 8, 8], [9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.

Now examine a block centered on '7' that *doesn't* change:
- Ex1, Block (0,2): `[[5, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]` - Center is 7, but other 7s are present.
- Ex1, Block (1,2): `[[1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]` - Center is 7, but other 7s are present.

**Revised Conclusion:** The transformation occurs on 3x3 blocks *if and only if* the center element is '7' AND all 8 surrounding elements are *not* '7'. The transformation sequence is: Swap Corners -> Rotate Clockwise.

  - Cells belonging to transformable_blocks in the input are replaced by the transformed block's cells in the output.
  - All other_cells map directly from input to output at the same location.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Swap_Corners_Then_Rotate_Clockwise
  - applicability: Applies only to 'transformable_blocks'.
  - steps:
    - 1: Iterate through all possible top-left corners (r, c) for a 3x3 block within the 7x7 grid (r from 0 to 4, c from 0 to 4).
    - 2: For each potential block starting at (r, c):
      - a: Check if the center cell (r+1, c+1) is 7.
      - b: Check if all 8 surrounding cells in the block `input[r:r+3, c:c+3]` are *not* 7.
      - c: If both conditions (a and b) are true:
        - i: Extract the 3x3 block.
        - ii: Create a mutable copy of the block.
        - iii: Swap the element at relative (0, 0) with the element at relative (2, 2) in the copy.
        - iv: Swap the element at relative (0, 2) with the element at relative (2, 0) in the copy.
        - v: Rotate the resulting copied block 90 degrees clockwise.
        - vi: Place this transformed 3x3 block into the output grid at position (r, c).
    - 3: Ensure all cells not overwritten by step 2.c.vi retain their original input values (copying the input to output initially achieves this).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid. This ensures all cells that are not part of a transformation retain their original values.
2.  Iterate through all possible 3x3 subgrids within the input grid by considering their top-left corner coordinates (row `r` from 0 to 4, column `c` from 0 to 4).
3.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid:
    a.  Check if the center cell of the subgrid (at input grid coordinates `r+1`, `c+1`) has the value 7.
    b.  If the center is 7, then check if *all* the other 8 cells within that 3x3 subgrid (i.e., the cells at `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c+2)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r+1, c+2)`, `(r+2, c)`, `(r+2, c+1)`, `(r+2, c+2)`) have values *different* from 7.
    c.  If both conditions (center is 7 AND all neighbours are non-7) are met:
        i.  Extract the 3x3 block of digits from the input grid corresponding to this subgrid.
        ii. Perform a corner-swapping operation on the extracted block: swap the top-left element with the bottom-right element, and swap the top-right element with the bottom-left element.
        iii. Rotate the block resulting from the swap operation 90 degrees clockwise.
        iv. Place this final transformed 3x3 block into the output grid, overwriting the values at the corresponding location (rows `r` to `r+2`, columns `c` to `c+2`).
4.  After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, return the completed output grid.
