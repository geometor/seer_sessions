**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a 7x7 grid, a background digit '7', and transformations occurring within 3x3 blocks. However, the previous attempt incorrectly deduced both the trigger condition for the transformation and the specific sequence of operations within the 3x3 block.

The provided results show that the `swap-then-rotate` logic applied by the previous code (`code_00.py`) failed to produce the correct output for all training examples. The discrepancies are localized to the areas where 3x3 transformations were expected.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-evaluate the transformation rule by comparing the input and expected output blocks directly, focusing on the examples where the previous code failed.
2.  Test the alternative hypothesis: `rotate-then-swap`. Apply a 90-degree clockwise rotation first, followed by corner swaps (main diagonal, then anti-diagonal).
3.  Confirm the trigger condition: The analysis of differences strongly suggests the transformation applies to any 3x3 block where the *center* cell contains the digit '7'.
4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the revised understanding (center='7' trigger, rotate-then-swap logic).

**Metrics and Analysis:**

The `code_execution` output provides detailed analysis comparing the `input`, `expected_output`, and the `actual_output` generated by the previous code (`code_00.py` which used `swap-then-rotate` triggered by center '7').

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 9
    *   Analysis: The code analyzed multiple 3x3 blocks centered on '7'. For the block starting at (0,0) with center (1,1), the `actual_block` `[[5, 8, 7], [8, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]` differs significantly from the `expected_block` `[[5, 8, 9], [8, 7, 6], [9, 1, 0]]`. Applying the `rotate-then-swap` logic to the `input_block` `[[9, 6, 5], [8, 7, 1], [0, 8, 9]]` yields the `expected_block`. Similar mismatches occur for the block centered at (5,4). This confirms the `swap-then-rotate` sequence was incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels Off: 18
    *   Analysis: The main transformed block is centered at (3,3). The `input_block` is `[[5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 9], [4, 3, 0]]`. The `expected_block` is `[[8, 1, 0], [3, 7, 2], [5, 9, 4]]`. The `actual_block` produced by the previous code was `[[8, 1, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]`. Applying `rotate-then-swap` to the input block yields the `expected_block`, again indicating the previous transformation order was wrong. The large number of differing pixels is due to the cascading effect of applying the transformation to overlapping blocks identified by the analysis script; the core issue lies in the transformation sequence for the block centered at (3,3).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Pixels Off: 13
    *   Analysis: Two blocks are transformed, centered at (2,4) and (5,1). For the block centered at (2,4), `input_block` `[[6, 5, 5], [5, 7, 6], [1, 5, 1]]` should yield `expected_block` `[[5, 5, 1], [5, 7, 5], [6, 6, 1]]`. The previous code produced `[[5, 5, 1], [7, 7, 5], [1, 7, 7]]`. For the block centered at (5,1), `input_block` `[[8, 8, 8], [9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0]]` should yield `expected_block` `[[8, 9, 0], [0, 7, 8], [8, 9, 0]]`. The previous code produced `[[8, 9, 7], [0, 7, 7], [8, 9, 8]]`. In both cases, applying `rotate-then-swap` to the input blocks yields the correct expected blocks.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation trigger is indeed a 3x3 block centered on '7'. The transformation sequence is: 1. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise. 2. Swap corners (0,0) <=> (2,2). 3. Swap corners (0,2) <=> (2,0).

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Transform a 7x7 grid of digits by applying a specific transformation to 3x3 subgrids centered on the digit 7.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 7x7 fixed size
      - contains: cells
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer digit (0-9)
  - object: background_cell_value
    description: The digit 7 often acts as a background or pivot, but can be part of the transformation.
    properties:
      - value: 7
  - object: target_block
    description: A 3x3 subgrid identified for transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner (r, c) within the main grid
      - trigger_condition: The center cell of the block (at grid coordinates r+1, c+1) must contain the digit 7.
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the grid for all 3x3 blocks whose center cell is 7.
      - transform: Apply the 'Rotate_and_Swap_Corners' sequence to the digits within the block.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions (7x7) as the input grid.
  - Cells that are *not* part of any identified target_block remain unchanged from input to output.
  - Identified target_blocks in the input are transformed and their resulting digits are placed into the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid. Overlapping transformations might occur if multiple centers are close, but the examples suggest transformations are applied independently based on the input grid state.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Rotate_and_Swap_Corners_on_Center_7
  - steps:
    - 1: Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    - 2: Iterate through all possible top-left corners (r, c) for a 3x3 block within the grid (i.e., `r` from 0 to 4, `c` from 0 to 4).
    - 3: For each potential block, check if the center cell (at input grid coordinates `r+1`, `c+1`) contains the digit 7.
    - 4: If the center cell is 7:
      - a: Extract the 3x3 block starting at (r, c) from the *input* grid.
      - b: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the extracted block.
      - c: Swap the element at the rotated block's relative coordinates (0, 0) with the element at (2, 2).
      - d: Swap the element at the rotated block's relative coordinates (0, 2) with the element at (2, 0). (Note: these swaps use the values resulting from step 4c if applicable, but the indices are distinct).
      - e: Place the resulting transformed 3x3 block into the *output* grid at the position starting at (r, c), overwriting the values copied in step 1.
    - 5: Return the final output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the 7x7 input grid to serve as the initial state of the output grid.
2.  Examine every possible 3x3 subgrid within the input grid. Iterate through potential top-left corner positions (row `r`, column `c`), where `r` ranges from 0 to 4 and `c` ranges from 0 to 4.
3.  For each potential 3x3 subgrid, check the value of its center cell located at input grid coordinates (`r+1`, `c+1`).
4.  If the value of the center cell is exactly 7:
    a.  Define the 3x3 block using the digits from the *input* grid spanning rows `r` to `r+2` and columns `c` to `c+2`.
    b.  Rotate this extracted 3x3 block 90 degrees clockwise.
    c.  Modify the rotated block by swapping the digit in its top-left corner (relative index 0,0) with the digit in its bottom-right corner (relative index 2,2).
    d.  Further modify the block by swapping the digit in its top-right corner (relative index 0,2) with the digit in its bottom-left corner (relative index 2,0).
    e.  Place this fully transformed 3x3 block into the *output* grid, replacing the digits in the corresponding area (rows `r` to `r+2`, columns `c` to `c+2`).
5.  After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, return the modified output grid.
