            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components: a 7x7 grid, a background digit '7', and transformations occurring within 3x3 blocks. However, the previous attempt incorrectly deduced both the trigger condition for the transformation and the specific sequence of operations within the 3x3 block.\n\nThe provided results show that the `swap-then-rotate` logic applied by the previous code (`code_00.py`) failed to produce the correct output for all training examples. The discrepancies are localized to the areas where 3x3 transformations were expected.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-evaluate the transformation rule by comparing the input and expected output blocks directly, focusing on the examples where the previous code failed.\n2.  Test the alternative hypothesis: `rotate-then-swap`. Apply a 90-degree clockwise rotation first, followed by corner swaps (main diagonal, then anti-diagonal).\n3.  Confirm the trigger condition: The analysis of differences strongly suggests the transformation applies to any 3x3 block where the *center* cell contains the digit '7'.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the revised understanding (center='7' trigger, rotate-then-swap logic).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nThe `code_execution` output provides detailed analysis comparing the `input`, `expected_output`, and the `actual_output` generated by the previous code (`code_00.py` which used `swap-then-rotate` triggered by center '7').\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 9\n    *   Analysis: The code analyzed multiple 3x3 blocks centered on '7'. For the block starting at (0,0) with center (1,1), the `actual_block` `[[5, 8, 7], [8, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]` differs significantly from the `expected_block` `[[5, 8, 9], [8, 7, 6], [9, 1, 0]]`. Applying the `rotate-then-swap` logic to the `input_block` `[[9, 6, 5], [8, 7, 1], [0, 8, 9]]` yields the `expected_block`. Similar mismatches occur for the block centered at (5,4). This confirms the `swap-then-rotate` sequence was incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 18\n    *   Analysis: The main transformed block is centered at (3,3). The `input_block` is `[[5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 9], [4, 3, 0]]`. The `expected_block` is `[[8, 1, 0], [3, 7, 2], [5, 9, 4]]`. The `actual_block` produced by the previous code was `[[8, 1, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]`. Applying `rotate-then-swap` to the input block yields the `expected_block`, again indicating the previous transformation order was wrong. The large number of differing pixels is due to the cascading effect of applying the transformation to overlapping blocks identified by the analysis script; the core issue lies in the transformation sequence for the block centered at (3,3).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 13\n    *   Analysis: Two blocks are transformed, centered at (2,4) and (5,1). For the block centered at (2,4), `input_block` `[[6, 5, 5], [5, 7, 6], [1, 5, 1]]` should yield `expected_block` `[[5, 5, 1], [5, 7, 5], [6, 6, 1]]`. The previous code produced `[[5, 5, 1], [7, 7, 5], [1, 7, 7]]`. For the block centered at (5,1), `input_block` `[[8, 8, 8], [9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0]]` should yield `expected_block` `[[8, 9, 0], [0, 7, 8], [8, 9, 0]]`. The previous code produced `[[8, 9, 7], [0, 7, 7], [8, 9, 8]]`. In both cases, applying `rotate-then-swap` to the input blocks yields the correct expected blocks.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation trigger is indeed a 3x3 block centered on '7'. The transformation sequence is: 1. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise. 2. Swap corners (0,0) <=> (2,2). 3. Swap corners (0,2) <=> (2,0).\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
