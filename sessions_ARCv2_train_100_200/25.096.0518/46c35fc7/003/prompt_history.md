Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are 2D grids (matrices) of single digits.
2.  **Grid Size:** The grids consistently have dimensions of 7x7 in all examples.
3.  **Background Value:** The digit '7' appears frequently and seems to act as a static background or padding. Cells containing '7' in the input remain '7' in the output.
4.  **Transformation Regions:** Changes between input and output occur within localized, contiguous 3x3 blocks where the digits are *not* '7'.
5.  **Transformation Type:** Within these 3x3 blocks, the digits are rearranged. Comparing the input and output blocks suggests a specific geometric transformation. Testing rotations and reflections reveals a pattern: a 90-degree clockwise rotation followed by swapping the corner elements along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.

  - name: Rotate_and_Swap_Corners
  - steps:
    - 1: Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input where none of the cells contain the digit 7.
    - 2: For each identified 3x3 block:
      - a: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the digits within the block.
      - b: Swap the digit at the top-left corner (0,0 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-right corner (2,2 relative to block).
      - c: Swap the digit at the top-right corner (0,2 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-left corner (2,0 relative to block).
    - 3: Construct the output grid by placing the transformed blocks into their original locations and copying all background (7) cells directly from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7), potentially filled with a placeholder value or copied from the input.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains the background digit '7', copy its value to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
3.  Identify all possible 3x3 subgrids within the input grid.
4.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if all nine cells within it contain digits *other than* '7'.
5.  If a 3x3 subgrid consists entirely of non-'7' digits (an "active block"):
    a.  Extract the 3x3 block of digits from the input.
    b.  Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on this extracted block.
    c.  After rotation, swap the element at the block's relative coordinates (0, 0) with the element at (2, 2).
    d.  After the first swap, swap the element now at the block's relative coordinates (0, 2) with the element now at (2, 0).
    e.  Place the resulting transformed 3x3 block into the corresponding position in the output grid, overwriting any values previously copied (which should only have been '7's if the block detection logic is correct relative to step 2).
6.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because the underlying assumption about the transformation trigger was incorrect. The code assumed that transformation only applies to 3x3 blocks composed *entirely* of non-'7' digits. The execution results show that no such blocks were found in the examples, and thus the input grids were returned unchanged.

Re-analysis of the input/output pairs reveals that the transformations occur within 3x3 blocks, but these blocks *do* contain the digit '7', specifically always in the center cell. The transformation rule itself (a combination of rotation and corner swaps) also needed refinement. The correct sequence appears to be swapping corner pairs *first*, followed by a clockwise rotation.

The strategy is to modify the identification criteria for the blocks to be transformed and correct the sequence of operations within the transformation.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

The core observation is the condition triggering the transformation. Let's verify the properties of the blocks where changes occur:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[0:3, 0:3]` and `[4:7, 3:6]`.
    *   The center of the first area is `input[1, 1]`, which is 7.
    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 4]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 14 (8 in the first block, 6 in the second, excluding the centers which don't change).

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid area `[2:5, 2:5]`.
    *   The center of this area is `input[3, 3]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 8 (all cells except the center).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[1:4, 3:6]` and `[4:7, 0:3]`.
    *   The center of the first area is `input[2, 4]`, which is 7.
    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 1]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 11 (6 in the first block, 5 in the second, excluding centers).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation is consistently applied to 3x3 subgrids where the *center cell* in the input grid contains the digit '7'. The transformation itself involves rearranging the 8 cells surrounding the center '7'.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner coordinates `(r, c)` for a 3x3 block within the grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to `height-3`, `c` from 0 to `width-3`).
3.  For each potential block starting at `(r, c)`, check the value of the center cell in the *input* grid at coordinates `(r+1, c+1)`.
4.  If the value of the center cell `input_grid[r+1][c+1]` is equal to '7':
    a.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the *input* grid, spanning rows `r` to `r+2` and columns `c` to `c+2`. Let this be `block`.
    b.  Perform the first swap on `block`: exchange the element at `block[0][0]` with the element at `block[2][2]`.
    c.  Perform the second swap on `block`: exchange the element at `block[0][2]` with the element at `block[2][0]`.
    d.  Rotate the modified `block` 90 degrees clockwise.
    e.  Place this finally transformed `block` into the *output* grid at the corresponding location, overwriting the values from `output_grid[r:r+3][c:c+3]`.
5.  After checking all possible 3x3 block positions, return the completed output grid.
