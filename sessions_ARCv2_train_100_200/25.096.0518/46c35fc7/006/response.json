            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code implementation failed because the transformation logic applied was incorrect (rotate then swap corners) and potentially the identification criteria for the blocks to be transformed was misidentified initially (non-7 blocks vs. 7-centered blocks). The comparison between the transformed output and the expected output showed significant discrepancies across all examples.\n\nThe analysis revealed a consistent pattern when reversing the order of operations (swap corners first, then rotate clockwise) and applying this transformation specifically to 3x3 subgrids *centered* on the digit '7'. This revised hypothesis successfully maps the input to the output for all three provided training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Block Identification:** Modify the logic to identify 3x3 blocks based *only* on whether their central cell (relative position 1,1) contains the digit '7'.\n2.  **Correct Transformation Sequence:** Implement the transformation for identified blocks as:\n    a.  Swap the top-left (0,0) element with the bottom-right (2,2) element.\n    b.  Swap the top-right (0,2) element with the bottom-left (2,0) element.\n    c.  Rotate the resulting 3x3 block 90 degrees clockwise.\n3.  **Update Grid:** Place the transformed block back into the output grid at the corresponding location. Cells not part of these transformations remain unchanged.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's confirm the locations and counts of 3x3 blocks centered on '7' in each input grid.\n\n"

The code output shows there are many more 3x3 blocks centered on '7' than I initially identified by just looking for the obvious \"active\" areas. However, looking closely at the *outputs*, changes *only* happen in the areas I originally identified.\n\nInput 1 Output 1 comparison: Changes occur only around (0,0) block and (4,3) block (top-left coords). Both have a '7' in the center.\nInput 2 Output 2 comparison: Changes occur only around (2,2) block. Center is '7'.\nInput 3 Output 3 comparison: Changes occur only around (1,3) block and (4,0) block. Both centers are '7'.\n\nWhy are the other '7'-centered blocks not changing?\nLet's look at Input 1, block top-left (0,2): `[[5, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]`. Center is 7.\nSwap corners: `[[9, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [5, 7, 7]]`\nRotate: `[[5, 1, 9], [7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]`\nIf this transformation happened, the output grid around (0,2) would be different. But it's not. The output grid matches the input grid in this area.\n\nHypothesis refinement #2: The transformation *only* applies to 3x3 blocks centered on '7' *IF* that block also contains non-7 values. Or perhaps, *all* values other than the center must be non-7?\n\nLet's re-examine the blocks that *do* change:\n- Ex1, Block (0,0): `[[9, 6, 5], [8, 7, 1], [0, 8, 9]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.\n- Ex1, Block (4,3): `[[1, 8, 4], [4, 7, 6], [6, 2, 4]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.\n- Ex2, Block (2,2): `[[5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 9], [4, 3, 0]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.\n- Ex3, Block (1,3): `[[6, 5, 5], [5, 7, 6], [1, 5, 1]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.\n- Ex3, Block (4,0): `[[8, 8, 8], [9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0]]` - Center is 7, all others non-7.\n\nNow examine a block centered on '7' that *doesn't* change:\n- Ex1, Block (0,2): `[[5, 7, 7], [1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7]]` - Center is 7, but other 7s are present.\n- Ex1, Block (1,2): `[[1, 7, 7], [9, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]` - Center is 7, but other 7s are present.\n\n**Revised Conclusion:** The transformation occurs on 3x3 blocks *if and only if* the center element is '7' AND all 8 surrounding elements are *not* '7'. The transformation sequence is: Swap Corners -> Rotate Clockwise.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
