task_description: Transform a 7x7 grid of digits by applying a local transformation to specific 3x3 subgrids.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - contains: cells
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer digit (0-9)
  - object: transformable_block
    description: A 3x3 subgrid that meets specific criteria for transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner coordinates (r, c) within the main grid
      - criteria:
        - Center cell (r+1, c+1) must have value 7.
        - All 8 surrounding cells within the block must have values other than 7.
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the grid to find all blocks matching the criteria.
      - transform: Apply a swap-corners-then-rotate sequence to the digits within the block.
  - object: other_cell
    description: Any cell not part of a transformable_block.
    properties:
      - behavior: Remains unchanged; copied directly from input to output.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Cells belonging to transformable_blocks in the input are replaced by the transformed block's cells in the output.
  - All other_cells map directly from input to output at the same location.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Swap_Corners_Then_Rotate_Clockwise
  - applicability: Applies only to 'transformable_blocks'.
  - steps:
    - 1: Iterate through all possible top-left corners (r, c) for a 3x3 block within the 7x7 grid (r from 0 to 4, c from 0 to 4).
    - 2: For each potential block starting at (r, c):
      - a: Check if the center cell (r+1, c+1) is 7.
      - b: Check if all 8 surrounding cells in the block `input[r:r+3, c:c+3]` are *not* 7.
      - c: If both conditions (a and b) are true:
        - i: Extract the 3x3 block.
        - ii: Create a mutable copy of the block.
        - iii: Swap the element at relative (0, 0) with the element at relative (2, 2) in the copy.
        - iv: Swap the element at relative (0, 2) with the element at relative (2, 0) in the copy.
        - v: Rotate the resulting copied block 90 degrees clockwise.
        - vi: Place this transformed 3x3 block into the output grid at position (r, c).
    - 3: Ensure all cells not overwritten by step 2.c.vi retain their original input values (copying the input to output initially achieves this).
