Cells containing '7' in the input remain '7' in the output.\n4.  **Transformation Regions:** Changes between input and output occur within localized, contiguous 3x3 blocks where the digits are *not* '7'.\n5.  **Transformation Type:** Within these 3x3 blocks, the digits are rearranged. Comparing the input and output blocks suggests a specific geometric transformation. Testing rotations and reflections reveals a pattern: a 90-degree clockwise rotation followed by swapping the corner elements along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
