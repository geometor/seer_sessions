task_description: Transform a 7x7 grid of digits based on local transformations within 3x3 subgrids.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - contains: cells
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer digit (0-9)
  - object: background_cell
    description: A cell whose value is 7.
    properties:
      - value: 7
      - behavior: Remains unchanged during transformation.
  - object: active_block
    description: A contiguous 3x3 subgrid composed entirely of non-background cells.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner coordinates within the main grid
      - contains: non-7 digits
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the grid to find these blocks.
      - transform: Apply a specific sequence of operations to the digits within the block.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background cells map directly from input to output at the same location.
  - Active blocks in the input are transformed and placed into the corresponding location in the output grid.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Rotate_and_Swap_Corners
  - steps:
    - 1: Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input where none of the cells contain the digit 7.
    - 2: For each identified 3x3 block:
      - a: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the digits within the block.
      - b: Swap the digit at the top-left corner (0,0 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-right corner (2,2 relative to block).
      - c: Swap the digit at the top-right corner (0,2 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-left corner (2,0 relative to block).
    - 3: Construct the output grid by placing the transformed blocks into their original locations and copying all background (7) cells directly from the input.
