task_description: Transform a 7x7 grid of digits by applying a specific transformation to 3x3 subgrids centered on the digit '7'.
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - contains: cells
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - value: integer digit (0-9)
  - object: trigger_cell
    description: A cell whose value indicates a transformation should occur in its 3x3 neighborhood.
    properties:
      - value: 7
      - role: Center of an active_block.
  - object: active_block
    description: A 3x3 subgrid identified for transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner coordinates (r, c) within the main grid.
      - trigger: The cell at the center of the block (r+1, c+1) in the input grid must have a value of 7.
      - contains: 9 digits (center is 7, others can be any digit).
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the input grid for cells with value 7 that can be centers of a 3x3 block.
      - transform: Apply a sequence of operations to the digits within the 3x3 block extracted from the input grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Cells not part of any identified active_block are copied directly from input to output at the same location.
  - Active blocks identified in the input are transformed and placed into the corresponding location in the output grid, overwriting initial values.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Swap_Corners_then_Rotate
  - condition: Applies to a 3x3 subgrid if its center cell in the input grid is 7.
  - steps:
    - 1: Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input grid whose center cell (relative coordinates (1,1)) has the value 7.
    - 2: For each identified 3x3 block:
      - a: Extract the 3x3 block of digits from the input grid.
      - b: Swap the digit at the top-left corner (0,0 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-right corner (2,2 relative to block).
      - c: Swap the digit at the top-right corner (0,2 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-left corner (2,0 relative to block).
      - d: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the resulting block (after swaps).
    - 3: Construct the output grid: Start with a copy of the input grid. Then, for each transformed block generated in step 2, place it into the corresponding location in the output grid, overwriting the original values.
