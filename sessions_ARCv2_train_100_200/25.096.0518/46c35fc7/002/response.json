            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed because the underlying assumption about the transformation trigger was incorrect. The code assumed that transformation only applies to 3x3 blocks composed *entirely* of non-'7' digits. The execution results show that no such blocks were found in the examples, and thus the input grids were returned unchanged.\n\nRe-analysis of the input/output pairs reveals that the transformations occur within 3x3 blocks, but these blocks *do* contain the digit '7', specifically always in the center cell. The transformation rule itself (a combination of rotation and corner swaps) also needed refinement. The correct sequence appears to be swapping corner pairs *first*, followed by a clockwise rotation.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the identification criteria for the blocks to be transformed and correct the sequence of operations within the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nThe core observation is the condition triggering the transformation. Let's verify the properties of the blocks where changes occur:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[0:3, 0:3]` and `[4:7, 3:6]`.\n    *   The center of the first area is `input[1, 1]`, which is 7.\n    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 4]`, which is 7.\n    *   Number of differing pixels: 14 (8 in the first block, 6 in the second, excluding the centers which don't change).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Changes are localized to input grid area `[2:5, 2:5]`.\n    *   The center of this area is `input[3, 3]`, which is 7.\n    *   Number of differing pixels: 8 (all cells except the center).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[1:4, 3:6]` and `[4:7, 0:3]`.\n    *   The center of the first area is `input[2, 4]`, which is 7.\n    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 1]`, which is 7.\n    *   Number of differing pixels: 11 (6 in the first block, 5 in the second, excluding centers).\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation is consistently applied to 3x3 subgrids where the *center cell* in the input grid contains the digit '7'. The transformation itself involves rearranging the 8 cells surrounding the center '7'.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
