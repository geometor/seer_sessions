**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed because the underlying assumption about the transformation trigger was incorrect. The code assumed that transformation only applies to 3x3 blocks composed *entirely* of non-'7' digits. The execution results show that no such blocks were found in the examples, and thus the input grids were returned unchanged.

Re-analysis of the input/output pairs reveals that the transformations occur within 3x3 blocks, but these blocks *do* contain the digit '7', specifically always in the center cell. The transformation rule itself (a combination of rotation and corner swaps) also needed refinement. The correct sequence appears to be swapping corner pairs *first*, followed by a clockwise rotation.

The strategy is to modify the identification criteria for the blocks to be transformed and correct the sequence of operations within the transformation.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

The core observation is the condition triggering the transformation. Let's verify the properties of the blocks where changes occur:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[0:3, 0:3]` and `[4:7, 3:6]`.
    *   The center of the first area is `input[1, 1]`, which is 7.
    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 4]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 14 (8 in the first block, 6 in the second, excluding the centers which don't change).

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid area `[2:5, 2:5]`.
    *   The center of this area is `input[3, 3]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 8 (all cells except the center).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Changes are localized to input grid areas `[1:4, 3:6]` and `[4:7, 0:3]`.
    *   The center of the first area is `input[2, 4]`, which is 7.
    *   The center of the second area is `input[5, 1]`, which is 7.
    *   Number of differing pixels: 11 (6 in the first block, 5 in the second, excluding centers).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation is consistently applied to 3x3 subgrids where the *center cell* in the input grid contains the digit '7'. The transformation itself involves rearranging the 8 cells surrounding the center '7'.

  - object: active_block
    description: A 3x3 subgrid identified for transformation.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: defined by top-left corner coordinates (r, c) within the main grid.
      - trigger: The cell at the center of the block (r+1, c+1) in the input grid must have a value of 7.
      - contains: 9 digits (center is 7, others can be any digit).
    actions:
      - identify: Scan the input grid for cells with value 7 that can be centers of a 3x3 block.
      - transform: Apply a sequence of operations to the digits within the 3x3 block extracted from the input grid.
relationships:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Cells not part of any identified active_block are copied directly from input to output at the same location.
  - Active blocks identified in the input are transformed and placed into the corresponding location in the output grid, overwriting initial values.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Swap_Corners_then_Rotate
  - condition: Applies to a 3x3 subgrid if its center cell in the input grid is 7.
  - steps:
    - 1: Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input grid whose center cell (relative coordinates (1,1)) has the value 7.
    - 2: For each identified 3x3 block:
      - a: Extract the 3x3 block of digits from the input grid.
      - b: Swap the digit at the top-left corner (0,0 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-right corner (2,2 relative to block).
      - c: Swap the digit at the top-right corner (0,2 relative to block) with the digit at the bottom-left corner (2,0 relative to block).
      - d: Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the resulting block (after swaps).
    - 3: Construct the output grid: Start with a copy of the input grid. Then, for each transformed block generated in step 2, place it into the corresponding location in the output grid, overwriting the original values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all possible top-left corner coordinates `(r, c)` for a 3x3 block within the grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to `height-3`, `c` from 0 to `width-3`).
3.  For each potential block starting at `(r, c)`, check the value of the center cell in the *input* grid at coordinates `(r+1, c+1)`.
4.  If the value of the center cell `input_grid[r+1][c+1]` is equal to '7':
    a.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the *input* grid, spanning rows `r` to `r+2` and columns `c` to `c+2`. Let this be `block`.
    b.  Perform the first swap on `block`: exchange the element at `block[0][0]` with the element at `block[2][2]`.
    c.  Perform the second swap on `block`: exchange the element at `block[0][2]` with the element at `block[2][0]`.
    d.  Rotate the modified `block` 90 degrees clockwise.
    e.  Place this finally transformed `block` into the *output* grid at the corresponding location, overwriting the values from `output_grid[r:r+3][c:c+3]`.
5.  After checking all possible 3x3 block positions, return the completed output grid.
