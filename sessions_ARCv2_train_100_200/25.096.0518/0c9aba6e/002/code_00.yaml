Input:
  type: multiline_string
  representation: grid_of_numbers
  structure: composite
  parts:
    - name: pattern_grid
      position: above_separator
      dimensions: 6x4
      cell_values: [0, 2]
      role: defines_pattern_locations
    - name: separator
      position: middle
      dimensions: 1x4
      cell_values: [7]
      role: delimiter_row
    - name: mask_grid
      position: below_separator
      dimensions: 6x4
      cell_values: [0, 6]
      role: defines_masking_locations
Output:
  type: list_of_lists # Represents a grid
  dimensions: 6x4
  cell_values: [0, 8]
Transformation:
  type: element-wise_comparison
  input_source: corresponding cells from pattern_grid and mask_grid
  output_logic: conditional_assignment
  condition_value_map:
    - condition: pattern_grid[r,c] == 0 AND mask_grid[r,c] == 0
      output_value: 8
    - condition: otherwise
      output_value: 0
Relationships:
  - The input is a single string containing line breaks.
  - The string must be parsed into a numerical grid structure.
  - A specific row (all 7s) acts as a separator between the two functional input grids.
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the pattern_grid and mask_grid dimensions.
  - The value of each output cell is determined solely by the values of the cells at the identical (row, column) position in the pattern_grid and mask_grid.
