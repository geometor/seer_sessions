Input:
  type: grid
  structure: composite
  parts:
    - name: pattern_grid
      position: above_separator
      dimensions: 6x4
      cell_values: [0, 2]
      role: pattern definition
    - name: separator
      position: middle
      dimensions: 1x4
      cell_values: [7]
      role: delimiter
    - name: mask_grid
      position: below_separator
      dimensions: 6x4
      cell_values: [0, 6]
      role: masking/filtering
Output:
  type: grid
  structure: simple
  dimensions: 6x4
  cell_values: [0, 8]
Transformation:
  type: element-wise_comparison
  logic: conditional assignment based on corresponding cells in pattern_grid and mask_grid
  condition_for_8: pattern_grid[r,c] == 0 AND mask_grid[r,c] == 0
  condition_for_0: NOT (pattern_grid[r,c] == 0 AND mask_grid[r,c] == 0)
Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the dimensions of the pattern_grid and mask_grid.
  - Each output cell's value depends solely on the values of the cells at the same row and column index in the two input grids (pattern and mask).
  - The separator line (7s) is ignored in the final calculation and serves only to demarcate the two input grids.
