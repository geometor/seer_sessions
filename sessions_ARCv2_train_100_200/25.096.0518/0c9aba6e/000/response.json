It contains a distinct separator row composed entirely of the number 7. This separator divides the input into two main parts: an upper grid and a lower grid.\n2.  **Grid Dimensions:** Both the upper and lower input grids appear to have consistent dimensions across examples (6 rows, 4 columns). The output grid also has these dimensions (6x4).\n3.  **Number Values:**\n    *   The upper input grid primarily uses numbers 0 and 2.\n    *   The lower input grid primarily uses numbers 0 and 6.\n    *   The separator uses number 7.\n    *   The output grid uses numbers 0 and 8.\n4.  **Transformation Nature:** The transformation seems to operate element-wise, comparing the cell at a specific position (row, col) in the upper input grid with the cell at the *same* position (row, col) in the lower input grid to determine the value of the cell at that position in the output grid.\n5.  **Core Logic:** Observing the examples, the output cell value is 8 only when the corresponding cell in the *upper* grid is 0 AND the corresponding cell in the *lower* grid is also 0. In all other cases (where either the upper cell is not 0, or the lower cell is not 0, or both are not 0), the output cell value is 0. The specific values (2 and 6) in the input grids seem only relevant in that they are *not* 0.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
