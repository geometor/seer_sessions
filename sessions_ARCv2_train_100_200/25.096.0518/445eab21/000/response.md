*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a 10x10 grid containing digits, with '0' representing the background.
    *   Each input grid contains exactly two distinct non-zero digits, forming two separate shapes or patterns.
    *   The output is always a 2x2 grid.
    *   The digit used to fill the output grid is one of the two non-zero digits present in the input grid.
    *   The key determining factor for the output digit seems to be the relative frequency or count of the two non-zero digits in the input. The digit that appears more times is selected for the output.

```yaml
    task_description: Identify the most frequent non-zero digit in the input grid and create a 2x2 output grid filled with that digit.
    
    elements:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: grid
          - dimensions: 10x10
          - contains: digits (0-9)
          - background_digit: 0
          - features: Contains exactly two distinct non-zero digits.
    
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: grid
          - dimensions: 2x2
          - contains: single digit
          - relationship: The digit filling the output grid is determined by the input grid.
    
      - object: non_zero_digit_1
        properties:
          - type: digit
          - value: (e.g., 6 in train_1)
          - frequency: count of its occurrences in the input grid
    
      - object: non_zero_digit_2
        properties:
          - type: digit
          - value: (e.g., 7 in train_1)
          - frequency: count of its occurrences in the input grid
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_non_zero_digits
        description: Find the two unique digits in the input grid that are not '0'.
      - action: count_frequencies
        description: Count the number of times each non-zero digit appears in the input grid.
      - action: compare_frequencies
        description: Compare the counts of the two non-zero digits.
      - action: select_output_digit
        description: Choose the non-zero digit that has the higher frequency (appeared more times).
      - action: generate_output
        description: Create a 2x2 grid and fill all its cells with the selected output digit.
    
    relationships:
      - The output digit is the non-zero input digit with the maximum frequency (count) within the input grid.
      - The size of the output grid (2x2) is fixed and independent of the input grid's content, other than the selected digit.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the 10x10 input grid.
    2.  Identify the two distinct non-zero digits present in the input grid.
    3.  For each of these two non-zero digits, count how many times it appears in the input grid.
    4.  Compare the counts obtained in the previous step.
    5.  Select the digit that has the higher count (appears more frequently).
    6.  Construct a 2x2 output grid.
    7.  Fill every cell of the 2x2 output grid with the selected digit.
    8.  Return the filled 2x2 output grid.
