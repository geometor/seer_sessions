Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

## Perception

The input and output are both grids of numbers.
The input grids appear to have two distinct vertical sections:
1.  A top section consisting of multiple identical rows (let's call this the "background row").
2.  A bottom section containing rows that differ from the background row and from each other, forming a "pattern block".

The output grid has the same dimensions (number of rows and columns) as the input grid.
The content of the output grid seems to be generated by repeating the "pattern block" from the input grid vertically until the output grid is filled. The way the pattern block is repeated (the starting row of the pattern used for the first row of the output) appears to depend on the structure of the input.

Specifically, the transformation identifies the contiguous block of rows at the bottom of the input grid that contains patterns different from the top 'background' rows. This block of pattern rows is then tiled vertically to fill the output grid. The starting point of this tiling cycle seems to be shifted based on the number of background rows relative to the number of pattern rows.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - element_type: integer
      - structure: contains a top section of identical 'background' rows and a bottom 'pattern block' section.
      - attributes:
          - height: n
          - width: m
          - background_row: row 0 of the input grid
          - pattern_block_start_index: s
          - pattern_block_height: p = n - s

  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - element_type: integer
      - structure: vertically tiled repetition of the input's pattern block.
      - attributes:
          - height: n (same as input)
          - width: m (same as input)

relationships:
  - type: determination
    source: input_grid.background_row
    target: input_grid.pattern_block_start_index
    details: The pattern block starts at index `s`, where `s-1` is the index of the lowest row (searching upwards from the bottom) identical to the background row.

  - type: calculation
    source: [input_grid.height, input_grid.pattern_block_start_index]
    target: input_grid.pattern_block_height
    details: p = n - s

  - type: calculation
    source: [input_grid.pattern_block_start_index, input_grid.pattern_block_height]
    target: tiling_offset
    details: offset = s % p

  - type: transformation
    source: input_grid.pattern_block
    target: output_grid
    action: vertical_tiling_with_offset
    details: Each row `i` (0-indexed) of the output grid is a copy of a row from the input grid's pattern block. The specific input row index is calculated as `s + ((i + offset) % p)`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Background Row**: Take the first row (row 0) of the input grid as the 'background row'.
2.  **Find Pattern Block Start**: Iterate upwards from the last row of the input grid. Find the index of the highest row (`boundary_index`) that is *different* from the background row. The pattern block starts at the row immediately below the first background row encountered when moving up from the bottom; let the starting row index of the pattern block be `s`. If the last row is identical to the background row, there is no pattern block distinct from the background. If all rows below the first row are different, the pattern block starts at row 1 (`s=1`). In the examples provided, `s` is found by locating the lowest row index `k` (where `k < n-1`) such that `input_row[k]` is identical to `input_row[0]`, and setting `s = k + 1`. If no such `k` exists, `s=1`.
3.  **Determine Pattern Block Height**: Calculate the number of rows in the pattern block, `p`, as the total number of rows `n` minus the starting index `s` (`p = n - s`).
4.  **Calculate Tiling Offset**: Calculate an offset `o` based on the start index and height of the pattern block: `o = s % p`.
5.  **Generate Output Grid**: Create a new grid with the same dimensions (`n` rows, `m` columns) as the input grid.
6.  **Fill Output Grid**: For each row `i` from 0 to `n-1` in the output grid:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding source row index `source_idx` in the input grid using the formula: `source_idx = s + ((i + o) % p)`.
    b.  Copy the row `input_grid[source_idx]` to `output_grid[i]`.
7.  **Return Output Grid**: The newly filled grid is the result.
