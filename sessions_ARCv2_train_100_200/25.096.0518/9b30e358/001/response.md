    Identifies a 'pattern block' of rows at the bottom of the input grid,
    distinguished from repeating 'background' rows at the top.
    This pattern block is then tiled vertically, potentially with an offset,
    to create the output grid of the same dimensions.

    1.  Identify the Background Row: Take the first row (row 0) as the 'background row'.
    2.  Find Pattern Block Start: Find the index 's' where the pattern block begins.
        This is the index immediately following the lowest row (searching upwards
        from the bottom) that matches the background row. If no such row exists
        below row 0, the pattern starts at row 1.
    3.  Determine Pattern Block Height: Calculate 'p' as the total rows 'n' minus 's'.
    4.  Calculate Tiling Offset: Calculate 'o' = s % p.
    5.  Generate Output Grid: Create a new grid of size n x m.
    6.  Fill Output Grid: For each output row 'i', copy the row from the input grid
        at index 's + ((i + o) % p)'.
