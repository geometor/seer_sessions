Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 8x8 grids containing integer values.
2.  **Values:** The grids contain the numbers 2, 7, and 9.
3.  **Key Transformation Areas:** The transformation seems to divide the grid into distinct regions:
    *   Left Half: Columns 0, 1, 2, 3.
    *   Top-Right Quadrant: Rows 0, 1, 2, 3 and Columns 4, 5, 6, 7.
    *   Bottom-Right Quadrant: Rows 4, 5, 6, 7 and Columns 4, 5, 6, 7.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation applied to the right half of the grid appears to depend on whether the value '2' exists anywhere within the *left half* (columns 0-3) of the *input* grid.
5.  **Specific Changes (Left Half):** The left half (columns 0-3) of the output grid is *always* filled entirely with the value '7', regardless of the input content or the condition.
6.  **Specific Changes (Right Half - Conditional):**
    *   **If '2' is present in the input's left half (like in train_1):** The top-right quadrant of the output is copied directly from the input's top-right quadrant, while the bottom-right quadrant is filled entirely with the value '2'.
    *   **If '2' is *not* present in the input's left half (like in train_2):** The bottom-right quadrant of the output is copied directly from the input's bottom-right quadrant. The top-right quadrant is modified: rows 0, 1, and 2 are filled entirely with '9', while row 3 is copied from the input's row 3 (in that quadrant).
