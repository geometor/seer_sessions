facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves moving pixels diagonally.
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: (row, column) tuple
  - actions:
      - type: move
        properties:
          - direction: diagonal (down-left, down-right, etc.)
          - magnitude: variable, needs to be determined. It does not depend on the number of colors above it.
  - input: 2D grid of colored pixels
  - output: 2D grid of colored pixels, same dimensions as input
