The colors present in this specific example are white (0), red (2), magenta (6), and yellow (4).  The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). The transformation seems to involve a vertical mirroring or reflection of the colored pixels, while the white pixels remain unchanged. The key colors (2, 4, and 6) appear to maintain their relative horizontal positions but are \"flipped\" vertically.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
