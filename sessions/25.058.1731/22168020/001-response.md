Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). The core operation seems to be related to expanding or "filling" connected regions of non-zero pixels. The input grids contain distinct, separated regions of a single color. The output grids appear to have these regions expanded. The edges of the colored regions in the output are adjacent.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_region
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9, representing a color)
      - shape: contiguous block of pixels with the same color
      - adjacency:  relation to other regions

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the size of a colored_region, filling adjacent pixels.
    constraints:
      - expansion_direction: horizontal and vertical.
      - expansion_limit:  until adjacent with edge of another original colored object

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two colored_regions are adjacent if their pixels are directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Colored Regions:** Find all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each block represents a colored region.

2. **Expand Regions:** For each colored region:
   - Expand the region horizontally and vertically. 
   - Add pixels of the same color to all sides of the colored shape.

3.  **Expansion Limit.** Expansion ceases when all colored regions have adjacent edges.

In summary, the transformation takes disjointed colored regions and expands them until their edges are adjacent.
