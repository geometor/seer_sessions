The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4). The input grid contains isolated and connected regions of blue and yellow pixels. The output grid appears to \"inflate\" or \"expand\" these colored regions, extending them horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
