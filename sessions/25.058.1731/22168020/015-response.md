Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with two distinct colored regions. One region is magenta (color 6) in the top-left, and the other is azure (color 8) in the bottom-right. The rest of the grid is white (color 0). The shapes formed by the colored regions appear to be contiguous. The magenta and azure regions do not touch, and there appears to be a clear separation of five rows, including and in-between the two distinct objects.
*   **Output:** The same 10x10 grid. The magenta and azure regions have expanded horizontally. Specifically, the magenta region has filled the available space to its right in the original rows where it was present. The azure region has filled the space to its left, in the rows where it was originally present, maintaining the general shape of the regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: magenta_region
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: contiguous block
    initial_location: top-left
    action: expand horizontally to the right
  - id: azure_region
    color: azure (8)
    shape: contiguous block
    initial_location: bottom-right
    action: expand horizontally to the left
  - id: background
    color: white(0)
    shape: fills remaining space

relationships:
  - magenta_region and azure_region are spatially separated
  - magenta_region and azure_region expand within their initial rows

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify two distinct colored regions in the input grid: a magenta region in the top-left and an azure region in the bottom-right. The rest of the grid at this point, is filled with white.
2.  For the magenta region, expand it horizontally to the right, filling all white cells within the rows where the magenta color is initially present.
3.  For the azure region, expand it horizontally to the left, filling all white cells within the rows where the azure color is initially present.
4. White cells, where neither condition applies, remain unchanged.
