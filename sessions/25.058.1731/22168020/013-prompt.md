Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (color 1) and yellow (color 4) pixels within the input grid. Consider each of these regions as separate objects.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each blue and yellow region:
    *   Expand the region horizontally to the left and right.
    *   Expansion continues until a pixel of any color other than white (0) is encountered. The expansion will include all white pixels (0) but will stop immediately before the non-white pixel.
3. If expansion from step 2 would cause the height of the region to be greater than one, expand the full height of the grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
