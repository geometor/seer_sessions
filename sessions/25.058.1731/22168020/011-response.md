Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved horizontal expansion of blue and yellow regions. The code successfully handles this first case. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. There are cases where the expansion doesn't simply extend to the grid edges or nearest non-white pixel. The presence of other colored pixels, and in particular, it appears black pixels, act as definitive boundaries to the expansions.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Refine Region Identification**: Ensure regions of colors 1 (blue) and 4 (yellow) can be selected
2.  **Refine Expansion Logic**: Modify the `expand_region_horizontally` function (or create a new one) to correctly handle expansion. The expansion should stop at any non-white pixel, but it seems that black pixels play a special role that is different than other colors..
3.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the revised code after each modification against *all* training examples to ensure we're converging on a general solution.
4.  Update Natural Language Program.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand what happened with the other grids, the approach of print statements to the console are not ideal, here, the report should display the information by calling the code and printing information in markdown.

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with observations:

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid):
    """Executes code and prints information about results"""

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    transformed_grid = np.array(transformed_grid)

    print(f"Input Grid:\n{input_grid}\n")
    print(f"Expected Output Grid:\n{output_grid}\n")
    print(f"Transformed Grid:\n{transformed_grid}\n")

    print(f"Shapes - Input: {input_grid.shape}, Expected: {output_grid.shape}, Transformed: {transformed_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Correct Transformation: {np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)}")
    
    # identify where differences are:
    if not np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid):
        diff = output_grid != transformed_grid
        print(f"Number of incorrect pixels: {np.sum(diff)}")
        print(f"Locations of incorrect pixels: {np.argwhere(diff)}")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_region
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular
    behavior: expands horizontally
    constraints:
      - stops at any non-white pixel

  - name: yellow_region
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: irregular
    behavior: expands horizontally
    constraints:
      - stops at any non-white pixel

  - name: black_region
    color: black(0)
    shape: irregular
    behavior: acts as boundary
    constraints: []
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (color 1) and yellow (color 4) pixels within the input grid. Consider each of these regions as separate objects.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each blue and yellow region:
    *   Expand the region horizontally to the left and right.
    * Expansion continues until a pixel of any color other than white (0) is encountered. The expansion will include all white pixels (0) but will stop immediately before the non-white pixel.
3. If expansion from step 2 would cause the height of the region to be greater than one, expand the full height of the grid.

This revised natural language program incorporates the critical observation that *any* non-white pixel acts as a boundary for the horizontal expansion, and accounts for expansion in height.
