The core operation seems to be related to expanding or \"filling\" connected regions of non-zero pixels. The input grids contain distinct, separated regions of a single color. The output grids appear to have these regions expanded. The edges of the colored regions in the output are adjacent.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
