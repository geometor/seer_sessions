Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of the same dimensions (10x10). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4). The input grid contains isolated and connected regions of blue and yellow pixels. The output grid appears to "inflate" or "expand" these colored regions, extending them horizontally.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 10]
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, blue, yellow]

  - type: region
    properties:
      color: blue
      shape: variable
      initial_location: variable
      final_location: variable

  - type: region
    properties:
      color: yellow
      shape: variable
      initial_location: variable
      final_location: variable
relations:
    - input_grid contains blue_region, yellow_region
    - output_grid contains expanded_blue_region, expanded_yellow_region
actions:
    - expand:
        subject: blue_region,yellow_region
        direction: horizontal
        constraint: none (expands to the end of any encountered white space)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (1) and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each identified region, expand it horizontally to the left and right.
    *   Expand to the left until a non-white (non-0) pixel or the grid boundary is encountered.
    *    Expand to the right until a non-white (non-0) or the grid boundary is encountered.
3.  **Preserve Original Shape:** When expanding use the y coordinate extents (height and location from the top of the original shape.
4. Fill in the expanded area with original color of the region.
5. keep all original shape pixels in the output.
6.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the expanded regions.

In simpler terms: The transformation takes each colored shape (blue or yellow) and stretches it out sideways as far as it can go within the bounds of the grid, while keeping the shape's original height and horizontal position, overwriting any white pixels (0) in its path.
