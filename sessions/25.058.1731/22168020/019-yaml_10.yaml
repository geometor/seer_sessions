  - observation: |
      Example 1: Input contains both Magenta and Azure. Output contains both, prediction is incorrect
  - observation: |
      Example 2: Input contains both Magenta and Azure. Output contains both, prediction is correct.
  - observation: |
     Example 3: Input contains both Magenta and Azure, Output contains only Magenta, prediction is incorrect
