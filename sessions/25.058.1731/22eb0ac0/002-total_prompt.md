<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x1330 at 0x7C360455CED0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most obvious changes happen to colored pixels with values other than 0. The zero values seem to represent a background or empty space, and non-zero values represent distinct colored objects. Some rows maintain their structure, while others experience change. The grids share the same dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10 (all examples)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9
  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value (0-9)
      - position: row and column index within the grid
  - type: colored_row
    description: A row that contains the color value
    properties:
     - row_index: y axis
     - color_value: color of the pixel
     - position: x, y

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: Replicate existing color across a row.
    details:
      - trigger: specific input conditions (non-zero pixels in specific configuration)
      - effect: fill a complete row with all of a single color.
  - type: check_row_position
    description: Find the y axis of the row with more than 1 value that is not 0

observations:
  - consistent_grid_size: All input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: 0 represents the background and remains largely unchanged.
  - row_filling:  Some rows become completely filled with a single color.
  - filling_position: The output row index matches a row that starts with a color, where there are also other colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Rows:** Scan the input grid to find rows that contain more than one non-zero pixel.

2.  **Check for Replication:** If a row is identified, replicate the first color of the row to make the entire row the first color.

3.  **Preserve other Rows:** All other rows, remain unchanged.

4.  **Output**: A new grid is the final result

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
