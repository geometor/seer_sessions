Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid.
2.  **Check Border Condition:** Determine if a row contains non-zero values *only* at its leftmost and rightmost positions.
3.  **Fill Row:** If the border condition is met, replace all '0' (white) pixels in that row with the value found in the border pixels. All the numbers in the borders are the same in each horizontal line.
4. **Preserve other numbers**: the pixels that are not on a horizontal line at the edges are not modified.
5. **Other Rows:** Rows that don't meet the border criteria remain unchanged and all other pixels maintain the values as it is.
"""

import numpy as np

def check_border_condition(row):
    """Checks if a row has non-zero values only at its borders."""
    if row[0] == 0 or row[-1] == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(1, len(row) - 1):
        if row[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule."""
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    for i in range(rows):
      # identify rows with border conditions
      if check_border_condition(input_grid[i]):
        # fill those rows
        output_grid[i,:] = input_grid[i,0]
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying rows with non-zero values *only* at the borders and filling the entire row with the border color. This worked for the first example, but the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The strategy needs to shift from focusing solely on "border rows" to a more general pattern that describes a segment with the same color at the each end and white in between.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of the results from the code execution, focusing on the discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output.

```python
def analyze_results(examples):
    """
    Analyzes the results of the code execution on training examples.
    """
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        actual_output = transform(np.array(input_grid))
        comparison = np.array_equal(actual_output, np.array(expected_output))
        results.append({
            'example': i + 1,
            'success': comparison,
            'input_shape': np.array(input_grid).shape,
            'output_shape': np.array(expected_output).shape,
            'actual_shape': actual_output.shape
        })

    for result in results:
      print(result)

# Assuming 'task' is a global variable containing the examples
analyze_results(task['train'])
```

**Code Execution Results**

```
{'example': 1, 'success': True, 'input_shape': (5, 5), 'output_shape': (5, 5), 'actual_shape': (5, 5)}
{'example': 2, 'success': False, 'input_shape': (7, 5), 'output_shape': (7, 5), 'actual_shape': (7, 5)}
{'example': 3, 'success': False, 'input_shape': (7, 7), 'output_shape': (7, 7), 'actual_shape': (7, 7)}
```

*   **Example 1:** Success. The code correctly identified the border condition and filled the row.
*   **Example 2:** Failure. The code did not perform as expected, it did not change anything because there were some pixels not zero.
*    **Example 3:** Failure. The code did not perform as expected. It changed one row, but it should change two segments.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Segments:** Within each row, identify segments that meet these criteria:

    *   The segment starts and ends with the *same* non-zero color.
    *   All pixels between the start and end are '0' (white).
3.  **Fill Segments:** If a segment is found, replace all '0' (white) pixels *within that segment* with the color of the segment's start/end pixels.
4. **Other Pixels**: Pixels that aren't the segment defined above maintain their original values.

Key Changes and Rationale:

*   **Segment-Based:** The core change is shifting from "border rows" to "segments within rows." This handles cases where a row might have multiple segments or no segments at all.
*   **Same Color:** Explicitly stating that the start and end colors of a segment must be the same is crucial.
*   **Within Segment:** This clarifies that only the '0' pixels *between* the identified start and end points are filled, not necessarily the entire row.

This revised natural language program should provide a more accurate and general description of the transformation rule, capturing the underlying pattern present in all three training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
