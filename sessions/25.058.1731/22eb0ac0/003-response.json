The primary observation is a change in a specific row. The input has a row of zeros and on that same row in the output all the values match the single non-zero value found on each half of that row in the input. It appears the transformation is focused on the row where every other value in the input grid are zeros.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
