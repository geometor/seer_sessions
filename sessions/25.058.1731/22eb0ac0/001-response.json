The most obvious changes happen to colored pixels with values other than 0. The zero values seem to represent a background or empty space, and non-zero values represent distinct colored objects. Some rows maintain their structure, while others experience change. The grids share the same dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
