objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10 (all examples)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9
  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value (0-9)
      - position: row and column index within the grid
  - type: colored_row
    description: A row that contains the color value
    properties:
     - row_index: y axis
     - color_value: color of the pixel
     - position: x, y

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: Replicate existing color across a row.
    details:
      - trigger: specific input conditions (non-zero pixels in specific configuration)
      - effect: fill a complete row with all of a single color.
  - type: check_row_position
    description: Find the y axis of the row with more than 1 value that is not 0

observations:
  - consistent_grid_size: All input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: 0 represents the background and remains largely unchanged.
  - row_filling:  Some rows become completely filled with a single color.
  - filling_position: The output row index matches a row that starts with a color, where there are also other colors.
