Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Target Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid.
2.  **Check Border Condition:** Determine if a row contains non-zero values *only* at its leftmost and rightmost positions.
3.  **Fill Row:** If the border condition is met, replace all '0' (white) pixels in that row with the value found in the border pixels. All the numbers in the borders are the same in each horizontal line.
4. **Preserve other numbers**: the pixels that are not on a horizontal line at the edges are not modified.
5. **Other Rows:** Rows that don't meet the border criteria remain unchanged and all other pixels maintain the values as it is.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
