Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all red (2) pixels and gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Gray Structures:** Determine the gray columns (vertical) and the horizontal gray bar (longest horizontal line of gray pixels).
3.  **Horizontal Bar:** Locate the row index of the horizontal gray bar.
4.  **Red Pixel Transformation - Above Bar:** For each red pixel *above* the horizontal gray bar:
    *   If the red pixel is *left* of a gray column, extend it to the *right* by filling all cells with red (2) until it reaches a gray column or right edge of grid is reached.
    *    If a red(2) pixel is *in* a Gray (5) column, it is unchanged.
5.  **Red Pixel Transformation - Below Bar:** For each red pixel *below* the horizontal gray bar, change its value to white (0).
6.  **Output:** Create the output grid with these modifications, keeping all other pixels unchanged from the input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs reasonably well on the first example, which was the basis for its design. However, the other examples reveal some limitations:

1.  **Multiple Horizontal Bars:** The initial assumption of a single, longest horizontal gray bar is incorrect. There can be multiple gray bars of different lengths. The logic needs to consider all gray structures, not just the longest.
2.  **Red Expansion Logic:** The rule for extending red pixels to the right until a gray column is encountered works in simple cases, but fails when gray structures are more complex or when other red pixels are encountered.
3.   **Adjacent Red Pixels:** There are cases in other examples where two Red(2) pixels are horizontally adjacent. In this circumstance, the fill should only fill the next cell if it's a White(0) cell.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Revisit Gray Structure Identification:** Instead of finding only the *longest* horizontal gray bar, we need to identify *all* contiguous horizontal gray lines.
2.  **Refine Red Pixel Transformation:**
    *   The "extend to the right" logic needs to be more precise. It should stop at *any* obstacle (gray column, edge of grid, or another red pixel).
    *   The fill should only happen if the next cell value is 0 (White).
3.  **Consider All Gray Lines:** The transformation of red pixels should be relative to *all* detected gray lines, not just the longest one.
4. **Example 3:** This example introduces a Red pixel on the *same* row as a Gray row. Add logic to consider and maintain Red pixels *on* Gray rows.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**

To better understand the patterns, let's gather some data. Because I don't have `code_execution` capabilities in this environment, I'll have to manually describe the observations. I would, in a real setting, write code to compute these automatically.

*   **Example 1 (Correct):**
    *   Input: Single horizontal gray bar, red pixels above and below.
    *   Output: Red pixels above extend to the right until a gray column; red pixels below turn white.
    *   *Observation:* The current logic works as intended in this simple case.
*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):**
    *   Input: Two horizontal gray bars, red pixels above, between, and below.
    *   Output: Only red pixels above the *longest* gray bar are extended. Red pixels between bars are not handled correctly.
    *   *Observation:* The logic fails to account for multiple horizontal gray bars.
*   **Example 3 (Incorrect):**
    *   Input: Red pixels on the *same row* as the horizontal gray bar.
    *    Output: All Red Pixels are cleared, instead of remaining unchanged.
    *   *Observation:* The logic needs to be updated to account for pixels on gray rows.
* **Example 4(Incorrect):**
    *    Input: Two Red(2) pixels adjacent.
    *    Output: The first red is extended the full distance to the Gray, and the 2nd Red pixel remains.
    *   *Observation:* Red pixels should only be extended to the next pixel if it is a White(0).

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Structures:** Find all horizontal gray lines (contiguous sequences of gray pixels) and all vertical gray columns in the input grid.
2.  **Categorize Red Pixels:** For each red pixel, determine its position relative to the gray lines:
    *   **Above:** If the red pixel's row is above *any* gray line.
    *   **Below:** If the red pixel's row is below *any* gray line.
    * **On:** If the Red Pixel's row is *on* any gray line.
3.  **Transform Red Pixels:**
    *   **Above any Gray Line:** If a red pixel is above any gray line AND left of a gray column AND is adjacent to a White(0) pixel horizontally, extend it to the right, changing White(0) pixels to Red(2), until it encounters a gray column, the edge of the grid, or another Red(2) pixel.
    *   **Below any Gray Line:** Change the red pixel to white (0).
    *   **On any Gray Line:** The red pixel should remain unchanged.
4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with these transformations, keeping all other pixels (gray and white) unchanged from the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
