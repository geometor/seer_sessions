task: 7b60155d
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    actions:
      - preserve: gray (5) lines/pixels
      - modify: green (3) pixels based on location and count

  - object: green_pixels
    properties:
      - count: variable
      - initial_location: any
      - final_location: specific arrangement (bottom-right section)
    actions:
      - remove: outside the designated section
      - arrange: based on count within the section, forming square or line

  - object: gray_lines
    properties:
      - type: horizontal or vertical
      - role: section dividers (potentially, but needs clarification)
    actions:
      - define: bottom-right section (current assumption - to be refined)
      - remain: static through out the transformation

  - section: bottom_right
    properties:
      - definition: unclear (needs further investigation and more precise definition)
    actions:
      - contains: final arrangement of green pixels.
