Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 11x11 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of colors representing values 0, 3, and 5, which correspond to white, green, and gray, respectively.
*   **Shapes:** There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines formed by gray (5) pixels. There are isolated and clustered green (3) pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The primary change seems to be related to the green pixels. Some green pixels disappear, and others seem to consolidate into a rectangular block at the bottom right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 11x11
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color_values: [0, 3, 5]
  - type: line
    color: gray (5)
    orientation: [horizontal, vertical]
    properties:
       - continuous
  - type: pixel_group
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - scattered
      - clustered

actions:
  - type: removal
    target: green (3) pixels
    condition: isolated or not part of the final cluster
  - type: consolidation
    target: green(3)
    location: bottom right
    shape: rectangle

relationships:
    - gray (5) lines form a grid structure
    - green(3) pixels existing within sections of grey grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Grid Lines:** Recognize the horizontal and vertical lines formed by the gray (5) pixels. These lines divide the grid into sections.

2.  **Locate green pixels:** Identify all green (3) pixels within the grid.

3. **Preserve the grey grid:** The grey portion of the grid is unchaged.

4.  **Green Pixel Removal:** Remove all green (3) pixels, *except* for those in the bottom-rightmost section of the grid.

5.  **Green Pixel Consolidation:** Within the bottom-rightmost section, arrange any remaining green pixels into a contiguous 3x3 rectangle in the bottom-right corner of that section. If green pixels are less than 9, create a horizontal green line of width equal to number of green pixels starting at bottom right.

In summary, the transformation preserves the gray grid, removes most green pixels except those at the bottom right of the grid. The surviving green pixels coalesce into a solid rectangle at the grid bottom right.
