Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all red (2) pixels and gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Gray Structures:** Determine the gray columns (vertical) and the horizontal gray bar (longest horizontal line of gray pixels).
3.  **Horizontal Bar:** Locate the row index of the horizontal gray bar.
4.  **Red Pixel Transformation - Above Bar:** For each red pixel *above* the horizontal gray bar:
    *   If the red pixel is *left* of a gray column, extend it to the *right* by filling all cells with red (2) until it reaches a gray column or right edge of grid is reached.
    *    If a red(2) pixel is *in* a Gray (5) column, it is unchanged.
5.  **Red Pixel Transformation - Below Bar:** For each red pixel *below* the horizontal gray bar, change its value to white (0).
6.  **Output:** Create the output grid with these modifications, keeping all other pixels unchanged from the input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
