A key feature seems to be horizontal lines of grey (value 5) that divide the grid. Within sections delineated by these grey lines, isolated colored pixels (non-grey, non-white, and non-black) appear. The transformation appears to replicate these colored areas.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These lines act as delimiters.\n2.  **Isolate Colored Regions:** Within each section bounded by the grey lines (or the edge of the grid), identify any connected regions of non-white (0) and non-grey(5) colors.\n3. **Identify replication zone:** Locate the zone at the bottom, beneath the last horizontal grey(5) line.\n4.  **Replicate Colored Regions:** For each identified colored region above the last horizontal grey line, check if the region to be replicated is composed by 1 or more pixels.\n    * if the colored region is one single pixel replicate a 3x1 region of the same color in the replication zone.\n    * if the original region is already 3x1, create a copy.\n    Maintain the horizontal order of the replicated colored pixels in the last section. The vertical order within the section does not matter as long as the copied sections are contiguous.\n\nIn essence, the transformation finds specific colored regions within boundaries defined by grey lines and replicates those color and dimension, to the replication zone at the bottom of the grid.\n"
