Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The dominant colors are white (0), gray (5), and red (2).
*   The gray (5) pixels appear to form a solid horizontal line across the middle of the grid, and also appear in vertical columns.
*   The red (2) pixels seem to move or get replaced.
*   The overall grid dimensions remain the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 11x11
      colors: [0, 2, 5]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        red: 2
        gray: 5
      location: [row, col]
actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Replaces a pixel's color with another.
relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description:  Gray (5) pixels form a continuous horizontal line, and vertical lines. Red (2) seems to move in straight line based on position of gray(5)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Consider Gray Columns**: Note the positions of Gray (5) pixels which form partial vertical columns from top of grid.
3. **Transformation**:
    *   If a Red(2) is in a gray (5) column and above the horizontal gray bar: it remains at same position, other wise, it is moved right until it is next to the gray column.
    *   If a Red(2) is in a gray (5) column and below the horizontal gray bar: it is replace by a white(0).
    *    If a red(2) pixel is to the left of the gray (5) column and and above the horizontal gray bar, it is moved adjacent to the column by filling the pixels to its right and at same level with red(2) .
4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified red pixel positions, keeping all other pixels the same as the input.

Essentially, the Red pixels that are to the left and are above the horizontal grey line are shifted right toward next gray column, staying on the same row and filling positions at their right. The Red Pixels below the horizontal gray bar in the input are removed (turn white) in the output.
