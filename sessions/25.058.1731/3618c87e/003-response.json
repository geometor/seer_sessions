The input grid contains a blue pixel (1) and some gray pixels (5), with the rest being white (0). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input. The blue pixel seems to have moved, or influenced a change, and the gray pixels remain. The most obvious change is the position and context of the '1' and surrounding '5' pixels\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, replace the central gray pixel in the bottom row with the blue pixel.\n4.  **Maintain relative position of other gray pixels:** All gray pixels that *aren't* in the bottom row stay where they are.\n5. **Shift grey pixel up:** Take the '5' that was in the middle of the bottom row, and place it at the coordinates where the '1' previously was.\n\nIn simpler terms: Swap the blue pixel with the center gray pixel on the bottom row.\n"
