example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: single pixel
        coordinates: [(7, 4)]
      - color: gray
        shape: horizontal line
        coordinates: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]
  output:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: single pixel
        coordinates: [(9, 4)]
      - color: gray
        shape: modified horizontal line
        coordinates:  [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8,4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]
