Okay, here's my analysis of the first example pair, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most prominent colors are white (0), azure (8), green (3), red (2). There's a noticeable change involving the green (3) pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - name: dimensions
        value: 20x20 (observed in both input and output)
      - name: color_values
        value: integers 0-9

  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - name: color
        value: determined by integer value (0-9)
      - name: position
        value: row and column index

  - type: color_group
    description: contiguous block of one color
    properties:
      - color: int (0-9)
      - shape: any

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: extend a color_group.
    agent: green_color_group
    target: white area
    precondition:
       - green is adjacent to white
       - azure color group is not fully enclosed

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Two pixels are adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Locate all pixels with the value '3' (green).
2.  **Expansion Condition:** Check if any '3' pixels are adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to '0' (white) pixels, that is, an open area.
3. **Conditional replacement**: Find the largest azure (8) shape that is *not fully enclosed*.
4.  **Expansion:** Change the value of all '0' pixels that *are* adjacent to a '3' to the value of '3', if there are '3's adjacent to 0's.
5. Repeat 3-4 until there are no more '3' pixels adjacent to '0' pixel, within the open azure area.

The core concept appears to be a constrained "filling" or "expansion" of the green color (3) into adjacent white (0) areas. This is not a simple flood fill, as it appears that the azure (8) acts as a boundary, where only areas not fully enclosed by azure are open for expansion.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
