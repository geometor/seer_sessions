The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), green (3), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a selective \"filling\" operation, where certain colored objects are expanded based on adjacency. The azure (8) pixels seem to act like fixed boundaries in most cases, and green 3 and Red 2 may be the object that is to be filled/expanded.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
