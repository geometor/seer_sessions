The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), green (3), and red (2).  The most prominent change appears to be related to the green (3) pixels.  Azure (8) pixels seem largely unchanged, while red (2) and white (0) have very localized changes. It seems that green (3) objects are expanding, under certain constraints. The position of green (3) and red (2) may hold the key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
