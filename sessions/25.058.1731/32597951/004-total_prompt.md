Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). In the output, a new color, green (3), appears to be replacing some of the blue (1) pixels adjacent to the azure (8) pixels. The transformation seems to focus on the interaction between blue and azure regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      width: 17
      height: 17
      cells: pixels with integer values (0-9)
  - type: pixel_region
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - azure (8)
        - green (3)
      shape: irregular

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      target: blue (1)
      replacement: green (3)
      condition: adjacency to azure (8)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal)."
    between:
       - blue_pixels
       - azure_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels and blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each blue (1) pixel, determine if it is directly adjacent (shares a side, not a corner) to an azure (8) pixel.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If a blue (1) pixel is adjacent to an azure (8) pixel, change its color to green (3).
4.  **Output Grid:** Create the output grid with the modified pixel colors, leaving all other pixels unchanged.
5.  Only blue pixels that were changed to green in the previous step, are replaced.

In essence, the transformation rule is: "Replace blue pixels with green pixels if and only if the blue pixel is directly adjacent to an azure pixel."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
