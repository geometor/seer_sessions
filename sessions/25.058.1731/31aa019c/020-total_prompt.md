1.  **Object Detection:** Find "L-shaped" objects. An L-shaped object is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels with the same, non-zero color, with one additional pixel of that same color connected to any of the corner.
2. **Object Position:** The position of output is based on the corner of the 2x2 block.
3.  **Transformation:** Create a 3x3 block of pixels at the same position of the 2x2 corner identified. The central pixel will be color '3', and the surrounding pixels will be '2'. All other cells will be '0'.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and correctly identified the "L-shape" pattern and its transformation. However, the other training examples show that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. The core issue is that the rule is too specific, building a 3x3 pattern. It seems that the intent is not tied to the L, but to the 2x2 block within it.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the object detection and L-shape detection logic. The core assumption about the 2x2 block is good.
2.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine the examples where the code fails. Identify the *actual* transformation rule by comparing the input and expected output.
3.  **Generalize the Rule:** Modify the natural language program to describe a more general rule that covers all training examples. The rule will likely involve only using the 2x2 and not any additional 5th pixel.
4. **YAML documentation** Create a yaml document with facts and metrics for each image

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification)**
Here, will write python scripts to evaluate the results.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Object Detection:** Find all 2x2 blocks of pixels with the same, non-zero color.
2.  **Transformation:** Copy each identified 2x2 block of pixels to the output grid, maintaining its original position and color.  All other pixels in the output grid should be 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
