1. **Identify the Area of Interest:** Scan the input grid. The area of interest are all pixels that are non-zero and have at least one neighbor (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) that is non-zero.
2.  **Locate Subgrid:** If an area of interest is found, identify the bottom-right-most pixel, and define the 3x3 region in the output grid at that bottom right corner of the area of interest.
3. **Fill Output:** If no region is found, the output is all zeros. If it exists:

4.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid are set to 0.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal that the logic is too specific and doesn't generalize well to other cases. The core issue is the assumption that *all* non-zero pixels with non-zero neighbors define the region of interest and that the transformation always involves placing a 3x3 pattern at the bottom-rightmost point of this region. The other examples show variations in:

1.  **Trigger Condition:** The condition for applying the transformation isn't just about any non-zero pixel with neighbors. There's likely a more specific pattern or object being detected.
2.  **Output Pattern:** The output isn't always a 3x3 square with a specific color arrangement. It varies, possibly based on the shape or properties of the detected input pattern.
3. **Output Location:** The output location is not only bottom right, and seem related to the position of object in the input.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to shift our focus from individual pixels to identifying *objects* (contiguous regions of the same color).
2.  **Pattern Recognition:**  Instead of a broad "area of interest," we must look for specific shapes or configurations of objects within the input.
3.  **Contextual Output:** The output pattern and location are likely *dependent* on the identified input object's properties (shape, size, color, location).
4. **Iterative Refinement:** test the transform function after each iteration.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's an analysis of each example, including the use of `code_execution` to verify observations:

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_grid = np.array(predicted_grid)

    input_objects = find_objects(input_grid)
    output_objects = find_objects(output_grid)
    predicted_objects = find_objects(predicted_grid)
    
    print("Input Objects:")
    for obj_id, obj_data in input_objects.items():
        print(f"  Object {obj_id}: Color={obj_data['color']}, Pixels={obj_data['pixels']}")

    print("\nOutput Objects:")
    for obj_id, obj_data in output_objects.items():
        print(f"  Object {obj_id}: Color={obj_data['color']}, Pixels={obj_data['pixels']}")

    print("\nPredicted Objects:")
    for obj_id, obj_data in predicted_objects.items():
        print(f"  Object {obj_id}: Color={obj_data['color']}, Pixels={obj_data['pixels']}")

    print(f"Correct Prediction: {np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)}")

def find_objects(grid):
    """
    Identifies distinct objects in a grid.  An object is a set of connected pixels of the same color.
    """
    objects = {}
    visited = set()
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    def dfs(r, c, color, object_id):
        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols) or grid[r, c] != color:
            return
        visited.add((r, c))
        objects[object_id]['pixels'].append((r, c))
        dfs(r + 1, c, color, object_id)
        dfs(r - 1, c, color, object_id)
        dfs(r, c + 1, color, object_id)
        dfs(r, c - 1, color, object_id)

    object_id = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r, c] != 0:
                objects[object_id] = {'color': grid[r, c], 'pixels': []}
                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], object_id)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Object Detection:** Find "L-shaped" objects. An L-shaped object is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels with the same, non-zero color, with one additional pixel of that same color connected to any of the corner.
2. **Object Position:** The position of output is based on the corner of the 2x2 block.
3.  **Transformation:** Create a 3x3 block of pixels at the same position of the 2x2 corner identified. The central pixel will be color '3', and the surrounding pixels will be '2'. All other cells will be '0'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
