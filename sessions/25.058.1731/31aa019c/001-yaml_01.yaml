objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: colored_pixels
    type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
       - colors: List[integer]
       - locations: List[tuple(row,col)]

actions:
  - name: identify_cluster
    input: input_grid
    output: colored_pixels
    description: Finds the largest contiguous cluster of non-white pixels.
  - name: transform_cluster
    input: colored_pixels
    output: output_grid
    description:  Creates a new grid, replaces the clustered pixels with red (2) except one and clears all others.
  - name: select_center_pixel
    input: colored_pixels
    output: tuple(row,col)
    description: finds a pixel, usually colored, inside the cluster

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency (pixels in the cluster are adjacent)
  - type: transformation
    relation: input_grid is transformed to output_grid by isolating and recoloring a color cluster.
