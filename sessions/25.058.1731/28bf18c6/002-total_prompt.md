**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids are larger (8x8) and contain a contiguous "blob" of a single non-zero color (azure, red, or blue in the examples).  The output grids are smaller (3x6 or 6x3) and seem to be a compressed, re-arranged representation of the non-zero colored pixels from the input. The output grid consistently has three rows and it alternates colors in columns. Zeros are present in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 8x8, output grids have three rows with varying lengths (e.g. 6x3, 3x6).
  - object_type: Input grid: Contains a single contiguous region of non-zero pixels (an "object").
  - object_color: The color of the "object" varies (azure, red, blue).
  - background_color: The background of both input and output is always color 0 (white).
  - transformation_type: Compression and rearrangement of the input "object".
  - output_structure: Alternating columns of the object's color and 0 (white).
  - spatial_relation: The object in the output maintains a relationship to the original object's shape and position, but is compressed.
  - color_consistency:  The non-zero color in the output matches the color of the "object" in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero colored pixels within the input grid. Note the color of this object.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with three rows. The length should correspond to twice number of rows/columns the input object occupied.
3. **Process by rows:** Check first if color pixels present. If so place the object color in the first column, and color `0` (white) in the next column. Proceed to place the object color and a zero alternatively until all object pixels present in the row are processed. If color pixels are not present, process next row.
4. **Repeat** for the rest of the input rows.
5. **Return** the final processed grid.

In summary, the transformation extracts the contiguous non-zero colored "object" from the input grid and represents it in a compressed, alternating-column format in the output grid. The crucial aspects are identifying the object, its color, and rearranging its pixels while preserving a compressed trace of its original shape within the alternating color/white columns of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
