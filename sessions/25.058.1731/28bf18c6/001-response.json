            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids are larger (8x8) and contain a contiguous \"blob\" of a single non-zero color (azure, red, or blue in the examples).  The output grids are smaller (3x6 or 6x3) and seem to be a compressed, re-arranged representation of the non-zero colored pixels from the input. The output grid consistently has three rows and it alternates colors in columns. Zeros are present in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Input grids are 8x8, output grids have three rows with varying lengths (e.g. 6x3, 3x6).\n  - object_type: Input grid: Contains a single contiguous region of non-zero pixels (an \"object\").\n  - object_color: The color of the \"object\" varies (azure, red, blue).\n  - background_color: The background of both input and output is always color 0 (white).\n  - transformation_type: Compression and rearrangement of the input \"object\".\n  - output_structure: Alternating columns of the object's color and 0 (white).\n  - spatial_relation: The object in the output maintains a relationship to the original object's shape and position, but is compressed.\n  - color_consistency:  The non-zero color in the output matches the color of the \"object\" in the input.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero colored pixels within the input grid. Note the color of this object.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with three rows. The length should correspond to twice number of rows/columns the input object occupied.\n3. **Process by rows:** Check first if color pixels present. If so place the object color in the first column, and color `0` (white) in the next column. Proceed to place the object color and a zero alternatively until all object pixels present in the row are processed. If color pixels are not present, process next row.\n4. **Repeat** for the rest of the input rows.\n5. **Return** the final processed grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts the contiguous non-zero colored \"object\" from the input grid and represents it in a compressed, alternating-column format in the output grid. The crucial aspects are identifying the object, its color, and rearranging its pixels while preserving a compressed trace of its original shape within the alternating color/white columns of the output.\n"
