Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the regions of red (2) pixels at the top right, azure (8) pixels on the left and bottom, and white (0) pixels in the rest of the grid.

2.  **Define Green Region Boundaries:**
    *   Find the inner most azure pixels, this can be done by checking pixels with azure value that has white pixel neighbor
    *   Starting on the 4th row from top and 4th column from left. Fill area with green until the 9th row and 9th column. There is an interruption.

3. Replace: All white pixels inside the rectangle will be green color, except those are next to red pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured the core idea of filling a region with green, bounded by azure and avoiding areas adjacent to red. However, the specifics of the green region's boundaries and the handling of the "interruption" (presumably the area near the red pixels) need adjustment based on all training examples, not just the first. The current code seems overly specific to the first example and fails to generalize correctly. A key observation across examples is an irregular boundary.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Re-examine Boundaries:** Instead of fixed row/column limits (like 3 to 9), we need a more dynamic way to define the green region's boundaries. The azure pixels provide one boundary, but the start/end points within that boundary vary.
2.  **Handle Red Pixels Consistently:**  The rule to avoid filling next to red pixels is correct, but we need to make sure it is implemented correctly.
3.  **Object Definition:** We should explicitly consider the azure outline as single "object" bounding the green and red regions.
4.  **Iterative boundary determination**: rather than using a fixed offset from the edges, or finding "inner" azure pixels, consider how the boundary should be determined based on the other objects

**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` when needed):**

Let's verify the output and identify failures:

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_boundary
    color: azure (8)
    description: An irregular outline shape enclosing other objects.
    properties:
      - contiguous: true

  - name: red_region
    color: red (2)
    description:  A small region within the azure boundary, located near the edge.
    properties:
      - contiguous: true

  - name: green_region
    color: green (3)
    description: Fills the area enclosed by the azure boundary, excluding cells adjacent to the red region.
    properties:
       - contiguous: true

actions:
  - name: fill_green
    target: green_region
    description: >
      The area inside the azure boundary is filled with green,
       but any white pixel adjacent to red pixels remains unchanged.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify three distinct objects: an irregular "azure\_boundary" (color 8), a "red\_region" (color 2), and a "green\_region" (color 3) that will be created.

2.  **Fill Inside Boundary:** Fill the area enclosed by the `azure_boundary` with green (color 3) to create the `green_region`.

3.  **Red Exclusion:** During the fill operation, any white pixel (color 0) that is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel in the `red_region` is *not* filled with green. It remains unchanged.

The critical update is that the green region isn't defined by fixed coordinates but rather by the *enclosure* of the azure boundary, with a specific exclusion rule for cells near the red region. This description emphasizes the relationship between objects and avoids hardcoded indices.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
