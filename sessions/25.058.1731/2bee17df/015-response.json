The right most column is all red(2). The lower right and lower left corners contains additional red(2) cells, connected to the rightmost red(2) column.\n*  The output maintains the overall structure, the right most column and lower connected parts are unchanged.\n*  Some, but not all, of the white (0) pixels in the input have become green (3) in the output. It seems likely that the change is related to position relative to the surrounding blue and red regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The transformation starts on row 6, where white cells adjacent to azure cells become green.\n"
