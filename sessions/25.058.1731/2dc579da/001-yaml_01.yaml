facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colors present in the input grids.
  - observation: The background is filled with a consistent repeating color.
  - observation: The background color is removed
  - observation:  The lines and rows with only the background color are removed
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5, 7x7, 11x11)
      - content: 2D array of color values (integers 0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: smaller than input_grid
      - content: 2D array of color values (subset of input_grid)
  - action: filtering
    description: Selectively extracts elements from input_grid based on color and position.
  - relationship: output_grid is a filtered version of input_grid.
  - rule: "Only the values that are not the background color of any lines are kept"
