Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 7x7 grid.
*   The output is a 3x3 grid.
*   The input grid has a cross of red (2) pixels, with a single blue (1) pixel, and the rest are yellow (4).
*   The output grid appears to be a zoomed-in section of the input, specifically centered around the blue (1) pixel.
*   The red cross is completely removed in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - color: yellow  # value 4
        count: 40
      - color: red    # value 2
        count: 8
      - color: blue   # value 1
        count: 1
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: yellow #value 4
        count: 8
      - color: blue # value 1
        count: 1

relations:
  - type: spatial
    description: output_grid is a sub-region of input_grid
    focus: blue pixel (1) in input_grid serves as the center for selection of the output_grid

actions:
 - type: selection
   description: A 3x3 region is selected from the input grid.
   criteria: centered around the blue pixel
 - type: removal
   description: all red pixels are removed
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Target:** Find the single blue (1) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Define the Region:** Create a 3x3 window centered on the blue pixel. If the blue pixel is on the edge, the window will still be 3x3 and go out of bounds on the input array.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the pixels within this 3x3 window.
4. **Output**: Output is the extracted 3x3 region.

Essentially, the transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered on the blue pixel from the input grid.
