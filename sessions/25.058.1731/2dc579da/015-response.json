The crop is centered on the azure pixel. Therefore, the boundaries are two rows/columns above, below, to the left, and to the right of the azure pixel.\n3.  **Exclude Blue Region**: The output grid excludes everything that's on the blue \"+\" shape.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create the 5x5 output based on the crop dimensions and the position of the azure pixel.\n5. **Crop:** Extract the pixels within the calculated boundaries from the input grid, constructing the output grid.\n\nIn simpler terms: Find the azure pixel. Crop a 5x5 square centered on it, excluding any pixels that were a part of the blue cross in the original image.\n"
