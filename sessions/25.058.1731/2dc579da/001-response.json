The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids, and they seem to retain only specific colors or patterns, while discarding others. The position of retained elements seems relevant. There seems to be an \"ignore\" color/value that forms the \"background\", and only the unique/infrequent colors from the \"foreground\" are copied. It looks like any lines of just background are discarded.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
