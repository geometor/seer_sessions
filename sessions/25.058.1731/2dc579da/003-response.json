The colors in the input grid are predominantly azure (8), with some green (3) and one yellow (4). The output grid seems to retain only the azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels, and in a very reduced format. The green (3) seems to disappear completely. The positions of azure and yellow in the output grid *seem* related to the location of the yellow in the input grid - bottom left corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Its position (row, column) is significant.\n3. **Extract subgrid:** Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid. The yellow pixel should be in the bottom-left corner of this subgrid, so use its position as the starting point of extraction.\n4.  **Filter colors:** Remove all green pixels. Only the azure and yellow colors found from the selected area should remain in the output.\n5.  **Construct the output:** Create the 2x2 output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the remaining azure and yellow pixels, from the area extracted from the input.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a 2x2 region from the lower-left corner of the input grid, defined by the position of a single yellow pixel, and filters out all pixels of the color green, and any other pixel color besides the yellow and azure.\n"
