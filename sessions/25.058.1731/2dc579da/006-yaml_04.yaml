  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: 2x2
      - derived from: input_grid
      - position: relative to yellow_pixel
  - action: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, yellow_pixel_coordinates
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts a 2x2 subgrid from the input grid, starting at the yellow pixel's location. If a subgrid of 2x2 cannot be created because of the grid boundaries, fill the missing elements with azure(8).
