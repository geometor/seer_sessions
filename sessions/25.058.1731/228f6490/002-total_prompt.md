<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x1330 at 0x7C360BFEB450>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer representing a color. The input grids appear to have distinct regions or "objects" of different colors. The transformation seems to involve swapping the colors of some of these objects based on some criteria. The background color seems to be consistently 0 (white) or 5(grey).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing the color.
      - shape: The shape formed by the contiguous region.
      - position: Location within the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: Color swapping between objects.
    properties:
      - trigger: The rule, potentially based on spatial position, shape, or relative positioning of colored object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of the same color. Consider these regions as distinct objects.
2.  **Find Swap Candidates:** Within the identified objects, find pairs according to a consistent rule between all three pairs.
3. **Color Swap**: In each input grid, two groups of pixels are exchanging color, with the colors not changing, i.e. color1 becomes color2 and color2 becomes color1. Looking at train\_1, color 8 becomes color 6, and color 6 becomes color 8. train\_2, color 3 becomes color 9, and color 9 becomes color 3, and in train\_3, color 2 becomes color 8, and color 8 becomes color 2.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid. The rule is to identify color pairs. The rest of the input pixels are unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
