The presence of other colored pixels doesn't prevent the transformation of the grey objects, but grey objects are only transformed if they are in either the top-left or bottom-right quadrants.\n\n1.  **Identify Grey Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of grey pixels (color 5).\n2.  **Determine Quadrant and Transform:** For each grey object:\n    *   Determine if the object is in the top-left or bottom-right quadrant of the grid.  The quadrant is determined by calculating the average row and column of the object's pixels and comparing this to the *inclusive* center of the grid. The center is inclusive, that is, it belongs to both sides, top and bottom, left and right.\n    *   Identify the \"inner\" pixels of the grey object. \"Inner\" pixels are grey pixels with at least three grey neighbors (including diagonals).\n    *   If in the top-left quadrant, change inner pixels to green (3).\n    *   If in the bottom-right quadrant, change inner pixels to maroon (9).\n3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels of other colors remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_grey_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous objects of grey color (5) in a grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != 5):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row + 1, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row + 1, col - 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col - 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] == 5:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\n\ndef get_quadrant(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Determine the quadrant of an object within the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input numpy array.\n        object_pixels: list of (row,col) pixels\n\n    Returns: quadrant \"top_left\", \"top_right\", \"bottom_left\", \"bottom_right\"\n    \"\"\"\n    center_row = grid.shape[0] / 2\n    center_col = grid.shape[1] / 2\n    \n    # find the \"average\" or representative row,col for the object\n    total_row = 0\n    total_col = 0\n    for r,c in object_pixels:\n        total_row += r\n        total_col += c\n    avg_row = total_row / len(object_pixels)\n    avg_col = total_col / len(object_pixels)    \n\n    if avg_row < center_row and avg_col < center_col:\n        return \"top_left\"\n    elif avg_row < center_row and avg_col >= center_col:\n        return \"top_right\"\n    elif avg_row >= center_row and avg_col < center_col:\n        return \"bottom_left\"\n    elif avg_row >= center_row and avg_col >= center_col:\n        return \"bottom_right\"\n    \n    return \"unknown\"  # Should not normally happen\n\ndef find_inner_pixels(object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the inner pixels of a grey object.
