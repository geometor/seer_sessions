The input grids contain gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grids introduce red (2) pixels while retaining some of the gray and white pixels from the input. The transformation appears to involve a direct mapping or substitution of some white pixels to red based on the position of gray pixels. The gray (5) pixels appear unchanged in their x,y position.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Change this pixel's value to 2 (red) in the corresponding position within the output grid.\n4. Gray pixels positions remains unchaged.\n5.  **Preserve other values:** All other pixel values and positions that do not meet the above criteria remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n\nIn simpler terms: Wherever there's a gray pixel in the input, put a red pixel in the same column on all rows that have any grey pixels. The gray pixels remain unchanged.\n"
