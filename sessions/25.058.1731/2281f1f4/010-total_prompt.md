Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 10x10 grid. The input grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces red (2) pixels while retaining some of the original gray and white pixels. The red pixels appear to be related to the position of grey. The positions of red cells form horizontal lines within areas that have the shape of a row of grey cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - gray (5)
      - red (2)

actions:
  - type: replace
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: red (2)
    condition: "adjacent to gray pixels horizontally"

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: "Red pixels are horizontally adjacent to where gray pixels were, maintaining original vertical position"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** For each row, examine the white pixels (0) that are within columns between gray cells.
3. **color Change:** For each row, replace the white pixels, that are located withing colums that contain a grey, with red (2) pixels .
4. Maintain the y position of pixels.

In essence, the transformation identifies horizontal ranges defined by gray pixels in each row. Within these horizontal ranges, excluding grey pixels, white pixels are replaced with red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
