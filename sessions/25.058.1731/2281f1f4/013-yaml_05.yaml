objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Colors
  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - name: horizontal_range
    type: segment
    properties:
      - start: (row, column)
      - end: (row, column)
      - bounded_by: [gray pixel, gray pixel]

actions:
  - name: identify_range
    input: [row]
    output: horizontal_range
    description: Find a horizontal range in a row bounded by gray pixels.
  - name: replace_color
    input: [horizontal_range, old_color, new_color]
    output: modified_row
    description: Replace pixels of old_color with new_color within the horizontal range.

constraints:
  - A horizontal range must be bounded by at least two gray pixels.
  - color replacement only occurs between grey pixels.
  - color replacement only changes white pixels to red.
