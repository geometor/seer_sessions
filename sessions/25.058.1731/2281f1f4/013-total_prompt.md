Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies horizontal ranges defined by gray pixels in each row. Within these horizontal ranges, excluding grey pixels, white pixels are replaced with red pixels. The transformation occurs only if a row contains at least two gray pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    for r in range(rows):
        # Find gray pixel indices in the current row
        gray_indices = np.where(input_grid[r] == 5)[0]

        # Check if there are at least two gray pixels
        if len(gray_indices) >= 2:
            #get the start of range
            start = gray_indices[0]

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
