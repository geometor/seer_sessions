```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Border:** Find all pixels along the edges (top, bottom, left, and right) of the input grid that have a non-zero color. These pixels constitute the "border."
2. **Check for solid border and infill:** If and only if the border is a solid gray (color 5) border that extends around the entire perimeter of the grid, then infill one step diagonally up and to the right of the bottom-left corner with blue color(1). If there isn't a solid border, do not perform any actions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
