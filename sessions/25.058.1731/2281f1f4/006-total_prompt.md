Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the positions of all gray (5) pixels in the input grid. These positions remain unchanged.
2. Identify rows that contain at least one gray pixel.
3. Identify columns that contain at least one gray pixel.
4. Within these identified rows and columns, change the color of white (0) pixels to red (2).
5. All other white pixels remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules."""

    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows_with_gray = set()
    cols_with_gray = set()

    # Find rows and cols with gray pixels
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r, c] == 5:
                rows_with_gray.add(r)
                cols_with_gray.add(c)

    # change white pixels to red in the target row and column
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r,c] == 0:
                if r in rows_with_gray and c in cols_with_gray:
                  output_grid[r,c] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of using gray pixels as anchors for changing white pixels to red. However, the initial rule was too restrictive. It only changed white pixels to red if they were BOTH in a row AND a column containing a gray pixel. The test results clearly show that this is not always the case. Some white pixels change to red if in the same row *or* column.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Careful Observation**: Examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to *which* white pixels change to red and their relationship to the gray pixels.
2. **Rule Modification**: Adjust the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed relationship (row OR column).
3. **Code Update (Next Phase)**:  The updated natural language program will guide the generation of revised code.
4. **Verification**: The future version of the program will be verified against all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand, I am creating a report about each of the examples, using
`get_report` to extract details that will help assess the transformation.

```tool_code
def get_report(grid_in, grid_out):
    """
    Generates a report comparing input and output grids, focusing on changes and gray pixel positions.
    """
    report = {}

    # Convert to numpy arrays for easier processing
    grid_in = np.array(grid_in)
    grid_out = np.array(grid_out)

    # Dimensions
    report['input_shape'] = grid_in.shape
    report['output_shape'] = grid_out.shape

    # Find gray pixel positions in the input
    gray_pixels_in = np.argwhere(grid_in == 5)
    report['gray_pixels_input'] = gray_pixels_in.tolist()

    # Changes from white (0) to red (2)
    changes = np.argwhere((grid_in == 0) & (grid_out == 2))
    report['white_to_red_changes'] = changes.tolist()
    
    report['num_white_pixels_input'] = np.sum(grid_in == 0)
    report['num_red_pixels_output'] = np.sum(grid_out == 2)

    return report

# Example usage for each training pair
reports = []
for i in range(len(task_data['train'])):
  input_grid = task_data['train'][i]['input']
  output_grid = task_data['train'][i]['output']
  reports.append(get_report(input_grid, output_grid))

for i, report in enumerate(reports):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    for key, value in report.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
