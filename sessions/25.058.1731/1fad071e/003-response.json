The output is a 1x5 grid, also of single-digit integers, which seem to be a highly compressed summary of the input. The significant reduction in size and change in shape is the primary characteristic of the transformation. Colors (represented by digits) present in the input are also present in the output, although frequency seems significantly altered. There seems to be a preference for outputting color values found on the edges or corners of shapes within the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
