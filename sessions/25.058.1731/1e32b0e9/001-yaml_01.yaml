objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 17
      - width: 17
      - cells: pixels with integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - type: cross
    properties:
      - color: varies (azure, red, blue) across examples
      - shape: "+" spanning the grid
      - position: centered

  - type: other_shapes
    properties:
      - colors: varies, different from the cross color
      - shape: irregular, often contiguous blocks
      - position: typically adjacent to or near the cross, but not on it

actions:
  - type: extend
    description:  Non-cross colored pixels extend horizontally along their row, filling cells between them and cross
    constraints:
      - only applies to colors different than the cross
      - extension happens only within the row
      - extension happens bidirectionally, or until edges
