    description: >-
      Expands blue color from green pixels, but only if certain conditions
      are met.

      - Vertical expansion if a blue pixel exists *anywhere* below the green pixel in the same column.
      - Horizontal expansion if a blue pixel exists *anywhere* to the right of the green pixel in the same row.
      - Stops at edges of the grid or a non-zero pixel, unless part of the final shape.
