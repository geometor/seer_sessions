Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of expansion. However, the test results reveal several crucial errors:

1.  **Incorrect Stopping Condition:** The expansion stops at *any* non-zero pixel, but it should only stop at non-zero pixels that are not part of the final expanded blue shape. This implies a need for a mechanism to determine the "final" shape before or during expansion. The current iterative approach is causing the expansion to stop prematurely.

2.  **Green Pixel Expansion Logic:** The green pixel conditional expansion logic is correct: it checks for the *existence* of a blue pixel somewhere below (for vertical expansion) or to the right (for horizontal expansion) in the same column/row. The provided code correctly implements this logic.

3.  **Order of Operations**: Currently the operations are performed sequentially, first blue expansion, then green. This may not be the correct order.

The strategy to address these errors involves reconsidering the core logic of the expansion. Instead of iterative expansion, we should try to define the target region for blue expansion *before* actually filling it in.  The key idea is that green pixels "activate" entire rows/columns for blue filling *if* certain conditions are met.  We need to capture these regions based on the positions of green and blue pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and provided example results)**

Here's a summary combining visual inspection of examples and analysis of the code behavior:

*   **Example 1 (Correct):** The code works as expected, filling the entire row and column of the blue pixel, and the rows/columns activated by the green pixels.

*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):**  The blue pixel expands correctly. The upper green pixel expands vertically correctly (because there is blue below). However, it fails to expand horizontally, it is missing blue to the right. The lower green pixel does not expand, it needs a blue pixel to the right.

* **Example 3 (Incorrect):** The code doesn't perform any expansions, the original and output are identical. The left most green pixel on the first row should expand horizontally because of the blue pixel to the right. The green pixel in the 4th row should expand up and down because there is a blue below.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - blue (1)
        - green (3)
        - black (0)  # Background, implicitly
      position: [row, col]  # Row and column index
    roles:
      - seed:  # Initiates expansion
          - blue
          - green

actions:
  - name: expand_blue
    description: Expands blue color from blue pixels.
    constraints:
      - Expands horizontally and vertically.
      - Stops at the edges of the grid or a non-zero pixel, unless that non-zero is part of the final shape.

  - name: conditional_expand_blue # More descriptive
    description: >-
      Expands blue color from green pixels, but only if certain conditions
      are met.
    constraints:
      - Vertical expansion if a blue pixel exists *anywhere* below the green pixel in the same column.
      - Horizontal expansion if a blue pixel exists *anywhere* to the right of the green pixel in the same row.
      - Stops at edges of the grid or a non-zero pixel, unless part of the final shape.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Blue Pixel Expansion:**  Blue pixels initiate a full expansion of blue color both horizontally and vertically, covering the entire row and column they occupy.

2.  **Green Pixel Conditional Activation:** Green pixels *activate* the row they are on and the column they are on for potential blue filling.

3. **Green Pixel Vertical Expansion:** A green pixel will cause its *entire column* to be filled with blue *if and only if* there is at least one blue pixel anywhere below it in that column.

4. **Green Pixel Horizontal Expansion:**  A green pixel will cause its *entire row* to be filled with blue *if and only if* there is at least one blue pixel anywhere to the right of it in that row.

5. **Combining:** Where expansions from blue and green pixels overlap, the overlapping area remains blue. The fill color is always blue.

6. **Boundaries:** Expansions stop at the edges of the grid.
