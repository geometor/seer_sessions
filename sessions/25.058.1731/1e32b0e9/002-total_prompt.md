<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3344x2226 at 0x7C36039E5450>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on identifying the underlying logic and expressing it as a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The most prominent visual feature is a cross-shaped pattern formed by a single color (e.g., azure in the first example, red in the second, blue in the third). This cross consistently spans the entire height and width of the grid, centered. There are other colors present, which seem to form smaller, potentially connected shapes, often located near, but not on, the main cross. The transformation appears to involve altering or "extending" those non-cross colors along rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 17
      - width: 17
      - cells: pixels with integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - type: cross
    properties:
      - color: varies (azure, red, blue) across examples
      - shape: "+" spanning the grid
      - position: centered

  - type: other_shapes
    properties:
      - colors: varies, different from the cross color
      - shape: irregular, often contiguous blocks
      - position: typically adjacent to or near the cross, but not on it

actions:
  - type: extend
    description:  Non-cross colored pixels extend horizontally along their row, filling cells between them and cross
    constraints:
      - only applies to colors different than the cross
      - extension happens only within the row
      - extension happens bidirectionally, or until edges
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Cross:** Locate the central, cross-shaped pattern spanning the grid. Note its color.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** For each row in the grid:
3. **Identify Target Pixels:** Find pixels *within the current row* that have a color *different* from the cross' color.
4. **Extend Target Pixels:**  if there are multiple pixels with the same color: connect all pixels of the target color within that row and the cross by filling the spaces between. It seems that the cross color will always be found within this range.

In simpler terms: The transformation takes any colored shapes (not part of the central cross) and stretches them horizontally within their respective rows, connecting any blocks of that same colour, and the cross.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
