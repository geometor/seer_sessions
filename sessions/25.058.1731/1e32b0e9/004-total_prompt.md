Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (8), and red (2). There are horizontal and vertical lines, as well as larger rectangular blocks. The transformation seems to involve the blue (8) pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red]
      - shapes: [lines, rectangles]
  - type: horizontal_line
    color: blue
  - type: vertical_line
    color: blue
  - type: rectangle
    color: red
    properties:
      - filled: true
  - type: rectangle
      color: blue
      properties:
          - filled: true
actions:
  - name: extend
    object: blue lines
    description: Extends blue pixels horizontally and/or vertically to adjacent azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels that form horizontal or vertical lines within the grid.

2.  **Locate** azure (8) pixels that are adjacent, either vertically or horizontally, to the ends of the existing azure lines and next to white pixels.

3.  **Change** the color of the white (0) pixel to azure (8)

4. Repeat steps 2&3 until no more pixels can be changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
