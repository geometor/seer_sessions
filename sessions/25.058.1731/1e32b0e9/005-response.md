Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extend azure (color 8) lines horizontally and vertically, one step at a time, wherever they neighbor white (color 0). However, the results show that not just any line is changed, but only those that are not part of a solid block of color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Accurate Observation:** We need to first identify the specific conditions where azure pixels are extended and when they are not.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Clearly define the initial state, how the transformations happen, and the ending state.
3. **Update Code and Iterate:** Adjust the code to improve accuracy, testing with all available training examples and using the test cases only at the end.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the results better, I'll analyze each example pair:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x6 grid with horizontal and vertical azure lines.
    *   Output: Azure lines are extended where they border white.
    *   Result: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *    Input: 10x10 with single azure pixels and lines in the input.
    *   Output: Azure extended correctly
    *   Result: Correct
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 6x6 grid with horizontal and vertical azure lines, and a 2x2 azure square.
    *   Output: Only single-pixel wide azure lines are extended. The 2x2 square is not.
    *   Result: Correct.

            initial_state: Single-pixel wide lines and a solid 2x2 block.
            transformations:
              - type: Extension
                direction: Adjacent to white pixels.
                details: Only single-pixel wide lines extend. The 2x2 square does not change.
            final_state: Extended single-pixel lines; unchanged 2x2 square.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Lines and Blocks:** Examine the input grid to find azure (color 8) pixels. Classify connected azure pixels as either "lines" (if they are only one pixel wide in either the horizontal or vertical direction) or "blocks" (if they are more than one pixel wide in both directions).
2.  **Extend Azure Lines:** Extend azure lines, one pixel at a time, where each extended segment is adjacent to a white pixel (color 0).
3.  **Iterate extension**: Repeat extension of the azure lines until no more extensions can be made.
4. **Preserve Azure Blocks** Azure blocks are not changed.
5.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of the iterative extension of azure lines.
