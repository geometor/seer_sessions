            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program and supporting information.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly copies the input grid and adds two azure pixels to the top-left and bottom-right corners. However, the problem arises in how it positions the azure pixels in the top left. It works for grids where there is an object at (0,0) and (0,1), but it overwrites existing pixels when the object's origin is further from the corners. The core issue is that the placement should be relative to the existing non-white object, not *always* at `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`. Instead the azure pixels should be added adjacent to, but not overwriting, an existing non-white object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-White Objects:** We need to find the bounding box of the non-white pixels in the input grid. This will define the \"object\" to which we'll add the azure pixels.\n2.  **Relative Positioning:** The azure pixels should be placed adjacent to this bounding box.\n3. **Handle edge cases** No changes are needed if the identified object already includes pixels that would meet the adjacency condition.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics (using a conceptual approach since I can't execute code directly):**\n\nLet's examine the provided image and code. I'll describe what *would* happen if I could execute code and what information I would gather. I'll create the YAML and natural language program assuming this conceptual execution.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Non-white object bounding box (conceptual): (0,0) to (1,1)\n    *   Expected Azure Placement:  Correctly placed in provided transform.\n    *   Result: `Correct`\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 5x5\n    *   Non-white object bounding box (conceptual): (2,2) to (3,3)\n    *   Expected Azure Placement (Top-Left):  (1,2) and (2,1) and similar.\n    *   Provided Transform Azure Placement: (0,0), (1,0) and (4,4), (3,4). Incorrect.\n    *   Result: `Incorrect` - Mismatched pixels at many locations.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 7x9\n    *   Output Shape: 7x9\n    *   Non-white object bounding box (conceptual): (2,3) to (4,6)\n    *   Expected Azure Placement (Top-Left): (1,3) and (2,2) - and similar.\n    *   Provided Transform Azure Placement: (0,0), (1,0) and (6,8), (5,8). Incorrect.\n    *   Result: `Incorrect` - Mismatched pixels at many locations.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_set: train\n    objects:\n      - description: \"Main object\"\n        type: \"contiguous non-white region\"\n        properties:\n          - bounding_box: \"Defined by min/max row and col of non-white pixels\"\n      - description: \"Added pixels\"\n        type: \"azure pixels\"\n        properties:\n          - color: azure (8)\n          - quantity: 4\n          - placement: \"Two adjacent to top-left of main object, two adjacent to bottom-right of main object\"\n    actions:\n      - description: \"Locate main object\"\n        method: \"Find bounding box of non-white pixels\"\n      - description: \"Add azure pixels\"\n        method: \"Place two pixels adjacent to the top-left and two adjacent to bottom right of bounding box\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy:** Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Object:** Find the bounding box of the contiguous non-white region (the \"main object\") in the input grid.\n3.  **Add Azure Pixels (Top-Left):** Place two azure (8) pixels adjacent to the top-left corner of the main object's bounding box. One pixel should be directly above the top-most row of the bounding box and aligned with it's left-most column. The other should be directly to the left of the bounding box's left-most column and aligned with its top-most row.\n4.  **Add Azure Pixels (Bottom-Right):** Place two azure (8) pixels adjacent to the bottom-right corner of the main object's bounding box. One pixel should be directly below the bottom-most row of the bounding box, aligned with the bounding box's right-most column. The other pixel should be directly to the right of the right-most column, aligned with the bottom-most row of the bounding box.\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:** If the object to be placed already exist, then no action is required.\n\nThis revised natural language program and the YAML facts provide a more accurate and complete description of the transformation, taking into account the need for relative positioning of the added azure pixels.\n"
