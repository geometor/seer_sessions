Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are green (3) and azure (8). White (0) represents the background. The transformation seems to involve some kind of reflection or mirroring of the green objects, and introducing azure in specific locations relative to the original green objects. The azure pixels appear outside the bounding box of the original green objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_objects
    color: green (3)
    description: Contiguous blocks of green pixels. Can be single pixels or 2x2 squares.
  - id: azure_objects
    color: azure (8)
    description: Appear in the output grid, seemingly related to the position of green objects.
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The empty space in the grids.

actions:
  - name: reflect_and_shift
    description:  The green objects aren't directly mirrored.  Instead, the position of azure pixels are determined relative to the green ones. The green objects do not change. New azure elements appear.

relationships:
  - object1: green_objects
    object2: azure_objects
    relation:  Azure pixels appear at a 45-degree diagonal "reflection" of each green object. They appear to be placed on an opposite corner of bounding box.
    details:
        - If a green pixel is at (r, c), an azure is created at the opposite end of a line.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Bounding Box:** For each contiguous group of green pixels, construct an axis-aligned bounding box that completely encloses it. Note: In this example, the green shapes are either a single pixel or a 2x2 square.

3. **Place Azure Pixels based on the bounding box corners**: For a single green pixel at row `r` and column `c`, place an azure pixel(8) in the row before `r-1` and column before `c-1`, as well as at row after `r+1` and column after `c+1`

4. **Place Azure Pixels based on the bounding box corners**: for the example of the 2x2 shape, consider opposite corners. Find azure pixels such that if the green corner pixels were extended, they would intersect the existing azure.

5.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the original green pixels and the newly placed azure pixels.
