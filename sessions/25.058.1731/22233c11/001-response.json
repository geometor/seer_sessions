White (0) represents the background. The transformation seems to involve some kind of reflection or mirroring of the green objects, and introducing azure in specific locations relative to the original green objects. The azure pixels appear outside the bounding box of the original green objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note: In this example, the green shapes are either a single pixel or a 2x2 square.\n\n3. **Place Azure Pixels based on the bounding box corners**: For a single green pixel at row `r` and column `c`, place an azure pixel(8) in the row before `r-1` and column before `c-1`, as well as at row after `r+1` and column after `c+1`\n\n4. **Place Azure Pixels based on the bounding box corners**: for the example of the 2x2 shape, consider opposite corners. Find azure pixels such that if the green corner pixels were extended, they would intersect the existing azure.\n\n5.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the original green pixels and the newly placed azure pixels.\n"
