Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block summarizing the facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 10x10 grids. The input grid contains green (3) pixels, while the output grid contains the original green pixels and adds some azure (8) pixels. The azure pixels seem to appear in locations related to the empty spaces between the green pixels. Specifically it creates azure pixels that are diagonal to each other.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - green (3)
        - azure (8)
        - white (0)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10

actions:
  - name: add_diagonal_fill
    input: green pixels
    output: adds azure pixels diagonally between green pixel pairs
    conditions:
      - green pixel pair are active

relationships:
   - green pixels and added diagonal azure pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are colored green (value 3).
2.  **Check for diagonal pairs:** see it the green pixels can be added diagonally
3.  **Place Azure Diagonally:** If the diagonal is free, place an azure pixel.
4.  **Maintain original:** all original pixels should remain the same


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
