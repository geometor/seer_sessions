Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Copy Green Pixels: Copy all pixels with the value '3' (green) from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.
2. Place Azure Pixels Diagonally: For each green pixel in the input grid, if an azure pixel can be placed at the following offsets, place an azure pixel in the output grid:
    *   +1 row, -2 column and -1 row, +2 columns.
    *  In other words, place an Azure pixel at one row and two cols, towards top-right and bottom-left corners, relative to the current green pixel, considering the origin as top-left.
3. Fill empty cells with zeros: Fill the other cells of the output with 0.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
