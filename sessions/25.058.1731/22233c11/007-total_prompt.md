"""
1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels colored green (value 3) in the input grid.
2.  **Check for Diagonal Pairs (Down-Right):** Determine if pairs of green pixels are positioned diagonally from each other, specifically where one is down and to the right of the other.
3. **Place Azure Diagonally:** For each pair identified in step 2, fill the spaces between the green pixels on that diagonal with azure (value 8) pixels.
4.  **Maintain Original Pixels:** Ensure all pixels from the original input grid, other than those filled with azure in step 3, remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
