Here's my analysis of the transformation:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The grids consist of pixels with integer values representing different colors.\n*   There are large areas of blue (1) pixels, bordered by azure (8) pixels.\n*   Within the blue areas, there are occurrences of red (2), green (3), and, in the second example a shape of red pixels that form a border\n*   The azure (8) border appears to remain constant.\n*   It seems like a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" type of operation occurs, but is constrained.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It extends, replacing all colors it encounters until it reaches a border composed of either azure (8) pixels or red (2) pixels, excluding the border itself. All colors replaced in the flood fill become red (2)\n\nThe transformation seems to be identifying specific features inside a larger shape (blue region), and converting the interior of these features and some of their surroundings to red (2), up to the point of a stopping condition.\n"
