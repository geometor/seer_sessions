Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Remove:** Locate and remove all blue pixels, these constitute the background.

2.  **Identify and Remove:** Locate all single yellow pixels (1x1 yellow rectangles) and remove them.

3.  **Identify and Shift Rectangles:** Find all red rectangles. Shift each red rectangle to the leftmost position within its row. Maintain the rectangle's shape during the shift.

4.  **Identify Green Lines:** Find the original positions of green pixels. For each row or column that contains green pixels, perform the next step.

5.  **Alternate Line Colors:** Starting with red, alternate the colors between red and green *only* at the original positions where a green pixel was found, skip the other positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
