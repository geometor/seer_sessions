The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), grey(5), magenta(6) and azure(8). There appear to be rectangular shapes and possibly other shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color. The transformations seem to involve alterations to these colored regions, potentially reflecting, combining or moving parts, and maybe point reflections.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
