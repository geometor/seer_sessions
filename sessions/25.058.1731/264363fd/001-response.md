Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), grey(5), magenta(6) and azure(8). There appear to be rectangular shapes and possibly other shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color. The transformations seem to involve alterations to these colored regions, potentially reflecting, combining or moving parts, and maybe point reflections.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    type: grid
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - description: fills the entire grid initially
  - name: rectangle_1
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1) in input_file_0, input_file_2, red(2) in input_file_1 and input_file_3, green(3) in input_file_4, and input_file_5
      - shape: rectangle
      - description: A large rectangular area.
  - name: rectangle_2
      type: shape
      properties:
        - color: blue (1) in input_file_0, red(2) in input_file_1, input file_3, green(3) in input_file_2, input_file_4, and input_file_5
        - shape: rectangle
        - description: Another rectangular area
  - name: cross
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: combination of red (2), and green (3) in input_file_0 and input_file_2, combination of red(2), green(3) and yellow(4), in input file_1, a combination of green(3), and yellow(4) in input_file_3, combination of magenta(6), gray(5) and yellow(4), in input_file_4 and input_file_5.
      - shape: cross-like or plus-sign
      - description: Smaller objects appearing at different locations.
  - name: other_small_shapes
    type: shape
    properties:
      - varies: green small shape(3), yellow small shape (4)
      - description: additional objects, potentially serving as markers or points of reference

actions:
  - type: point_reflection
    description:  reflect certain pixels/objects in another pixel/object

relationships:
  - rectangle_1 and rectangle_2 contains other objects inside
  - cross: located outside the rectangle
  - Other small shapes appears inside and outside rectangles.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all colored rectangles and smaller colored shapes within the azure background.
2.  **Locate Point Reflection Centers:** Identify the pixel locations of the center of the crosses. and yellow pixels inside large rectangles.
3. **Point reflect objects:** Point reflect color of cross center in yellow pixel inside the larger rectangle. If there are two such yellow pixels, point reflect color of cross center with the center of the rectangle.
4. **Point reflect objects:** Reflect other single colored dots in the center of the cross, if the dot is inside the big rectangle.
5. Point reflect colors of the rectangle which includes the center cross in the other yellow dot, if the dot is outside the rectangle.
