Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 30x30 grid with pixels of various colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, yellow=4). There are distinct rectangular shapes formed by red pixels, and lines formed by other colors. It looks like there are two red rectangles, crossed by green lines, and containing single yellow pixels. There's also a green cross shape in one. All surrounded by Blue.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 30x30 grid. The blue and yellow are gone, but all the red shapes have been shifted to the left, and the green has changed. It looks like red takes turns with green on alternating rows, starting with red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
