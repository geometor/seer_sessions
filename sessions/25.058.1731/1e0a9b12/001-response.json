The primary element seems to be the movement and consolidation of non-zero (colored) pixels. Zeros (white pixels) appear to act as empty space. The transformation seems to involve shifting these colored pixels based on certain rules, possibly prioritizing specific locations or directions. The shape and dimensions of input and output are different.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Empty rows created by this are removed.\n\n3.   **Maintain Order:** Ensure that within their final respective rows, the relative horizontal order (left-to-right) of the non-zero pixels is preserved from the input to the output.\n\n4. **Remove empty rows:** rows that are all zero at the top are removed.\n\nIn simple terms, imagine all non-zero colored pixels \"falling\" to the bottom, stacking on top of each other, while keeping their original left-to-right arrangement, and removing all the blank rows.\n"
