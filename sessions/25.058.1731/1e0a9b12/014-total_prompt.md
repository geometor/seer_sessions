Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all non-zero, single-cell colored squares (objects) within the input grid.
2.  **Observe The Maroon 9:** Locate '9' (maroon) in the input. Note the change in position.
3. **Move Other Objects:** The 9 (maroon) moves to the output position that, relative to the 8 (cyan), occupies a location that is in the same column but one row below the 8 instead of one column to the right.
4. **All of the other objects stay in place except for the 9** The 8, 7, and 4 are unchanged in the output.
5.   **Output Grid:** Create the output grid with all other cells filled with '0' (white).

            if grid[r, c] == color:

        # Calculate the new position of 9 relative to 8.

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple relative movement of the maroon (9) object. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more complex rule or perhaps some missed constraints. The current code only moves the '9' (maroon) pixel relative to '8' (cyan), and assumes that the '9' will always start in the same position relative to the '8'. Testing has revealed that it doesn't, and that more factors might be involved.

My strategy to resolve errors will be to:

1.  **Carefully examine all training examples**: Look at input/output pairs to understand the movement of *all* objects, not just '9', and consider what other contextual information is being used.
2.  **Identify consistent patterns**: Determine if the movement is based on absolute position, relative position to other specific objects, or some other unseen rule.
3.  **Refine the natural language program iteratively**: Update the program step-by-step based on each example, adding new conditions or constraints as necessary.
4. **Prioritize simple explanations**: since ARC likes Occam's Razor - simplest is often best.
5. **Leverage code execution**: confirm facts and relationships observed

**Metrics and Observations**

I will use code execution to gather information about each example. Specifically, I'll check:

*   The initial and final positions of 9 (maroon)
*   The presence and positions of 8 (cyan).
*   The presence and position of all of the other colored blocks

Here's the code execution and analysis for each training example:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    """Finds the coordinates of a single-cell object with the given color."""
    coords = []
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r, c] == color:
                coords.append((r,c))
    return coords

        example_data = {
            'correct': np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output),

        }

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all single-pixel, non-zero colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Find Maroon (9):** Specifically identify the coordinates of the maroon (9) object.
3. **Move the Maroon Object:** The maroon (9) pixel moves *down one row*, but does not change column.
4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other colored objects (single pixels) remain in their exact original positions.
5.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, where all the other cells are '0' (white).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
