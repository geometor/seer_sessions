Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Blue Pixel Shift:** If a blue pixel is located in the 4th column (index 3) and its row index is 2 or greater, move it down by one row.
2.  **Green Pixel Shift:** Identify green pixels. if green pixel is in the second column (index 1) and its row index is greater or equal to 1, move it down by one row.
3.  **Magenta Pixel Shift:** If there is a magenta pixel at position [3, 0], move it down by one row.
4.  **Red Pixel Shift**: If a red pixel is located in the 5th column (index 4) and its row index is less than 2, move it down and one position to the left, by one row.
5.  **Copy Remaining:** Any other non-zero pixel that is not affected by the above rules should remain in its original position in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
