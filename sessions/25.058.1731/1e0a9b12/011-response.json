In this specific example, each non-zero colored cell appears to be its own object, as they are not touching.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The positions of the colored cells relative to each other and the grid edges are important.\n*   **Movement:** The primary transformation appears to involve the movement, Specifically the non-zero digits are moving.\n*    **Specific Digits**: It seems that the colors are associated with their specific values, i.e. 4 is always yellow, 7 is orange, 8 is cyan, and 9 is maroon.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
