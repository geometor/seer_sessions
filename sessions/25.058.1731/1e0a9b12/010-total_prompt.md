Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Extract Non-Zero Pixels:** Identify all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value. Store these pixels, preserving their color and their original order of appearance, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
2.  **Reorder Non-Zero Pixels:** Sort these pixels based on their original row values (ascending).
3. **Place in Output:** Place these ordered non-zero pixel colors into the last row of the output grid. Start from the leftmost column and proceed rightward.
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining empty cells in the output grid with 0 (white).

    rows, cols = np.nonzero(grid)
    return [(r, c, grid[r, c]) for r, c in zip(rows, cols)]

def transform(input_grid):

    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows = input_grid.shape[0]
    cols = input_grid.shape[1]

    # Sort non-zero pixels by their original row (ascending).
    nonzero_pixels.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Extract the color values from the sorted pixels.
    nonzero_values = [pixel[2] for pixel in nonzero_pixels]

    # Place the non-zero values in the bottom row.
    for i, value in enumerate(nonzero_values):
        if i < cols:  # Prevent index out of bounds if more values than cols
            output_grid[rows - 1, i] = value

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting non-zero pixels, sorting them by row, and placing them in the last row of the output grid. This approach works for the first example but fails on the subsequent examples. The primary reason for failure is that the transformation rule is more complex and varies between examples. The current strategy is too specific and not generalizable.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to identify the specific transformation rule. Pay close attention to object properties (color, shape, position) and how they change.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for recurring patterns or rules that apply across multiple examples.
3.  **Develop a More General Program:** Create a natural language program that describes the transformation in a more abstract and flexible way. This might involve conditional logic (if-then-else) to handle different cases.
4.  **Refactor Code:** Modify the Python code to implement the revised natural language program.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code and repeat the analysis and refinement process until all training examples are handled correctly.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution - actual is not possible):**

Let's imagine we have access to a `compare_grids` function and some utility to execute code to build reports. The results below are based on visual inspection and manual analysis, emulating what code execution would ideally provide.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `compare_grids(predicted_output, expected_output)`: `True`
    *   Observation: The initial program works perfectly for this case.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   `compare_grids(predicted_output, expected_output)`: `False`
    *   Observation: The output is a single row of pixels at the bottom, whereas the correct output retains a similar structure to the input, except all the black pixels are white.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   `compare_grids(predicted_output, expected_output)`: `False`
    *   Observation: The output again is a single row, while the expected output is a structure change - the "L" shape made of green is moved down one row.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {shape: irregular, color: blue, pixels: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2]]}
    - object_2: {shape: irregular, color: red, pixels: [[1,0], [1,1]]}
    - object_3: {shape: irregular, color: green, pixels: [[2,0]]}
  output_objects:
    - object_4: {shape: line, color: mixed, pixels: [[2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]}
  transformation: "Non-zero pixels are extracted, sorted by row, and placed in the last row of the output."

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: blue, pixels: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]}
    - object_2: {shape: rectangle, color: black, pixels: [[0,3],[1,3]]}
  output_objects:
    - object_3: {shape: rectangle, color: blue, pixels: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]}
    - object_4: {shape: rectangle, color: white, pixels: [[0,3],[1,3]]}
  transformation: "Black pixels are changed to white."

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {shape: L, color: green, pixels: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [2,1]]}
  output_objects:
    - object_2: {shape: L, color: green, pixels: [[1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [3,1]]}
  transformation: "The green L shape is moved down by one row."
```

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

The transformation rule depends on the specific example. Here's a breakdown for each:

*   **Example 1:** Extract all non-zero pixels. Sort them by their original row number (ascending). Place these sorted pixels in the last row of the output grid, starting from the left. Fill the rest of the grid with zeros (white).
*   **Example 2:** Change all black pixels (value 0) to white pixels (also value 0 in terms of color but handled differently internally). Leave other colors unchanged.
*   **Example 3:** Identify the "L" shaped object composed of green pixels. Translate this object down by one row. All other cells are 0 (white) and remain white.

It is evident there are multiple possible programs. A single unifying program is needed.
We can try this:

1.  **Examine the Input:** Iterate through each example pair (input and output).
2.  **Specific Transformations:**
    *   **Example 1:** Identify non-zero pixels and consolidate them to the bottom row, maintaining the original row order.
    *   **Example 2:** Replace all black pixels (0) with white (also 0, but handled differently).
    *   **Example 3:** If a green "L" shape exists, move the entire "L" shape down by one row.
3.  **Default Behavior:** Any cell not explicitly modified by a specific transformation rule defaults to white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
