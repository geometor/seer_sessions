The colors are represented by single-digit integers.  The transformation seems to involve some kind of shifting or rearrangement of the colored pixels within the grid, while also possibly blanking some out (changing to 0, or white). It appears that spatial relationships and relative positions of colored pixels are key to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
