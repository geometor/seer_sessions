"""
The program takes a grid of pixels as input. The program changes each pixel's value based on an observed relationship between the pixel's original value and a new, specific value. The relationship observed thus far are:

1.  If a pixel's color is green (value 3), it is changed to blue (value 1).
2.  If a pixel's color is orange (value 7), it is changed to magenta (value 6).
3.  If a pixel's color is yellow (value 4), it is changed to green (value 3).
4.  If a pixel's color is blue (value 1), it changes to yellow (value 4)

All other pixels remain unchanged. The output is the modified grid.
