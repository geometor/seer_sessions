The input grid contains pixels of colors yellow (4), white (0), green (3), and orange (7). The output grid appears to maintain the structure of yellow, white, and orange pixels but changes green pixels to yellow, and some yellow pixels in the sixth line from the top become orange. The core concept appears to involve a color substitution, specifically of green pixels, and selective changes to the 6th horizontal line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
