Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple rule derived from the first training example: changing green to yellow and, conditionally, yellow to orange on the 6th row. The test results on the other training examples show that this rule is incomplete and needs refinement. The core issue is that the rule doesn't fully capture the spatial and contextual relationships between the colored pixels, specifically when to change yellow to orange.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze the Results:** Examine the provided input/output pairs and corresponding code outputs to understand the discrepancies. I'll use some numpy operations to calculate differences between arrays to pin-point where and what updates are needed.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how colors change (or don't change) based on their position and neighbors.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect a more accurate and comprehensive rule that explains all the training examples.
4.  **Focus on spatial relationships:** Pay close attention to row and column positions, and proximity of colors.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I need to use the results to understand when and how the transform rules should change.
I will calculate the differences between the expected and observed pixel colors

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
