Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of a green vertical line originating from a seed green pixel. However, the provided examples reveal a critical flaw: the generated code uses the *input* grid to determine the end of the vertical green line, when it *should* use the output grid, as evidenced by the failing tests where objects in the input grid are not present to define the length of the vertical line in the output grid.

The main issue is the line-stopping condition, which is currently based on detecting non-white pixels *in the input grid*.  The examples demonstrate that the line's length isn't solely dependent on obstacles in the input, it can be defined by a constant height or possibly run to the bottom of the grid if no other objects of the same color are present in the output grid. The examples indicate that stopping condition is when the green line encounters a non-white pixel *below* it, not in the input grid, but after it has been drawn. The current method does not account for this concept.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Shift Focus to Output Grid:** The stopping condition must be evaluated based on the output grid *as it is being constructed*, not the input grid.
2.  **Iterative Line Drawing:** The line should be drawn pixel by pixel, checking for the stopping condition *after* each pixel is drawn.
3.  **Clarify Stopping Condition:** The exact nature of the stopping condition needs refinement.  It appears to be encountering any non-white pixel, but it must be in the *output*, not the input.
4.  **No input dependency** The height of the grid, location of green pixel in input, or other objects in the input grid seem to have no bearing on the output grid, other than to determine the horizontal location.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To better understand the patterns, let's analyze each example pair and the test results. Since I don't have direct code execution capabilities here, I will describe what needs to be checked and the expected information. I am assuming access to `input_grid`, `output_grid`, and `predicted_output` for each example.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid Size: (get from `input_grid.shape`)
    *   Output Grid Size: (get from `output_grid.shape`)
    *   Green Pixel Location (Input): (row, col) using `find_green_pixel(input_grid)`
    *   Vertical Line Start/End (Output): Determine the start and end row indices of the green line in `output_grid`.
    *   Vertical Line Start/End (Predicted): Determine the start and end row indices of the green line in `predicted_output`.
    *   Obstacle Location (Output): If the line stops before the bottom, find the row/col of the non-white pixel that caused the stop in `output_grid` using a modified `find_next_non_white_pixel_below` that works on a partially constructed grid.
    *   Result: Pass/Fail.

*   **Example 2, 3, 4:**
    *    Repeat the same analysis as Example 1 for each of these examples.

I expect this detailed analysis, once performed, to confirm that the predicted output is matching some of the output grids due to how the stopping condition is implemented.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Green Pixel:** Find the single green pixel in the input grid. Note its column.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid, initially all white (or a copy of the input without the green pixel - this needs further investigation, but all-white seems more likely).
3.  **Draw Vertical Line Iteratively:** Starting from the top row (row 0) of the *output* grid, in the column identified in step 1, draw a green pixel.
4.  **Check for Obstacles:** After drawing *each* green pixel, check the cell immediately *below* it in the *output* grid.
5.  **Stopping Condition:**
    *   If the cell below is non-white, stop drawing the line (the current pixel is the last one).
    *   If the cell below is white, continue to the next row and repeat steps 3 and 4.
    *   If you reach the bottom row of the output grid, stop drawing.

This revised natural language program emphasizes the iterative, output-focused nature of the transformation, which is crucial for correctly implementing the stopping condition. The next step (coder role) is to translate this into code.
