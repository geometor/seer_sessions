1. Find Green Regions: Identify all contiguous regions of green pixels (value 3).
2. Find Red Pixels within Green: Locate all red pixels (value 2) that are contained *within* the boundaries of any green region.
3.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying green regions and extending red pixels within them. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal a flaw: It's not *any* red pixel within the green, but specifically, it should act on red pixels that are part of certain structure within the green areas. The current implementation extends red columns based on the vertical position of the initial red, this works for first example, but is not correct general rule.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** More precisely define the relationship between the red and green pixels. It appears only red pixels that are inside of green area should be selected.
2.  **Conditional Extension:** Refine condition for extending the red color. It is not simply based on the red pixel's position relative to the grid's center. There's a structural relationship at play, such as the single red sitting on green area.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get a clearer picture, I need to examine the exact input and output grids. Let's use the provided examples.

```python
def show_grid(grid, title="Grid"):
    print(title)
    print(grid)

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    print("Comparison (Element-wise Difference):")
    print(grid1 - grid2)
    print("Are the grids equal?", np.array_equal(grid1, grid2))

def analyze_example(example):
     input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
     expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
     predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)

     print("--- Example Analysis ---")
     show_grid(input_grid, "Input Grid")
     show_grid(expected_output_grid, "Expected Output Grid")
     show_grid(predicted_output_grid, "Predicted Output")

     compare_grids(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)
     print("\n\n")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_region
    type: contiguous_region
    color: green
    properties:
      shape: variable
  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: red
    properties:
      inside_green: True

actions:
  - name: extend_red_up
    object: red_pixel
    condition: "red pixel is inside green region"
    transformation: >
      Change all pixels above the red pixel, within the same column, to red,
      stopping at the edge of the grid or if a non-background pixel is encountered.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green pixels.
2.  **Identify Red Pixels within Green Regions:** Find all red pixels that are located *inside* a green region.
3.  **Conditional Extension:** Iterate through each red pixel within the green area. Extend the red color upwards, overwriting only background pixels.

I believe this program better describes all the training cases. It's important to only change background pixels, which have the color 0 (black in visualization, white in number representation).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
