The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), green (3), and red (2). The input grid contains a cluster of green and red pixels, while the rest of the grid is white. The output grid retains the initial cluster of green and red pixels but adds a vertical column of red pixels extending downwards from the initial red pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All the white pixels not part of the column remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to find the red pixel within the green cluster and extend it downwards to the bottom edge of the grid, forming a red column, all other elements of the grid remain unchanged.\n"
