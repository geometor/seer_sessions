            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and documented facts.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: finding a blue pixel and expanding it to the right. However, the provided examples, and particularly the errors, reveal a crucial missing element: **The expansion to the right only occurs until a non-white pixel (a pixel with color other than 0) is encountered. The orginal code did not include this rule.** The strategy for resolving this is to incorporate a \"stopping condition\" into the expansion logic within the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics:**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I will use a combination of manual inspection and my understanding of numpy to derive the following, I will NOT attempt code execution, since I do not have that capability.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion to the right is valid.\n*   **Example 2:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion stopped before a non-white pixel.\n*   **Example 3:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion stopped before a non-white pixel.\n\nAll the examples show that the expansion works, and stop before a non-white pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: blue_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      count: one\n      behavior: starting_point\n  - object: expansion_zone\n    properties:\n        direction: right\n        start: blue_pixel\n        color: white (0)\n        stop_condition: non-white pixel\n  - object: other_pixels\n    properties:\n      behavior: unchanged\n\nactions:\n  - find: blue_pixel\n  - expand:\n      color: blue (1)\n      direction: right\n      from: blue_pixel_location\n      until: edge_of_grid or non-white_pixel\n  - maintain: all_other_pixels\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Locate:** Find the single blue (1) pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Expand Right:** Starting from the blue pixel's location, change consecutive white pixels (0) to the right, into blue pixels (1).\n3.  **Stopping Condition:** Stop the expansion when either the right edge of the grid is reached, or a non-white pixel (any color other than 0) is encountered.\n4. **Preservation:** All other pixels in the grid that are not the subject of the expansion, must remain unchanged.\n\nThis revised natural language program now explicitly includes the crucial stopping condition, making it a complete description of the transformation rule apparent in all three examples.\n"
