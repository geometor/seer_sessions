Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A grid of pixels, mostly white (0), with a small cluster of red (2) and a single blue (1) pixel. The blue pixel is seemingly embedded within or adjacent to the red cluster.
*   **Output:** The same grid as the input, but with additional blue (1) pixels extending to the right edge of the grid from the original blue pixel. The shape formed by original pixels is maintained.
* **Transformation**: It appears a "flood fill" or horizontal expansion of the blue pixel is performed from the location of the blue pixel in input until the right boundary is met.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 15
      cells: integers (0-9)
      colors: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red}

  - type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
      shape: irregular
      colors: [red, blue]

  - type: single_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue
    location: within_cluster

actions:
  - name: horizontal_expansion
    subject: blue_pixel
    direction: right
    extent: grid_edge
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the single blue (1) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Expand:** From the position of identified blue pixel, replace all the pixels in the row to its right with blue pixels up to the right edge of the grid.
3.  **Maintain:** Do not modify the grid or any other pixels, except by previous step.
