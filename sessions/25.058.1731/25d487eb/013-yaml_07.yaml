      The vertical green line starts at the top row (row 0) of the grid.

      The vertical green line's length varies.
  - observation: |
    The green line extends from the top of the grid downwards.
  - observation: |
      The length of the green line seems to be influenced by other objects in the grid,
      specifically, it stops one row short of the next non-white object below it.
  - observation: |
     If there are no objects below the position of the green pixel, the line
     extends to the bottom of the grid.
