The colors represent different objects or parts of objects. There's a clear transformation happening between the input and output grids. The transformations seem to involve adding or extending existing objects based on some internal rule related to the shapes. In the provided training examples, the \"objectness\" concept is evident in compact shapes of color, but it does get interesting in train_1, train_2.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note its original color or colors.\n2.  **Determine Extension Direction:**\n    *   If train example 1, the base_shape has a horizontal shape, extend horizontally.\n    *   If train example 2, the base_shape has a vertical shape. Extend vertically.\n    *    If train example 3, extend a vertical shape of color 2.\n3.  **Extend the Shape:**\n    * If the base_shape has a horizontal component and does not have a vertical component. Extend the shape horizontally across the entire grid.\n\t* If the base_shape has a a vertical component and a horizontal component. Add a shape to extend vertically below it.\n\nThe trick appears to be when both a horizontal and vertical component exist, extend vertically only. Also extend any shape 2 vertically.\n"
