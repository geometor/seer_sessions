The blue pixel is seemingly embedded within or adjacent to the red cluster.\n*   **Output:** The same grid as the input, but with additional blue (1) pixels extending to the right edge of the grid from the original blue pixel. The shape formed by original pixels is maintained.\n* **Transformation**: It appears a \"flood fill\" or horizontal expansion of the blue pixel is performed from the location of the blue pixel in input until the right boundary is met.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
