"""
1. **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct rectangular regions of uniform color within the input grid, ignoring the background color (0/white).
2. **Determine the Target Row:** Identify, in the Input Grid, the lowest row index *above* each colored object.  Add 1 to find the target row index.
3.  **Translate Vertically:** Move each identified object downwards. The top row of each object will be placed at the target row index determined in the previous step. Preserve the object's original width and horizontal position.
4.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color (0). Place the translated objects onto this grid at their new positions.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
