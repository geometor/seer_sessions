The input grid appears to have a central \"blob\" of azure (8) pixels, with single, isolated pixels of other colors surrounding it. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with some of the azure pixels changed to match the colors of the surrounding pixels. Specifically, it looks like the colors of the surrounding pixels have \"replaced\" some of the azure pixels adjacent to them. There is a mirroring of colors at the edges of shape '8'.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify adjacent 8 pixels. For the pixels identified find the closest adjacent 8's.\n4.  **Propagate/Mirror Colors**: Working from left to right, top to bottom. If an isolated pixel has a value different than 8, it will mirror its value to the adjacent 8 on its right, and the isolated pixel above will mirror to the 8 pixel below. If an isolated pixel of color is adjacent to an '8' along the shape's diagonal corners, it is assigned the value of the isolated color pixel.\n\nThis program captures the core transformation: isolated pixels' colors influencing/replacing adjacent azure pixels within the central blob, with a sense of \"propagation\" or mirroring of those colors along the shapes border.\n"
