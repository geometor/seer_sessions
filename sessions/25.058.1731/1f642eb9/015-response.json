            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying an azure blob and propagating colors from isolated pixels to adjacent azure pixels. However, the tests reveal that the propagation logic is incomplete and needs adjustments to handle more complex scenarios. The propagation is too broad. The tests show many instances of the propagation being applied incorrectly. The direction of propagation appears to have variations and the simple corner cases are not correct.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Failed Examples:** Carefully analyze the input/output pairs where the current code fails. Pay close attention to the *exact* locations where color propagation *should* and *should not* occur. Focus on edge cases that demonstrate the direction of propagation.\n2.  **Refine Propagation Rules:** The current \"right, down and diagonal\" propagation is too simplistic. We need to develop more precise rules that consider:\n    *   **Connectivity:** Propagation should likely be limited to azure pixels directly connected to the initial isolated pixel and potentially to the larger region.\n    *  **Direction:** Consider which direction the color propagates, it is not always right and down.\n    * **Termination condition:** Determine under which condition the color should stop to propagate.\n3.  **YAML Facts and NL Program Update:**  Update both the YAML facts and the natural language program based on the refined rules.\n4. **Consider object properties:** The current program does not consider that the propagation colors are objects, with potentially different rules.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when appropriate):**\n\nIt's difficult to provide *precise* metrics without interactive code execution (to count pixels, etc.). However, I can make these qualitative observations based on visual inspection of the images (that you would provide in a real environment). I will assume I have image representations to work from.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Success):** The initial code worked correctly. Isolated pixels (red, green, yellow) correctly propagated their colors to adjacent azure pixels.\n*   **Example 2 (Failure):**\n    - Input has single isolated pixels with colors (red (2) and green (3)), but also two green pixels (3) together.\n    - The code propagated the color green (3) to the azure pixels (8) to the two close pixels, but it should propagate it to the large group. It did not propagate to other pixels, missing a large portion of the shape.\n    - The code correctly propagated the red color.\n*   **Example 3 (Failure):**\n    - Input has two isolated single pixels: red (2) and blue (1)\n    - The code propagated correctly the red color to the right, but it also propagated on the diagonal the color to many pixels that it shouldn't.\n    - The blue color did propagate to the bottom correctly, but not to the other two pixels to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: azure_blob\n    description: The largest contiguous region of azure (8) pixels.\n    properties:\n      - color: azure (8)\n      - shape: irregular\n  - object: isolated_pixels\n    description: Single pixels of color other than azure (8) or black (0) and surrounded by pixels of other colors and not connected to more than two pixels of other colors.\n    properties:\n      - color: variable (not 0 or 8)\n      - size: 1x1\n      - state: isolated\n  - action: color_propagation\n    description:  Isolated pixels propagate their color to adjacent azure pixels.\n    details: The direction of color propagation is dependent on the relative position. It seems propagation happens in 'chains' from isolated pixel. The color of single pixels expands into adjacent regions of '8'.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the azure blob:** Locate the largest contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify isolated pixels:** Find all single pixels that have colors and are not connected to anything on at least two sides.\n3. **Propagate Colors:** For each isolated pixel, propagate its color to adjacent azure (8) pixels. Propagation follows a 'chain' and depends on position. An isolated single color pixel will propagate its value to any directly adjacent '8' pixel that is part of the main shape.\n\n"
