"""
1.  **Identify the azure blob:** Locate the largest contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify isolated pixels:** Find all single pixels that have colors and are not connected to anything on at least two sides.
3. **Propagate Colors:** For each isolated pixel, propagate its color to adjacent azure (8) pixels. Propagation follows a 'chain' and depends on position. An isolated single color pixel will propagate its value to any directly adjacent '8' pixel that is part of the main shape.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
