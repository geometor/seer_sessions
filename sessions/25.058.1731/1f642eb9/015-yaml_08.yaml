facts:
  - object: azure_blob
    description: The largest contiguous region of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: irregular
  - object: isolated_pixels
    description: Single pixels of color other than azure (8) or black (0) and surrounded by pixels of other colors and not connected to more than two pixels of other colors.
    properties:
      - color: variable (not 0 or 8)
      - size: 1x1
      - state: isolated
  - action: color_propagation
    description:  Isolated pixels propagate their color to adjacent azure pixels.
    details: The direction of color propagation is dependent on the relative position. It seems propagation happens in 'chains' from isolated pixel. The color of single pixels expands into adjacent regions of '8'.
