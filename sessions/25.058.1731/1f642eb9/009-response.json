There are distinct colored regions (objects) within the grid. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The modifications include some color changes and what appears to be a mirroring or reflection of certain pixels across a central vertical axis, but only for some specific objects. It seems only some specific colors have been added, and some colors remained unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
