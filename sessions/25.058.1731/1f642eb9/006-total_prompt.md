The transformation rule is as follows:
1. The maroon (9) pixel at the top remains in the same position.
2. The top-left azure (8) pixel in the 3x2 block is replaced by the maroon (9) pixel.
3. The remaining azure (8) pixels in the 3x2 block remain in their original positions.
4. The magenta(6) pixel moves to overlap the original azure block at the left most available position.
5. The yellow (4) pixel remains in the same position.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code were based on the first training example. While it performed correctly on that specific instance, the subsequent tests reveal its limitations. The core issue is that the initial program was too specific, focusing on the exact positions and movements observed in the first example, rather than generalizing the underlying rules. The program fails to handle the variations present in other training samples.

The strategy for improvement involves the following steps:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, including the failed ones, to identify common patterns and variations. Don't give preference to the original training example.
2.  **Identify Core Objects and Actions:** Determine the key objects involved (maroon pixel, azure block, magenta pixel, yellow pixel) and their general behaviors, not just their specific behavior in a single example. Focus on _relative_ positioning, not absolute.
3.  **Generalize the Rules:** Re-formulate the natural language program to describe the transformations in a more general way, accounting for different configurations and sizes of the objects. Focus on relative positions and constraints.
4. **YAML documentation**: Extract specific metrics about each example

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

To ensure accuracy in our observations, I need to use a code cell to provide some reports, and examine results.
Here are the reports generated:

```python
import numpy as np

def report(grid, label):
    # Find and report positions of key colors
    colors = {
      9: "maroon",
      8: "azure",
      6: "magenta",
      4: "yellow"
    }
    
    print(f"Report on {label}:")
    print(grid)

    for color_val, color_name in colors.items():
        coords = np.argwhere(grid == color_val)
        if len(coords) > 0:
            #find bounding box
            min_row, min_col = np.min(coords, axis=0)
            max_row, max_col = np.max(coords, axis=0)
            height = max_row - min_row + 1
            width = max_col - min_col + 1
            print(f"  {color_name} ({color_val}):")
            print(f"    Top-left: ({min_row}, {min_col})")
            print(f"    Bottom-right: ({max_row}, {max_col})")
            print(f"    Height x Width: {height} x {width}")
        else:
            print(f"  {color_name} ({color_val}): Not found")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  maroon_pixel:
    color: 9
    behavior: "Stays in its original row, and duplicates to the row below"
    shape: single pixel, appears duplicated after transform.

  azure_block:
    color: 8
    behavior: "Remains in place, but one cell in block becomes maroon"
    shape: rectangular block

  magenta_pixel:
    color: 6
    behavior: "Moves adjacent to the azure block, below it if there's space; otherwise, to the side and as close as it can"
    shape: single pixel

  yellow_pixel:
    color: 4
    behavior: "Remains in the same position"
    shape: single pixel

rules:
  - "The maroon pixel (9) always stays in the original row, and one instance is added to the row below"
  - "An azure (8) pixel adjacent to and below the maroon pixel becomes maroon."
  - "The magenta (6) pixel moves as close as possible to the azure block, preferring to be directly below it."
  - "The yellow (4) pixel remains unchanged."
  - "Empty spaces are filled with black (0)."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Maroon Pixel Duplication:** The maroon (9) pixel remains in its original row. A new maroon pixel is created in the row immediately below the original maroon pixel's column. If the original maroon pixel is on the bottom row, the new maroon pixel will appear on the bottom row.

2.  **Azure Block Modification:** An azure (8) pixel within the azure block that is directly below the original maroon pixel, becomes maroon (9). This assumes there is always at least one azure pixel below the maroon one.

3. **Magenta Pixel Repositioning:** The magenta (6) pixel is moved to a new position. The preferred new position is directly below the azure block, and left aligned with its left most boundary. If the azure block occupies the lowest rows, the magenta pixel moves to the lowest available row, adjacent to the azure block on either the left or right side, whichever provides available space.

4.  **Yellow Pixel Invariance:** The yellow (4) pixel maintains its original position in the grid.

5. **Blank Spaces**: Empty spaces are filled with color black(0).

This revised natural language program aims for generality and captures the relationships between the objects, addressing the issues found in the initial, overly specific program.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
