observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: [6, 5]
      output_shape: [6, 4]
      predicted_output_shape: [6, 4]
      success: true
      notes: "The output is the first four columns of the input."
  - example_2:
      input_shape: [6, 5]
      output_shape: [6, 4]
      predicted_output_shape: [6, 4]
      success: true
      notes: "The output is the first four columns of the input."
  - example_3:
      input_shape: [3, 5]
      output_shape: [3, 4]
      predicted_output_shape: [3, 4]
      success: true
      notes: "The output is the first four columns of the input."
  - example_4:
      input_shape: [6, 6]
      output_shape: [6, 4]
      predicted_output_shape: [6, 4]
      success: true
      notes: "The output is the first four columns of the input."

overall_assessment:
  - The predicted outputs consistently match the expected outputs across all examples.
  - The transformation rule appears to be a simple selection of the first four columns.
  - There's no evidence of conditional logic or dependence on specific input patterns (colors, shapes, etc.).
