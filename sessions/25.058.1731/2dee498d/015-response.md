Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored numbers. The input grid appears to be wider than the output grid. The colors are consistent (red=2, blue=1, green=3), but the spatial arrangement changes. It seems like columns are being removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: [2, 6]  # 2 rows, 6 columns
        output: [2, 2] # 2 rows, 2 columns
      elements:
        type: integer
        values: [1, 2, 3] # Representing colors
        color_mapping:
          1: blue
          2: red
          3: green

actions:
  - type: column_removal
    description: Selects specific columns from the input grid to create the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid retains the same row structure as the input, but with fewer columns.
  - type: element-wise
    description: The values in the selected columns remain unchanged.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid, which has 2 rows and 6 columns.
2.  **Select** the first and second columns from every set of two adjacent columns of the input grid.
3.  **Construct** the output grid using the selected columns, preserving their original order and row positions.

In essence, the transformation takes repeating sets of two adjacent columns and keeps only the the first two columns to form the output grid.
