            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and task examples to refine our natural language program and address the discrepancies.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of extracting unique elements from each column and transposing them to form rows was a reasonable starting point. However, the results show that this approach is too simplistic and doesn't fully capture the transformation logic. The code works for example 1, but shows errors for example 2, and 3. The core issue is that the transformation isn't simply about unique elements *within* columns; it's about unique elements *across* the entire input, and how they are arranged in the output. The output is a single row that seems to include all unique numbers in input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Core Transformation:** We need to shift from a column-wise unique element extraction to a global unique element extraction, preserving the order of their first appearance in the input grid (reading row by row left to right).\n2.  **Output Shape:** The output is consistently a single row. Our code currently produces multiple rows if the input grid has repeating colors in the same column. This needs to be fixed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use a more concise reporting, since the notebook output is already available.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (1, 3)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (1, 3)\n    *   Result: Success. The code correctly identifies 4, 8, and 4 as the unique column values.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 8)\n    *   Output Shape: (1, 4)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (1,4)\n    *   Result: Success. The code correctly identifies 5, 0, 5, and 0 as unique column values.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (1, 4)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (1,4)\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: 2D_array\n    properties:\n      - contains: integers (0-9) representing colors\n      - shape: variable dimensions\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: 2D_array\n    properties:\n      - contains: integers (0-9) representing colors\n      - shape: (1, N)  # Always a single row, where N is the number of unique colors\n  - transformation:\n      type: unique_element_extraction\n      details:\n        - Extracts unique colors from the input_grid.\n        - Preserves the order of the first appearance of each unique color.\n        - Arranges the unique colors in a single-row output_grid.\n        - Reads input row by row, left to right.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Scan the Input:** Traverse the input grid row by row, from top to bottom and left to right.\n2.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Maintain a list of unique colors encountered. Add a color to this list only if it hasn't been seen before. Preserve the order in which the unique colors first appear.\n3.  **Create Output:** Construct a single-row output grid containing the ordered list of unique colors.\n\nRevised, and much simpler natural language program.\n"
