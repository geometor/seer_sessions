**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7C360BF95DD0>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger, more detailed version of the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or "compressed" representation of the input, retaining only certain key features or colors, while reducing its dimensions. Specifically, the output grid takes only the unique elements of each column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: colored pixels (represented by integers)
      properties:
        height: number of rows
        width: number of columns
        colors: set of unique colors present

actions:
  - compress:
      input: original grid
      output: reduced grid
      method: extract a simplified representation

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains_more_detail_than: output_grid
  - output_grid: is_a_compressed_version_of: input_grid
  - output_grid: column_elements_from: input_grid #New relation

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
2.  Extract the unique color values of the column, maintaining the original order from top to bottom.
3. **Construct** a new grid using these extracted values as columns. The height of the new grid will change based on the count of unique elements in a column.

In essence, the transformation reduces the input grid by getting the unique elements in a column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
