The input grid contains isolated single-pixel colored objects, scattered across the grid, with most of the grid being filled with 0 (white). The output grid seems to expand some of these colored pixels, particularly around other non-zero pixels. There's a sense of \"filling in\" or \"connecting\" the colored pixels, with a preference to grow in specific patterns. Yellow (4) seems to be the main instigator, expanding vertically down. The other colors grow horizontally to fill the area created by expansion of color 4.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Stop extending this line when you encounter another non-zero pixel or the bottom edge of the grid.\n\n3. **Horizontal Expansion(other colors):** Identify other colored pixels on same row with Yellow(4) . Expand them horizontally to fill the columns occupied by the yellow pixels in the corresponding rows.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves a directional expansion of pixels. Yellow (4) pixels initiate a downward vertical expansion, defining vertical extent and other colors spread horizontally based on vertical expansion.\n"
