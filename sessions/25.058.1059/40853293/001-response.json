The input grids seem to have isolated single-pixel objects of various colors, scattered seemingly randomly. The output grids appear to transform these single pixels into vertical or horizontal lines, sometimes crossing each other, centered on the original pixel's location. The lines are composed of the same color as the original input pixel. The lines also seem to extend to include any pixels of the same value adjacent on the diagonals.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
