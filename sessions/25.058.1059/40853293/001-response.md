Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, aiming to discern the transformation logic and express it in a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The input grids seem to have isolated single-pixel objects of various colors, scattered seemingly randomly. The output grids appear to transform these single pixels into vertical or horizontal lines, sometimes crossing each other, centered on the original pixel's location. The lines are composed of the same color as the original input pixel. The lines also seem to extend to include any pixels of the same value adjacent on the diagonals.

**YAML Fact Documentation**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids contain single-pixel objects of different colors."
  - observation: "Output grids expand these pixels into lines."
  - property: "Lines are of the same color as the source pixel."
  - property: "Lines are centered on the original pixel position."
  - property: "Lines can be vertical or horizontal."
  - property: "lines extend to include diagonal pixels of the same color"
  - relationship: "Input pixel color corresponds to output line color."
  - action: "Expansion of single pixels into centered, colored lines."
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** each non-black (non-zero) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **For each** identified pixel:
    a. **Determine** the color of the pixel.
    b. **Create** a line of the same color in the output grid.
    c. **Center** the line on the original pixel's coordinates.
        i. extend lines vertically and horizontally
        ii. include all pixels of the same value on horizontal, vertical, and
        diagonals
3.  **Leave** all other pixels as black (0).
