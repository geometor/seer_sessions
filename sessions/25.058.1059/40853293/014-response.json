The expansion continues until the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel that has a value is encountered (not including background).\n3.  **Identify Expansion Rows:** Determine the rows that contain vertically expanded yellow pixels.\n4.  **Horizontal Expansion (Other Colors):** Within each row identified in step 3, expand any non-yellow and non-background color horizontally.  This expansion occurs in both directions (left and right). The expansion of a color stops when it encounters a pixel of a *different* color, or the edge of the grid.
