Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 30x30 grid with single-color pixels sparsely distributed. The colors include white (0), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta (6), and azure (8).
*   **Output:** A 30x30 grid with a similar structure to the input. Some single pixels remain unchanged. New areas of colored pixels extend from some of the original pixels.
* **Transformation:** It appears the single pixels in the input are extended. The single red pixel is extended vertically upwards. The single azure pixel is extended vertically downwards. The single green and the gray/white/magenta extend in both directions, with some areas duplicated, to form colored lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    color: red
    initial_position: [3, 6]
    action: extend_vertically_up
  - name: green_pixels
    type: single_pixel
    color: green
    initial_position: [7,3]
    action: extend_horizontally
  - name: azure_pixels
    type: single_pixel
    color: azure
    initial_position: [13, 14]
    action: extend_vertically_down
  - name: magenta_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    color: magenta
    initial_position: [19,4]
    action: extend_horizontally
 - name: gray_pixels
    type: single_pixel
    color: gray
    initial_position: [21,2]
    action: extend_horizontally
 - name: white_pixels
    type: single_pixel
    color: white
    initial_position: [21,7]
    action: extend_horizontally
  - name: background
    type: grid
    color: white
    size: 30x30

actions:
  - extend_vertically_up:
      new_color: same as original
      length: to top edge

  - extend_vertically_down:
      new_color: same as original
      length: to bottom edge

  - extend_horizontally:
      new_color: same as original
      length: all available

relationships:
    - all objects are on the background grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify "seed" pixels:** Locate all single, isolated pixels of colors red, green, azure, magenta, white and gray in the input grid.
2.  **Red Extension:** For the red pixel, extend it vertically upwards, maintaining the red color, until it reaches the top edge of the grid.
3.  **Azure Extension:** For the azure pixel, extend it vertically downwards, maintaining the azure color, until it reaches the bottom edge of the grid.
4.  **Green, Magenta, White, Gray Extension:**
     - copy all pixels of these colors 6 times to the right,
     - the magenta pixel also has the gray pixels to the left and right.

This program describes how each seed pixel's color is propagated to form the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
