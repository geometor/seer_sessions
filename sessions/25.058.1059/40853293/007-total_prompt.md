Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all *single* pixels of colors red, azure, magenta, gray, green, and white. A single pixel is defined as a pixel that does *not* have an adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right) of the same color.

2.  **Red Extension:** If a single red pixel is found, extend it vertically upwards to the top edge of the grid, changing those pixels to red.

3.  **Azure Extension:** If a single azure pixel is found, extend it vertically downwards to the bottom edge of the grid, changing those pixels to azure.

4.  **Magenta Extension:** If a single magenta pixel exists, extend it by *one* pixel horizontally in *both* directions (left and right).

5.  **Gray Extension:** If a single gray pixel is found, *and* if that pixel is on row index 3 or greater, extend it downwards to the bottom.

6.  **Green Extension:** If a single green pixel if found, extend it to the right until it makes the green object to 4 pixels long in total.

7.  **White Extension:** If a single white pixel if found, extend it to the right until it makes the white object to 7 pixels long in total.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
