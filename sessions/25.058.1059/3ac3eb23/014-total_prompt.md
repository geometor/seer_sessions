Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Initiator:** Locate the initial yellow pixel (value 4) within the input grid.
2.  **Replicate with Constraints:** Starting from the row and column of the initial yellow pixel perform the following:
    *   From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original, if the cell in the same column is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).
    * From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original,
        *   if the cell one position to the left of the original is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).
        *   if the cell one position to the right of the original column is not black (value 0), and, set it to yellow (value 4).
3. **Boundary Condition.** The replication in any direction stops if it encounters a black pixel (value 0) or goes out of the grid boundary.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly captured the core idea of expanding from a yellow pixel, it failed to generalize to all cases. It's making mistakes due to over-simplification. Specifically, it is performing transformations on *every other* row above and below.

The strategy to resolve these errors is to:

1.  **Re-examine all examples**: Carefully analyze *all* provided input/output pairs, paying close attention to how the yellow color expands, the conditions under which it stops, and any variations in the pattern.
2.  **Identify Incorrect Assumptions**: Pinpoint the specific assumptions in the original natural language program that are contradicted by the failing examples.
3.  **Refine the Program**: Modify the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation observed in *all* examples. This might involve adding conditions, removing incorrect generalizations, or completely restructuring the description.
4.  **Focus on Generality:** The error is due to the initial assumption generalizing incorrectly. So we'll need to make the transformation rule more accurate.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

To better understand the patterns, let's use numpy to help gather some information about the grids in the examples. I need to see the input and output grids together to understand what is happening.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Initiator:** Locate the initial yellow pixel (value 4) within the input grid.
2.  **Vertical Extension:** Extend the yellow color vertically upwards and downwards from the initial yellow pixel's column.
3.  **Stopping Condition:** The extension stops when it encounters a black pixel (value 0) or reaches the boundary of the grid. The extension includes the starting pixel.

This revised program simplifies the logic, focusing on continuous vertical extension rather than an alternating pattern. The key change is removing the "every other row" constraint and adding the "stopping" rule, which applies to *all* training examples. The extension is now contiguous.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
