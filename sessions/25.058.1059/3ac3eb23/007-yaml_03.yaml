observations:
  - object: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    behavior: propagate downwards and diagonally, stopping at non-white pixels or other propagated pixels
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    behavior: propagate downwards and diagonally, stopping at non-white pixels or other propagated pixels
  - object: other_pixels
    color: any color except white, red, and azure
    behavior: act as barriers; stop propagation of red and azure pixels

propagation_rules:
  - direction: down
    condition: target cell is white (0)
  - direction: down-left
    condition: target cell is white (0)
  - direction: down-right
    condition: target cell is white (0)
