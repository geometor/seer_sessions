facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary colors involved are azure (8) and blue (1).  Gray (5) appears in some examples but does not change.
  - object_identification: |
      Azure pixels are the main objects of interest.  They can be considered individually or as groups based on adjacency.
  - properties:
      - adjacency:  The number of adjacent azure pixels (North, South, East, West) is a critical property.
      - change_condition: Azure pixels might change to blue based on their adjacency.
  - actions:
      - transform: Replace azure pixels with blue pixels under specific adjacency conditions.
      - condition_check_1: evaluate number of adjacent azure pixels for each azure pixel
      - transform_rule_1: if adjacent azure == 1, azure becomes blue
  - counter_examples:
    - example 2 showed that the initial single neighbor rule is not sufficient
    - example 3 introduces an interaction with grey pixels
