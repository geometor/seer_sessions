Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by a digit (0-9). The primary color observed is azure (8) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the output grid, specifically in locations where the azure (8) pixels are present in the input, based on a specific condition.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 8, 1]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        azure: 8
        blue: 1

actions:
  - type: conditional_replacement
    input_color: 8
    output_color: 1
    condition: specific_locations

relationships:
  - azure pixels in input relate to blue and azure pixels in output.
  - The locations where blue replaces azure seem to be connected to the relative positions to other azure pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the color azure (value 8).
2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   Iterate through each of identified azure pixels. Check how many azure pixels exist in all the neighbors in all directions, excluding diagonals.
    *    If the number of adjacent azure pixels is exactly one, replace the pixel with the color blue (value 1) in the output grid.
    *    otherwise, maintain the color of the pixels (azure (8)).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (those not azure in the input) remain unchanged in the output grid (value 0).

In simpler terms, the transformation replaces azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels if and only if the azure pixel has only one neighbor in the north, south, east, or west direction that is also azure. Otherwise, keep the azure color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
