The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve identifying specific azure-colored objects and potentially altering pixels within or around them. A new color, blue (1), appears in the output, potentially marking a specific location or property related to the azure objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
