Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example pair and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input and Output Grids:** Both the input and output are 3x3 grids.
*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grids contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   **Repeating Pattern:** The input grid has a repeating sequence of digits (3, 1, 2) in each row. The output grid has a repeating sequence of different digits (4, 5, 6) in each row.
*   **Consistent Transformation:** The transformation appears to consistently map each digit in the input to a corresponding digit in the output. The mapping could be thought of a substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        cells: [[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]
      - name: output_grid
        cells: [[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]

actions:
  - type: map_values
    description: Each value in the input grid is replaced with a new value.

value_mapping:
    3: 4
    1: 5
    2: 6
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule involves a simple substitution of digits. Each digit in the input grid is mapped to a different, specific digit in the output grid.

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  Replace the value '3' with '4'.
3.  Replace the value '1' with '5'.
4. Replace the value '2' with '6'.
5. The resulting output is the new grid.

Essentially, this program describes a one-to-one mapping or substitution cipher applied to the grid values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
