Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts each column's value from the input grid and uses it to generate the corresponding single-element repeated rows of the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid.
    The transformation extracts each column's value from the input and uses it to construct the output rows.
    """
    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Initialize an empty output grid (3x3)
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Get the values from each column of the input grid (any row will do since rows are identical)
    col1_val = input_grid[0, 0]
    col2_val = input_grid[0, 1]
    col3_val = input_grid[0, 2]
    
    # Create the output row
    output_row = [col1_val, col2_val, col3_val]

    # Fill the output grid with the repeated output row
    for i in range(3):
        output_grid[i] = output_row

    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
