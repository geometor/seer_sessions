observations:
  - example_1:
      input_object:  Grid of 3x3 with all pixels being gray (5).
      output_object: Identical to the input grid.
      action: Copy the entire input grid to the output.
      result: "Success"
  - example_2:
      input_object: Grid of 3x3, first row is blue(1), red(2), green(3). Other rows are different.
      output_object: The first row of the input grid is replicated three times.
      action: Copy the first row of the input grid to all rows of the output grid.
      result: "Success"
  - example_3:
      input_object: Grid of 3x3 with various colors in each cell.
      output_object: First row of the input grid replicated three times.
      action: Copy the first row of the input grid to all rows of the output grid.
      result: "Success"
  - example_4:
      input_object:  Grid of 3x3 with all pixels being maroon (9).
      output_object: Identical to the input.
      action: Copy the entire input grid to the output.
      result: "Success"
  - example_5:
    input_object: Grid of 2x2, with all blue (1)
    output_object: Identical to the input grid.
    action: Copy the entire input grid to the output grid.
    result: "Failure - previous code predicts 3x2"
