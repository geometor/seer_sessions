Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Record the color and original position (row, column) of each non-zero pixel, *in the order they appear from top-to-bottom and left-to-right within the input grid*.
3.  **Clear:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with zeros (white pixels).
4.  **Rearrange:** Iterate through the recorded non-zero pixels *in their original order*. Place each pixel in the output grid, starting from the bottom-right corner. Fill cells moving from right-to-left. Once a row is full, move to the row above, again filling from right-to-left.
5.  **Fill:** (Implicit) The output grid is initialized with zeros, so any remaining spaces will automatically be white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing the core idea of relocating non-zero pixels. However, the provided code has successfully worked for all the training examples. This indicates the initial hypothesis needs slight update. The strategy is to:

1.  **Carefully examine** all training input/output pairs, focusing on how non-zero pixels are re-arranged.
2.  **Verify behavior:** Re-run the provided code, and confirm all the given input and output pairs.
3. **Update Natural Language Program:** rephrase the transformation steps clearly and unambiguously.

**Metrics and Observations**

To confirm the behavior, I will run transform with a simple python script to compare the results.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid, preserving relative order of non-zero pixels."""

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    non_zero_pixels = []

    # 1. Identify and 2. Extract non-zero pixels (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                non_zero_pixels.append((input_grid[r, c], (r, c)))

    # 3. Clear (already done during initialization)

    # 4. Rearrange: Position non-zero pixels to bottom-right (preserving order)
    pixel_index = 0
    for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):  # Start at bottom row
        for c in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):  # Start at rightmost col
            if pixel_index < len(non_zero_pixels):
                output_grid[r, c] = non_zero_pixels[pixel_index][0]
                pixel_index += 1

    return output_grid.tolist()

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- observation: All non-zero pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
- observation: The order of non-zero pixels, when read from top-to-bottom and left-to-right, is maintained.
- observation: The non-zero pixels are moved to the bottom-right of the output grid, filling the grid from bottom to top, and right to left.
- observation: The output grid is initialized as all zeros.
- object: Non-zero pixels
  properties:
    - color: Varies (represented by integers 1-9)
    - original_position: (row, column) in the input grid
    - order: Preserved from input to output, based on top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading.
  actions:
    - moved: To the bottom-right of the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify and Extract:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not zero (white). Record the color of each non-zero pixel, and keep track of the order in which you find them (reading the grid from top to bottom, and left to right).

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Make a new grid, the same size as the input grid, and fill it entirely with zeros (white).

3.  **Rearrange:** Take the non-zero pixels you found in step 1, and one by one, place them into the output grid. Start placing them at the very bottom-right corner. Fill each row from right to left. Once a row is full, move to the row above, and continue filling from right to left.

4.  **Implicit Fill:** Because the output grid starts filled with zeros, any remaining empty spaces will naturally be white (zero).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
