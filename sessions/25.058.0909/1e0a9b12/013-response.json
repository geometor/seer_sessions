The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. Most cells are '0' (white), but there are a few cells with other colors. The positions of the non-zero colored cells and their values seem to be important to the transformation. It looks like relative vertical positions is key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

We should sort by row first, then column.\n3.  **Shift Down:** For these non-zero values, the values should maintain their original x coordinate, but stacked at the bottom, y coordinates, in order of initial positions.\n\nEssentially, the non-zero colored cells are \"shifted\" down, maintaining original x position, and stacking at the bottom of the grid relative to their initial positions.\n"
