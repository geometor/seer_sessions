The input grid contains azure (8) pixels arranged in two separate groups. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1). The change seems to be specific to individual azure pixels, not entire groups. Specifically a single azure pixel at the border between a group of pixels and background pixels has been changed to blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
