            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of finding azure (8) pixel groups and modifying a border pixel. However, the initial approach only considered the *first* border pixel touching white. The additional examples reveal that the choice of which azure pixel to change to blue is more complex and depends on relative position of the azure group. The current implementation doesn't correctly handle all cases, particularly where there are different shapes of azure groups.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all training examples**: Go through the provided examples and precisely document the observed changes. We will focus on the characteristics of border pixels and their relationship to the azure pixel group.\n2.  **Refine Object and Action Definitions**: Improve the definition of \"border pixel\" and selection logic to correctly identify the specific azure pixel to transform. consider relative position, and if the object detection needs to be re-defined.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program**: Rewrite the program to reflect the refined logic, being more specific about the pixel selection criteria.\n4.  **Iterate**: We might need to go through this process again if further testing reveals more nuances.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the specific selection logic, lets review the input, output, and prediction for each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: Single azure region, spanning multiple rows and columns.\n    *   Expected Output: The top-leftmost azure pixel of the azure object touching a white pixel is changed to blue.\n    *   Predicted Output: correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: Two azure regions, one smaller than the other.\n    *   Expected Output: The top-leftmost azure pixel of each azure object touching a white pixel is changed to blue.\n    *   Predicted Output: correct\n*    **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: One horizontal line of azure.\n    *   Expected Output: The left-most azure pixel touching a white pixel is changed to blue.\n    *   Predicted Output: correct\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular\n        description: Contiguous block of azure pixels.\n        action: Change top-leftmost border pixel touching white to blue (1).\n    border_pixel_selection: top-leftmost relative to entire grid.\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular\n        description: Contiguous block of azure pixels.\n        action: Change top-leftmost border pixel touching white to blue (1).\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular, smaller\n        description: Contiguous block of azure pixels.\n        action: Change top-leftmost border pixel touching white to blue (1).\n    border_pixel_selection: top-leftmost relative to entire grid for each object.\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        description: horizontal line of azure pixels\n        action: change left-most border pixel touching a white pixel to blue(1)\n    border_pixel_selection: left-most\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct groups of contiguous azure (8) pixels within the input grid. A distinct group is one that is not connected to another group, either directly or diagonally.\n2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel group, identify its border pixels. A border pixel is an azure pixel that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, *not* diagonally) to a white (0) pixel.\n3.  **Locate Target Pixel:** Within each group, select the *top-leftmost* border pixel. \"Top-leftmost\" is defined relative to the overall grid coordinates, i.e., the pixel with the smallest row index; and among those with the same row index, the one with the smallest column index.\n4.  **Transformation:** Change the color of the selected top-leftmost border pixel in each azure group to blue (1).\n5.  **Output:** Create an output grid which is identical to the input grid, except for the transformed pixels.\n"
