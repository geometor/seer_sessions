Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct groups of contiguous azure (8) pixels within the input grid. A distinct group is one that is not connected to another group, either directly or diagonally.
2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel group, identify its border pixels. A border pixel is an azure pixel that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, *not* diagonally) to a white (0) pixel.
3.  **Locate Target Pixel:** Within each group, select the *top-leftmost* border pixel. "Top-leftmost" is defined relative to the overall grid coordinates, i.e., the pixel with the smallest row index; and among those with the same row index, the one with the smallest column index.
4.  **Transformation:** Change the color of the selected top-leftmost border pixel in each azure group to blue (1).
5.  **Output:** Create an output grid which is identical to the input grid, except for the transformed pixels.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of finding azure (8) regions and altering a specific pixel within them. However, the testing revealed a crucial flaw: the definition of "border pixel" needs refinement. The code currently identifies border pixels correctly, but it misses a key detail that can be used to identify the "top-leftmost" pixel that should be turned to blue (1)

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Border Pixel Definition:** The current definition of a border pixel (adjacent to white) is partially correct, but it is not complete.  We observe that not just any border pixel is transformed; it's a very *specific* border pixel. From the provided input/output, it becomes clear that the pixel which becomes blue is not just adjacent to a white pixel.  The pixel turning blue (1) seems to depend on the specific structure of the azure (8) object.
2.  **Re-evaluate Top-Leftmost:** While "top-leftmost" among border pixels was a good initial hypothesis, the test results show that it's not general enough. We may need to develop a different concept.  It's likely a combination of being a "corner" and relative position.
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** We'll use the training examples to iteratively refine our understanding and modify both the natural language program and (in the next phase) the Python code.

**Metrics and Observations (using a conceptual analysis - code execution would be used in a real environment):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single azure (8) object, several "border" pixels. The top-left *corner* is changed to blue (1)
    *   Output: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two azure (8) objects, with some shared edges.  The code as currently designed picks the top-left-most correct.
    *    Output: Correct.
*    **Example 3:**
     *   Input: Multiple azure (8) objects.  The code as currently designed, pick the top-leftmost border pixel correctly.
     *   Output: Correct

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
facts:
  - object_type: azure_region
    description: Contiguous block of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - border_pixels: Pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels.
      - target_pixel: The specific border pixel that changes color.
    transformation:
      - action: change_color
        target: target_pixel
        new_color: blue (1)
        rule: >
            Identify a 'corner' pixel, then from that subset, locate the top-left most pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all distinct, contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** Within each azure region, identify the border pixels. A border pixel is an azure (8) pixel directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one white (0) pixel.
3.  **Locate target pixel:** Find what could be called a "corner" of the azure object. A corner pixel is identified as any azure border pixel adjacent to at least two white pixels, *but also* including the pixels above and to the left of the current pixel.
4.  **Select Target Pixel**: Among these 'corner' pixels, locate the one that is the top-left most.
5.  **Transform:** Change the color of the identified top-left corner pixel to blue (1).
6.  **Output:** Create a new grid identical to the input, except for the pixel transformed in the previous step.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
