Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify: Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2. Extract: Record the color and original location of each non-zero pixel.
3. Clear: Make all of the input image zero
4. Rearrange: reposition the non-zero pixels to the bottom right of the grid, filling empty spaces from the left of the row to the right, and rows from the bottom row and up, preserving the color of the original cells.
5. Fill: Ensure any unassigned spaces is filled with white pixels (zeros).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
