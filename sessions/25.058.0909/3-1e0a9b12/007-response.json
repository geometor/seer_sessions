The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some elements shifted or combined. Key observations are the movement of the maroon '9', the azure '8', and their relative positions. The yellow '4' and orange '7' remain anchored to each other.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
