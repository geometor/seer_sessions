Previous Code:
```python
"""
Shifts non-zero colored cells in a grid downwards, maintaining their x-coordinate (column),
and stacks them at the bottom of the grid in the original order of top to bottom, left to right.
"""

import numpy as np

    """Finds and returns non-zero cells with their original row and column indices."""
    nonzero_cells = []

                nonzero_cells.append((r, c, grid[r, c]))
    return nonzero_cells

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by shifting non-zero cells down."""
    # Initialize output grid with zeros (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Get non-zero cells from input, keeping initial locations.
    nonzero_cells = get_nonzero_cells(input_grid)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
