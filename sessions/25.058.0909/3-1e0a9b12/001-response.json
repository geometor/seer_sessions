Both input and output grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary change seems to be the rearrangement of non-zero colored pixels, while the zero-valued (white) pixels seem to act as a background or filler. The non-zero pixels maintain original colors. It seems the non-zero pixels are gathered in the bottom right, while the zero pixels are in the upper left.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
