"""
The transformation rule performs a context-dependent color substitution. While the general mapping of 2->6, 3->4, and 8->9 holds, the exact application of this mapping is determined by a condition that needs to be discovered based on the provided input and expected output grids. The provided `transform` function correctly applies the mapping, which is not sufficient to fully solve the problem. It's a color swap and the dimensions remain the same.

The previous natural language program is accurate, but incomplete.
