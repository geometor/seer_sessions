The output grid is constructed by replicating the first row of the input grid. The number of times the first row is replicated is equal to the number of rows in the input grid. If the input grid is NxM, the output grid is also NxM, with all its rows being identical to the first row of the input grid. The dimensions of the input and output grid will always be equal.
