Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution. Each digit in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output grid according to the following mapping:

1.  Replace all instances of digit '2' (red) with digit '6' (magenta).
2.  Replace all instances of digit '3' (green) with digit '4' (yellow).
3.  Replace all instances of digit '8' (azure) with digit '9' (maroon).

The spatial arrangement of the digits is preserved; only the digit values (colors) are changed.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by applying a color substitution."""
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Define the color mapping
    color_map = {
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        8: 9,
    }

    # Iterate through the color map and apply the substitutions
    for input_color, output_color in color_map.items():
        output_grid[input_grid == input_color] = output_color

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
