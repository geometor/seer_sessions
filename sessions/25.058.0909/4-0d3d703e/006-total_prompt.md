Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves a simple substitution of digits. Each digit in the input grid is mapped to a different, specific digit in the output grid.

1. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. Replace the value '3' with '4'.
3. Replace the value '1' with '5'.
4. Replace the value '2' with '6'.
5. The resulting output is the new grid.

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = []
    for row in input_grid:
      output_grid.append(row.copy())

    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid.
    for i in range(len(output_grid)):
        for j in range(len(output_grid[i])):
            # Apply the value mapping.
            if output_grid[i][j] == 3:
                output_grid[i][j] = 4
            elif output_grid[i][j] == 1:
                output_grid[i][j] = 5
            elif output_grid[i][j] == 2:
                output_grid[i][j] = 6

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against all the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code implements a simple color substitution cipher. The initial hypothesis was partially correct, but the provided examples and test results show there's a need for refinement. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Verifying the Cipher:** Double-check if the initial substitution rules (3->4, 1->5, 2->6) hold true across *all* successful examples.
2.  **Identifying Missed Rules:** If the initial cipher doesn't explain all transformations, identify additional substitution rules or conditions by comparing input and output grids, specifically focusing on where current code fails.
3.  **Generalizing:** Ensure the natural language program describes a general rule, not just a set of observations tied to specific examples. The current program is good, but we need to confirm or update mappings.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To accurately gather metrics, I'll use a Python script to compare input and output grids pixel by pixel and record any discrepancies. This script extends the functionality of the simple `transform` function by adding error checking.

```python
def analyze_transform(input_grid, output_grid, transform_func):
    transformed_grid = transform_func(input_grid)
    correct = transformed_grid == output_grid
    mismatches = []
    if not correct:

        for i in range(len(output_grid)):
            for j in range(len(output_grid[i])):
                if transformed_grid[i][j] != output_grid[i][j]:
                    mismatches.append({
                        'row': i,
                        'col': j,
                        'input_val': input_grid[i][j],
                        'expected_val': output_grid[i][j],
                        'transformed_val': transformed_grid[i][j]
                    })
    return correct, mismatches

# Example usage with the provided data:
task_data = [
    {
        "input": [[3, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 2], [1, 3, 2, 3], [3, 2, 3, 1]],
        "output": [[4, 5, 4, 4], [4, 4, 5, 6], [5, 4, 6, 4], [4, 6, 4, 5]],
    },
    {
        "input": [[1, 3, 3, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3, 3, 1]],
        "output": [[5, 4, 4, 6, 4], [4, 6, 5, 4, 4], [6, 4, 4, 4, 5]],
    },
    {
        "input": [[2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3], [3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2], [3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3]],
        "output": [[6, 6, 4, 4, 5, 4], [6, 4, 5, 4, 6, 4], [4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6], [4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4]],
    },
]
def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = []
    for row in input_grid:
      output_grid.append(row.copy())

    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid.
    for i in range(len(output_grid)):
        for j in range(len(output_grid[i])):
            # Apply the value mapping.
            if output_grid[i][j] == 3:
                output_grid[i][j] = 4
            elif output_grid[i][j] == 1:
                output_grid[i][j] = 5
            elif output_grid[i][j] == 2:
                output_grid[i][j] = 6

    return output_grid

results = []
for example in task_data:
  results.append(analyze_transform(example["input"], example["output"], transform))
print(results)
```

```
[(True, []), (True, []), (True, [])]
```
The code provided passes all tests, and the results of the new `analyze_transform` confirm this. The substitutions are consistent.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each with a color value.
  - property: color_substitution
    description: A mapping between input and output colors.
  - mapping_rule:
    - input: 3
      output: 4
    - input: 1
      output: 5
    - input: 2
      output: 6
  - action: substitute
    description: Replace pixel values in the input grid based on the mapping rule to create the output grid.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a color substitution cipher. Every instance of color '3' (green) in the input grid is replaced with color '4' (yellow) in the output grid. Every instance of color '1' (blue) is replaced with color '5' (gray). Every instance of color '2' (red) is replaced with color '6' (magenta). Other colors remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
