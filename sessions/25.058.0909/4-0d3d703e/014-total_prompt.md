Here's my analysis of the provided example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input and Output:** Both input and output are 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   **Colors:** The colors in the output grid correspond to the digits according to a color map (not provided in this turn, but mentioned in system prompt).
*   **Repetition:** The input grid consists of three identical rows. The output grid also consists of three identical rows.
* **Column-wise Transformation:** It appears the transformation occurs on a per-column basis. The first column of the input becomes the first element repeated in all rows in the output, the second column maps to the middle repeated element, and so on.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: color_grid_transformation
  input:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    properties:
      - identical_rows
  output:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    properties:
      - identical_rows
  transformation_type: columnwise_mapping
  objects:
      - name: column
        properties:
            - index: [0, 1, 2] # Column index
            - value: integer       # Integer value in that column of the input
            - output_value: integer # Corresponding integer in the output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid (from left to right, index 0 to 2).
2.  **For each column**, take the value of any cell in that column (since all rows are identical in the input).
3. **Construct** output row using column values from step 2.
4.  **Repeat** the output row three times to form the complete 3x3 output grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts each column's value from the input and uses it to generate the corresponding single-element repeated rows of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
