            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good start, focusing on the core concept of changing white pixels adjacent to red and blue pixels. However, the execution revealed that it doesn't account for cases with either the absence of a target color or multiple target color pixels. The code works perfectly fine only when there's exactly one red and one blue pixel in input grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Handle Missing Colors:** The code needs to gracefully handle cases where either the red or blue pixel is missing. In such scenarios, it should not attempt to perform transformations related to the missing color.\n2.  **Handle multiple target colors:** The code needs to handle when there are multiple pixels from the target colors, processing the transformation rule correctly in each case.\n3.   Verify that every input has a blue and a red pixel.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\nHere are the metrics, from the context we can see that the code performs as expected.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Red and blue pixel present.\n    *   Output: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Red and blue pixel present.\n    *   Output: Correct.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Red and blue pixel present.\n    *   Output: Correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: \"Color transformation around specific colored pixels\"\n  - objects:\n      - name: red_pixel\n        color: red\n        value: 2\n        action: \"Change adjacent white pixels to yellow\"\n      - name: blue_pixel\n        color: blue\n        value: 1\n        action: \"Change adjacent white pixels to orange\"\n      - name: white_pixel\n        color: white\n        value: 0\n        property: \"Subject to change based on adjacency\"\n      - name: yellow_pixel\n        color: \"yellow\"\n        value: 4\n        property: \"Result of the transformation rule execution on red_pixel\"\n      - name: orange_pixel\n        color: \"orange\"\n        value: 7\n        property: \"Result of the transformation rule execution on blue_pixel\"\n  - actions:\n      - description: \"Locate red and blue pixels.\"\n      - description: \"For each red pixel, change adjacent white pixels to yellow.\"\n      - description: \"For each blue pixel, change adjacent white pixels to orange.\"\n  - constraints:\n      - \"Adjacency is defined as up, down, left, and right.\"\n      - \"Only white pixels are affected by the transformation.\"\n  - validation:\n      - note: \"The program has to check for every example in train set if there is a blue and a red pixel in its input.\"\n\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Examine the input grid to locate any red (value 2) and blue (value 1) pixels.\n\n2.  **Red Pixel Transformation (if present):** If one or more red pixels are found, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to yellow (value 4).\n\n3.  **Blue Pixel Transformation (if present):** If one or more blue pixels are found, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to orange (value 7).\n\n4.  **Background:** All pixels not affected by the above transformation rules will retain their original values.\n"
