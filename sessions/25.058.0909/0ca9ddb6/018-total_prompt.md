"""
1.  **Locate Key Pixels**: Scan the input grid to identify "key" blue (1) and red (2) pixels. A "key" pixel is one that is at the center of a plus shaped empty space - it must have at least one adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white (0) pixel.
2.  **Expand Around Blue**: For each key blue pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Expand Around Red**: For each key red pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to yellow (4).
4. **Preserve Magenta:** Copy any magenta (6) pixels from the input to output with no change.
5.  **Unchanged Pixels**: All other pixels remain unchanged in their original color and position.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which it handled correctly. However, the subsequent examples reveal limitations in the initial logic. The core issue seems to be the definition of a "key" pixel. The original definition, requiring *all* adjacent pixels to be white, is too restrictive. It appears that only *one* adjacent white pixel is sufficient to trigger the color change. Additionally, we need to clarify the order of operations (blue expansion vs. red expansion) and ensure no unintended overwrites.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Relaxing the "key pixel" definition:** Modify the `is_key_pixel` function (or its equivalent logic in the natural language program) to require only *at least one* adjacent white pixel.
2.  **Prioritizing expansions**: Determine if there is any implicit ordering for the expansions on red and blue pixels.
3.  **Re-evaluating the natural language program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the relaxed conditions and operational order.
4.  **Gathering Metrics**: Utilize code execution to examine specific characteristics of input/output pairs and differences between output and expected results, identifying crucial locations, colors, etc.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gain a more precise understanding of the errors, I'll examine each example pair using code execution. I will specifically look for:

*   Locations where the output differs from the expected output.
*   Colors of the differing pixels.
*   The neighbors of differing pixels.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Preserve Magenta:** Copy all magenta (6) pixels from the input to the output without changes.
2.  **Identify Key Pixels**: A pixel is a "key" pixel if it is either blue (1) or red (2) AND has at least one adjacent (up, down, left, or right) white (0) pixel.
3.  **Expand Around Key Pixels**:
    *   If a key pixel is blue (1), change any adjacent white (0) pixels to orange (7).
    *   If a key pixel is red (2), change any adjacent white (0) pixels to yellow (4).
4.  **All Other Pixels**: Pixels that are not magenta and are not adjacent to a *key* pixel remain unchanged.

**Changes and Justification from previous version:**

*   **"Key Pixel" Definition:** Changed from requiring *all* adjacent pixels to be white to requiring *at least one* adjacent white pixel. This corrects the errors observed in Examples 2 and 4, where expansion didn't occur when it should have.
*   **Order of Operations:** The analysis didn't definitively reveal a strict order between blue and red expansion. The new description explicitly states that both expansions happen, which will be important in the next phase when we create the code. If order is important, it will be a simple code change, but there wasn't any data to support it.
*   **Clarity:** Improved the wording for clarity and conciseness.

The next step will be to update the Python code to match this revised natural language program and verify against all training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
