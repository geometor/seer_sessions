The colors present in the input are red (2), magenta (6), and blue (1), along with the background white (0). The output introduces new colors: yellow (4) and orange (7). The positions of the original colored pixels seem to be preserved. The new colored pixels appear adjacent to the original ones.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
