Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 9x9 grids. The input grid contains two single-pixel objects of different colors (red '2' and blue '1') against a background of white '0' pixels. The output grid introduces changes around these colored pixels. The red pixel seems to "attract" yellow '4' pixels, while the blue pixel gets surrounded by orange '7' pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: obj1
    type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: (3, 2)  # (row, column)
    behavior: attracts yellow
  - id: obj2
    type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: (6, 6)
    behavior: surrounded by orange
  - id: background
    type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: replaced based on proximity to other objects

actions:
  - type: attraction
    agent: obj1 (red pixel)
    target: adjacent cells
    result: change adjacent white pixels to yellow (4)
  - type: surrounding
    agent: obj2 (blue pixel)
    target: adjacent cells
    result: change adjacent white pixels to orange (7)

relationships:
  - adjacency:  Objects influence only directly adjacent (non-diagonal) pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the red (value 2) and blue (value 1) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Red Pixel Transformation:** For the red pixel, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to yellow (value 4).

3.  **Blue Pixel Transformation:** For the blue pixel, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to orange (value 7).

4. **Background:** All the pixels that where not affected by the above transformation rule will keep its original value.

In essence, the transformation rule involves identifying specific colored pixels and modifying their immediate surroundings based on their color. The red pixel creates a "yellow zone," and the blue pixel creates an "orange zone," but only on adjacent, not diagonals, cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
