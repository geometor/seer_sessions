```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** through each of the original non-zero pixels found.
3.  **Check** the locations of the pixel values of '1', and '2'.
4.  **Introduce** a new '7' (orange) colored pixel in the output grid in all empty spaces (value 0) adjacent to the locations.
5. **Check** the locations of the pixel values of '1', and '8'.
6. **Introduce** a new '4' (yellow) colored pixel in the output grid, in the locations that complete a 3x1 or 1x3 cluster, if a straight line of two empty spaces exists between the locations.
7. **Copy** all original pixel values to the output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples. The goal is to refine the natural language program and, consequently, the code, to accurately reflect the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, capturing some key aspects of the transformation. However, the testing revealed discrepancies, indicating that the logic isn't entirely correct or complete. The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each example where the output doesn't match the expected output, pinpoint the exact locations (row, column, and color) of the differences. This will reveal specific aspects of the transformation that the current program fails to capture.
2.  **Pattern Recognition in Errors:** Look for common patterns in the errors. Are we consistently missing a certain type of object, misinterpreting a relationship, or failing to apply a rule under specific conditions?
3.  **Refinement of the Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis, adjust the natural language program step-by-step. Be very specific about the conditions under which each rule applies.
4.  **Iterative Code Adjustment:** Translate the refined natural language program into code modifications.
5.  **Re-testing:** After each code modification, re-test against all training examples to ensure that the changes fix the identified errors without introducing new ones.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when useful)**

Let's analyze each training example:

```python

    """Compares two grids and returns the differences."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:

    if not np.any(diff):
        return "Identical"
    diff_indices = np.argwhere(diff)
    diff_values = [(grid1[row, col], grid2[row, col]) for row, col in diff_indices]
    return list(zip(diff_indices, diff_values))

**Example 1:** `Example 1: [((array([3, 4]), (7, 7)), (0, 7)), ((array([4, 5]), (7, 7)), (7, 0)), ((array([5, 6]), (8, 8)), (7, 0)), ((array([6, 7]), (8, 8)), (7, 7))]`

*   **Observation:** There are errors. The '7' (orange) placement is not quite right. It should only appear next to '1' and '2', not '8'.

**Example 2:** `Example 2: [((array([3, 4]), (4, 4)), (0, 7)), ((array([3, 4]), (5, 5)), (0, 4)), ((array([4, 5]), (4, 4)), (7, 4)), ((array([4, 5]), (5, 5)), (7, 4)), ((array([6, 7]), (4, 4)), (0, 4)), ((array([6, 7]), (5, 5)), (0, 4))]`

*   **Observation:** The 4's placement between 1 and 8 is not consistent. Also, similar error as Example 1 with incorrect '7' placement.

**Example 3:** `Example 3: Identical`

*   **Observation:** This one works perfectly! This provides a good reference point. The difference lies in the longer distance (3 spaces vs 2 in other cases) between '1' and '8'.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    description: Appears in the input grid.
  - name: red_pixel
    color: 2
    description: Appears in the input grid.
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: 8
    description: Appears in the input grid.
  - name: orange_pixel
    color: 7
    description: Added adjacent to blue and red pixels.
  - name: yellow_pixel
    color: 4
    description: Added between blue and azure pixels under specific conditions.

actions:
  - name: add_orange
    trigger: Presence of blue or red pixels.
    rule: Place an orange pixel in all empty (0) adjacent cells.
  - name: add_yellow
    trigger: Presence of blue and azure pixels on the same row or column.
    rule: |
      If there are three or more empty cells between the blue and azure pixels,
      place yellow pixels to create a continuous line connecting them.
      If there are exactly two empty spaces, it does NOT place any yellow pixels.
      If there are less than two, do nothing as well.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify:** Find all blue (1), red (2), and azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Orange Rule:** For each blue (1) and red (2) pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighboring cell is empty (0), change it to orange (7).
3.  **Yellow Rule:** For each pair of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels:
    *   Check if they are in the same row or the same column.
    *   If they are in the same row or column, count the number of empty (0) cells between them.
    *  If there are three or more empty cells between them, place yellow pixels to complete the straight line connecting them
    *   If there are two or fewer empty cells between them, do *not* add any yellow pixels.
4.  **Copy:** All original pixels from the input that have not be changed, are copied.

This revised natural language program addresses the issues observed in the test results by:

*   Explicitly excluding '8' (azure) from the orange rule.
*   Making the yellow rule condition more precise (3 or more spaces).
*   Clarifying the action of completing a connection between 1 and 8 if the conditions are right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
