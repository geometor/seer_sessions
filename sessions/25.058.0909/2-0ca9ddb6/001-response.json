The input grid contains two single-pixel objects of different colors (red '2' and blue '1') against a background of white '0' pixels. The output grid introduces changes around these colored pixels. The red pixel seems to \"attract\" yellow '4' pixels, while the blue pixel gets surrounded by orange '7' pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The red pixel creates a \"yellow zone,\" and the blue pixel creates an \"orange zone,\" but only on adjacent, not diagonals, cells.\n"
