observations:
  - task: "Color transformation around specific colored pixels"
  - objects:
      - name: red_pixel
        color: red
        value: 2
        action: "Change adjacent white pixels to yellow"
      - name: blue_pixel
        color: blue
        value: 1
        action: "Change adjacent white pixels to orange"
      - name: white_pixel
        color: white
        value: 0
        property: "Subject to change based on adjacency"
      - name: yellow_pixel
        color: "yellow"
        value: 4
        property: "Result of the transformation rule execution on red_pixel"
      - name: orange_pixel
        color: "orange"
        value: 7
        property: "Result of the transformation rule execution on blue_pixel"
  - actions:
      - description: "Locate red and blue pixels."
      - description: "For each red pixel, change adjacent white pixels to yellow."
      - description: "For each blue pixel, change adjacent white pixels to orange."
  - constraints:
      - "Adjacency is defined as up, down, left, and right."
      - "Only white pixels are affected by the transformation."
  - validation:
      - note: "The program has to check for every example in train set if there is a blue and a red pixel in its input."
