Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Key Pixels**: Scan the input grid to identify "key" blue (1) and red (2) pixels. A "key" pixel is one that is at the center of a plus shaped empty space - it must have at least one adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white (0) pixel.
2.  **Expand Around Blue**: For each key blue pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Expand Around Red**: For each key red pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to yellow (4).
4. **Preserve Magenta:** Copy any magenta (6) pixels from the input to output with no change.
5.  **Unchanged Pixels**: All other pixels remain unchanged in their original color and position.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
