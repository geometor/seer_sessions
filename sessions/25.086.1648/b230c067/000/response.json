            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves identifying distinct objects made of azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid. These objects retain their shape in the output grid but change color. The output uses blue (1) and red (2) to color these objects. The transformation rule appears to depend on the properties and relative positions of these azure objects. Specifically, it seems to identify one specific object to color red (2) and colors all others blue (1). The selection criterion involves checking if objects enclose a \"hole\" (an area of white pixels) and identifying the \"top-right-most\" object based on its bounding box.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
