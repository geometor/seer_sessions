  input_grid:
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with integer values 0-9.
    relevant_pixels:
      - color: 0 (white) - Represents background and potential enclosed 'holes'.
      - color: 8 (azure) - Represents the primary objects to be analyzed and transformed.
  output_grid:
    description: A 2D grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    relevant_pixels:
      - color: 0 (white) - Unchanged background.
      - color: 1 (blue) - Color assigned to some azure objects based on rules.
      - color: 2 (red) - Color assigned to one specific azure object based on rules.

objects:
  - name: azure_object
    description: A contiguous group of azure (8) pixels, connected 8-directionally (including diagonals).
    properties:
      - pixel_set: The set of (row, col) coordinates constituting the object.
      - bounding_box: Defined by (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - has_hole: A boolean property, true if the object encloses one or more white (0) pixels that are not connected to the exterior of the object's bounding box + 1 pixel padding.
      - position_sort_key: Derived from the bounding box (min_row, -max_col) for sorting (lowest row first, then highest column).

transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list of azure_objects
    filter: color == 8
    connectivity: 8-directional

  - action: analyze_objects
    input: list of azure_objects
    output: list of azure_objects with properties (bounding_box, has_hole, position_sort_key) calculated.

  - action: count_holes
    input: list of analyzed azure_objects
    output: integer count of objects where has_hole is true.

  - action: select_red_object
    description: Selects exactly one object to be colored red based on hole count and position.
    conditions:
      - if hole_count == 1:
          input: non-hole azure_objects
          selects: the object with the minimum min_row, breaking ties with maximum max_col.
      - if hole_count == 0:
          input: all azure_objects
          selects: the object with the minimum min_row, breaking ties with maximum max_col.
      - otherwise: no object is selected as red.

  - action: select_blue_objects
    description: Selects objects to be colored blue.
    conditions:
      - if hole_count == 1:
          selects: the object with the hole AND all non-hole objects EXCEPT the one selected as red.
      - if hole_count == 0:
          selects: all objects EXCEPT the one selected as red.
      - otherwise: no objects are selected as blue.

  - action: color_output_grid
    input: input_grid, selected_red_object, selected_blue_objects
    output: output_grid
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid with white (0) pixels.
      - For the selected_red_object, change the color of its corresponding pixels in output_grid to red (2).
      - For each selected_blue_object, change the color of its corresponding pixels in output_grid to blue (1).
