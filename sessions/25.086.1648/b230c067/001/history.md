*   **Perception**: The task involves identifying distinct objects made of azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid. These objects retain their shape in the output grid but change color. The output uses blue (1) and red (2) to color these objects. The transformation rule appears to depend on the properties and relative positions of these azure objects. Specifically, it seems to identify one specific object to color red (2) and colors all others blue (1). The selection criterion involves checking if objects enclose a "hole" (an area of white pixels) and identifying the "top-right-most" object based on its bounding box.

*   **Facts YAML**:
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (e.g., 10x10).
      input_colors: [0 (white), 8 (azure)]
      output_colors: [0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red)]
      background_color: 0 (white) remains unchanged.
    
    elements:
      - element: object
        description: Contiguous areas of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
        properties:
          - shape: The spatial arrangement of the pixels. Remains the same in the output.
          - color: Always azure (8) in the input. Changes to blue (1) or red (2) in the output.
          - bounding_box: The minimum bounding rectangle enclosing the object. Key coordinates are min_row and max_col.
          - has_hole: A boolean property indicating if the object fully encloses a region of white (0) pixels.
        relationships:
          - count: There can be multiple distinct azure objects in the input.
          - relative_position: Objects can be compared based on their position, particularly using their bounding boxes' top-right characteristics (min_row, max_col).
    
    transformation:
      - action: identify_objects
        input: input grid
        output: set of azure (8) objects, each defined by its pixel coordinates.
      - action: analyze_objects
        input: set of azure objects
        processing:
          - For each object, calculate its bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
          - For each object, determine if it has a hole (encloses white pixels).
        output: List of objects with properties (pixels, bbox, has_hole).
      - action: select_red_object
        input: List of objects with properties.
        logic:
          - Count objects with holes (`hole_count`).
          - If `hole_count == 0`:
              - Find the object with the minimum `min_row`.
              - If there's a tie in `min_row`, select the one with the maximum `max_col` among the tied objects. This is the "top-right-most".
              - This "top-right-most" object is designated to be red.
          - If `hole_count == 1`:
              - The object with the hole is designated to be blue.
              - Consider only the objects *without* holes.
              - Find the object among these with the minimum `min_row`.
              - If there's a tie in `min_row`, select the one with the maximum `max_col` among the tied objects. This is the "top-right-most" among the non-hole objects.
              - This "top-right-most" object (among non-hole objects) is designated to be red.
          - (Assumption: `hole_count` will only be 0 or 1 based on examples).
        output: The single object designated to be red. The object designated blue (if `hole_count == 1`).
      - action: color_output_grid
        input: input grid dimensions, list of objects, designated red object, designated blue object (if applicable).
        processing:
          - Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized with white (0).
          - For the designated red object, color its corresponding pixels red (2) in the output grid.
          - If a specific object was designated blue (the one with the hole when `hole_count == 1`), color its corresponding pixels blue (1).
          - For all other azure objects (not red and not the specifically designated blue one), color their corresponding pixels blue (1) in the output grid.
        output: final output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
    2.  Identify all separate connected objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    3.  For each identified azure object, determine its bounding box (specifically the minimum row index `min_row` and maximum column index `max_col`) and check if it encloses any white (0) pixels (has a hole).
    4.  Count how many objects have holes.
    5.  Initialize a list of objects to be colored blue.
    6.  **If exactly one object has a hole:**
        *   Add this object with the hole to the list of objects to be colored blue.
        *   Consider only the objects *without* holes. Find the object among these that has the smallest `min_row`. If multiple objects share the smallest `min_row`, choose the one among them with the largest `max_col`. This is the "top-right-most" object among the non-holed objects.
        *   Designate this "top-right-most" object to be colored red (2).
        *   Add all remaining objects (those without holes that were not selected to be red) to the list of objects to be colored blue.
    7.  **If zero objects have holes:**
        *   Consider all identified azure objects. Find the object that has the smallest `min_row`. If multiple objects share the smallest `min_row`, choose the one among them with the largest `max_col`. This is the overall "top-right-most" object.
        *   Designate this "top-right-most" object to be colored red (2).
        *   Add all other objects to the list of objects to be colored blue.
    8.  Color the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the designated red object with red (2).
    9.  Color the pixels in the output grid corresponding to all objects in the list of objects to be colored blue with blue (1).
    10. Return the completed output grid.
