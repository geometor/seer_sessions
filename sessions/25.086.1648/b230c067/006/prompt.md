"""
Transforms an input grid containing white (0) and azure (8) pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions.

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals). If no azure objects are found, return the initial white output grid.
3.  For each identified azure object, determine its properties:
    *   The set of pixel coordinates `(row, col)` belonging to the object.
    *   The bounding box containing the object: `(min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)`.
    *   Whether the object contains an internal "hole" (a contiguous area of white pixels fully enclosed by the object and not connected to the grid exterior relative to the object's boundary).
4.  Count the total number of azure objects that possess a hole (`hole_count`).
5.  Determine which objects (if any) will be colored red (2) and blue (1) based on `hole_count`:
    *   **If `hole_count` is exactly 1:**
        *   Designate the single object *with* the hole to be colored blue (1).
        *   Among the objects *without* holes, identify the "top-right-most" one. Designate this object to be colored red (2). (The "top-right-most" object is the one with the minimum `min_row`; if there's a tie, it's the one among the tied objects with the maximum `max_col`).
        *   Designate all *other* objects (those without holes that were not chosen to be red) to be colored blue (1).
    *   **If `hole_count` is 0:**
        *   Among *all* azure objects, identify the "top-right-most" one (using the same definition as above). Designate this object to be colored red (2).
        *   Designate all *other* azure objects to be colored blue (1).
    *   **If `hole_count` is greater than 1:**
        *   No objects are designated to be colored red or blue. The output grid remains white.
6.  Populate the output grid: For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated red, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 2. For every pixel `(r, c)` belonging to an object designated blue, set `output_grid[r, c]` to 1.
7.  Return the final output grid.
