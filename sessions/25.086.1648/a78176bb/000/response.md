**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 10x10 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The inputs primarily use white (0), gray (5), and one other "main" color (maroon 9, orange 7, or red 2). The outputs retain the main color and white, removing the gray.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   Input: Contains a "main object" composed of the non-gray, non-white color, and a "secondary object" composed of gray (5) pixels. The main object often appears as a diagonal line or path. The gray object appears as a contiguous or semi-contiguous block near the main object.
    *   Output: Contains the original main object (potentially with pixels removed where gray pixels were, though this isn't explicit in the rules derived, it just happens the gray areas are removed first). Crucially, a *new* diagonal line object of the main color is added.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves:
    *   Identifying the main color (C) and the gray color (5).
    *   Identifying the locations of the main object and the gray object.
    *   Removing the gray object (changing gray pixels to white).
    *   Determining the starting position for a new diagonal line based on the relative positions of the top-leftmost gray pixel and the top-leftmost main color pixel.
    *   Drawing this new diagonal line using the main color (C), proceeding down and right until the grid edge.
5.  **Key Relationship:** The starting point of the *new* diagonal line depends on the coordinates of the top-leftmost gray pixel `(gr, gc)` and the top-leftmost main color pixel `(mr, mc)`. Specifically, the comparison between `gc` and `mc` determines whether the new line starts at `(gr, 0)` or `(0, gc)`.
6.  **Pattern:** A consistent pattern emerges where the gray pixels act as a "signal" or "modifier" that dictates the placement of a new diagonal structure derived from the main object's color. The new structure is always a straight diagonal line going down and right.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the primary color `C` present in the input grid (the single color that is not white (0) or gray (5)).
2.  Locate the pixel coordinates `(gr, gc)` representing the top-leftmost gray (5) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
3.  Locate the pixel coordinates `(mr, mc)` representing the top-leftmost primary color `C` pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
4.  Determine the starting coordinates `(sr, sc)` for a new diagonal line based on the column indices:
    *   If `gc` (gray column) is greater than `mc` (main color column), set `(sr, sc) = (0, gc)`.
    *   Otherwise (if `gc` is less than or equal to `mc`), set `(sr, sc) = (gr, 0)`.
5.  Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.
6.  In the output grid, change all gray (5) pixels to white (0).
7.  Starting from the determined coordinates `(sr, sc)`, draw a diagonal line using the primary color `C`. This line extends downwards and to the right (incrementing row and column by 1 for each step) until it exits the bounds of the grid. Add these colored pixels to the output grid.
