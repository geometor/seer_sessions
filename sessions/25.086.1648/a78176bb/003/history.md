Transforms the input grid according to the following rules:

2. Find the coordinates (gr, gc) of the top-leftmost gray (5) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
3. Find the coordinates (mr, mc) of the top-leftmost main color (C) pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
4. Determine a starting point (sr, sc) for a new diagonal line based on the column indices:
   - If the gray column `gc` is greater than the main color column `mc`, the start point is (0, gc).
   - Otherwise (if `gc` is less than or equal to `mc`), the start point is (gr, 0).
5. Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.
6. In the output grid, change all gray (5) pixels to white (0).
7. Starting from the determined coordinates (sr, sc), draw a diagonal line using the main color C. This line extends downwards and to the right (incrementing row and column by 1 at each step) until it goes off the grid boundary.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully implements the transformation for the first two examples but fails on the third. The core logic involves identifying a 'main color' (non-white, non-gray), locating the top-leftmost pixels of the main color and gray color, removing all gray pixels, and then drawing a diagonal line using the main color.

The failure in Example 3 indicates that the rule for determining the *starting point* of the new diagonal line needs refinement. The original rule compared the column indices (`gc` and `mc`) of the top-leftmost gray and main color pixels, respectively. While this worked for Examples 1 and 2, it produced an incorrect starting point for Example 3.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the coordinates of the top-leftmost gray pixel (`gr`, `gc`) and the top-leftmost main color pixel (`mr`, `mc`) across all examples to derive a condition that correctly determines the starting point (`sr`, `sc`) for the diagonal line. The potential starting points appear to be `(gr, 0)` or `(0, gc)`. The revised logic must correctly choose between these two based on the relative positions identified.

## Metrics

| Example | Input Size | Main Color (C) | Top-Left Gray (gr, gc) | Top-Left Main (mr, mc) | Original Condition (`gc > mc`) | Deduced Start (Original) | Expected Start | Revised Condition | Deduced Start (Revised) | Match |
| :------ | :--------- | :------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------- | :---- |
| 1       | 10x10      | 9 (maroon)     | (1, 5)                 | (0, 5)                 | False (`5 <= 5`)               | `(gr, 0)` -> (1, 0)      | (1, 0)         | `gc <= mc`        | `(gr, 0)` -> (1, 0)     | True  |
| 2       | 10x10      | 7 (orange)     | (3, 4)                 | (0, 0)                 | True (`4 > 0`)                 | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 4)      | (0, 4)         | `gc > mc & gr < gc` | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 4)     | True  |
| 3       | 10x10      | 2 (red)        | (3, 3)                 | (1, 0)                 | True (`3 > 0`)                 | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 3)      | (3, 0)         | `gc > mc & gr >= gc`| `(gr, 0)` -> (3, 0)     | False |

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   The original condition `gc > mc` correctly distinguishes Example 1 from Examples 2 and 3.
*   However, for cases where `gc > mc` (Examples 2 and 3), an additional condition is needed.
*   Comparing `gr` and `gc` seems to provide the necessary distinction:
    *   If `gc > mc` AND `gr < gc` (Example 2), the start is `(0, gc)`.
    *   If `gc > mc` AND `gr >= gc` (Example 3), the start is `(gr, 0)`.
*   The revised conditions correctly predict the required starting point for all three examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Colors:** Find the main color (C), which is the unique color in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor gray (5).
3.  **Locate Key Pixels:**
    *   Find the coordinates `(gr, gc)` of the top-leftmost gray (5) pixel (minimum row `gr`, then minimum column `gc`).
    *   Find the coordinates `(mr, mc)` of the top-leftmost main color (C) pixel (minimum row `mr`, then minimum column `mc`).
4.  **Remove Gray:** Change all gray (5) pixels in the output grid to white (0).
5.  **Determine Line Start:** Determine the starting coordinates `(sr, sc)` for a new diagonal line based on the coordinates found in step 3:
    *   If the gray pixel's column index `gc` is less than or equal to the main color pixel's column index `mc` (`gc <= mc`), set the starting point to `(sr, sc) = (gr, 0)`.
    *   Otherwise (if `gc > mc`):
        *   If the gray pixel's row index `gr` is less than its column index `gc` (`gr < gc`), set the starting point to `(sr, sc) = (0, gc)`.
        *   Otherwise (if `gr >= gc`), set the starting point to `(sr, sc) = (gr, 0)`.
6.  **Draw Line:** Starting from the determined coordinates `(sr, sc)`, draw a diagonal line using the main color `C`. This line extends downwards and to the right (incrementing row `r` and column `c` by 1 at each step) until it goes off the grid boundary. Pixels along this line in the output grid are set to color `C`, overwriting any existing color.
7.  **Output:** Return the modified output grid.
