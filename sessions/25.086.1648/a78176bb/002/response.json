            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code successfully implements the transformation for the first two examples but fails on the third. The core logic involves identifying a 'main color' (non-white, non-gray), locating the top-leftmost pixels of the main color and gray color, removing all gray pixels, and then drawing a diagonal line using the main color.\n\nThe failure in Example 3 indicates that the rule for determining the *starting point* of the new diagonal line needs refinement. The original rule compared the column indices (`gc` and `mc`) of the top-leftmost gray and main color pixels, respectively. While this worked for Examples 1 and 2, it produced an incorrect starting point for Example 3.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the coordinates of the top-leftmost gray pixel (`gr`, `gc`) and the top-leftmost main color pixel (`mr`, `mc`) across all examples to derive a condition that correctly determines the starting point (`sr`, `sc`) for the diagonal line. The potential starting points appear to be `(gr, 0)` or `(0, gc)`. The revised logic must correctly choose between these two based on the relative positions identified.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Size | Main Color (C) | Top-Left Gray (gr, gc) | Top-Left Main (mr, mc) | Original Condition (`gc > mc`) | Deduced Start (Original) | Expected Start | Revised Condition | Deduced Start (Revised) | Match |\n| :------ | :--------- | :------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------- | :---- |\n| 1       | 10x10      | 9 (maroon)     | (1, 5)                 | (0, 5)                 | False (`5 <= 5`)               | `(gr, 0)` -> (1, 0)      | (1, 0)         | `gc <= mc`        | `(gr, 0)` -> (1, 0)     | True  |\n| 2       | 10x10      | 7 (orange)     | (3, 4)                 | (0, 0)                 | True (`4 > 0`)                 | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 4)      | (0, 4)         | `gc > mc & gr < gc` | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 4)     | True  |\n| 3       | 10x10      | 2 (red)        | (3, 3)                 | (1, 0)                 | True (`3 > 0`)                 | `(0, gc)` -> (0, 3)      | (3, 0)         | `gc > mc & gr >= gc`| `(gr, 0)` -> (3, 0)     | False |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n*   The original condition `gc > mc` correctly distinguishes Example 1 from Examples 2 and 3.\n*   However, for cases where `gc > mc` (Examples 2 and 3), an additional condition is needed.\n*   Comparing `gr` and `gc` seems to provide the necessary distinction:\n    *   If `gc > mc` AND `gr < gc` (Example 2), the start is `(0, gc)`.\n    *   If `gc > mc` AND `gr >= gc` (Example 3), the start is `(gr, 0)`.\n*   The revised conditions correctly predict the required starting point for all three examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
