task_context: Identify the most frequent color (dominant color) and use it to fill regions of other colors that are enclosed by it.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids share the same height and width.
  - Grids contain pixels with integer values 0-9 representing different colors.
objects:
  - Dominant Color Pixel: The pixel value with the highest count in the input grid. This color acts as a barrier.
  - Non-Dominant Color Pixel: Any pixel whose value is different from the dominant color.
  - Boundary Pixel: A pixel located on the edge (row 0, last row, column 0, or last column) of the grid.
  - Enclosed Region: A connected group (allowing 8-directional adjacency: orthogonal and diagonal) of one or more non-dominant color pixels that cannot reach any boundary pixel via a path consisting solely of non-dominant color pixels.
  - Reachable Region: A connected group (allowing 8-directional adjacency) of one or more non-dominant color pixels where at least one pixel in the group is a boundary pixel, or can be reached from a boundary pixel via a path consisting solely of non-dominant color pixels.
actions:
  - Count Frequencies: Tally the occurrences of each color value in the input grid.
  - Identify Dominant Color: Select the color value with the highest frequency. Assume a consistent tie-breaking rule if necessary (though not explicitly tested here).
  - Identify Reachable Non-Dominant Pixels:
      - Start a search (e.g., BFS) from all boundary pixels that are *not* the dominant color.
      - The search can propagate to adjacent (8 directions) pixels only if they are *not* the dominant color.
      - Mark all visited pixels during this search as 'reachable'.
  - Fill Enclosed Pixels:
      - Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
      - Iterate through all pixels of the grid.
      - If a pixel is *not* the dominant color AND it was *not* marked as 'reachable', change its color in the output grid to the dominant color.
output_grid_generation:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by changing the color of all pixels within enclosed regions to the dominant color. Pixels belonging to the dominant color initially, and pixels in reachable non-dominant regions, remain unchanged.
