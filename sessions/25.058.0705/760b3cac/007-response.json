The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are azure (8) and yellow (4), with the background being white (0). The azure (8) pixels appear to be the primary focus of the transformation. The yellow (4) pixels, and therefore the object containing it, remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
