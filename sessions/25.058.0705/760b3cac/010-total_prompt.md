Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of extending azure shapes to the right edge. The provided code and results indicate that this rule generally works, but the trigger condition (touching the second-to-last column) isn't universally applicable. Some examples show the extension happening without this condition, while others fail because of this condition.

The core logic of identifying azure objects and extending them to the right seems correct. The main issue is refining the *condition* under which this extension happens. The current condition, `touches_second_to_last_column`, is too restrictive, as it only triggers the action when certain condition exists.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the azure objects and their surroundings.
2.  **Identify a new condition:** Discard the "second-to-last column" condition. Look for a more general pattern or property of the azure objects that consistently triggers the rightward extension. Perhaps it based on the object itself or perhaps there is a relationship between multiple object that define the rule.
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the program to reflect the new condition and ensure it covers all observed cases.
4.  **Verify against current logic**: Run checks against the current code to highlight the diffs.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather precise information, I'll describe what I'd *like* to do if I had code execution capabilities. Since I don't, I'll describe the process and expected outcomes.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   *Input:* Azure shape touching the second-to-last column.
    *   *Expected Output:* Azure shape extended to the right.
    *   *Actual Output:* Correct.
    *   *Metrics:* (Would use code to calculate)
        *   Number of azure objects: 1
        *   Bounding box of each azure object
        *   Does the azure object touch the second-to-last column?: Yes

*   **Example 2:**
    *   *Input:* Azure shape *not* touching the second-to-last column.
    *   *Expected Output:* Azure shape extended to the right.
    *   *Actual Output:* Incorrect (no extension occurred).
    *   *Metrics:*
        *   Number of azure objects: 1
        *   Bounding box of each azure object
        *   Does the azure object touch the second-to-last column?: No

*   **Example 3:**
    *   *Input:* Azure shape *not* touching the second-to-last column. But there is a green shape as well.
    *   *Expected Output:* Azure shape extended to the right.
    *   *Actual Output:* Incorrect (no extension occurred).
    *   *Metrics:*
        *   Number of azure objects: 1
        *   Bounding box of each azure object.
        *   Does the azure object touch the second-to-last column?: No
        *   Number of green object: 1
        *   is the green object in the same rows as the azure object? yes
        *   does the green object touch the right side? yes.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    azure_objects: 1
    azure_object_1_touches_second_to_last_column: True
  output:
    azure_extended: True

example_2:
  input:
    azure_objects: 1
    azure_object_1_touches_second_to_last_column: False
  output:
    azure_extended: True #Expected

example_3:
  input:
    azure_objects: 1
    azure_object_1_touches_second_to_last_column: False
    green_objects: 1
    green_object_touches_right_edge: true
    azure_and_green_in_same_row: True

  output:
    azure_extended: True
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (color 8) pixels.
2.  **Conditional Extension to Right:** Inspect each detected azure object for extending. If there is green object(s) present, and the azure shape and a green shape are in the same row, and a green object touches the right edge of the grid, then the azure pixels extend to the right edge, filling all spaces to the end of the grid for the current row.

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning**

*   **Removed "Second-to-Last Column" Condition:** The examples show this isn't a reliable indicator.
*   **Added Condition of existing green object:** Based on example 3, presence of a green block in the same row(s) seems to the the trigger to extend to the right.

This revised program attempts to capture the observed behavior in all three examples, correcting the issues from the previous iteration. The key change is the shift from a column-based trigger to an analysis of rows with both azure and green objects, where the green object touches the right edge.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
