Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions (6x9). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are azure (8) and yellow (4), with the background being white (0). The azure (8) pixels appear to be the primary focus of the transformation. The yellow (4) pixels, and therefore the object containing it, remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_shape_1
    type: shape
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position:
      row_start: 0
      row_end: 2
      col_start: 3
      col_end: 5
  - id: yellow_shape_1
    type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position:
      row_start: 3
      row_end: 5
      col_start: 3
      col_end: 5
  - id: azure_shape_1_transformed
    type: shape
    color: azure(8)
    transformed_position:
      row_start: 0
      row_end: 2
      col_start: 3
      col_end: 8

transformations:
  - object_id: azure_shape_1
    action: extend
    details: Extend the shape to the right, filling cells to the boundary if azure (8) is at the edge. If the shape is not present at the column edge, perform a flood fill using only azure (8).

relationships:
  - type: unchanged
    object_ids: [yellow_shape_1]
  - type: transformed
    object_ids: [azure_shape_1, azure_shape_1_transformed]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels. Consider these as separate objects.

2.  **Yellow Object Check**: Ensure that the yellow shape is unchanged.

3.  **Azure Object Transformation:**
      * If the azure object has any pixels on column 5, extend the azure object to the right.
      * Extension continues to boundary of the grid (column 8).
      * Existing instances of azure on the edge are extended to the right edge.
      * The yellow shape is unaffected.

In summary, the transformation rule extends an azure shape to the right edge of the grid.
