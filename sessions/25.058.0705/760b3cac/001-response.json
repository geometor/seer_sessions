The grids contain single-digit numbers (0, 4, and 8) representing different colors (white, yellow, and azure, respectively). The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The azure pixels appear to be \"moved\" or \"extended\" to the left.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Copy them directly to the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation selectively shifts azure pixels to the left within their respective rows, filling the closest empty (white, 0) space to their left, while keeping other colored pixels unchanged.\n"
