Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions (6x9). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct clusters/objects of azure and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The change in the azure pixels appears to be a positional shift or duplication.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 6x9
    elements: [0, 8, 4]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x9
    elements: [0, 8, 4]
  - type: object
    color: azure (8)
    input_positions: [(0,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3)]
    output_positions: [(0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3)]
    change: positional shift/duplication
  - type: object
    color: yellow (4)
    input_positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
    output_positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
    change: none
  - type: observation
    description: Yellow (4) object remains unchanged.
  - type: observation
    description: Azure (8) object changes position, possibly duplicates.
  - type: observation
    description: The shape of the azure cluster changes.
  - type: relationship
    description: Relative positions of yellow and azure objects are maintained somewhat - the azure cluster is above the yellow one in both.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Yellow:** Copy the yellow (4) object from the input grid to the output grid without any changes.

3.  **Transform Azure:**
    *   Observe the initial positions of the azure (8) pixels.
    *   Shift the original 'L' shaped azure formation one column to the left.
    *   Duplicate the entire original 'L' shaped formation, starting from the two leftmost original positions of the 'L'.
    *   Place both formations such as the relative location from the yellow shape is preserved.

In essence, the azure 'L' shape object moves left, and it also gets duplicated, effectively mirroring the original L. The yellow object stays put.
