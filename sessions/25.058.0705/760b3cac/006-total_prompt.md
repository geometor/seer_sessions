Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Azure Pixels: Locate all pixels with the color azure (value 8) within the input grid.
2. Row-wise Processing: For each row in the grid:
    a. find all white pixels
    b. find all azure pixels
    c. shift all azure pixels to the leftmost white spaces, combining any azure pixels in the same row.
3. Other colors are unchanged. All other colored pixels (not azure or white) remain in their original positions.
4. combine all azure pixels in row

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying azure pixels and shifting them left within each row. However, the execution results reveal some crucial errors, especially when no white is present or when a non-white pixel is to the left of the azure. We need to do the following.

1.  **Handle Edge Cases Better:** The initial code attempts to handle, but fails, the cases when there are no white pixels in a row or if a non-white cell is to the left of an azure cell. We need to correctly perform these.
2.  **Row-wise Operation Confirmed**: The approach of processing each row independently is validated by the examples, so we'll retain that.
3. **Non-white and non-azure interaction:** The original instructions were incomplete. We need to evaluate how to integrate other colored objects. It appears they should remain untouched.

**Example and Results Analysis**
I will use a markdown table to summarize, and note differences.

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Colors | Result Colors | Observations and Discrepancies                                                                                                                   |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | (9,7)       | (9,7)        | 0, 8            | 0, 8           | Correct. Azure moves to the leftmost white position in each row.                                                                              |
| 1       | (7,9)       | (7,9)         | 0, 8            | 0,8            | Correct. Azure moves to leftmost white in each row, combining all azure pixels in the row.                                                    |
| 2       | (7,9)      | (7,9)        | 0, 8            | 0,8   | Correct. No white in first row, so azure fills first position in row.        |
| 3       | (10,5)     | (10,5)        | 0,2,8            | 0,2,8           | Correct. In the first row all azure moves to the first postion because the cell is to the left of any azure. Other colors are not changed |

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixels
    color: azure
    value: 8
    properties:
      movable: true
      combines: true
  - name: white_pixels
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties:
      target: true # Azure moves here if present
  - name: other_pixels
    color: any
    value: "!0, !8"
    properties:
      movable: false
      obstruct: true
actions:
  - name: shift_left
    object: azure_pixels
    condition: per_row
    target: leftmost_white_or_first
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate Rows:** Process each row of the input grid independently.
2.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Within each row, locate all pixels colored azure (value 8).
3.  **Identify White Pixels:** Within each row, locate all pixels colored white (value 0).
4. **Shift Azure:**
      * If any white is left of any azure, move all azure pixels to the leftmost white pixel location within the row. All azure pixels in the row are combined.
      * If there are no white pixels in the row, and if there are any non-white, non-azure to the left of the first azure, then combine all azure pixels in the row and place to the right of the rightmost non-white, non-azure pixel
      *If there are no white pixels in the row, and no non-white, non-azure to the left, then move all azure pixels to the leftmost cell.
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** Pixels that are neither azure nor white remain in their original positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
