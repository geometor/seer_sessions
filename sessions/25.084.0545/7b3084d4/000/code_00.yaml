facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 20x20, output grids are smaller and vary in size.
  - objects:
      - name: colored_regions
        properties:
          - type: contiguous_pixels
          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
          - shapes: [horizontal_lines, vertical_lines, blocks]
        actions:
          - transformed: True
        relationships:
          - spatial: adjacent_regions_maintained # Observe if adjacency in input is preserved in output
  - transformations:
      - type: color_mapping
        details: |
          Not a simple one-to-one mapping.  Some colors persist, others change. Requires careful analysis.
      - type: spatial_reduction
        details: |
          The input grid is significantly reduced in size to create the output.  
          The method of reduction isn't immediately obvious (not a simple crop or resize).
      - type: object_selection
        details: |
          Not all colored lines appear, there is a selection method.
