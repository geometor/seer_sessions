facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: "Interior objects: Groups of contiguous pixels of the same color surrounded by different colors or the edge of the grid."
    properties:
      - color: "Integer value (0-9) representing a specific color."
      - shape: "Irregular, defined by contiguous pixels."
      - location: "Defined by pixel coordinates."
    actions:
      - "Color change: The color of an interior object's pixels can change."
  - object: "Border pixels: Pixels on the edge of the grid."
    properties:
      - color: "Integer value (0-9)."
    actions:
      - "Conditional color change:  Border pixels can change color, seemingly based on changes to interior objects, and propagation of colour change to adjacent cells"
  - relationship: "Adjacency:  Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not just a corner)."
  - relationship: "Containment: Interior objects are contained within the grid, bounded by border pixels or other interior objects of different colors."
  - observation: "There isn't any clear object movement, rotation or mirroring"
  - observation: "Changes seem to propagate from the location of an initial color change."
  - observation: "Color changes in examples are consistent - ie the same color always gets changed to another specific color"
