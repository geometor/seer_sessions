            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming grids of colored pixels.  The most obvious changes are related to the interior pixels.  Exterior, or border, pixels sometimes change, seemingly in response to changes in the interior. There appear to be \"objects\" comprised of groups of same-colored pixels within the input grid. These objects may change color and, based on how the colors change, affect adjacent pixels.  The transformations don't seem to involve movement or rotation, but rather color substitution, sometimes propagating outwards. The examples also seem to favor replicating the color changes of one object in other similar objects, or performing a 'fill' operation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

After that changes are propagated along rows and columns. Finally, any remaining colours that have been consistently mapped from input to output in the examples are updated.\n"
