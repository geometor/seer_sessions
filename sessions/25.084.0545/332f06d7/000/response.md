Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be selective replacement of certain colors (represented by digits) within a grid. The color `3` (green) seems to be a background or frame, and is untouched. Colors `0`(white), `2`(red) are replaced under some specific condition. Color `1` (blue) appears to be a key object in each grid. The transformation seems to involve changing some colors to `1`(blue), and leaving others the same. The specific positions changed changes for each example, so a simple positional rule is unlikely. It's more likely the positions are relative to other objects in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: background
    type: color
    properties:
      - value: 3  # Green
      - role: static frame, unchanged
  - name: target_colors
    type: colors
    properties:
      - values: [0, 2] # white, red
      - role: replaced by color '1' under conditions.
  - name: key_color
    type: color
    properties:
       - value: 1
       - role: defines replacement region

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Change target color to the key color in defined areas.
    parameters:
      - from_color: [0, 2]
      - to_color: 1

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The target color is changed to the key color, probably within a specific relationship to an area of the key color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Background:** The color `3` (green) forms a static background and remains unchanged.
2.  **Identify Key Color Regions:** Consider contiguous regions of the input that contains existing pixels of the key color `1`.
3.  **Locate Target Pixels**: consider pixels of color `0`(white) or `2`(red).
4.  **Apply Conditional Replacement:** Any pixel of color `0` or `2` within a contiguous region containing `1` becomes color `1`.
5. **All other pixels**: Do not modify any pixel that is color `3` or pixels of color `0` or `2` that do not reside in contiguous area containing pixels of color `1`.

In essence, contiguous regions containing color `1` spread to fill any connected area of color `0` or `2`.
