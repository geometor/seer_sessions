facts:
  - observation: "The code is missing an import for the 'scipy' library, causing a runtime error."
    evidence: "The traceback shows a 'No module named 'scipy'' error."
    resolution: "Add 'import scipy' to the beginning of the code."
  - observation: "The initial natural language program describes a rule where white (0) and red (2) pixels connected to blue (1) pixels are changed to blue (1)."
    evidence: "Provided code comments and function logic."
    implication: "This rule needs to be validated against *all* training examples to ensure it's complete and accurate."
  - observation: "Green (3) pixels are explicitly stated to remain unchanged."
    evidence: "Code comment: 'Color 3 (green) pixels are never changed.'"
    implication: "This constraint must be maintained in any revised logic."
  - observation: "Colors other than white, red connected to blue should not change."
    evidence: "Code comment."
    implication: "Any other color change logic would be a defect"
  - observation: "We do not yet have concrete metrics for the behavior of the code on all examples, as we can not run until resolved."
    evidence: "Code execution failed due to the missing import."
    implication: "We need to execute the corrected code to gather detailed information."
  - task: "Determine the transformation between input and output grids"
  - input: "2d array of integers 0-9, each represents a color"
  - output: "2d array of integers 0-9, each represents a color"
