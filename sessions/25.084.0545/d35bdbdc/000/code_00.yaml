facts:
  - observation: "Grids are of varying sizes, but input and output dimensions are always the same for a given example."
  - object_identification: "Colors represent distinct objects or parts of objects."
  - object_property: "Objects are contiguous regions of the same color."
  - transformation_observation: "Some objects/pixels are removed (changed to white/0) in the output."
  - transformation_observation: "Some objects have their internal pixels modified, changing the inner color of a block."
  - transformation_observation: "The perimeter color/pixels of objects are generally preserved when their inner pixels change."
  - spatial_relationship: "The relative positions of objects generally remain consistent, except for those that are removed."
  - hypothesis: "The transformation rule likely involves identifying and conditionally removing or altering objects based on their color, shape, or neighboring pixels."
