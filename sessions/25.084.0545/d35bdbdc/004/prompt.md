The transformation rule can be described as:
1. Identify Objects: Define objects as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.
2. Surrounding Context: For each object, determine the colors of its surrounding pixels (including diagonals).
3. Transformation Rules:
    *   If a block is completely surrounded by the background color (0), its shape and colors are preserved.
    * If an inner most pixel has color 2 (red), 4 (yellow), or 6 (magenta), it becomes 0 (background).
    *   If an inner most pixel is 9 (maroon) and *any* of its neighboring pixels has a color 1 (blue) , *and* it is not surrounded by 0, the color 9 pixel changes to 3 (green).
    * All other colors keep their inner pixels.
