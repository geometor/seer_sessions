Interior pixels are defined as pixels that are *not* on the outer edge of an object.\n    *   If the object contains any of the colors 2, 4, 6 inside the object, the entire interior of that object becomes 0.\n    *   If the entire object consists of color 1, 2, or 3, the entire object becomes 0.\n4.  **Special Rule for Color 9:** If a single pixel object of color 9 exists:\n    *   If the color 9 pixel is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, *or diagonally*) to a pixel of color 1 *and* to a pixel of color 2, the 9 pixel becomes 3. Otherwise, the 9 pixel remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, i, j, include_self=False):\n    \"\"\"Gets the colors of neighboring pixels (including diagonals).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for x in range(max(0, i - 1), min(rows, i + 2)):\n        for y in range(max(0, j - 1), min(cols, j + 2)):\n            if include_self or (x, y) != (i, j):\n                neighbors.append(grid[x, y])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef get_object(grid, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the object containing the given pixel.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    color = grid[i, j]\n    if color == 0:\n        return []\n\n    object_pixels = []\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(i, j)]\n\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.pop(0)\n        if (x, y) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((x, y))\n\n        if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and grid[x, y] == color:\n            object_pixels.append((x, y))\n            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    if (dx, dy) != (0, 0):\n                        queue.append((x + dx, y + dy))\n    return object_pixels\n\ndef is_surrounded_by_0(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Checks if an object is completely surrounded by color 0.\"\"\"\n    for x, y in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n        if not all(neighbor == 0 for neighbor in neighbors):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_interior_pixels(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Identifies the interior pixels of an object.\"\"\"\n    interior_pixels = []\n    for x, y in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n        # Check if all neighbors have same color.
