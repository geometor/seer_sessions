Contiguous means adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Object Preservation:** If an object is completely surrounded by background color (0), the entire object is preserved without changes.\n\n3.  **Interior Pixel Removal**:\n    *   The \"interior\" of an object consists of pixels that have all eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) being pixels of the *same* color as the object.\n    *    If any interior pixel of an object is color 2, 4, or 6, then all *interior* pixels of that object become 0.\n\n4.  **Complete Object Removal (Specific Colors):**\n    *    If an object consists of color 1 ONLY, the entire object becomes 0\n    *    If an object consists of color 2 ONLY, the entire object becomes 0\n\n5.  **Color 9 Transformation (Special Case):**\n    *   If a single-pixel object of color 9 exists, and it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to *both* a pixel of color 1 and a pixel of color 2, then the color 9 pixel becomes color 3. Otherwise, the color 9 pixel is unchanged.\n\n6.  **Edge Cases**:\n    * If part of object is touching the edge of the input, it is not considered surrounded.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, i, j, include_self=False):\n    \"\"\"Gets the colors of neighboring pixels (including diagonals).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for x in range(max(0, i - 1), min(rows, i + 2)):\n        for y in range(max(0, j - 1), min(cols, j + 2)):\n            if include_self or (x, y) != (i, j):\n                neighbors.append(grid[x, y])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef get_object(grid, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the object containing the given pixel.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    color = grid[i, j]\n    if color == 0:\n        return []\n\n    object_pixels = []\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(i, j)]\n\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.pop(0)\n        if (x, y) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((x, y))\n\n        if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and grid[x, y] == color:\n            object_pixels.append((x, y))\n            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    if (dx, dy) != (0, 0):\n                        queue.append((x + dx, y + dy))\n    return object_pixels\n\ndef is_surrounded_by_0(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Checks if an object is completely surrounded by color 0.\"\"\"\n    for x, y in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n        if not all(neighbor == 0 for neighbor in neighbors):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_interior_pixels(grid, object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Identifies the interior pixels of an object.\"\"\"\n    interior_pixels = []\n    for x, y in object_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n        # Check if all neighbors have same color.\n        if all(neighbor == grid[x,y] for neighbor in neighbors):\n            interior_pixels.append((x,y))\n    return interior_pixels\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    processed_pixels = set()\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if (i, j) not in processed_pixels:\n                object_pixels = get_object(input_grid, i, j)\n\n                if not object_pixels:  # background\n                    continue\n\n                processed_pixels.update(object_pixels)\n\n                # Object Preservation\n                if is_surrounded_by_0(input_grid, object_pixels):\n                    continue  # Preserve object\n\n                # Complete Object Removal (Specific Colors)\n                object_colors = [input_grid[x, y] for x, y in object_pixels]\n                if all(c == 1 for c in object_colors):\n                    for x, y in object_pixels:\n                        output_grid[x, y] = 0\n                    continue\n                if all(c == 2 for c in object_colors):\n                    for x, y in object_pixels:\n                        output_grid[x, y] = 0\n                    continue\n\n                # Interior Pixel Removal\n                interior_pixels = get_interior_pixels(input_grid, object_pixels)\n                if any(input_grid[x, y] in [2, 4, 6] for x, y in interior_pixels):\n                    for x, y in interior_pixels:\n                        output_grid[x, y] = 0\n\n                # Color 9 Transformation (Special Case)\n                if len(object_pixels) == 1:\n                    x, y = object_pixels[0]\n                    if input_grid[x, y] == 9:\n                        neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, x, y)\n                        if 1 in neighbors and 2 in neighbors:\n                            output_grid[x, y] = 3\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
