Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of identical dimensions (8 rows x 21 columns).\n*   **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited color palette, primarily 0 (white) and 5 (gray), with a few other colors (3-green, 2-red, 4-yellow, 7-orange, 6-magenta, 8-azure) appearing in specific regions.\n*   **Dominant Colors:** White (0) acts as the background, and Gray (5) seems to define a structural element or boundary.\n* **Object Identification:** Based on contiguity the colored regions can be treated as distinct objects.\n*   **Object Arrangement:** Objects are contained between a horizontal gray line on top and an irregular gray shape at the bottom. Objects do not overlap.\n*   **Transformation Focus:** The transformation appears to be focused on a specific region within the gray \"frame\" or boundary, specifically moving objects to the left.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These define the operational area.\n2.  **Identify Enclosed Objects:** Within this boundary, identify contiguous blocks of non-white, non-gray pixels. Each such block is an object.\n3.  **Shift Objects Left:** For each column, starting from the top and moving downwards:\n    *   If a non-gray cell has a grey cell above and below, find the next non-zero cell.\n    *   shift that next cell left as far as possible, until next to another non-zero, non-gray cell.\n    *   fill empty spaces with white pixels\n\nEssentially, the transformation involves shifting the colored objects within the gray boundary to the left, within their respective columns. The gray boundary remains unchanged. The objects maintain shape and color.\n"
