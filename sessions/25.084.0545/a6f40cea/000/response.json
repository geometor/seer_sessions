            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Colors:** In each example, there's a set of \"key colors\" that are not the background. The output seems to be constructed based on these and sometimes the adjacent colors.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Iterate the color of the objects, the output would be based on the object in the input with that color, for example, in train\\_1, start with color 2, and form a sliding window to capture the rectangle of color 2, then move on to color 4. The height of the rectangle can be determined by the top-most and bottom-most object coordinates.\n\n3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** For each object of the same color, determine the bounding box that captures them all and compress them.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid with the extracted region, maintaining relative positions of different colored regions, with the color of the sliding window as a parameter, it can be one color or the neighboring color of that color.\n\n5. **Compress Objects**: compress objects if they have many repeating values on the same row.\n\nLet's summarize in steps for the provided example:\n* train_1\n    1. The background is 8 (azure). The key colors are 2(red), 3(green) and 4(yellow).\n    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 2. It is from (4,9) to (6, 15) and its compressed version is from (1,4) to (2,7)\n    3. Find the object with color 4. It is from (10, 3) to (14, 8) and its compressed version is from (3, 1) to (4, 3)\n    4. Compose two extracted regions to create final output.\n\n* train_2\n    1. The background is 1 (blue). The key colors are 2(red), 3(green), 6(magenta) and 8(light blue).\n    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 2. It is from (4,7) to (20, 14). Then the object of color 8 is from (9, 18) to (12, 22). Since the color 8 object is adjacent to the object of color 2, combine this object with color 2, which would result to the box from (4,7) to (12, 22). The compressed version will be from (1, 3) to (8, 7)\n    3. Find the object with color 6. It is from (13, 11) to (26, 26). It has neighbor of color 3, so we get from (12, 11) to (26, 26). And its compressed version will be (1,1) to (14, 1)\n    4. Find the object with color 8. It is from (27, 18) to (28, 22) and it compressed object is (1, 8) to (14, 8).\n    5. Find the object with color 8. It is from (9, 18) to (12, 22) and it compressed object is (1, 9) to (14, 9).\n    4. Compose all extracted compressed regions to create final output.\n\n* train_3\n    1. The background is 2 (red). The key colors are 3(green), 4(yellow), 5(grey), 8(light blue) and 9(maroon).\n    2. Find bounding box for objects of color 4 and 5. They are from (4, 4) to (7, 9) and its compressed version is from (1, 1) to (2, 4)\n    3. Find the object with color 9 and 8. It is from (14, 16) to (18, 19) and its compressed version will be from (6, 2) to (7, 7)\n    4. Compose all extracted regions to create final output.\n"
