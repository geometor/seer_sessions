facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - size: large (variable)
      - description: Contains background color and regions of other colors.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - size: small (variable)
      - description: Appears to be a compressed or extracted representation of the input.

  - observation: color_focus
    description: The transformation seems to focus on specific colors or color changes.

  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is always smaller than the input grid.

  - observation: shape_retention
    description: object shapes are some how compressed in output.

  - observation: possible_sliding_window
      description: there appears to be sliding aspect to building the output.

  - action: extract_region
    description: Certain color changes or object combinations may mark the boundaries in the input grid that form the compressed object of output.
