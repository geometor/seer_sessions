            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements of the Task:**\n\nThe task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.  The grids are filled with single-digit integers (0-9), which can be interpreted as colors. The predominant color in all input grids is a background color (e.g., 5 (gray) in train_1, 8 (azure) in train_2, 4 (yellow) in train_3, etc.).  There are isolated pixels of different colors (e.g., 1 (blue), 6 (magenta)). The transformation seems to involve a combination of moving and/or replicating these non-background pixels. It is also interesting that the non-background color pixels *always* comes in pairs in input grids, except for train_5. There is a spiral or diagonal pattern expansion.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This color is considered the background and remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n2. **Locate Non-Background Pixels:** Identify the pixels in the input grid that have colors different from the background color.\n\n3. **Expand the Non-Background colors:**\n    *   If there are *two different* non-background colors (for example blue=1 and magenta=6), construct the following expansion:\n      *   Starting from each of the original non-background pixel locations, create an outward spiral or diagonal pattern in 4 directions. Each step of expansion, places a pixel of that original color one unit cell up, down, left and right. The expansion continues until there are no more empty slots that share the side with the currently expanded figure.\n    * If there is only *one* non-background color (for example blue=1), construct the following expansion:\n        * Starting from the non-background color pixel location, shift it diagonally (up and right) by one. Repeat until the end of the grid.\n\n4. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.\n\n5. **Populate Output:** Place the expanded non-background pixels into the output grid, based on their expanded positions determined in step 3.\n"
