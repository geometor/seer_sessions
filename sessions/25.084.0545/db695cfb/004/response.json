The results across the five examples show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Expansion:** The diagonal expansion for single-color objects is not always correct. Some cases require shifting the entire object, or parts of object.\n2.  **Multi-Color Interaction:** While the code attempts to handle multi-color interactions, the logic (color 6 \"wins\") is not universally applicable and the cross-spiral expansion needs better definition, in many cases the output is not expanding at all.\n3. **Object definition:** the object definition needs improvements.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Object Definition:** Carefully analyze how objects are defined in each example, considering connectivity and color.\n2.  **Refine Expansion Rules:** Develop more precise rules for single and multi-color object expansion, observing patterns of movement, growth, and interaction.\n3. **Prioritize cross expansion**: the main logic appears to be cross expansion of objects.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code after each modification to the natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI need to gather more specific information about the object, their features and how they map to the output. Because of the current code structure, I can't do that reliably now.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
