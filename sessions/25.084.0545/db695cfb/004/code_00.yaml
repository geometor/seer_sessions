  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: 1
          shape: single pixel
          initial_position: (3, 1)
          action: cross expansion
        - color: 6
          shape: scattered pixels
          initial_positions: [(2, 9), (5, 3), (8, 6), (13, 4)]
          action: cross expansion
      background_color: 5
      interactions: "Colors 1 and 6 expand; 6 overwrites 1 when they intersect"

      background_color: 4
      interactions: "1 expands up until row 1, 6 remains stationary"
  - example_4:
      objects:
         - color: 1
           shape: multiple pixels
           initial_positions: [(2,2), (3, 12), (11,11), (14, 3)]

           action: cross expansion
      background_color: 8
      interactions: "1 and 6 cross expand, 6 wins"
  - example_5:
      objects:
        - color: 1
          shape: multiple pixels
          initial_positions: [(2, 1), (7, 6)]
