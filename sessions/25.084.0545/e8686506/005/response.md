"""
The transformation identifies connected regions of the same color within the input grid and represents them in a smaller output grid. Connectivity is defined along edges (not diagonals). The output grid's size and content reflect the arrangement and colors of these connected regions. The top-left cell of each detected region is used to place color in output grid, preserving relative positions, and condensing the overall size.
