    input_objects:
      - description: Connected region of color 3
        shape: Irregular
        approximate_location: Center-left
      - description: Connected region of color 4
        shape: Vertical line
        approximate_location: Right, interspersed
      - description: Connected region of color 1
        shape: Rectangle
        approximate_location: Bottom
      - description: Single pixel of color 6
        shape: point
        approximate_location: center right
      - description: Connected region of color 8
        shape: large background area, other objects embedded
        approximate_location: surrounds all other colors.
    output_objects:
      - description: Condensed representation of input regions.
        notes: Output preserves the relative positions of the distinct color regions of the input but doesn't represent their full extent—only top-left of connected region

    output_objects:
      - description: Condensed representation of input regions, with a focus on connected blocks of different colors, not only enclosed regions. Output preserves relative positions of input regions
        notes:  Output preserves the relative positions of the distinct color regions of the input but doesn't represent their full extent—only top-left
