"""
The transformation identifies all connected regions of the same color within the input grid, where connectivity is defined along edges (not diagonals). It then represents these regions in a smaller output grid, using the color of each region and preserving the relative positions of the top-left corner of each region. The output grid is sized to just fit all these representations.
