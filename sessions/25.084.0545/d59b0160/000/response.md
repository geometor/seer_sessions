Okay, let's analyze this ARC task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   There are clear, large blocks of the digit '7' (orange) in all input examples.
*   There are other digits scattered within and around the '7' blocks.
*   The transformation seems to selectively remove certain digits, primarily those within the larger '7' blocks, while leaving the '7' blocks mostly intact. Digits outside of blocks seem to get removed in some columns, in the lower part of the output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of digits representing colors.
  - type: block
    description: Contiguous regions of the same digit, particularly large blocks of '7'.
  - type: digit
    description: Individual digits (0-9) within the grid.

properties:
  - name: color
    type: categorical
    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Representing different colors
  - name: position
    type: coordinate
    description: (row, column) location of a digit within the grid.
  - name: size
    type: numerical
    description: for blocks, it refers to height and width

actions:
  - name: remove
    description: Setting a digit's value to '7' (effectively merging it with the surrounding '7' blocks or making single digits in the '7' blocks, 7 again).
  - name: keep_static
    description: retaining existing digits

relationships:
  - type: inside
    description: A digit is located within a block of '7's.
  - type: outside
    description: A digit is not within a block of '7's.
  - type: adjacent
    description: Two digits are next to each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
 - type: lower_part
    description: the bottom rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of '7's in the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
3.  Within any pre-existing block of '7's, any other number is reverted to '7'.
4.  In the lower part of the grid (from row index equal to or greater than the height of any '7' block that extends to the bottom edge of the grid, find the minimum such height), most of the isolated digits are changed to 7.
5. From the three examples, digits with column indexes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, are kept the same.
6.  All other digits, retain their original value.

Essentially, the transformation cleans up the "inside" of the large '7' blocks by changing any other number to '7'.
The transformation also changes the "outside" of the large '7' block, at the lower part, of the grid, by also changing those digits to 7, except for the ones in columns 9 to 14.
