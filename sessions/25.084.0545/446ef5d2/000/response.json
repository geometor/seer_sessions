The primary operation seems to involve identifying contiguous regions (objects) of the same color and either shifting or deleting them based on certain criteria. The background color appears to be consistently '8' (azure). There's a sense of \"gravity\" or directionality, as if objects are moving downwards, with the specific behavior differing between the examples.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n"

Shift objects in the left part of the grid to the bottom\n\n    b. delete regions in the right part of the grid, replacing it with 8\n\n5. **Combine Results**: Create the final grid by combining all partitions\n"
