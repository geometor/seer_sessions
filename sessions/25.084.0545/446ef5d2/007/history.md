5. **Preserve Boundaries:** Do not change any pixels that form part of the enclosing boundary for each region.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code has several issues, leading to incorrect transformations in both examples. The core problem seems to be a combination of:

1.  **Incorrect Object Movement:** The objects aren't moving correctly to the bottom of their enclosed regions. The current logic appears to shift some pixels, leaving gaps and not filling the region as intended. It seems objects don't always "fall" to the bottom. They may fall partially and incorrectly.
2.  **Boundary Handling Errors**: The boundary seems to shift at times, it should always remain fixed.
3. **Region detection**: The first example shows that the enclosed regions are not handled correctly. There is mixing between the areas.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Prioritize Region Isolation:** Refine the `find_enclosed_regions` function. The current depth-first search (DFS) seems problematic when multiple disconnected regions exist. We need to isolate each region completely before attempting to move objects within it. The individual regions must be identified.
2.  **Correct Object Movement:** Revisit the `shift_objects_in_region` function.  The sorting and shifting logic needs careful review. We must ensure that objects within a region move *as a unit* to the lowest possible position within that region *without overlapping other objects or the boundary*. It's crucial to handle cases where objects might collide during their descent.
3. **Boundary Integrity**: Review logic to ensure that it never modifies the boundary.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution when possible):**

I'll use print statements for debugging and inspecting intermediate values. I'll analyze the provided example grids manually first, and then formulate code to gather specific metrics programmatically if needed.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Two enclosed regions separated by an azure (8) border.
*   **Expected Output:** Objects within each region should "fall" to the bottom.
*   **Actual Output:** Objects partially move, leaving gaps. The border shifts incorrectly.
*   **Problems:** Incorrect region separation, incorrect object movement, boundary movement.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Two enclosed regions separated by an azure (8) border.
*   **Expected Output:** Objects within each region "fall" to the bottom.
*   **Actual Output:**  Objects partially move. The border shifts incorrectly.
* **Problems**: The objects do not move to the bottom. There is boundary movement.

general_rule: "Identify enclosed regions defined by a background color (8). Within each region, objects (contiguous blocks of non-background color) fall to the lowest possible position without overlapping other objects or the region boundary."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** The background color is consistently color '8' (azure).
2.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Find all distinct regions enclosed by the background color.  These regions are completely surrounded by the background color and do not touch the edges of the entire grid.  Each enclosed region should be treated independently.
3.  **Identify Objects:** Within each enclosed region, identify "objects." An object is a group of connected pixels (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that share the same color and are *not* the background color.
4.  **Gravity within Regions:**  For each enclosed region, apply a "gravity" effect.  All objects within the region fall downwards.  The movement stops when an object hits:
    *   The bottom boundary of its enclosed region.
    *   Another object within the same region.
5. **Preserve Boundaries:** The surrounding boundary of azure (8) must remain unchanged.

This revised program focuses on *independent* region processing and clarifies the "falling" behavior. The key improvement is explicitly stating that objects fall *within their region* until they collide with something.
