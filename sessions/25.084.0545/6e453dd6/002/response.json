The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Flood Fill Application:** The flood fill is intended to connect *external* white regions to the magenta shape, effectively \"filling in\" the background. However, it's currently filling *all* connected white regions, including those *inside* the intended central shape. The examples make it clear the outer boundary of the magenta region is what matters.\n\n2.  **Overly Broad Red Replacement:**  The rule to change magenta to red adjacent to the gray stripe is applied too liberally.  The expected output shows that only magenta pixels that are part of the *original* magenta shape (before any flood filling) should turn red. The current code changes magenta pixels created by the flood fill, which is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Incorrect Gray Stripe Identification:** The gray stripe is misidentified, it is the single column of gray near the right.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues involves:\n\n1.  **Refine Flood Fill:** Modify the flood fill to *only* affect white pixels that are connected to the edge of the grid *without* passing through any magenta pixels.  This will correctly identify the background.\n\n2.  **Track Original Magenta:**  Before any flood filling, store the locations of the original magenta pixels.\n\n3.  **Conditional Red Replacement:**  Use the stored locations of the original magenta pixels to apply the red replacement rule *only* to those pixels that were originally magenta and are adjacent to the gray stripe.\n\n4. **Fix gray stripe identification.** Identify single column of gray near right edge of the grid.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere, I'll summarize my findings from your provided examples:\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Many extra red pixels along gray stripe\n    *   Flood fill incorrectly changes white to magenta inside the center object\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Many extra red pixels, and missing some within inner boundary of the original magenta object\n    *   Flood fill incorrectly changes internal white pixels to magenta.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Many extra red pixels.\n    *   Flood fill incorrectly changes internal white regions.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"

These represent the original central shape.\n\n3.  **Identify and Fill Background:** Perform a flood fill, starting from the edges of the grid.\n    *   Target color: white (0)\n    *   Replacement color: magenta (6)\n    *   *Constraint:* The flood fill should *not* propagate through any pixels that were originally magenta (from step 2). It fills only the background.\n\n4.  **Create Red Border:** For each pixel location stored in step 2 (original magenta pixels):\n    *   Check if it's directly adjacent (horizontally) to the gray stripe identified in step 1.\n    *   If it is, change its color to red (2).\n\n5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output. All other pixels are unchanged.\n"
