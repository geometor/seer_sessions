These pixels define the boundaries of regions.\n\n3. **Identify Interior Regions for Filling** The areas enclosed *completely* by the identified \"wall\" pixels constitute the regions to be filled.\n\n4.  **Flood Fill:** Perform a flood fill operation with color `2` (red) within each enclosed region, starting from a seed point *inside* the region.
