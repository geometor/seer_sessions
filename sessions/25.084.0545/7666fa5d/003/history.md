```python
"""
1.  **Identify Walls:** Locate all pixels of the designated "wall" color (8/azure). This includes both the horizontal and vertical lines formed by this color and the diagonal color line (4/yellow in the first pair and 3/green in the second).

2.  **Fill Adjacent Pixels:** For each pixel identified as part of a wall, change the color of all adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally) to the "fill" color (2/red), *unless* the adjacent pixel is also part of a wall (color 8, 4 in example 1 or 8,3 in example 2).

3.  **Propagate Fill:** Continue this filling process iteratively. For each newly filled pixel (color 2/red), repeat step 2, changing the color of its adjacent pixels to 2/red, again respecting the wall boundaries.

4. **Termination Condition**: Stop when no more pixels can be filled. This means no more azure (8) or other background colored pixels.

In summary, it's a region-filling algorithm where "walls" of a specific color define the boundaries of the regions, and a "fill" color propagates outwards from the walls until the entire region is filled.

Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and the subsequent code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code correctly identified the core concept: a flood-fill operation bounded by "walls". However, the implementation failed to propagate the fill correctly. The code enqueues neighbors of wall pixels *once*. It then fails to re-check neighbors after changing a pixel to the fill color. This leads to incomplete filling, as seen in the mismatches.  The strategy needs to ensure iterative propagation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the `Pixels Off` and `Color Count Correct` metrics to understand the extent of the fill failure. The examples are large, but we need to know the scope of the problem.
2.  **Refine NL Program:** Update the natural language program to clearly articulate the *iterative* nature of the fill. The current program mentions "propagate fill," but doesn't fully capture that it must occur until no more changes can occur.
3. **Address the "double check"**. The fill algorithm needs to visit pixels more than once, and update the queue.

**Metrics Gathering (using conceptual `tool_code` - actual execution later):**

The metrics were calculated correctly in the original response so a separate
tool_code isn't required.

**Example Analysis (from provided results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 38
    *   Color Count Correct: False
    *   Notes: Filling stopped prematurely along both the horizontal/vertical walls and the diagonal wall.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels Off: 96
    *   Color Count Correct: False
    *   Notes: Similar to Example 1, filling is incomplete, but more extensive since there's more area to fill.

**YAML Fact Block:**

task: flood_fill_with_walls
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: integer values (colors)
  - name: wall
    type: object
    properties:

  - name: fill_region
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 2
      role: filled area
      initial_state: adjacent to walls
actions:
  - name: identify_walls
    input: grid, wall_colors
    output: list of wall pixel coordinates
  - name: get_neighbors
    input: grid, row, col
    output: list of valid neighbor coordinates (up, down, left, right)
  - name: flood_fill
    input: grid, wall_pixels, fill_color
    process: |
      Iteratively fills adjacent pixels with fill_color, starting from
      neighbors of wall pixels. Stops when no more pixels can be filled.
      Does NOT fill diagonally.
    output: modified grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Wall Pixels:** Determine the wall colors. If color 3 is present in the grid, the wall colors are 8 and 3. Otherwise, the wall colors are 8 and 4. Locate all pixels within the input grid that match the wall colors. These pixels constitute the "walls."

2.  **Initialize Fill:** Find all pixels adjacent (up, down, left, right - *not* diagonally) to the wall pixels. These are the starting points for the fill.

3.  **Iterative Flood Fill:**
    *   Set the color of a pixel in the "fill set" to the fill color (2/red).
    *   Add all of *its* valid neighbors (up, down, left, and right) to the "fill set" *if* they are not already the fill color (2) *and* are not wall pixels.
    *   Repeat this process until the "fill set" is empty, meaning no more pixels can be filled.

4.  **Output:** The modified grid, where all regions bounded by walls have been filled with color 2.
