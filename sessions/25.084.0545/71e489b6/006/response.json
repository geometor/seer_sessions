            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code have significant flaws. The code attempts to implement a rule where blue pixels adjacent to white pixels are turned orange, with constraints to prevent 2x2 orange blocks and enclosed white areas. However, the results clearly show many discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The primary issues seem to stem from:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Neighbor Handling:** The `get_neighbors` function seems correct, but the logic applying the transformation based on neighbors is flawed.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of \"Enclosed\":** The `is_enclosed` function seems to be the core of the errors, and is not correctly identifying enclosed regions.\n3. **Incorrect logic preventing 2x2 orange blocks**: The check to prevent thickening is not working as expected.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Focus on `is_enclosed`:** This function is critical and needs to be completely rethought. The depth-first search approach is correct in principle, but the current implementation is buggy. The key is ensuring that visited pixels during the search are correctly tracked and managed to prevent infinite loops, incorrect boundary checks, and premature termination.\n2.  **Re-evaluate 2x2 check**: `is_2x2_orange` has subtle edge cases when a pixel at an edge or corner.\n3.  **Simplify and Refactor:** The overall logic can be simplified. Instead of checking for \"adjacent to white,\" we can reverse the process to avoid recursion problems.\n4. **Correct the logic for applying the transformation**: Iterate through white cells, not blue.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nSince the provided tool doesn't allow direct code execution, I'll outline what *would* be done. I would write code to:\n\n1.  **Count mismatches:** Compare each transformed output with its expected output, pixel by pixel, and count the differences. (Already provided in prompt)\n2.  **Identify `is_enclosed` failures:** Call `is_enclosed` on various white pixels in the input grids (especially those near boundaries and in different configurations) and check if the return value is correct. This will reveal specific cases where the enclosure detection fails.\n3.  **Identify `is_2x2` failures:** Test the edge and corner cases of the grids.\n4. **Test a simpler transform**: Remove the calls to is_enclosed and is_2x2.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
