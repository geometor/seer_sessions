            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting data.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code focused on outlining white shapes with a one-pixel-thick orange border. However, the results on the provided examples show inconsistencies. The code sometimes adds orange to the interior of shapes, creates outlines that are too thick, or misses adding outlines entirely. The main issue appears to be the over-application of the orange outline based on a simple adjacency check. The program needs to better distinguish between *intended* exterior outlines and internal blue pixels that happen to be next to white pixels. It also has to respect some constraints implicit with outlines, mainly that an outline can't thicken itself and the orange border can't merge.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Identify specific pixel locations where the code produced incorrect results.\n2.  **Refine Adjacency Rules:** The current code simply checks for white neighbors. We need to be more precise about *where* the orange pixels should go. Consider the configuration of blue and white, looking for \"edges\" of white shapes.\n3.  **Prevent Outline Thickening:** Implement a strict rule that prevents adding orange pixels if they would create a 2x2 or larger block of orange. This addresses the \"thickening\" issue observed in the examples.\n4.  **Consider Enclosed White Areas**: Example 3 has inner parts of the white that are \"enclosed\" so they should not be outlined.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Adjust the natural language program and, subsequently, the code based on these observations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations using code execution:**\n\nSince the question doesn't require calculations, I can proceed directly to gather facts and build natural language program.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
