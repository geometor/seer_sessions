            value: [0, 1, 7]

          conditions:
            - adjacent_to_white: "A blue pixel is adjacent to at least one white pixel."
            - one_layer_adjacency: "The blue pixel should only transform if it will make a single layer of orange."
  - observations:
    - example_1: "The transformation creates an orange outline around white areas where blue pixels were adjacent, but existing code makes outlines too thick."
    - example_2: "Similar to example 1, the transformation creates orange outlines incorrectly making outline and shapes too thick."
    - example_3: "The central line should become one pixel thick, the algorithm makes them thicker."
  - overall_rule: "Blue pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to orange to create a one-pixel thick outline adjacent to white shapes."
