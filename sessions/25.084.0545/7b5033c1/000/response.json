The output appears to be a vertical compression or summarization of the colored regions present in the input grid. Specifically, it seems like the transformation identifies contiguous vertical columns of non-white (non-8) colors within the input grid and outputs those distinct colors in the order they are encountered from top to bottom. The white (8) pixels in the background are effectively ignored, and only the \"colored objects\" are considered. Each output color is repeated for the width of the contiguous shape which that color appears.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
