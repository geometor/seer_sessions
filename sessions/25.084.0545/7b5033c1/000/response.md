Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a 1D list of colored pixels. The output appears to be a vertical compression or summarization of the colored regions present in the input grid. Specifically, it seems like the transformation identifies contiguous vertical columns of non-white (non-8) colors within the input grid and outputs those distinct colors in the order they are encountered from top to bottom. The white (8) pixels in the background are effectively ignored, and only the "colored objects" are considered. Each output color is repeated for the width of the contiguous shape which that color appears.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Output is a 1D list of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Integers represent colors.
  - property: 8 represents white and acts as a background.
  - property: Non-8 integers represent colored objects.
  - relationship: Output list contains only non-8 integers found in input.
  - action: Input grid is scanned.
  - action: Contiguous vertical runs of non-8 colors are identified.
  - action: The unique colors are extracted and outputted to list.
  - relationship: Order of colors in output matches vertical order in input.
  - relationship: Repetition is related to width of shape
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scan the Input:** Examine the input grid from top to bottom.
2.  **Identify Background:** Treat the color white (8) as the background; ignore it.
3.  **Detect Colored Objects:** Look for vertical columns of contiguous, non-white pixels. These form "colored objects."
4. **Extract in Order** Extract colors for the objects going from top to bottom.
5.  **Output:** Generate a 1D list by adding color for each object, repeating for the width of the shape.
