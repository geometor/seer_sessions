The transformation appears to operate on specific sub-grids or objects within the larger grid. The most obvious changes happen within rectangular regions of the same color, and single isolated pixels surrounded by zeros also change. It is a local operation, the value surrounding are changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the central pixel of a cross is different from the cross arms, change the central pixel to the value most present in the cross arms.\n\n4. **Process Isolated Pixels**: For each isolated pixel, change the pixel value to that of the most prevalent non-zero color in the its 8-neighbors (Moore neighborhood of range 1: including diagonals). If there's a tie or no neighbors, or most prevalent non-zero neighbor is '0', maintain its original color.\n\n5. **Output:** Construct the output grid by applying these changes to the input grid.\n"
