example_1:
  input_objects:
    - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [28, 22]
  output_objects:
    - colors: [1, 3, 2, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [3, 4]
  transformations:
    - Find full-width rows in input
    - Extract unique colors from those rows.
    - Create output rows with extracted colors repeated four times.

    - colors: [1, 2, 4, 3, 8, 5]
      type: grid
      dimensions: [5, 4]
  transformations:
    - Find full-width rows in input
    - Extract unique colors from those rows.
    - Create output rows with extracted colors repeated four times.
