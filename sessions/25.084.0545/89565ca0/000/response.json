The output grid seems to represent a summarized or abstracted version of the input grid. The colors in the output grid appear to correspond to prominent, contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid. It appears a large object is reduced to a single pixel in the output. The output grids are consistently 4 columns wide, even with different colored objects.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
