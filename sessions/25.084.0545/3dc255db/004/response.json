It's attempting to implement multiple rules (color 9 removal, enclosed region color change, and vertical line replacement), but it's doing so incorrectly. The enclosed region color change seems particularly problematic, as it's often making incorrect replacements or missing them altogether. The vertical line replacement also has clear errors. The \"color 9\" removal isn't perfect, but seems to be closer than other rules.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n1. Improve reporting with metrics.\n2. Improve reporting with YAML.\n3. Break down the existing natural language program into smaller, more testable parts.\n4. Focus on correcting each part individually, starting with what seemed partially successful previously.\n5. Refine the natural language program steps incrementally.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Develop Reports:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to gather some more specific information about the examples. I'll check:\n*   Size of the grid.\n*   Unique colors present in the input and output.\n*   Number of pixels of each color in the input and output.\n* Number of changed pixels\n\n"
