Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be the manipulation of colored blocks within the grid.  The transformations seem to involve identifying specific colored blocks (objects), potentially based on their shape, size and unique status, and then either moving them, changing the grid size, or a combination. There's a strong suggestion of "extracting" or "separating" certain parts of the input grid into combined forms in the output. It also appears that surrounding 7's (white, based on your color map) plays a key role in the boundary.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: [0-9]  # Representing colors as integers
      shape: [contiguous, variable]
      size: [variable]
  - type: grid
    properties:
     height: [variable]
     width: [variable]

actions:
  - type: extract
    description: Isolates specific blocks based on color.
  - type: rearrange/combine
    description: changes the order/position of blocks

relationships:
  - adjacency: Blocks of the same color are considered a single object.
  - containment: The overall grid contains all blocks.
  - spatial: The position/order of the extracted blocks are changed.
  - boundary: surrounding by white (7) pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid. Each contiguous block of a single color, other than '7', is an object. Each row of '6' is considered a separator/delimiter object.

2.  **Extract and Separate:**
    a. Extract these objects from the input grid.
    b. Split the input at each occurrence of a row of '6's.

3.  **Recombine:**
    Combine the parts by the color of the objects in reverse order of the splitted parts in the original input.
    a. preserve the x,y location inside the object, when recombining.

4. **Output new Grid.** The output grid is the combination of the changed objects.

Essentially, the program splits input into segments using the solid rows of 6, extracts colored blocks that are not 7 and recombines them.
