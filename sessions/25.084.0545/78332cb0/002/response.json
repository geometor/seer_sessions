            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved splitting the grid by rows of 6s, extracting objects (non-7 colored regions), and recombining them in reverse order. However, the results of applying this to all three training examples reveal significant problems:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Recombination:** The recombination logic is flawed. It seems to rebuild each segment based on object bounding box sizes. The output grid size does not reflect correct size. It pads the output with 7's\n2.  **Lost Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of objects *within* each segment, and relative to the segmentation lines of '6' are not being preserved as they should be.\n3.  Example 3 has no divider lines - so no action is being taken.\n\nThe main strategy for resolving the errors is to rethink the recombination step. Instead of simply concatenating objects based on reversed segment order, we need to reconstruct the output grid more carefully, preserving relative positions of the input.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's examine each example in more detail, focusing on object positions and segment boundaries.\n\n"
