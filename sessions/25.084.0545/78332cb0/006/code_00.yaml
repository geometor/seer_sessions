example1:
  input:
    shape: [11, 11]
    divider_lines: [5]  # Row indices where divider lines exist
    objects:
      - color: 7  # Background
      - color: 6  # Divider
      - color: 4  # Object 1 (right of divider)
      - color: 2  # Object 2 (left of divider)
      - color: 1  # Object 3 (right of divider)
      - color: 3  # Object 4 (left of divider)
  output:
    shape: [23, 5]
    arrangement: |
        Segments are created to the left and right of divider columns.
        Segments are delimited by rows of color 6.
        Segments are stacked vertically, reversing the segment order.
        Objects in segments maintain relative positions.

example2:
  input:
    shape: [17, 5]
    divider_lines: [5, 11]
    objects:
      - color: 7 # Background
      - color: 6 # Divider
      - color: 8 # Object 1 (left of divider)
      - color: 2 # Object 2 (left of divider)
      - color: 9 # Object 3 (left of divider)

  output:
    shape: [5, 17]
    arrangement: |
      Segments are created to the left and right of divider columns.
      Segments are delimited by rows of color 6.
      The order of the objects defined by the color 6 dividers is reversed.
      Objects in segments maintain relative positions within and between segments.

example3:
  input:
    shape: [5, 17]
    divider_lines: [] # No divider lines
    objects:
      - color: 7  # Background
      - color: 6 # Divider (empty columns to the left and right)
      - color: 8 # Object left of first empty column
      - color: 1 # Object right of first empty column
      - color: 9 # Object right of second empty column
  output:
    shape: [17, 5]
    arrangement: |
      Columns of color 6 (empty or not) define segment boundaries.
      Segments are re-arranged with the order of objects defined by color 6 reversed.
