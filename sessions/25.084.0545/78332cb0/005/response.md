1.  **Identify Divider Lines:** Examine the input grid to find horizontal lines consisting entirely of the color '6' (magenta). These lines divide the grid into segments.
2.  **Segment the Grid:** Split the input grid into segments based on the divider lines found in step 1. If no divider lines are present, the entire input grid is treated as a single segment.
3.  **Reverse Segment Order:** Reverse the order of the segments created in Step 2.
4.  **Determine Maximum Width:** Find the maximum width among all segments.
5. **Pad segments:** Pad segments with color 7 (white) so that all segments are the same width.
6.  **Construct Output:** Create an output grid. Stack the segments vertically, in the reversed order.
7.  **Fill Empty Space:** Fill any remaining empty cells in the output grid with the color '7' (white).
