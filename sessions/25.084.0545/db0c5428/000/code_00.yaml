facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The background color (8, azure) is mostly preserved.
  - observation: |
      There are irregular shaped objects of different colors in the grids.
  - observation: |
      Transformation focuses on colored objects, not the azure background.
  - observation: |
      Object shapes are altered, seemingly mirrored or inverted in sections.
  - observation: |
     Colors within mirrored shapes change following a defined, consistent ruleset.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, maroon (9) appears inside the mirrored object, connected diagonally.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, maroon(9) is replaced by white(7).
  - observation: |
     In train_3, the transformation shows that the central cluster expands.
  - object_types:
    - background:
        color: 8  # Azure
        behavior: Mostly unchanged
    - foreground_objects:
        colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]  # All colors other than azure
        behavior: Subject to shape and color transformations
  - transformations:
      - type: shape_change
        description: Mirroring/inversion of object parts.
      - type: color_change
        description: Systematic color swaps within the transformed areas.
      - type: expansion
        description: addition of pixels diagonally adjacent to existing groups
  - relationships:
      - adjacency: |
          Changes often occur at or near the boundaries of objects and background.
      - containment: |
          Transformed regions are generally contained within the original object's bounding box, if one were loosely defined.
