1.  **Anti-Diagonal Mirroring:** Create an output grid that is the mirror image of the input grid along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). The element at `input[r][c]` will be placed at `output[c][r]`.

2.  **Conditional Recoloring (Based on Post-Mirroring Relationships):** After mirroring, analyze the spatial relationships between pixels to apply these color transformations:
    * Identify "lines" or contiguous blocks of pixels in certain colors in the *mirrored* grid.
    *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` is part of a horizontal contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in output:
        *  change pixels to the left of the contiguous block blue to white (0)
        *  change pixels to the right of the contiguous block to blue (1)
        * change pixels above of the contiguous block to green(3).
    *  If there are areas of 2x2 of yellow (4) with one of the pixels black (0) at [r][c]: change to orange (7).
        *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` was originally red (2) *and* is now adjacent to a mirrored pixel that was originally yellow(4), change the pixel to orange (7).
        *  If the mirrored pixel at [c][r] contains an orange(7), change to black(0).
3.  **Default Color Preservation:** If a pixel's color, *after* mirroring, doesn't meet the above relationship-based criteria, it retains its color from the mirroring step (i.e., the original color from `input[r][c]`).
