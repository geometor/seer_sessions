1.  **Anti-Diagonal Mirroring:** Create an output grid that is the mirror image of the input grid along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). The element at `input[r][c]` will be placed at `output[c][r]`.

2.  **Conditional Recoloring (Based on Post-Mirroring Relationships):** After mirroring, analyze the spatial relationships between pixels to apply these color transformations:
    * Identify "lines" or contiguous blocks of pixels in certain colors in the *mirrored* grid.
    *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` is part of a horizontal contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in output:
        *  change pixels to the left of the contiguous block blue to white (0)
        *  change pixels to the right of the contiguous block to blue (1)
        * change pixels above of the contiguous block to green(3).
    *  If there are areas of 2x2 of yellow (4) with one of the pixels black (0) at [r][c]: change to orange (7).
        *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` was originally red (2) *and* is now adjacent to a mirrored pixel that was originally yellow(4), change the pixel to orange (7).
        *  If the mirrored pixel at [c][r] contains an orange(7), change to black(0).
3.  **Default Color Preservation:** If a pixel's color, *after* mirroring, doesn't meet the above relationship-based criteria, it retains its color from the mirroring step (i.e., the original color from `input[r][c]`).

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly implements the anti-diagonal mirroring. However, the recoloring logic is flawed and doesn't accurately capture the complex rules of the task, particularly with respect to spatial relationships *after* the mirroring. The code attempts to handle some color changes, but the conditions are incorrect and applied inconsistently, leading to significant discrepancies between the predicted and expected outputs. The core issues stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Contiguous Block Logic:** The conditions for changing colors around blue blocks do not consider the position of the pixels after the mirror operation, resulting in the incorrect output dimensions.
2.  **Incorrect adjacency handling:** the detection and transformation based on color contiguity is not correct.
3.  **Incorrect/incomplete conditional recoloring:** other colors than blue are involved in the transformation.
4.  **Incorrect orange to black transformation:** This is the easiest bug to fix, but fixing it will only address a small portion of the errors.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully study all three examples, paying close attention to the *post-mirroring* spatial relationships between pixels of different colors.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Create a more precise and comprehensive natural language description of the transformation rules, focusing on the exact conditions that trigger color changes *after* mirroring. Specifically, identify patterns and shapes in the *output* and relate those back to actions on the mirrored grid.
3.  **Rewrite conditions based on *output*:** modify transformation rules and base all of the rules on shapes and patterns found in the output.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code after each significant change to the logic, using all available examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use a more visual approach in my analysis, leveraging the ability to execute code and process NumPy arrays. This helps in understanding the spatial relationships.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Anti-Diagonal Mirroring:** Create an output grid that's the mirror image of the input grid along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).  The element at `input[r][c]` is placed at `output[c][r]`.

2.  **Recoloring Based on Output Patterns:** The following color transformations are applied based on patterns observed in the *output* grid after the mirroring:

    *   **Horizontal Blue Lines:**
        *   If a pixel is part of a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels in the output, change the pixels immediately to the left of the blue line to white (0).
        *   If a pixel is part of a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels in the output, change the pixels immediately to the right of the blue line to blue(1).
        *   If a pixel is part of a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels in the output, change the pixels immediately above the blue line to green(3).
    *   **Yellow 2x2 squares**:
        * If a pixel is part of a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels, then change *all* of the yellow(4) pixels in that square to orange(7).
    *   **Orange to Black:**
        * If a pixel is orange (7) change it to black (0).
