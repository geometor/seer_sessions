The element at `input[r][c]` will be placed at `output[c][r]`.\n\n2.  **Conditional Recoloring (Based on Post-Mirroring Relationships):** After mirroring, analyze the spatial relationships between pixels to apply these color transformations:\n    * Identify \"lines\" or contiguous blocks of pixels in certain colors in the *mirrored* grid.\n    *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` is part of a horizontal contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in output:\n        *  change pixels to the left of the contiguous block blue to white (0)\n        *  change pixels to the right of the contiguous block to blue (1)\n        * change pixels above of the contiguous block to green(3).\n    *  If there are areas of 2x2 of yellow (4) with one of the pixels black (0) at [r][c]: change to orange (7).\n        *   If the *mirrored* pixel at `[c][r]` was originally red (2) *and* is now adjacent to a mirrored pixel that was originally yellow(4), change the pixel to orange (7).\n        *  If the mirrored pixel at [c][r] contains an orange(7), change to black(0).\n3.  **Default Color Preservation:** If a pixel's color, *after* mirroring, doesn't meet the above relationship-based criteria, it retains its color from the mirroring step (i.e., the original color from `input[r][c]`).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)\n\n    # Mirror along the anti-diagonal.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            output_grid[c, r] = input_grid[r, c]\n\n    # Apply recoloring based on post-mirroring relationships.\n    modified_grid = output_grid.copy()  # Work on a copy to avoid in-place modification issues.\n    \n    for r in range(cols):\n        for c in range(rows):\n            # Check for contiguous blue blocks.\n            if modified_grid[r,c] == 1:\n                \n                if c > 0 : modified_grid[r,c-1] = 0\n                if c < rows -1 : modified_grid[r,c+1] = 1\n                if r > 0 : modified_grid[r-1,c] = 3\n            # Check for original red adjacent to original yellow after mirroring.\n            if input_grid[c,r] == 2:  # Original was red.\n              \n              if r > 0 and input_grid[c,r-1] == 4 and modified_grid[r-1,c] != 7:\n                  modified_grid[r,c] = 7\n\n              if r < rows - 1 and input_grid[c,r+1] == 4 and modified_grid[r+1,c] != 7:\n\n                  modified_grid[r,c] = 7\n              if c > 0 and input_grid[c-1,r] == 4 and modified_grid[r,c-1] != 7 :\n                    modified_grid[r,c] = 7\n\n              if c < cols-1 and input_grid[c+1,r] == 4 and modified_grid[r,c+1] != 7 :\n                    modified_grid[r,c] = 7\n    \n    for r in range(cols):\n      for c in range(rows):\n        if modified_grid[r,c] == 7 : modified_grid[r,c] = 0\n\n    return modified_grid.tolist()\n```"
