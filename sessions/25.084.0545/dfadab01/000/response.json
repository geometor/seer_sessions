It appears there are two primary operations. The first operation is mirroring the input grid based on patterns and colors. It seems a mirroring effect across the diagonal of the grid. The second major operation involves changing some of the colors in the mirrored image based on the colors of the input image.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Recoloring works as follows:\n\n    *   If the input pixel is red (2), the output pixel in the mirrored position becomes yellow (4).\n    *   If the input pixel is green (3), the output pixel in the mirrored position becomes blue (1).\n    *   If the input pixel is grey (5), the output pixel in the mirrored position becomes magenta (6).\n    *   If the input pixel is magenta (6), the output pixel in the mirrored position becomes white (0).\n    *   Other colors in the input grid, including white (0), remain unchanged in the output grid (copied directly after mirroring).\n\n"
