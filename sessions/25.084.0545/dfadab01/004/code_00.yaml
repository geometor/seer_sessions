facts:
  - task: "Anti-diagonal mirroring with conditional recoloring"
  - objects:
      - type: "grid"
        properties:
          - dimensions: "rows x cols (variable)"
          - elements: "pixels with integer color codes (0-9)"
  - actions:
      - name: "mirror"
        description: "Reflect the grid along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)."
        details: "Element at input[r][c] moves to output[c][r]."
      - name: "recolor"
        description: "Conditionally change pixel colors based on relationships after mirroring."
        details: |
           The recoloring seems to be based on patterns formed AFTER mirroring.
           Simple recoloring based on original input color is NOT sufficient.
