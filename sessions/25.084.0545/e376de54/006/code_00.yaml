objects:
  - description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color value of the object (0-9).
      - pixels: A list of (row, column) tuples representing the object's pixels.
      - segments: horizontal segments in the object
        properties:
          - row: row index
          - start_col: starting column
          - end_col: end column + 1
          - color: segment color

transformations:
  - action: Replace multi-pixel segments
    trigger: The presence of one or more single-pixel segments of *different* colors within the *same row and the same object.*
    condition: The segment must belong to the same object as single-pixel of different color
    result: "The segment between the smallest and largest column containing single pixels is replaced by the color of the segment"
