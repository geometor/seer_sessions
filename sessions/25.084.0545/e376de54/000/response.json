Within this grid, there are other colors forming distinct shapes or lines. The transformation seems to selectively *remove* certain colored pixels, specifically those that form horizontal lines, while leaving other shapes/colors untouched, and sometimes parts of a multi colored structure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
