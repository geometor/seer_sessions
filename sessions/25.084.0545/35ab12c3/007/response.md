"""
1. Identify Objects: Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. An
   object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels sharing the same color
   (excluding black/0, which represents the background).
2. Iterative Expansion: Expand each object outward, one layer at a time.
3. Asymmetric Expansion: The expansion may not be equal in horizontal and
   vertical directions.
4. Iterate Until Stable: Continue the expansion process iteratively. In each
   iteration, every object expands by one layer. The process stops when a
   complete iteration results in no changes to the grid.
5. Color Interaction (Complex): When the expansion of two objects of different
   colors results in an overlap, the color of the overlapping region isn't
   determined by a fixed precedence. The resulting color can be either of the
   interacting colors. The exact rule is complex, depends on the example, and
   needs further refinement by looking at the geometry and order of operations.
