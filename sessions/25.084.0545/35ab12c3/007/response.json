An\n   object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels sharing the same color\n   (excluding black/0, which represents the background).\n2. Iterative Expansion: Expand each object outward, one layer at a time.\n3. Asymmetric Expansion: The expansion may not be equal in horizontal and\n   vertical directions.\n4. Iterate Until Stable: Continue the expansion process iteratively. In each\n   iteration, every object expands by one layer. The process stops when a\n   complete iteration results in no changes to the grid.\n5. Color Interaction (Complex): When the expansion of two objects of different\n   colors results in an overlap, the color of the overlapping region isn't\n   determined by a fixed precedence. The resulting color can be either of the\n   interacting colors. The exact rule is complex, depends on the example, and\n   needs further refinement by looking at the geometry and order of operations.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies distinct objects in a grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 2D numpy array representing the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are colors and values are lists of (row, col)\n        tuples representing the object's pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = {}\n    visited = set()\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or (row, col) in visited\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return []\n\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        pixels = [(row, col)]\n        pixels.extend(dfs(row + 1, col, color))\n        pixels.extend(dfs(row - 1, col, color))\n        pixels.extend(dfs(row, col + 1, color))\n        pixels.extend(dfs(row, col - 1, color))\n        return pixels\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            color = grid[row, col]\n            if (row, col) not in visited and color != 0:\n                if color not in objects:\n                    objects[color] = []\n                objects[color].extend(dfs(row, col, color))\n\n    return objects\n\ndef expand_object_one_layer(grid, pixels, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Expands an object by one layer, considering neighbors.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The current state of the grid.\n        pixels: The current pixels of the object.\n        color: The color of the object being expanded.\n\n    Returns:\n        A set of new pixel coordinates that represent the one-layer expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    expanded_pixels = set()\n    for row, col in pixels:\n        neighbors = [\n            (row + 1, col),\n            (row - 1, col),\n            (row, col + 1),\n            (row, col - 1),\n        ]\n        for r, c in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]:\n                expanded_pixels.add((r, c))  # Add all neighbors\n    return expanded_pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    previous_grid = None\n\n    # Iterate until the grid stops changing\n    while not np.array_equal(output_grid, previous_grid):\n        previous_grid = output_grid.copy()\n        input_objects = find_objects(output_grid) # Find objects on each iteration\n        \n        # Keep track of expanded pixels in this iteration\n        expanded_pixels_this_iteration = {}\n\n        all_colors = sorted(input_objects.keys())\n        for color in all_colors:\n          pixels = input_objects[color]\n          expanded_pixels = expand_object_one_layer(output_grid, pixels, color)\n\n          # Store the expanded pixels for this color and this iteration\n          expanded_pixels_this_iteration[color] = expanded_pixels\n\n        # Apply expansion:\n        for color in all_colors:\n            for r, c in expanded_pixels_this_iteration[color]:\n              # Check for conflicts with other colors\n              conflict = False\n              for other_color in all_colors:\n                if other_color != color:\n                  if (r,c) in expanded_pixels_this_iteration.get(other_color, set()):\n                    # output grid at this location matches neither color, this\n                    # indicates an interaction between the colors in a\n                    # previous iteration.\n                    if output_grid[r,c] != color and output_grid[r,c] != other_color:\n                      conflict = True\n\n              if not conflict: #if there is a conflict, do not expand\n                output_grid[r,c] = color #expand\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
