            "text": "Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial approach of expanding objects by one layer is a good starting point. However, the results clearly demonstrate that the interaction between colors is more complex than simple overwriting. The errors highlight several key issues:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Expansion:** Objects don't always fully expand to their final state in a single layer expansion. Multiple expansion steps are needed.\n2.  **Incorrect Interaction Rules:** When objects of different colors meet during expansion, the current logic (expanding only empty `0` cells) does not correctly predict the final color.\n3.  **Asymmetrical Expansion**: example 3 expansion along the y-axis is greater\n    than expansion along the x-axis.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Iterative Expansion:** Modify the code to perform multiple expansion steps until the grid no longer changes.\n2.  **Developing Color Interaction Rules:** Analyze the correct outputs to determine the rules governing which color \"wins\" when expansions overlap. This might involve a precedence order, or a more complex rule based on spatial relationships. This will likely require detailed pairwise comparisons of color interactions.\n3.  **Addressing Asymmetry:** consider expansion rules that are not symmetrical\n    along the x and y axis\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nTo understand the color interaction rules, we need more data. Specifically, we need to track:\n\n*   Which colors are adjacent to each other in the input.\n*   Which color occupies the overlapping region in the *expected* output.\n\n"

An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels sharing the same color (excluding black/0, which represents the background).\n2.  **Iterative Expansion:** Expand each object outward, one layer at a time.\n3. **Asymmetric Expansion:** The expansion may not be equal in horizontal\n   and vertical directions.\n4.  **Iterate Until Stable:** Continue the expansion process iteratively. In each iteration, every object expands by one layer. The process stops when a complete iteration results in no changes to the grid.\n5.  **Color Interaction (Complex):** When the expansion of two objects of different colors results in an overlap, the color of the overlapping region isn't determined by a fixed precedence. The resulting color can be either of the interacting colors. The exact rule is complex, depends on the example, and needs further refinement by looking at the geometry and order of operations.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nThe crucial next step is to implement iterative expansion and then refine the color interaction rule. The current `analyze_interactions` function is useful for observing interactions. We'll modify the expansion to happen iteratively. Then, we will use the function to study specific interactions between colors, looking at the geometry and the expansion history to formulate a more precise rule. We will likely need to examine all three training examples in more depth before writing the next code. We might need a way to \"replay\" the expansion step-by-step to understand the dynamics fully.\n"
