    expansion_rules:
      - rule_1: "Objects expand one layer at a time."
      - rule_2: "Expansion occurs iteratively until no further changes."
      - rule_3: "When different colors meet, the resulting color is not
                 determined by a simple precedence rule."
      - rule_4: "Objects can expand asymmetrically."
