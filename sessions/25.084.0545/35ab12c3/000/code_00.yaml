facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - objects: |
      Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
  - object_properties: |
      color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      shape: The arrangement of pixels forming the object. Can be a single pixel, line, rectangle, or irregular shape.
      position: Location of the object in the grid, definable by row and column indices.
  - actions: |
      expansion: Objects of certain colors expand outwards, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
      filling: The expansion fills in areas of the background color (0/white).
      color_change: In some instances an object might change its color and the surrounding object colors as well.
      copy: An object might maintain its color/shape in output.
  - relationships: |
      adjacency: Objects interact based on their proximity to each other. Expansion seems to occur until a non-background color is encountered.
      containment: The background (0/white) can be considered a container for all other objects.
