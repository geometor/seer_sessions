1.  **Reflect Rows:** The output grid is a reflection of the input grid. The reflection appears to happen by inverting the rows - the first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second to last, and so on.
2.  **Color Change (Conditional):** In some cases, Maroon (color 9) is consistently transformed into Magenta (color 6) during or after reflection. It appears in example 1 and 2.
3. There is no horizontal expansion of colors.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of row reflection and color change (Maroon to Magenta) is partially correct but misses crucial details. The reflection is happening, but the color transformations and, importantly, the expansion/duplication of certain colored lines are not correctly handled.  The errors are significant across all examples, indicating the need for a more nuanced rule. The key seems to lie in understanding how *all* colors, not just Maroon, are transformed during the row reflection, and how rows are potentially duplicated. Specifically in example 1 we should expect the bottom green line to turn orange and expand, and the last blue should repeat and turn white and repeat. In example 2 we expect line duplication for the green line at row index 7.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Carefully examine input vs. expected output, row by row, for *all* examples, not just focusing on the Maroon color.
2.  **Color Mapping:** Create a table of input color vs. corresponding output color *after* reflection. This will reveal the color transformation rules.
3.  **Row Duplication:** Investigate if certain rows are duplicated during reflection. This seems likely given the expansion of colors observed. Look for patterns in which rows get duplicated.
4. **Refactor observations** update observations to YAML to reflect current state of knowledge
5. **Refactor the natural language program** to be consistent with the updated observations.

**Gather Metrics and Develop Reports (using code execution):**

We don't really need to use code execution here, we can generate a table by
examining the input and output for each example

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Row Reflection:** The input grid's rows are reflected vertically (top-to-bottom).
2.  **Color Transformation:** During reflection, colors are transformed according to the following rules, this seems to change per example:
    *   Example 1:
        *   White (0) remains White (0).
        *   Blue (1) becomes White (0).
        *   Azure (8) becomes Green (3)
        *   Maroon (9) becomes Magenta (6).
    *   Example 2:
        *   White (0) remains White (0)
        *    Green (3) becomes Green (3)
        *    Yellow (4) becomes Yellow (4)
        *   Maroon (9) becomes Magenta (6)
    *   Example 3:
        *    White (0) becomes White (0)
        *    Red (2) becomes Red (2)
        *    Magenta(6) becomes Magenta (6)
3.  **Row expansion/duplication:** In the first 2 examples, rows containing specific colors are duplicated after the reflection and color transformation:
    * The last row containing colors in the input is expanded to two rows in the output.
