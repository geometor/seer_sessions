facts:
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid are sometimes replicated in the output grid.
  - observation: Replication often occurs horizontally, creating lines of the same color.
  - observation: Input grids and output grids may have different shapes, but in the examples presented the heights differ by no more than 2.
  - observation: The output grid's colored pixels are often arranged in a specific structure derived from the input grid, not randomly placed.
  - observation: Color 0 (white) acts as a background and is generally unchanged, except where overwritten by other colors.
  - observation: The transformation rule seems to involve repeating each colored pixel across its entire row.
  - observation: In train_1, the maroon pixels '9' are replaced by magenta '6'.
  - observation: In train_1, single pixel objects are repeated horizontally in the row.
  - observation: In train_2, the last row objects are the same as the last row in train_1.
  - observation: In train_2, only the objects in the last row are repeated horizontally.
  - observation: The last row objects are repeated horizontally when they are single pixels.
  - action: Replicate certain non-zero pixels horizontally.
  - action: Potentially shift or rearrange elements based on some row-specific rule.
  - relationship: Output pixel arrangement is directly related to the input arrangement, specifically by horizontal replication.
  - relationship: The transformation rule considers each row of the input, paying close attention to single-pixel colored objects
