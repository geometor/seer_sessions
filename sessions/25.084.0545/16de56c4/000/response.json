The most salient feature is the replication of non-zero single pixels within certain rows. It seems the core operation is a kind of \"copying and shifting\" of certain colored pixels, often creating horizontal lines. The transformation may sometimes alter the positions of the original elements. The background (color 0, white) seems to serve as padding, and the final transformation often maintains some positional relationship to the original grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
