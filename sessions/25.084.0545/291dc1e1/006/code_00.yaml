facts:
  - task: "ARC Task"
  - description: "Extract and rearrange color regions, maintaining relative positions."
  - input_type: "2D grid (integer array)"
  - output_type: "2D grid (integer array)"
  - colors_ignored: [0, 1, 2]
  - region_property: "Contiguous pixels of the same color (excluding 0, 1, 2)"
  - region_extraction_order: "Top-left corner (row first, then column)"
  - output_transformation:
    - type: "Reconstruction"
    - rule: "Two rows per region, width derived from horizontal extent, maintaining approximate spatial relationships."
  - observations:
    - note_1: "Original code produces wider grids."
    - note_2: "Spatial relationships between regions are not correctly maintained."
    - note_3: "Zeros added to pad the width, causing a very sparse grid."
