The core issues seem to be related to maintaining relative spatial arrangement and handling duplicate rows. Based on the examples and their incorrect transformed outputs, it's clear that the current logic doesn't correctly interpret the transformation rule. Specifically, it struggles with:\n\n1.  **Relative Positioning:** The code attempts to maintain some spatial relationships, but fails. It seems like entire colored regions are being put in the right general area, but with many errors.\n2.  **Duplicate Rows:** The rule of duplicating *every* row of a region (defined by adjacent color) seems to apply, but it does not do it correctly.\n3. **Ignoring Rows**: The first two rows should be ignored.\n4. **Ordering**: The relative order of regions should be from left to right, top to bottom.\n\nThe strategy to address this is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Region Extraction:** Ensure that the `extract_regions` function correctly identifies contiguous regions, taking into account diagonal adjacency.\n2.  **Correct Spatial Mapping:** Develop a more robust method to map the extracted regions to the output grid, ensuring correct relative placement and duplication. It might be better to consider each region and place it according to a clear rule.\n3. **Order by position**: The regions needs to be ordered by position, top to bottom, left to right, when building output grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection; code execution not needed for this level of analysis)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on what the code *should* do versus what it *did*:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 20x8\n    *   Expected Output Size: 12x6\n    *   Actual Output Size: 148 x 8\n    *   Observations: The code has failed to correctly identify and extract. It created many more rows, and has not sized each area correctly. Many values are zeros (white) which indicate a failure to place the region values correctly, even after finding regions.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 8x11\n    *   Expected Output Size: 8x4\n    *   Actual Output Size: 30 x 10\n    *   Observations: Similar issues. Some regions of appropriate width but far too tall, with large stretches of zeros.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 8x28\n    *   Expected Output Size: 14x8\n    *   Actual Output Size: 48 x 27\n    *   Observations: Again, large areas of incorrect values. The region finding appears to have failed.\n\n* **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 8x23\n    *   Expected Output Size: 14 x 6\n    *   Actual output size: 40 x 22\n    * Observations: Similar failure.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction**\n\n"
