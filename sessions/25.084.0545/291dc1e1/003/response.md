```python
"""
Extracts and rearranges contiguous color regions (excluding 0, 1, and 2) from the input grid, forming a smaller output grid.
The first two rows of the input grid are ignored. The spatial relationship
of the extracted color regions are maintained as they are arranged into
the output grid, in order of top to bottom, then left to right. For each set of same-color pixels that touch either
side-by-side or diagonally, two rows are added to the output with identical
colors.
