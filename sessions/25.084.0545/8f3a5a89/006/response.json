            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were overly simplistic and failed to capture the complex interactions between the azure (8), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels, especially the propagation and conditional transformations. The code incorrectly applies the rules and misses crucial order-of-operation nuances. The core issue is that the transformation isn't iterative, and it doesn't completely propagate changes based on adjacent cells *after* they've potentially changed.  A single pass through the grid is insufficient; we need a mechanism to re-evaluate cells based on their neighbors' updated states. Also, rule 4 condition,`changed_to_7[r,c]` needs to be check on the `output_grid`, not the input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Iterative Propagation:** The key is to implement a loop that continues to apply the rules until no further changes occur. This ensures that the \"ripple effect\" of 8-to-7 conversions is fully accounted for.\n2.  **Corrected Rule 4:** Ensure the propagation check in rule 4 applies to the output grid.\n3.  **Refine Order of operations:**. The rules should generally be applied in the specified order (Magenta adjacency, Blue left, propagate).\n4.    **Revisit blue rule:** Rule 2 as stated is incomplete. It transforms 8 to 7, based on having a blue to the left. However, in cases where this 7 then changes other blues adjacent to it, the rule is incomplete - it doesn't transform blues *adjacent* to the changed 8.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution not strictly necessary for this high-level analysis):**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Many azure (8) pixels near magenta (6) were not converted to orange (7). Many blues that should have turned to orange remained blue. The propagation logic is clearly faulty.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar issues to Example 1, with propagation not working correctly.  The left-side blue-to-orange conversion seems partially correct, but it fails in later stages.\n*   **Example 3:**  Again, highlights propagation problems. The \"wave\" of orange (7) should extend further based on the initial magenta (6) and blue (1) placements.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
