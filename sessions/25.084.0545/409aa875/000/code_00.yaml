facts:
  - objects:
      - name: background
        color: 7  # Orange
        property: dominant, static

      - name: changing_pixels
        colors: [9, 0, 2] # Maroon, White, Red
        property: subject to change

  - actions:
      - name: replace_pixel
        description: Replace a pixel of one color with another.
        parameters:
          - source_color: [9, 0, 2]
          - target_color: [9,1,0]
        constraints: The replacement logic seems to be based upon x, y position, relative to nearby colors, and is not universally applied

  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: The surrounding pixels likely influence the replacement rule.  The color of neighboring pixels and their positions are probably important.
