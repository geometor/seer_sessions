The core issues seem to stem from:\n\n1.  **Incorrect 9 to 1 transformation:** The specific coordinate rule (row 9, col 7) for changing 9 to 1 is too narrow and doesn't generalize. It only applies to example 1.\n2.  **Misunderstanding of 0 to 9 transformation:** The vertical adjacency rule for changing 0 to 9 is incorrect. It seems to misinterpret the relationship between 0 and 7.\n3. **Incorrect 2 to 9 transformation**: condition of two rows above it relative to 7 is probably not correct, and the context and meaning is ambiguous.\n4. **Incorrect 9 retention rule:** Neighbors of 9 shouldn't influence 9s remaining as 9.\n5. **Missing Context**: The provided examples contain clues to understand better relationship between the input and the output\n\nThe strategy to address these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the examples:** Carefully study the input-output pairs of all three examples to identify the *true* underlying rules, paying close attention to the spatial relationships and color patterns.\n2.  **Focusing on object properties:** The provided code does not consider spatial information, such as contiguous blocks of one or more pixels with same color.\n3.  **Developing more general rules:** Avoid hardcoding coordinates or conditions that only apply to a single example.\n4.  **Iterative refinement:** Start with a simple, revised natural language program, implement it in code, test it against all examples, and repeat the process until all examples are matched.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Evidence**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to gather more specific information about the errors.\n\n"

These define the background and boundaries.\n\n2.  **Object 9 Transformation (9 to 1):**  A pixel of color 9 (maroon) changes to color 1 (blue) if and only if it is located at the intersection of a complete horizontal line of 9s and the right most vertical boundary of an object of color 9s.\n\n3.  **Object 0 Transformation (0 to 9):** A pixel of color 0 (white) changes to color 9 (maroon) if *any* of the following conditions are met:\n    *   It is part of a horizontal segment of color 0 that is adjacent to a *complete* horizontal line of color 7.\n    *    It is immediately above or below a pixel of color 9.\n\n4.  **Object 2 Transformation (2 to 9):** A pixel of color 2 (red) changes to color 9 (maroon) if it's directly below a horizontal line of 7s, of any length greater than 1.\n\n5. **Object 9 Retention:** A pixel of color 9 does not change, except for the single pixel specified on step 2.\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning**\n\n*   **9 to 1:** The previous rule was too specific (a hardcoded coordinate).  The revised rule focuses on the relationship of the 9 to the boundaries created by 7.\n*   **0 to 9:** The \"vertical adjacency\" was too simplistic. The revised rule considers both horizontal adjacency to complete lines of 7. The additional condition of being adjacent vertically to a color 9 helps in example 2.\n*    **2 to 9:**  The new description uses \"directly below\". The length consideration addresses Example 3.\n*   **Object 9 Retention:** Added a rule to specify that 9 remains unchanged unless its location is the specified on step 2.\n* **Object Definitions:** The YAML defines objects based on color, helping to structure the rules around these objects.\n\nThis revised program provides a more accurate and general description of the transformation rules observed across all three examples.\n"
