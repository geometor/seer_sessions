Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and formulate a revised natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed on all three training examples, indicating significant flaws in the implemented logic. The core issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect 9 to 1 transformation:** The specific coordinate rule (row 9, col 7) for changing 9 to 1 is too narrow and doesn't generalize. It only applies to example 1.
2.  **Misunderstanding of 0 to 9 transformation:** The vertical adjacency rule for changing 0 to 9 is incorrect. It seems to misinterpret the relationship between 0 and 7.
3. **Incorrect 2 to 9 transformation**: condition of two rows above it relative to 7 is probably not correct, and the context and meaning is ambiguous.
4. **Incorrect 9 retention rule:** Neighbors of 9 shouldn't influence 9s remaining as 9.
5. **Missing Context**: The provided examples contain clues to understand better relationship between the input and the output

The strategy to address these errors will involve:

1.  **Re-examining the examples:** Carefully study the input-output pairs of all three examples to identify the *true* underlying rules, paying close attention to the spatial relationships and color patterns.
2.  **Focusing on object properties:** The provided code does not consider spatial information, such as contiguous blocks of one or more pixels with same color.
3.  **Developing more general rules:** Avoid hardcoding coordinates or conditions that only apply to a single example.
4.  **Iterative refinement:** Start with a simple, revised natural language program, implement it in code, test it against all examples, and repeat the process until all examples are matched.

**Gathering Metrics and Evidence**

Let's use `tool_code` to gather more specific information about the errors.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_errors(example_num, input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes the differences between the expected and transformed outputs."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    diff = expected_output != transformed_output
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    diff_values = expected_output[diff_indices]
    
    print(f"Example {example_num}:")
    print(f"  Number of differing pixels: {np.sum(diff)}")
    print(f"  Indices of differing pixels (row, col): {list(zip(diff_indices[0], diff_indices[1]))}")
    print(f" Expected values at differing pixels: {diff_values}")

  Indices of differing pixels (row, col): [(np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(9)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(11)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(12)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(14)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(15)), (np.int64(7), np.int64(8)), (np.int64(9), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(9), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(9), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(9), np.int64(9)), (np.int64(11), np.int64(13)), (np.int64(11), np.int64(14))]

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Boundary Preservation:** All pixels with color 7 (orange) remain unchanged. These define the background and boundaries.

2.  **Object 9 Transformation (9 to 1):**  A pixel of color 9 (maroon) changes to color 1 (blue) if and only if it is located at the intersection of a complete horizontal line of 9s and the right most vertical boundary of an object of color 9s.

3.  **Object 0 Transformation (0 to 9):** A pixel of color 0 (white) changes to color 9 (maroon) if *any* of the following conditions are met:
    *   It is part of a horizontal segment of color 0 that is adjacent to a *complete* horizontal line of color 7.
    *    It is immediately above or below a pixel of color 9.

4.  **Object 2 Transformation (2 to 9):** A pixel of color 2 (red) changes to color 9 (maroon) if it's directly below a horizontal line of 7s, of any length greater than 1.

5. **Object 9 Retention:** A pixel of color 9 does not change, except for the single pixel specified on step 2.

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning**

*   **9 to 1:** The previous rule was too specific (a hardcoded coordinate).  The revised rule focuses on the relationship of the 9 to the boundaries created by 7.
*   **0 to 9:** The "vertical adjacency" was too simplistic. The revised rule considers both horizontal adjacency to complete lines of 7. The additional condition of being adjacent vertically to a color 9 helps in example 2.
*    **2 to 9:**  The new description uses "directly below". The length consideration addresses Example 3.
*   **Object 9 Retention:** Added a rule to specify that 9 remains unchanged unless its location is the specified on step 2.
* **Object Definitions:** The YAML defines objects based on color, helping to structure the rules around these objects.

This revised program provides a more accurate and general description of the transformation rules observed across all three examples.
