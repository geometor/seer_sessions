The other colors (blue - 1, orange - 7) appear to be transient or removed during the transformation. The core task seems to involve manipulating the grid based on the arrangement of the yellow pixels, and sometimes including the blue and orange pixels depending on their surrounding. It seems like there are regions of interest, and perhaps \"noise\" to be removed. The output often, but not always, has a smaller or similar size relative to the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
