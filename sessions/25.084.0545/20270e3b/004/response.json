The core idea of identifying a yellow boundary and connected blue regions is partially correct, but the implementation needs significant adjustments, and it has some problems with orange breaking the structure:\n\n1.  **Missing Dependency:** The code uses `scipy.ndimage.measurements`, which isn't available. We need to either find an alternative approach that doesn't rely on external libraries (preferred, given the ARC constraints) or implement equivalent functionality using built-in Python or NumPy. Since the function is used to find a rectangle, which is easy to find just with `np.where`, I'll remove the dependency in next version.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Generalization:** The code seems overly specific to the first example. It assumes a single, large outer rectangle. We need to make it more flexible to handle different configurations of yellow and blue pixels, especially cases with inner structures and multiple components. The orange pixels are considered blockers.\n\n3.  **Incorrect Connected Component Logic:** The connected component search has an error - check `elif not visited[n_row, n_col] and grid[n_row,n_col] != 0:`. It's not enough only to check colors different than `0`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Remove `scipy` dependency:** I can find the rectangle using `np.where`.\n2.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all provided input/output pairs to understand the variations in the transformation rule.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately and comprehensively describe the rule.\n4.  **Test and Iterate:** After implementing code changes, test against all examples and refine both the code and the natural language program if needed.\n5.  **Handle Disconnected Regions:** Pay close attention to how disconnected regions of blue within the yellow boundary are handled.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis:**\n\nBecause I don't have access to the explicit data, I will ask to print the train examples so I can update the logic.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If no such region exists, no changes are performed.\n2.  **Identify Connected Blue Regions:** Starting from the yellow boundary, find all blue (color 1) pixels that are directly connected (up, down, left, or right) to the boundary or to other connected blue pixels. Orange pixels are considered a \"wall\". Any blue pixels that are not connected, or their connection is broken by orange, are not included.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid, copying only the yellow boundary and the connected blue regions identified.\n4. The output grid is obtained from a subgrid that is the outer boundary from the original input grid.\n\nI'd like to see all train examples (input and expected output) to better refine the program.\n"
