1.  Identify the Outer Yellow Boundary: Find the largest rectangular region formed by yellow (color 4) pixels in the input grid. This rectangle defines the dimensions of the output grid. If there isn't a yellow rectangle, return the original grid (no change).

2.  Determine the Output Dimensions: The output grid's dimensions are determined by the outer yellow rectangle's boundaries in the input grid.

3.  Copy Input Subgrid: The output grid is created from the input, within the region defined by the yellow boundary, and copying the contents.

4.  Identify and keep Connected Blue Pixels: Within the copied region, find all blue (color 1) pixels that are part of a connected component, starting at any yellow pixel of the boundary.  Orange pixels are considered walls that prevent connection. Keep only these connected blue pixels, and the yellow boundary.

5.  All Other Colors: All other pixels in the input grid are removed, leaving only those within the yellow boundary, and only colors yellow and the connected blue.
