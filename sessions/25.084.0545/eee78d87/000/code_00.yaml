objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: larger than input_grid (input height * 3 + input width * 3)
  - name: transformed_input
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: same as input_grid
      position: embedded within output_grid, surrounded by border
  - name: border
    type: pattern
    properties:
      pattern: alternating 7 and 0
      location: surrounds transformed_input

  - name: fill
    type: pattern
    properties:
      pattern: alternating 7 and 0 like checkerboard
      location: fills all cells besides the border, cross lines and the changed color areas

  - name: changed_pixels
    type: pixels
    properties:
      original_value: not 7
      new_value: 9
      location: within transformed_input

actions:
  - name: expand
