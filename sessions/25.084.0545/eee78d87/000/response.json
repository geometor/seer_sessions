The original input grid appears to be embedded within a larger, mostly black (0) output grid.  The key transformation seems to involve:\n\n1.  **Expansion:** The output grid is significantly larger than the input grid.\n2.  **Bordering:** A consistent pattern of alternating '7' (orange) and '0' (black) pixels surrounds the transformed input.\n3. **Insertion of cross pattern.** A cross of '0' is inserted.\n4.  **Replacement:** Some pixels within the embedded input change their values: Some non-7-value pixels become '9'(maroon).\n5.  **Checkerboard Overlay:** The entire output grid, excluding cross lines and changed cells, has an alternating pattern of '7' (orange) and '0' (black) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
