            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first example, and it's clear it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Checkerboard Placement:** The checkerboard pattern of 0s and 7s is not correctly aligned with the embedded input grid. It seems to be an alternating pattern irrespective of embedding.\n2. **Embedding and replacement is not correct:** The replacement of non-7 pixels with 9 is inconsistent, especially regarding the surrounding 0s and 7s. The positioning or the extent of the region that should contain 9s is wrong. It appears the original code intended to fill the embedded region with 9's but it does not always.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine all three examples to understand the exact placement of the checkerboard pattern and the embedding logic.\n2.  **Correct Checkerboard Logic:** Modify the code to ensure the checkerboard pattern is correctly positioned, *relative to the embedded input*.\n3. **Fix Embedding**: Refactor the sections of code responsible for embedding and replacement to consider correct placement and extent.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
