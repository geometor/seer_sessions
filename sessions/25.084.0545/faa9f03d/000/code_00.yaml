facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Pixels are represented by single-digit integers (0-9), corresponding to colors.
  - observation: |
        Colors are changing, replacement or modification.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 12x12
      - elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: replace_color
    description: |
       A pixel's color is changed based on its original color and potentially its neighbors.
  - relationship: |
      Neighboring pixels (horizontal and vertical) may influence color changes.
  - patterns:
      - train_1: 2 replaced by 3; every group of 3s remains.
      - train_2: 3s at the edges are unchanged. 4->3; every group of 3s becomes edge.
      - train_3: 4->6, 6->0, 0->6 or 0 ; every group of 6s and 0s becomes the background.
