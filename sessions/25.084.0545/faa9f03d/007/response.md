"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify objects by color.
2. Conditional Color Replacement:
    - If red (2) exists, replace it with green (3).
    - If yellow (4) exists and magenta (6) does *not* exist, replace yellow (4) with green (3).
    - If magenta (6) exists, replace yellow (4) with magenta (6).
3. Conditional Actions Based on Adjacency and Color:
    - If any green (3) is adjacent to where red (2) *was*, change that green (3) to blue (1).
    - If magenta (6) exists, flood fill the background (0) starting from each magenta pixel, replacing 0 with 6.
4. No flood filling occurs if Magenta(6) is not present
