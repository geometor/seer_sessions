general_rule: |
    1.  Identify objects by color.
    2.  Conditional Color Replacement:
        -   If red (2) exists, replace it with green (3).
        -   If yellow (4) exists and magenta (6) does *not* exist, replace yellow (4) with green (3).
        -   If magenta (6) exists, replace yellow (4) with magenta (6).
    3.  Conditional Actions Based on Adjacency and Color:
        - If any green (3) is adjacent to where red (2) *was*, change that green (3) to blue (1).
        - If magenta (6) exists, flood fill the background (0) starting from each magenta pixel, replacing 0 with 6.
    4. No flood filling occurs if Magenta(6) is not present
