            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on identifying contained objects and extracting them. However, the results show that this approach is insufficient. None of the examples matched the expected output. The code failed to accurately identify the correct target objects and their transformations and also had significant errors in judging size and contents. The strategy needs to shift from simply finding contained objects to understanding a more complex set of rules involving containment, relative positioning, and possibly color/shape patterns.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Containment:** The simple containment check (`is_contained`) is not capturing the logic. We need to consider partial containment, overlapping, and potentially hierarchical relationships between objects.\n2.  **Consider Relative Position:** The current code extracts objects but doesn't always preserve their relative positioning correctly or scale to the output grid.\n3.  **Analyze Color and Shape Patterns:** Look for patterns in the colors and shapes of the objects, and how they relate to the output. The examples reveal more complex selection logic.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll likely need multiple iterations, testing the updated code after each change to the natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to gather detailed metrics about each example, comparing input, expected output, and transformed output. This will help to identify which kinds of problem to solve.\n\n"
